6340,soil hydraulic conductivity k significantly affects subsurface flow and solute transport but convenient measurement of k remains a challenge electrical conductivity ec which can be measured conveniently and accurately can be quantitatively related to k because of the similarity between current movement and groundwater flow motivating us to estimate k using ec a soil column apparatus was built to explore the relation between ec and k fifty four experiments were conducted under various degrees of soil compaction and grain diameters including six different particle sizes three compaction levels and six solution concentrations the overall negative correlation between k and ec can be fitted reasonably well by an exponential function with a large determination coefficient 0 81 for each solute concentration while a power law function better fits the correlation when k is larger than 10 m d these experiments led to several empirical models for specific solution concentrations and one comprehensive model with variable parameters to estimate k given ec in the field if the ec of pore water can be measured the empirical models under the specific solution concentrations can be applied to greatly improve the k estimation comparison showed that the proposed models which provides a quick estimate of k using easily available ec performed better than most of the classical grain size based formulas although there is uncertainty in the k estimation likely due to the limited control factors considered in this study the new method proposed above can provide a convenient estimate for k for the field site with strong spatial heterogeneity keywords hydraulic conductivity electrical conductivity compaction solution concentration empirical equation apparatus 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity k is one of the most important hydrogeological parameters that controls fluid flow and solute transport through a porous or fractured material such as rock or unconsolidated material de lima and niwas 2000 k tends to be spatially heterogeneous for natural aquifers consisting of quaternary loose sediment gev et al 1996 lu et al 2012 sinha et al 2009 and k is also affected by fluid properties such as density and viscosity which are related to solute concentration hubbert 1940 it is necessary when calculating various hydraulic processes properties such as groundwater yield obiora et al 2018 groundwater flow and contaminant transport dynamics elwaseif et al 2012 maclear 2001 soupios et al 2010 to accurately calculate k moreover pacheco and van der weijden 2012 2014a b demonstrated the need to account for spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic diffusivity for a convenient estimation of mineral weathering rates at catchment scale and differential weathering of different rocks hence convenient and reliable estimation of the non trivial parameter k is one of the fundamental practices in hydrologic and hydrogeological sciences hydraulic conductivity has been estimated using various hydrogeological approaches including pumping test slug test laboratory analysis of core samples and the numerical simulation method khalil and monterio santos 2009 the analysis of stream flow data is also a possibility to estimate hydraulic conductivity at catchment scale pacheco and van der weijden 2012 2014a b additionally the method based on a spatial analysis of hydraulic head data can also get the hydraulic conductivity pacheco 2013 these traditional methods can be expensive since they usually require significant amount of time and effort angulo jaramillo et al 2000 such as the time consuming and expensive pumping test and numerical simulation approaches the resulting data can also have obvious noise or exhibit disturbing effects especially for low permeability niwas 1985 most of the traditional methods only provide a single value for k which cannot capture the continuous variation of k in aquifers massoud et al 2010 reliable and convenient estimation of k remains a challenge salas garcía et al 2017 new technologies in geophysical well logging is growing rapidly aleke et al 2018 providing abundant information through hydrological drilling thabit et al 2018 and motivating the further improvement of k estimation abundant geophysical data including electrical and magnetic signals provide the possibility of estimating k quickly and accurately particularly much attention has been paid to electrical signals biswal et al 2018 farrag et al 2019 farzamian et al 2015 kelly 1977 kosinski and kelly 1981 perdomo et al 2014 since both the electric current and water move along the path of least resistance moreover the constitutive relation proposed by hubbert 1940 showed that electrical conductivity ec and hydraulic conductivity may be correlated although this relation has been studied for more than a decade niwas and de lima 2003 slater 2007 more efforts including systematic experiments and correlation analysis are still needed to explore the quantitative connection between electrical conductivity and hydraulic conductivity this necessity motivated this study it is also noteworthy that hydraulic conductivity is also significantly affected by medium structure properties such as particle diameter grain composition the degree of soil compaction yadav and abolfazli 1998 and the scale pacheco et al 2015 for example k tends to decrease with an increasing degree of compaction and the scale effects k is usually because of medium heterogeneity fallico 2014 the electrical characteristics of soil which can usually be described by the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity wildenschild et al 2000 are also related to medium structure properties the dielectric constant is closely related to the soil moisture content okiongbo and mebine 2015 and soil electrical conductivity is closely related to soil water factors such as soil porosity saturation and pore water conductivity niwas et al 2011 therefore to reliably link ec to k it is necessary to explore the influence of medium structure properties on ec this study aims to build a quantitative relationship between hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity at laboratory scale by considering the variation of particle size degree of soil compaction and concentration of sodium chloride solution i e the fluid to reach this goal we build a transient seepage apparatus to conduct experiments under the three influence factors mentioned above the rest of this work is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the experimental setup and the physical model used to explore the relationship between k and ec section 3 applies the experimental data to connect k and ec under specific conditions the solution ec is then assumed as a variable in the resultant k ec functional relationship leading to an empirical model that can conveniently estimate k section 4 evaluates the novel empirical formulas by detailed comparison with the traditional grain size based equations and discusses the potential uncertainty in the models section 5 draws the main conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus we first built a self circulation unsteady flow darcy permeameter which can monitor the hydraulic head and ec fig 1 the inner and outer diameters of the pvc glass tube are 40 and 50 mm respectively and the tube height is 550 mm the tube is packed with sand up to 300 mm in depth and then filled with water to 200 mm the ec meter and the pressure sensor are attached at both sides of the tube so that the hydraulic head which can then be used to calculate hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity can be measured simultaneously a gauze screen is installed at the bottom of the tube the sand is packed in the tube however due to the relatively long length of the soil column the actual degree of sand compaction may differ along the tube hence the hydraulic conductivity may change with depth the multiple sensors and meters installed in the apparatus can measure the hydraulic head and electrical conductivity at different depths with a uniform interval of 5 cm 2 2 schematic flow of the experiment the main purpose of this experiment is to obtain a test dataset of k and ec the porosity of soil is one factors affecting the soil ec and the compaction of soil column can change the porosity and therefore should be evaluated experiments show that the electrical conductivities of the uppermost and the lowermost sediments differ significantly because of the different degrees of sand compaction and the strata type of distribution for sand along the column the upper part of soil is usually loose and the lowest layer is tightly compacted therefore the mean of the measured ec cannot represent the effective ec of the whole soil column to reduce this uncertainty the soil column is separated into multiple layers so that each layer can have its own k and ec the relative compaction ratio is used to quantify the degree of compaction by measuring the soil height change under different compaction conditions finally three degrees of compaction loose slightly dense and compacted are implemented through height and frequency of hammering moreover the solute concentration sodium chloride solution used here and the type of salt appelo and postma 2005 can influence the viscosity and density of the fluid passing through the soil column causing a change of k the solute concentration can change the density of fluid and then result in a certain effect on the viscosity of the fluid changing k meyer et al 2018 the effect of salt concentration on the hydraulic conductivity was mainly considered in the laboratory test the impacts of solution concentration are investigated through six different solution concentration scenarios 2 2 1 experimental scenario design in this study the layer of soil at the height of 300 mm was treated as loose soil the height of 290 mm as slightly dense soil and the height of 280 mm as compacted soil the dry bulk densities are 1 46 g cm3 1 51 g cm3 and 1 56 g cm3 respectively the concentration of sodium chloride solution is divided into six grades 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 g l soil with different particle sizes is divided into 5 categories no 1 to 5 and the diameter is 0 10 0 25 0 25 0 35 0 35 0 50 0 50 0 80 and 0 80 1 00 mm for no 1 2 3 4 and 5 soil respectively considering the difficulty level of compaction and data requirement this experiment uses three compaction degrees for no 2 soil and no 3 soil while the other soil with different particle sizes is tested under the slightly dense condition fifty four experimental scenarios are developed with parameters shown in table 1 there are 5 sediment samples with different particle sizes 3 compaction levels and 6 sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations 2 2 2 operation of the experiment the following six major steps are followed in each experiment to measure the ec and the hydraulic head 1 fill the pvc tube with soil up to the height of 300 mm to reach the designed degree of soil compaction a gravity hammer is used to compress the soil column to the corresponding height seal the glass tube to prevent any leakage 2 immerse the soil column into the configured sodium chloride solution at a certain concentration from the bottom up till the soil is fully saturated to avoid air bubbles entrapment 3 assemble the hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity sampling device i e sensors and meters 4 after the soil column is saturated with water turn on the electrical conductivity meter to record the soil electrical conductivity and the temperature 5 when the hydraulic head in the tube decreases record the duration of each 2 cm drop in the hydraulic head the declining hydraulic head is also recorded at a temporal interval t which is defined as one tenth of the total experimental duration 6 refill the soil sample with particles with different sizes degrees of compaction or sodium chloride solution concentrations and repeat steps 1 5 2 3 calculation of hydraulic conductivity the unsteady condition seepage test under in this study is extended from the darcy test according to the unsteady seepage instruments todd 1980 the following darcy law is applicable to the unsteady flow 1 q k a h l where q is the flow rate cm3 s a is the cross sectional area of the soil column cm2 h is the change of the hydraulic head i e the decline of the hydraulic head in time cm and l is the length of the soil column cm the mass conservation law leads to the following equation 2 ka h l d t a d h which can be re arranged as the following formula 3 t l k ln h 0 l k ln h using the slope of the line defined by eq 3 we can calculate the hydraulic conductivity hence eq 3 converts the hydraulic head and time data into the average hydraulic conductivity for the whole soil column k t the average k t needs to be converted to hydraulic conductivity for each layer k i when the flow direction is perpendicular to the strata the flow through each layer remains the same due to mass conservation the total thickness m is equal to the sum of the layer thicknesses m i and the total head δ h is equal to the sum of the head δ h i if an effective homogeneous aquifer is used to replace the stratified medium the thickness of the equivalent layer is equal to the stratified thickness and the flow q is the same 4 q k i b δ h i m i in this test the vertical equivalent hydraulic conductivity k v can be calculated using the head drop obtained from the pressure pipe the hydraulic conductivity k i for each layer can be calculated using k v 5 k i m i j 1 n m j k v j 1 i 1 m j k j where k i and k j are the hydraulic conductivity of the i and j th layers respectively and m i and m j are the thickness of the i and j th layers respectively for a long term experiment the water temperature may not remain stable and therefore the hydraulic conductivity needs to be adjusted for the temperature change 6 k k t η t η 20 where k t m d is the hydraulic conductivity when water temperature is t c k is the hydraulic conductivity when the water temperature is room temperature 20 c η t kpa s is the water viscosity at temperature t and η 20 1 010 10 6 kpa s is the water viscosity at temperature of 20 c 2 4 development of the regression model a regression model can be used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity using soil electrical conductivity data in our experiments the impacts of three factors solution concentration particle size and the degree of soil compaction on k are tested when the solution concentration remains the same the other two factors control k the hydraulic conductivity under various conditions are calculated by eqs 3 6 an exponential regression model 7 is selected 7 k h a e b e c c where k h is the estimated k of the soil column under the six specific solution conditions i e the sodium chloride solutions and a b and c are parameters to be fitted given the experimental data other types of regression models such as power law will also be tested and evaluated below assuming that unknown parameters a b and c vary with solution concentration model 7 allows the determination of parameters using laboratory experiments with specific solute concentration it is noteworthy that other fluid properties may also affect these parameters the solution concentration is one of the major factors and is easy to measure in the field hence this study reveals only the relationship between these parameters and the solution concentration a future study is needed to reveal the other factors controlling the above mentioned parameters the regression model 7 can also be used in the field with the following generalized formula to estimate model parameters 8 k c a e b e c c a m 1 e n i ec r p 1 b m 2 e n 2 ec r p 2 c m 3 e n 3 ec r p 3 where k c is the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the soil column ec r is the electrical conductivity of the solution and m n and p are parameters to be defined because ec can be measured more conveniently than k and generally has a monotonous relationship with the concentration of solution cs ec r is selected as an independent variable in the regression model 8 2 5 the grain size analysis approaches to estimate k as reviewed above there are many methods to estimate k among which the grain size analysis method has been widely used for sediments biswal et al 2018 the popular estimation of k based on grain size analysis considers physical composition grain size and percentage content of grain size distribution of various particles in the disturbed sediment but it does not consider the potential impact of the solute concentration or the degree of compaction on k compared with the other methods the grain size analysis method is cost effective simple and convenient it can be used to approximate k for certain areas kasenow 2002 proposed a dimensional homogeneous formula for k after vukovic and soro vukovic and soro 1992 the general formula to estimate the hydraulic conductivity k e from the grain size distribution takes the form 9 k e g ν c φ n d w 2 where c dimensionless is an empirical coefficient g m2 s is the acceleration of gravity ν m2 s is the kinetic viscosity coefficient of water n is porosity φ n dimensionless is a function of porosity and d w is the particle diameter when the cumulative weight is w percent of the total weight here the viscosity ν depends on water temperature coefficients c and φ n vary with the selection method and porosity n is approximated by the uniformity coefficient 3 results 3 1 correlation between k and ec under different compaction degrees the measured hydraulic and electrical conductivities under different compaction conditions are depicted in fig 2 there is an overall negative correlation between k and ec and the discrepancy in k between different compaction conditions decreases with an increasing ec for example as shown in fig 2a when ec is 20 μ s cm the corresponding k is 22 33 24 19 and 38 21 m d for the loose slightly dense and dense sand columns respectively when ec increases to 80 μs cm the value for k is similar 8 37 8 73 and 10 86 m d for the three sand columns the impact of solute concentration varying from 0 to 5 g l on the relationship between k and ec is also shown in fig 2 the measured k or ec usually decreases with an increasing degree of soil compaction for example when the soil ec is the same the k decreases with the increasing degree of compaction fig 2 or in other words when the k is the same the higher degree in soil compaction leads to the lower soil ec however under some conditions fig 2c d some measured ks for the slightly dense soil are lower than that of the loose or dense soil this inconsistent pattern compared with the other trend lines is probably due to a few incidental experimental errors when the degree of soil compaction increases the medium porosity decreases i e the volumetric ratio of water to soil solid decreases decreasing the influence of the solution ec on the soil ec niwas et al 2011 note that the conductivity of the nacl solution is greater than that of the sand column in addition according to the well known archie equation archie 1942 there is an inverse relationship between porosity and resistivity ec and resistivity are also reciprocal hence there is a negative relationship between soil ec and the degree of soil compaction 3 2 relation between k and ec under different grain sizes the test soil samples are classified into 3 groups which are fine sand no 1 and no 2 medium sand no 3 and coarse sand no 4 and no 5 as shown in fig 3 b when cs 1 g l the variation rate of k is relatively large for coarse sand 0 0064 while it is relatively small for medium 0 0025 and fine sand 0 0014 furthermore the coefficient of determination of coarse sand is smaller than fine and medium sand for example when cs 5 g l fig 3f the coefficient of determination is 0 57 0 71 and 0 62 for coarse medium and fine sand respectively in general the slope of coarse sand s lnk ec curve is greater than that of fine sand and medium sand fig 3 it is concluded that the change of ec for larger sand has a stronger influence on soil k a larger particle size results in smaller porosity todd 1980 and hence the volumetric proportion of water in coarse sand is smaller than fine sand the coefficient of determination for the exponential lnk ec regression curve is smaller for coarser sand as shown by fig 3 the ec of pore water has a smaller impact on the soil ec for coarser sand while the impact of the solution ec is relatively stronger for the coarser sand 3 3 the empirical models to estimate k using ec this section discusses the functional relationship between k and ec under the same solution concentration fig 4 the nonlinear attenuation variation of ec and k may be described by exponential and power law functions and we explore which function is more appropriate for practical applications fig 4 shows that for a fixed solute concentration the soil k has a significant negative correlation with the soil ec which can be better fitted by the exponential function with a larger determination coefficient varying from 0 81 to 0 96 than the power law function where the coefficient of determination varies from 0 58 to 0 80 hence the exponential model fits the measured k ec relation better than the power law model as mentioned above the relationship between soil k and ec follows an exponential function form as y a e b x c where the parameters a b and c can be estimated using the measured ec of the solution fig 5 a c when k is a dependent variable parameters a 113 4 428 7 b 0 012 0 125 and c 3 29 8 31 generally satisfy the exponential distribution defined by 8 fig 5d shows that the modeled k using the parameters estimated above can capture the overall trend of the calculated i e real k although there is apparent noise representing discrepancy between the modeled and calculated k this discrepancy increases with the increasing k which will be discussed further in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the calculated k and the modeled k this section analyzes the difference between the measured k and the modeled one using empirical model 7 under both the six specific conditions k h and the comprehensive evaluation model k c 8 fig 6 shows the errors between the measured hydraulic conductivity and the results of the six empirical mathematical models listed in fig 4 of hydraulic conductivity k h and the comprehensive evaluation model k c the error values are concentrated around 0 and the error distributions are relatively uniform and symmetric the standard deviation obtained by the comprehensive evaluation model k c 8 is larger than those obtained by the model 7 estimation under the six specific conditions k h implying that additional errors are introduced in the comprehensive evaluation model 8 when calculating its parameters a b and c when using the mathematical model 7 under specific solution concentration conditions a more accurate k can be obtained because the influence of the solution ec on the error is excluded in addition the 95 and 99 confidence intervals riceles 2003 are selected to analyze the mathematical models discussed above and the results are shown in fig 7 the image shows that the range of the confidence interval of the comprehensive evaluation model 8 is less than that for the model 7 the mathematical model description using the comprehensive evaluation model to estimate the error range of hydraulic conductivity is smaller fig 7 shows that the median of each group is close to 0 in addition the distribution of the empirical relationship between k and ec in the six groups under specific solution concentration conditions is narrower therefore the result would be better than that of the comprehensive evaluation model although the error of k c is larger than that of k h the comprehensive model 8 is still applicable for general field applications under the laboratory conditions it is possible to analyze the experimental results of the six characteristic solute concentrations and calibrate their relationship curves as conducted in this study however when ec r is not equal to the values provided by this study the use of the above six exponential formulas shown in the fig 4 will generate an inestimable error the calculation of k c by the comprehensive formula 8 can solve this issue in the field applications since it does not rely on the characteristic solute concentration hence we may have to use the convenient and applicable method 8 when approximating soil k in the field with much less information although model 8 is less accurate than 7 as shown in fig 5d the normalized root mean square error rmse of data points fitted with the comprehensive model 8 k c shown by black dots in fig 5d was 20 17 the normalized rmse for k larger than 10 m d is 29 26 showing larger deviation of the estimation for a large k i e 10 m d the blue and black regression lines shown in fig 5d were built based on all the k c data and only the large k c 10 m d respectively many of the paired points are located outside of the 95 confidence interval ci showing that the apparent estimation error still exists using our proposed ec based method more than fifty percent of the measured k data were greater than 10 m d since early arrivals of pollutants is mainly controlled by large hydraulic conductivity values creating preferential flow paths the k data larger than 10 m d are selected and fitted with the following power law model 10 and the resultant k k f k 10 m d is shown by the red dots in fig 5d 10 k f d ec e d q 1 e c r r 1 e q 2 e c r r 2 where k f is the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the soil column ec r is the electrical conductivity of the solution and q and r are parameters to be defined the rmse of k data larger than 10 m d fitted by the comprehensive model 8 and the power law model 10 is 23 14 m d and 20 25 m d respectively showing that the large k can be better fitted by the power law model 10 the determination coefficient of data fitting using the comprehensive model 8 is 0 48 after fitting with the power law function 10 the determination coefficient is 0 52 therefore the data of high k 10 m d can be better modeled using the power law function providing an alternative model for k estimation in the field 4 2 comparison with grain size analysis approaches to estimate k there are five empirical formulas that define the parameters in 9 vukovic and soro 1992 which are the hazen method slichter method sauerbrei method kozeny method and u s bureau of replication method usbr are used to estimate k table 2 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to assess the model ability of reproducing the estimated k 11 ns 1 i 1 n q m i q 0 i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 where q 0 is the mean of the measured k q m is the modeled k q 0 is the measured k and n is the total number of the measurements a larger coefficient ns represents a closer match between the measured and model results the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns identifies a perfect model efficiency when it is equal to 1 as shown in fig 8 the range of the measured k is 31 98 m d the range of k h 30 35 m d estimated by the functional relationship 7 is the closest one to the measured one and the ns of k h ns 0 80 is also the largest of all the methods the range of k c obtained by the comprehensive model 8 which is 34 71 m d is slightly larger than k h obtained by model 7 under specific solution concentration conditions and the ns of k c 0 50 is larger than the hazen method 0 21 the slichter method 0 06 and the usbr method 0 14 but less than the sauerbrei method 0 60 and the kozeny method 0 67 therefore k c is better than k e estimated by most of the empirical formulas based on the grain size distribution notably ns of the slichter and usbr methods is close to 0 showing that the model results are close to the average level of the measured value the hazen method has a negative ns ns 0 21 indicating that the mean measured k is better than that of the modeled k as mentioned above the method of particle size based analysis considers only the distribution of each particle size in the soil column while the degree of compaction for the soil column and the effect on hydraulic conductivity by solution electrical conductivity differences are not accounted for our proposed model 7 is established based on the measured electrical conductivity and it also accounts for the impacts of grain size and the degree of compaction of sand column on k hence it provides a better estimation for k than the classical empirical approaches focusing only on the grain size in addition k c estimated by the comprehensive model 8 only partially considers the grain size impact on k natural sediment is usually nonuniform in size and hence the empirical parameters a b and c are based on little data therefore some grain size analysis methods perform better than the k c estimation approach more measured data are needed to improve the estimation of parameters a b and c and finally the k c estimate 5 conclusions this study tries to provide a convenient approach to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity k by building the quantitative relationship between k and soil electrical conductivity ec three factors that may dominate the soil k are considered which are the particle size the degree of soil compaction and the fluid which is the nacl solution in this study concentration experimental study numerical analysis and model comparison lead to the following conclusions first the soil ec is mainly influenced by soil porosity and solution concentration in the pores an increasing solution concentration can result in a less fluid resistivity generating a larger soil ec these impacts will be more significant with a larger portion of soil voids i e a larger porosity since the medium is filled with more fluids for a loose formation with a relatively larger porosity a higher proportion of fluids makes the soil ec be more sensitive to the change of the pore water ec second the strong negative exponential correlation between k and ec is identified and can guide the estimation of the unknown k our laboratory experiments show that under the fixed solution concentration condition the soil k is negatively correlated with the soil ec by following an exponential regression function with a large determination coefficient r2 0 81 model comparison shows that the estimated hydraulic conductivity using the mathematical model under specific solution conditions k h is more reliable than the classical empirical formula based on the particle gradation such as the hazen slichter sauerbrei kozeny and usbr methods in addition parameters in the mathematical model of electrical conductivity and hydraulic conductivity k h under specific solution conditions can be obtained through experiments and their accuracy is higher than that of the comprehensive mathematical model k c the comprehensive model with variable parameters k c is more reliable than the hazen slichter and usbr methods third model comparison shows that the functional relationship between k and ec is more accurate if the electrical conductivity of the solution is considered in the model when the electrical conductivity of solution in the field is included the empirical model of k and ec under the specific solution electrical conductivity conditions can be used for parameter estimation if the electrical conductivity of solution is not available the comprehensive model with variable parameters can also provide a quick relatively reliable estimation of k such as the natural aquifer a power law model can provide a better estimation for k larger than 10 m d after obtaining the empirical formula under the specific solution conditions in the laboratory a more accurate estimate can be obtained for k finally although there is high uncertainty in our k estimation the empirical models proposed in this study reveal the relationship between k and ec and provide a quick and convenient way to estimate soil k uncertainty in k estimation in the field increases with the heterogeneity of soil k and more efforts are needed in the future to improve the empirical models especially the key parameters

solution ec is then assumed as a variable in the resultant k ec functional relationship leading to an empirical model that can conveniently estimate k section 4 evaluates the novel empirical formulas by detailed comparison with the traditional grain size based equations and discusses the potential uncertainty in the models section 5 draws the main conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus we first built a self circulation unsteady flow darcy permeameter which can monitor the hydraulic head and ec fig 1 the inner and outer diameters of the pvc glass tube are 40 and 50 mm respectively and the tube height is 550 mm the tube is packed with sand up to 300 mm in depth and then filled with water to 200 mm the ec meter and the pressure sensor are attached at both sides of the tube so that the hydraulic head which can then be used to calculate hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity can be measured simultaneously a gauze screen is installed at the bottom of the tube the sand is packed in the tube however due to the relatively long length of the soil column the actual degree of sand compaction may differ along the tube hence the hydraulic conductivity may change with depth the multiple sensors and meters installed in the apparatus can measure the hydraulic head and electrical conductivity at different depths with a uniform interval of 5 cm 2 2 schematic flow of the experiment the main purpose of this experiment is to obtain a test dataset of k and ec the porosity of soil is one factors affecting the soil ec and the compaction of soil column can change the porosity and therefore should be evaluated experiments show that the electrical conductivities of the uppermost and the lowermost sediments differ significantly because of the different degrees of sand compaction and the strata type of distribution for sand along the column the upper part of soil is usually loose and the lowest layer is tightly compacted therefore the mean of the measured ec cannot represent the effective ec of the whole soil column to reduce this uncertainty the soil column is separated into multiple layers so that each layer can have its own k and ec the relative compaction ratio is used to quantify the degree of compaction by measuring the soil height change under different compaction conditions finally three degrees of compaction loose slightly dense and compacted are implemented through height and frequency of hammering moreover the solute concentration sodium chloride solution used here and the type of salt appelo and postma 2005 can influence the viscosity and density of the fluid passing through the soil column causing a change of k the solute concentration can change the density of fluid and then result in a certain effect on the viscosity of the fluid changing k meyer et al 2018 the effect of salt concentration on the hydraulic conductivity was mainly considered in the laboratory test the impacts of solution concentration are investigated through six different solution concentration scenarios 2 2 1 experimental scenario design in this study the layer of soil at the height of 300 mm was treated as loose soil the height of 290 mm as slightly dense soil and the height of 280 mm as compacted soil the dry bulk densities are 1 46 g cm3 1 51 g cm3 and 1 56 g cm3 respectively the concentration of sodium chloride solution is divided into six grades 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 g l soil with different particle sizes is divided into 5 categories no 1 to 5 and the diameter is 0 10 0 25 0 25 0 35 0 35 0 50 0 50 0 80 and 0 80 1 00 mm for no 1 2 3 4 and 5 soil respectively considering the difficulty level of compaction and data requirement this experiment uses three compaction degrees for no 2 soil and no 3 soil while the other soil with different particle sizes is tested under the slightly dense condition fifty four experimental scenarios are developed with parameters shown in table 1 there are 5 sediment samples with different particle sizes 3 compaction levels and 6 sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations 2 2 2 operation of the experiment the following six major steps are followed in each experiment to measure the ec and the hydraulic head 1 fill the pvc tube with soil up to the height of 300 mm to reach the designed degree of soil compaction a gravity hammer is used to compress the soil column to the corresponding height seal the glass tube to prevent any leakage 2 immerse the soil column into the configured sodium chloride solution at a certain concentration from the bottom up till the soil is fully saturated to avoid air bubbles entrapment 3 assemble the hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity sampling device i e sensors and meters 4 after the soil column is saturated with water turn on the electrical conductivity meter to record the soil electrical conductivity and the temperature 5 when the hydraulic head in the tube decreases record the duration of each 2 cm drop in the hydraulic head the declining hydraulic head is also recorded at a temporal interval t which is defined as one tenth of the total experimental duration 6 refill the soil sample with particles with different sizes degrees of compaction or sodium chloride solution concentrations and repeat steps 1 5 2 3 calculation of hydraulic conductivity the unsteady condition seepage test under in this study is extended from the darcy test according to the unsteady seepage instruments todd 1980 the following darcy law is applicable to the unsteady flow 1 q k a h l where q is the flow rate cm3 s a is the cross sectional area of the soil column cm2 h is the change of the hydraulic head i e the decline of the hydraulic head in time cm and l is the length of the soil column cm the mass conservation law leads to the following equation 2 ka h l d t a d h which can be re arranged as the following formula 3 t l k ln h 0 l k ln h using the slope of the line defined by eq 3 we can calculate the hydraulic conductivity hence eq 3 converts the hydraulic head and time data into the average hydraulic conductivity for the whole soil column k t the average k t needs to be converted to hydraulic conductivity for each layer k i when the flow direction is perpendicular to the strata the flow through each layer remains the same due to mass conservation the total thickness m is equal to the sum of the layer thicknesses m i and the total head δ h is equal to the sum of the head δ h i if an effective homogeneous aquifer is used to replace the stratified medium the thickness of the equivalent layer is equal to the stratified thickness and the flow q is the same 4 q k i b δ h i m i in this test the vertical equivalent hydraulic conductivity k v can be calculated using the head drop obtained from the pressure pipe the hydraulic conductivity k i for each layer can be calculated using k v 5 k i m i j 1 n m j k v j 1 i 1 m j k j where k i and k j are the hydraulic conductivity of the i and j th layers respectively and m i and m j are the thickness of the i and j th layers respectively for a long term experiment the water temperature may not remain stable and therefore the hydraulic conductivity needs to be adjusted for the temperature change 6 k k t η t η 20 where k t m d is the hydraulic conductivity when water temperature is t c k is the hydraulic conductivity when the water temperature is room temperature 20 c η t kpa s is the water viscosity at temperature t and η 20 1 010 10 6 kpa s is the water viscosity at temperature of 20 c 2 4 development of the regression model a regression model can be used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity using soil electrical conductivity data in our experiments the impacts of three factors solution concentration particle size and the degree of soil compaction on k are tested when the solution concentration remains the same the other two factors control k the hydraulic conductivity under various conditions are calculated by eqs 3 6 an exponential regression model 7 is selected 7 k h a e b e c c where k h is the estimated k of the soil column under the six specific solution conditions i e the sodium chloride solutions and a b and c are parameters to be fitted given the experimental data other types of regression models such as power law will also be tested and evaluated below assuming that unknown parameters a b and c vary with solution concentration model 7 allows the determination of parameters using laboratory experiments with specific solute concentration it is noteworthy that other fluid properties may also affect these parameters the solution concentration is one of the major factors and is easy to measure in the field hence this study reveals only the relationship between these parameters and the solution concentration a future study is needed to reveal the other factors controlling the above mentioned parameters the regression model 7 can also be used in the field with the following generalized formula to estimate model parameters 8 k c a e b e c c a m 1 e n i ec r p 1 b m 2 e n 2 ec r p 2 c m 3 e n 3 ec r p 3 where k c is the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the soil column ec r is the electrical conductivity of the solution and m n and p are parameters to be defined because ec can be measured more conveniently than k and generally has a monotonous relationship with the concentration of solution cs ec r is selected as an independent variable in the regression model 8 2 5 the grain size analysis approaches to estimate k as reviewed above there are many methods to estimate k among which the grain size analysis method has been widely used for sediments biswal et al 2018 the popular estimation of k based on grain size analysis considers physical composition grain size and percentage content of grain size distribution of various particles in the disturbed sediment but it does not consider the potential impact of the solute concentration or the degree of compaction on k compared with the other methods the grain size analysis method is cost effective simple and convenient it can be used to approximate k for certain areas kasenow 2002 proposed a dimensional homogeneous formula for k after vukovic and soro vukovic and soro 1992 the general formula to estimate the hydraulic conductivity k e from the grain size distribution takes the form 9 k e g ν c φ n d w 2 where c dimensionless is an empirical coefficient g m2 s is the acceleration of gravity ν m2 s is the kinetic viscosity coefficient of water n is porosity φ n dimensionless is a function of porosity and d w is the particle diameter when the cumulative weight is w percent of the total weight here the viscosity ν depends on water temperature coefficients c and φ n vary with the selection method and porosity n is approximated by the uniformity coefficient 3 results 3 1 correlation between k and ec under different compaction degrees the measured hydraulic and electrical conductivities under different compaction conditions are depicted in fig 2 there is an overall negative correlation between k and ec and the discrepancy in k between different compaction conditions decreases with an increasing ec for example as shown in fig 2a when ec is 20 μ s cm the corresponding k is 22 33 24 19 and 38 21 m d for the loose slightly dense and dense sand columns respectively when ec increases to 80 μs cm the value for k is similar 8 37 8 73 and 10 86 m d for the three sand columns the impact of solute concentration varying from 0 to 5 g l on the relationship between k and ec is also shown in fig 2 the measured k or ec usually decreases with an increasing degree of soil compaction for example when the soil ec is the same the k decreases with the increasing degree of compaction fig 2 or in other words when the k is the same the higher degree in soil compaction leads to the lower soil ec however under some conditions fig 2c d some measured ks for the slightly dense soil are lower than that of the loose or dense soil this inconsistent pattern compared with the other trend lines is probably due to a few incidental experimental errors when the degree of soil compaction increases the medium porosity decreases i e the volumetric ratio of water to soil solid decreases decreasing the influence of the solution ec on the soil ec niwas et al 2011 note that the conductivity of the nacl solution is greater than that of the sand column in addition according to the well known archie equation archie 1942 there is an inverse relationship between porosity and resistivity ec and resistivity are also reciprocal hence there is a negative relationship between soil ec and the degree of soil compaction 3 2 relation between k and ec under different grain sizes the test soil samples are classified into 3 groups which are fine sand no 1 and no 2 medium sand no 3 and coarse sand no 4 and no 5 as shown in fig 3 b when cs 1 g l the variation rate of k is relatively large for coarse sand 0 0064 while it is relatively small for medium 0 0025 and fine sand 0 0014 furthermore the coefficient of determination of coarse sand is smaller than fine and medium sand for example when cs 5 g l fig 3f the coefficient of determination is 0 57 0 71 and 0 62 for coarse medium and fine sand respectively in general the slope of coarse sand s lnk ec curve is greater than that of fine sand and medium sand fig 3 it is concluded that the change of ec for larger sand has a stronger influence on soil k a larger particle size results in smaller porosity todd 1980 and hence the volumetric proportion of water in coarse sand is smaller than fine sand the coefficient of determination for the exponential lnk ec regression curve is smaller for coarser sand as shown by fig 3 the ec of pore water has a smaller impact on the soil ec for coarser sand while the impact of the solution ec is relatively stronger for the coarser sand 3 3 the empirical models to estimate k using ec this section discusses the functional relationship between k and ec under the same solution concentration fig 4 the nonlinear attenuation variation of ec and k may be described by exponential and power law functions and we explore which function is more appropriate for practical applications fig 4 shows that for a fixed solute concentration the soil k has a significant negative correlation with the soil ec which can be better fitted by the exponential function with a larger determination coefficient varying from 0 81 to 0 96 than the power law function where the coefficient of determination varies from 0 58 to 0 80 hence the exponential model fits the measured k ec relation better than the power law model as mentioned above the relationship between soil k and ec follows an exponential function form as y a e b x c where the parameters a b and c can be estimated using the measured ec of the solution fig 5 a c when k is a dependent variable parameters a 113 4 428 7 b 0 012 0 125 and c 3 29 8 31 generally satisfy the exponential distribution defined by 8 fig 5d shows that the modeled k using the parameters estimated above can capture the overall trend of the calculated i e real k although there is apparent noise representing discrepancy between the modeled and calculated k this discrepancy increases with the increasing k which will be discussed further in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the calculated k and the modeled k this section analyzes the difference between the measured k and the modeled one using empirical model 7 under both the six specific conditions k h and the comprehensive evaluation model k c 8 fig 6 shows the errors between the measured hydraulic conductivity and the results of the six empirical mathematical models listed in fig 4 of hydraulic conductivity k h and the comprehensive evaluation model k c the error values are concentrated around 0 and the error distributions are relatively uniform and symmetric the standard deviation obtained by the comprehensive evaluation model k c 8 is larger than those obtained by the model 7 estimation under the six specific conditions k h implying that additional errors are introduced in the comprehensive evaluation model 8 when calculating its parameters a b and c when using the mathematical model 7 under specific solution concentration conditions a more accurate k can be obtained because the influence of the solution ec on the error is excluded in addition the 95 and 99 confidence intervals riceles 2003 are selected to analyze the mathematical models discussed above and the results are shown in fig 7 the image shows that the range of the confidence interval of the comprehensive evaluation model 8 is less than that for the model 7 the mathematical model description using the comprehensive evaluation model to estimate the error range of hydraulic conductivity is smaller fig 7 shows that the median of each group is close to 0 in addition the distribution of the empirical relationship between k and ec in the six groups under specific solution concentration conditions is narrower therefore the result would be better than that of the comprehensive evaluation model although the error of k c is larger than that of k h the comprehensive model 8 is still applicable for general field applications under the laboratory conditions it is possible to analyze the experimental results of the six characteristic solute concentrations and calibrate their relationship curves as conducted in this study however when ec r is not equal to the values provided by this study the use of the above six exponential formulas shown in the fig 4 will generate an inestimable error the calculation of k c by the comprehensive formula 8 can solve this issue in the field applications since it does not rely on the characteristic solute concentration hence we may have to use the convenient and applicable method 8 when approximating soil k in the field with much less information although model 8 is less accurate than 7 as shown in fig 5d the normalized root mean square error rmse of data points fitted with the comprehensive model 8 k c shown by black dots in fig 5d was 20 17 the normalized rmse for k larger than 10 m d is 29 26 showing larger deviation of the estimation for a large k i e 10 m d the blue and black regression lines shown in fig 5d were built based on all the k c data and only the large k c 10 m d respectively many of the paired points are located outside of the 95 confidence interval ci showing that the apparent estimation error still exists using our proposed ec based method more than fifty percent of the measured k data were greater than 10 m d since early arrivals of pollutants is mainly controlled by large hydraulic conductivity values creating preferential flow paths the k data larger than 10 m d are selected and fitted with the following power law model 10 and the resultant k k f k 10 m d is shown by the red dots in fig 5d 10 k f d ec e d q 1 e c r r 1 e q 2 e c r r 2 where k f is the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the soil column ec r is the electrical conductivity of the solution and q and r are parameters to be defined the rmse of k data larger than 10 m d fitted by the comprehensive model 8 and the power law model 10 is 23 14 m d and 20 25 m d respectively showing that the large k can be better fitted by the power law model 10 the determination coefficient of data fitting using the comprehensive model 8 is 0 48 after fitting with the power law function 10 the determination coefficient is 0 52 therefore the data of high k 10 m d can be better modeled using the power law function providing an alternative model for k estimation in the field 4 2 comparison with grain size analysis approaches to estimate k there are five empirical formulas that define the parameters in 9 vukovic and soro 1992 which are the hazen method slichter method sauerbrei method kozeny method and u s bureau of replication method usbr are used to estimate k table 2 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to assess the model ability of reproducing the estimated k 11 ns 1 i 1 n q m i q 0 i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q 0 2 where q 0 is the mean of the measured k q m is the modeled k q 0 is the measured k and n is the total number of the measurements a larger coefficient ns represents a closer match between the measured and model results the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns identifies a perfect model efficiency when it is equal to 1 as shown in fig 8 the range of the measured k is 31 98 m d the range of k h 30 35 m d estimated by the functional relationship 7 is the closest one to the measured one and the ns of k h ns 0 80 is also the largest of all the methods the range of k c obtained by the comprehensive model 8 which is 34 71 m d is slightly larger than k h obtained by model 7 under specific solution concentration conditions and the ns of k c 0 50 is larger than the hazen method 0 21 the slichter method 0 06 and the usbr method 0 14 but less than the sauerbrei method 0 60 and the kozeny method 0 67 therefore k c is better than k e estimated by most of the empirical formulas based on the grain size distribution notably ns of the slichter and usbr methods is close to 0 showing that the model results are close to the average level of the measured value the hazen method has a negative ns ns 0 21 indicating that the mean measured k is better than that of the modeled k as mentioned above the method of particle size based analysis considers only the distribution of each particle size in the soil column while the degree of compaction for the soil column and the effect on hydraulic conductivity by solution electrical conductivity differences are not accounted for our proposed model 7 is established based on the measured electrical conductivity and it also accounts for the impacts of grain size and the degree of compaction of sand column on k hence it provides a better estimation for k than the classical empirical approaches focusing only on the grain size in addition k c estimated by the comprehensive model 8 only partially considers the grain size impact on k natural sediment is usually nonuniform in size and hence the empirical parameters a b and c are based on little data therefore some grain size analysis methods perform better than the k c estimation approach more measured data are needed to improve the estimation of parameters a b and c and finally the k c estimate 5 conclusions this study tries to provide a convenient approach to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity k by building the quantitative relationship between k and soil electrical conductivity ec three factors that may dominate the soil k are considered which are the particle size the degree of soil compaction and the fluid which is the nacl solution in this study concentration experimental study numerical analysis and model comparison lead to the following conclusions first the soil ec is mainly influenced by soil porosity and solution concentration in the pores an increasing solution concentration can result in a less fluid resistivity generating a larger soil ec these impacts will be more significant with a larger portion of soil voids i e a larger porosity since the medium is filled with more fluids for a loose formation with a relatively larger porosity a higher proportion of fluids makes the soil ec be more sensitive to the change of the pore water ec second the strong negative exponential correlation between k and ec is identified and can guide the estimation of the unknown k our laboratory experiments show that under the fixed solution concentration condition the soil k is negatively correlated with the soil ec by following an exponential regression function with a large determination coefficient r2 0 81 model comparison shows that the estimated hydraulic conductivity using the mathematical model under specific solution conditions k h is more reliable than the classical empirical formula based on the particle gradation such as the hazen slichter sauerbrei kozeny and usbr methods in addition parameters in the mathematical model of electrical conductivity and hydraulic conductivity k h under specific solution conditions can be obtained through experiments and their accuracy is higher than that of the comprehensive mathematical model k c the comprehensive model with variable parameters k c is more reliable than the hazen slichter and usbr methods third model comparison shows that the functional relationship between k and ec is more accurate if the electrical conductivity of the solution is considered in the model when the electrical conductivity of solution in the field is included the empirical model of k and ec under the specific solution electrical conductivity conditions can be used for parameter estimation if the electrical conductivity of solution is not available the comprehensive model with variable parameters can also provide a quick relatively reliable estimation of k such as the natural aquifer a power law model can provide a better estimation for k larger than 10 m d after obtaining the empirical formula under the specific solution conditions in the laboratory a more accurate estimate can be obtained for k finally although there is high uncertainty in our k estimation the empirical models proposed in this study reveal the relationship between k and ec and provide a quick and convenient way to estimate soil k uncertainty in k estimation in the field increases with the heterogeneity of soil k and more efforts are needed in the future to improve the empirical models especially the key parameters

6341,suction in subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction of the pavement the equilibrium suction has a direct influence on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil in the current mechanistic empirical pavement design guide equilibrium suction is determined based on the empirical relationship with water table depth however studies have shown that other critical factors also influence equilibrium suction in this study a new mechanistic empirical model is presented to predict equilibrium suction considering the effects of physical properties of the soil and climatic factors a simple regression model is also generated to predict the equilibrium suction from readily available parameters i e thornthwaite moisture index tmi plasticity index pi and dry suction value at surface u dry in the final section of this paper the effects of tmi and vegetation on equilibrium suction are evaluated for various soil classes and tmi ranges respectively a contour map of the equilibrium suction values for the entire continental united states has been generated using the geographic information system gis platform and followed by the model predictions keywords equilibrium suction thornthwaite moisture index geographic information system subgrade soil moisture active zone 1 introduction the pavement subgrade moisture condition is critical because it directly affects the strength and stiffness of pavement structure perera et al 2004 subgrade soils are usually unsaturated and the resilient modulus of the subgrade soil is highly dependent on the degree of saturation and the corresponding matric suction liang et al 2008 oloo et al 1998 wolfe and butalia 2004 khoury and zaman 2004 gu et al 2014 luo et al 2017 saha et al 2017 2018b zhang et al 2019 past studies showed that matric suction in the subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction aitchison and richards 1965 basma and ai suleiman 1991 hence accurate estimation of equilibrium suction underneath pavement structures is critical for determining the long term resilient modulus of subgrade soil which is further used to predict pavement performance an enhanced integrated climatic model eicm was implemented in the current aashtoware pavement me design to incorporate the climatic design inputs the eicm is a one dimensional heat and moisture flow program developed by the federal highway administration fhwa for predicting the moisture condition in subgrade soils the eicm used the depth to ground water table to compute moisture content and the corresponding suction in subgrade however this model would yield inaccurate suction values if the water table data is missing or the water table depth is greater than 7 m current studies demonstrated that many other factors affected the suction profile in addition to ground water table which included precipitation evapotranspiration field capacity etc russam and coleman 1961 coleman 1965 this study aimed to develop an improved prediction model of equilibrium suction which would take into account a variety of influence factors matric suction in soil reaches an equilibrium condition at a certain depth of the moisture active zone zm there are primarily two different approaches available to determine the equilibrium suction 1 correlation with a rational climatic index and 2 statistical model based on climatic factors and soil index properties a climatic index related to the soil environment is based on a process in which the potential for soil moisture exchange is determined by the frequency analysis of precipitation and evapotranspiration a number of climatic indices e g thornthwaite moisture index tmi thornthwaite 1948 and penman index penman 1963 were developed to correlate with various annual moisture balance indicators tmi was correlated with the depth of moisture active zone and equilibrium suction carpenter et al 1974 edris and lytton 1976 fityus et al 1998 lytton et al 2005 gay 1994 developed a relationship between mean annual moisture depth and tmi he used climatic data from 12 sites in texas to establish a relationship between tmi values and mean moisture depth the post tensioning institute pti 2004 and the australian standard as2870 2011 developed a correlation between the subgrade equilibrium suction and tmi however existing studies showed that suction beneath covered areas was dependent on both climatic factors and soil index properties russam and coleman 1961 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 zapata 1999 recently witczak et al 2006 proposed a statistical model for predicting equilibrium suction of subgrade soil based on p200 and wpi parameters where p200 is the percent of material passing no 200 0 075 mm sieve and wpi is the product of p200 and plasticity index pi these correlation models were developed by using a limited number of data sets that are highly variable to improve the prediction accuracy of equilibrium suction in a subgrade layer a mechanistic empirical approach was adopted in this study which involved the transient suction profile and soil water retention characteristics of soil as well as climatic factors a geographic information system gis is a platform to capture store manage and present all types of geographical data including equilibrium suction values through the gis database the users enable to input longitude and latitude of the specific location to extract the equilibrium suction value the gis database is also compatible with the current aashtoware pavement me design program which facilitates the determination of stiffness variation of subgrade soils the primary objective of this paper was to introduce a method to predict equilibrium suction from tmi and pi the following section described the generation of the tmi contour map in a gis platform this contour map provided the required input for determining the equilibrium suction of subgrade soil by utilizing a mechanistic empirical approach a contour map of equilibrium suction was plotted for the continental u s in the following a regression model was developed to predict equilibrium suction using tmi and pi subsequently a parametric study was described to evaluate the effect of soil class and vegetation on equilibrium suction the concluding section summarized the significant findings of this study 2 development of a gis based contour map of tmi tmi is a moisture index that reflects climate and soil humidity thornthwaite 1948 this index is calculated using soil moisture balance in terms of rainfall potential evapotranspiration and the depth of available moisture balance stored in the rooting zone of vegetation at a particular site fig 1 shows the tmi contour map of the united states originally developed by thornthwaite 1948 although many other methods were proposed to determine the tmi values in the past decades the original contour map was still widely used in many studies due to its simplicity and reliability chan and mostyn 2009 fox 2002 mitchell 2013 jewell and mitchell 2009 mckeen and johnson 1990 fityus et al 1998 er and rifat 2014 li and sun 2015 karunarathne et al 2016 however the regeneration of the original tmi map in gis platform is difficult because of the missing historical water storage data on a yearly basis olaiz et al 2018 performed a comparison study of the four different tmi calculation processes developed from 1948 to 2006 and concluded that the model developed by witczak et al 2006 matched closely with the original tmi calculation process accordingly this study adopted witczak s model to calculate the tmi value of the continental united states a detailed description of the process to develop the tmi map in the gis platform is presented as follows in this study a gis based tmi contour map was generated based on the precipitation and temperature metadata file the spatial metadata files were collected from prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate mapping system daly et al 1994 2002 2008 at oregon state university the prism mapping system was developed based on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate database which includes in situ measurements of temperature and precipitation from 5852 weather stations across the continental united states prism uses a weighted regression scheme to account for complex climate regimes associated with orography rain shadows temperature inversions slope aspect coastal proximity and other factors and depicts climatological normal from 1981 to 2010 at 30 arcsec 800 m resolution fig 2 shows the annual average precipitation p and temperature contour map of the united states in the gis platform the potential evapotranspiration was calculated using monthly average temperature ti for the specific site wilm et al 1944 an annual heat index hy was determined using eq 1 1 h y i 1 12 0 2 t i 1 54 the monthly potential evapotranspiration was quantified using eq 2 2 p e i 1 6 10 t i h y a where p e i is the potential evapotranspiration in the ith month and a 6 75 10 7 h y 3 7 71 10 5 h y 2 0 01792 h y 0 49239 the p e i value represents potential evapotranspiration over a period of 30 day with 12 hour daylight duration the effect of daily variations in daylight on monthly potential evapotranspiration were determined based on a correction factor di introduced by mckeen and johnson 1990 the corrected potential evapotranspiration was obtained using eq 3 3 p e i p e i d i n i 30 where p e i is the monthly corrected potential evapotranspiration unit cm di is the daylight correction factor for each month unit hrs n i is the number of days in the given month the average annual potential evapotranspiration p e y was calculated by summing p e i over a 12 month period as shown in eq 4 4 p e y i 1 12 p e i fig 3 depicts the calculated p e y map of continental united states on the gis platform finally the tmi value is calculated using eq 5 witczak et al 2006 and plotted in fig 4 5 tmi 75 p p e y 1 10 this study collected the tmi values at the specific locations from the original tmi map which are listed in table 1 snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 wray 1989 jayatilaka et al 1992 fig 5 compares the tmi values from the original map table 1 and the contour map fig 4 developed in this study using arcgis software tmi values were extracted from the developed map at the specific geographic coordinates shown in table 1 a statistical analysis was performed to determine the coefficient of determination r2 associated with the tmi values from original and developed contour maps this correlation resulted in an r2 value of 0 93 indicating that the developed tmi contour map was in good agreement with the original map the next section describes a mechanistic empirical approach used to determine equilibrium suction of the soil using the developed tmi map for a specific location to relate the tmi value with the soil properties the total map area of the continental united states was divided into 74 400 map units the map units define the map areas identified in the soil survey geographic ssurgo database that was developed by the national cooperative soil survey these areas were identified based on the soil type and other components that have unique properties interpretations and productivity the zonal distribution toolbar in arcgis software was used to calculate the average tmi value of each map unit 3 development of a mechanistic empirical model to determine equilibrium suction a mechanistic empirical method was developed to determine equilibrium suction which involved a steady state diffusion equation proposed by mitchell mitchell 1979 and a functional relationship between tmi and annual average moisture depth established by gay 1994 mitchell 1979 expressed matric suction at a depth z in the soil profile by solving a two dimensional diffusion equation with surface boundaries subject to suction change shown in eq 6 6 u z u e u 0 e π n α z where u z is the suction at depth z expressed on the pf scale u e is the equilibrium value of suction on the pf scale u 0 is the suction profile amplitude n is the number of suction cycles per second 1 year 365 24 60 60 s α is the unsaturated soil diffusion coefficient unit cm2 sec z is the depth below the surface unit cm fig 6 illustrates a typical suction profile in unsaturated soil from the surface to the depth of the moisture active zone zm the terms u dry and u wet represent soil suction at the surface corresponding to an air dry state and soil field capacity respectively the terms u dry z m and u wet z m denote the suction in dry and wet profiles respectively at a depth of zm the term u dry is assumed to be 4 5 pf water pressure at 104 5 cm 3 10 103 kpa and 5 7 pf water pressure at 105 7 cm 4 92 104 kpa for vegetation and non vegetation areas respectively whereas u wet represents the suction level of 3 pf water pressure at 103 cm 98 kpa fpa 2017 gay 1994 the presence of vegetation significantly affects the depth of zm cameron 2001 if the site has vegetation at the surface zm is at least two feet 60 9 cm deeper than the deepest vegetation root observed in the soil fpa 2017 however when there is no vegetation in the surface zm is the depth of desiccation several experimental studies were performed by fpa 2017 and lytton et al 1997 and the average depths of zm in non vegetation and fully vegetation area were estimated to be 9 39 feet 286 2 cm and 21 feet 640 1 cm respectively it is observed that the depth of zm is dependent on the amount of vegetation on the surface to accurately determine the depth of zm a vegetation cover map of continental united states is presented in the following section 3 1 calculation of the fraction of vegetation cover noaa climate data records cdr provide historical climate information using data from weather satellites normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data were collected from this dataset which was derived from surface reflectance data acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor this long term record spans from 1981 to 2013 and utilizes avhrr data from six noaa polar orbiting satellites ndvi data were collected in georeferenced tagged image file format geotiff with embedded geographic information for gis applications the method proposed by brunsell and gillies 2003 was used in this study to obtain the fraction of vegetation cover from ndvi the method scaled the ndvi to obtain the fraction of vegetation cover fr between bare soil and a full canopy and was expressed in eqs 7 and 8 7 n ndvi n d v i 0 ndv i max n d v i 0 8 f r n 2 where ndvi0 is the bare soil ndvi value set as 2000 and ndvimax is the maximum ndvi corresponding to full cover dense vegetation set as 10000 fig 7 shows the fr map for the continental united states calculated using the raster calculator function in arcgis the zm value for specific sites were then determined by linearly interpolating fr between the average zm of bare soil 286 2 cm and full cover vegetation 640 1 cm the calculated zm values were used to determine the maximum available moisture depth and thereby establish a relationship between maximum available moisture depth and the mean moisture depth 3 2 calculation of maximum available annual moisture depth dam maximum available annual moisture depth dam represents the maximum depth of moisture that is lost from soil during a transition from the wet state to the dry state at the root potential of resident vegetation it is determined by the area of volumetric water content profile between dry and wet states fig 8 illustrates the volumetric water content θ profile where total moisture is stored between θ dry and θ wet herein u dry z m and u wet z m are calculated using eq 6 when u e equals 3 0 pf water pressure at 103 cm 98 kpa the unsaturated diffusivity coefficient α represents the slope of the suction profile it was determined as a function of the slope of soil water characteristics curve swcc θ w log h and saturated soil water permeability van genchten 1980 9 α k sat θ w log h saturated soil water permeability ksat was collected for all map units from the natural resource conservation service nrcs database the expression for θ w log h in eq 9 is presented in appendix a the value of n was assumed to be 1 0 cycle per year for all sites the terms θ dry θ wet θ dry and θ wet were calculated using the swcc for a particular site the fredlund xing equation was used to estimate the relationship between matric suction and volumetric water content as shown in eqs 10 and 11 fredlund and xing 1994 10 θ w c h x θ sat l n e h a f b f c f where h represents matric suction in units of cm of water pressure and c h is a correction factor defined as 11 c h 1 ln 1 h h r ln 1 1 021 x 10 7 h r the four fitting parameters i e af bf cf and hr in eqs 10 and 11 were predicted using the artificial neural network ann model developed by saha et al 2018a soil physical properties such as gradation atterberg limits saturated volumetric water content θ sat and mean annual air temperature were used as input parameters and the fitting parameters are obtained as output finally dam can be expressed as the sum of areas abc and bcde in fig 8 or according to eqs 12 and 13 12 d am 0 z m θ wet z θ dry z 13 d am θ dry θ dry n π α 1 e n π α z m θ wet θ dry z m in the moisture balance process the moisture depth or soil moisture storage reaches an equilibrium condition which is denoted as the mean annual moisture depth dm the relationship between dam and dm will be described in the next section 3 3 relationship between mean annual moisture depth d m and maximum available annual moisture depth d am the mean annual moisture depth dm is not only dependent on water retention and diffusivity characteristics of soil but is also affected by climatic factors as discussed earlier tmi is an indicator of annual moisture balance of a specified location based on precipitation evaporation and runoff in this study gay s approach gay 1994 was adopted to incorporate climatic factors in addition to soil characteristics to estimate moisture depth at equilibrium he computed equilibrium moisture depth from the input of tmi annual precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe and the depth of maximum available moisture dam when tmi the difference between p and pe was positive water would be added to the annual moisture storage up to a maximum value of d am if tmi was negative soil moisture loss would occur and be subtracted from storage up to a minimum value of zero gay 1994 collected climatic data from 12 sites and developed the relationship between dm and tmi in order to fit a rational function between tmi and dm it is necessary to establish the limits of the function the dependent variable dm logically has a maximum possible value of d am and a minimum value of zero to establish the limits of the assumed independent variable tmi eq 6 was examined it is deduced from eq 6 that the minimum value of tmi occurs if there is no precipitation for the entire year under this circumstance the minimum value or lower bound of the tmi would be equal to 65 while the upper bound of tmi theoretically goes to infinity to establish the relationship between tmi and dm juarez badillo s approach was applied in this study juarez badillo 1975 the functional domains for the variables are shown in fig 9 the real domain for t tmi 65 and moisture depth d are 0 and 0 dam respectively the real domain for variable d is incomplete and therefore a function of f d is needed that is similar i e increasing in the same direction to the real domain of variable t likewise the formulation of volume by juarez badillo 1981 the following function represents the simplified function form for d that satisfies these boundary conditions 14 f d 1 d am d m 1 d am assuming a linear rate of change between f d and t and integrating them within the limits of the domains shown in fig 9 the final expression for dm is obtained in eq 17 the relationship between f d and t is established as 15 γ dt t df d f d where γ is a non dimensional parameter of proportionality introducing eq 14 into eq 15 and integrating between the limits of f d and t 16 γ ln t t 1 ln 1 d am d m 1 d am 1 d am d 1 1 d am 17 d m d am 1 d am d 1 d 1 t t 1 γ the parameters γ t1 and d1 were regressed against the measured values of the depth of mean annual moisture dm for 17 locations snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 and jayatilaka et al 1992 the resulting expressions of γ d1 and t1 are given by eqs 18 through 20 18 γ 0 0369 d am 19 d 1 0 269 d am 20 t 1 0 8418 d am equilibrium suction was then calculated using the dm value at each location which included the regression parameters eq 21 was used to calculate equilibrium suction a graphical illustration of this equation is shown in the appendix b 21 θ dry θ dry n π α 1 e n π α z m θ e θ dry z m d m to validate the prediction accuracy of the regression parameters a new set of measured suction data at equilibrium were collected from the literature snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 jayatilaka et el 1992 these were compared against the calculated equilibrium suction values and plotted in fig 10 the predicted suction values showed good agreement with the measure values hence these relationships facilitate the calculation of equilibrium suction for all map units in the united states equilibrium

process an empirical relationship was established to predict the equilibrium suction for various soil types from the tmi value this relationship and its development is presented in the next section 4 development of prediction models for equilibrium suction a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the significant parameters that are correlated with equilibrium suction the soil and climatic parameters used in the regression model were tmi pi u dry zm fr 1 α θ sat af bf and cf these parameters were selected from the developed equilibrium suction equation presented in eq 21 and the linear relationship between dam and dm expressed in eq 17 the parameters u dry α zm and fr are the independent variables that play significant role in the formulation of equilibrium suction model the relationship between volumetric water content θ and the soil suction u as shown in eqs 10 and 11 is dependent on four fitting parameters af bf cf and hr and saturated volumetric water content θ sat zapata et al 2003 demonstrated that soil suction of plastic soil is proportional to its specific surface area the pi is a simple indicator that reflects the specific surface area of soil and therefore significantly affects af bf and cf parameters the t ratio and the p value obtained from the f test were used to identify the significant variables in the regression model the p value less than 0 05 indicates the variable is significant at a 95 confidence level the t ratio is a ratio of the departure of an estimated parameter from its notional value and its standard error a higher absolute value of the t ratio corresponds to a smaller p value table 3 presents the results of the f test which were obtained from the commercially available matlab software the parameters tmi pi u dry and 1 α had p values less than 0 05 and therefore are significant variables for the equilibrium suction prediction model for the sake of simplicity the parameter 1 α was not included and only tmi pi and u dry were used for model development the developed regression equation for equilibrium suction is expressed in eq 22 22 u e p f 1 135 0 0066 t m i 0 012 p i 0 55 u dry it is observed from eq 22 that equilibrium suction pf has a positive correlation with pi and u dry but follows a negative relationship with tmi fig 13 shows the plot of calculated versus predicted equilibrium suction using eq 22 the r2 value of 0 80 indicated that the developed regression model was capable of accurately predicting equilibrium suction 4 1 relationship between tmi and equilibrium suction the calculated equilibrium suction values for all map units were categorized based on american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto soil classes and plotted against corresponding tmi values obtained from fig 4 an exponential trend line was fitted for each case to express the relationship between u e and tmi the standard deviation σ of the scattered suction values from the trend line were also calculated and the results are presented in fig 14 it is evident from fig 14 that the equilibrium suction u e value decreased as tmi increased for all the soil types this trend was in agreement with eq 6 because a greater tmi value indicated a larger difference between precipitation p and evapotranspiration pe and therefore a larger amount of water being stored within the moisture active zone larger θe resulted in a smaller u e value furthermore the a 3 soil class had the shallowest slope while the a 7 6 soil class had the steepest slope in the tmi ue plot which was consistent with the fact that u e increased with increasing percentage of fine material the σ values provide a measure of the dispersion of the data from the fitted trend line in the tmi ue plots in fig 14 σ values ranged from 0 09 to 0 34 which was within the allowable limit compared to the total range of equilibrium suction values 4 2 relationship between fraction of vegetation cover fr and equilibrium suction the amount of surface vegetation is a factor that is not typically considered in the calculation of equilibrium suction however fpa 2017 documented that vegetation has a major influence on soil moisture content within the root zone to consider the effect of vegetation on the surface a vegetation cover map was generated in this study for the continental united states in the gis platform fig 7 the calculated equilibrium suction values for each map unit were plotted against the corresponding fr value obtained from fig 7 a logarithmic trend line was fitted for each tmi range to establish a relationship between u e and fr the results are presented in fig 15 fig 15 clearly indicates that the magnitude of equilibrium suction pf decreased as the vegetation cover increased this was consistent with the fact that an increase of surface vegetation increased the depth of moisture active zone z m which was attributed to higher volumetric water content at equilibrium and a smaller equilibrium suction value fig 15 also shows that the slope of the trend line was steepest for tmi 40 and shallowest for tmi 40 indicating that the impact of vegetation on u e was likely to be greater in humid areas having higher tmi values pti 2004 bulut and nevels 2018 the range of σ values 0 18 0 24 indicated that the proposed model was accurate for predicting the range of equilibrium values 5 summary and conclusions this study developed an improved prediction model of equilibrium suction for subgrade soils based on mechanistic principles the equilibrium suction contour map accompanying the model allows for a simple and accurate determination of a baseline equilibrium suction values at any given latitude and longitude within the continental united states the incorporation of this model in an analysis approach will allow for a more reliable estimation of critical parameters such as subgrade resilient modulus and vertical movement due to swelling and shrinking of expansive clays thereby improving the prediction of pavement performance the major contributions of this study were summarized as follows a gis based tmi contour map of the continental united states was developed using precipitation and temperature data collected from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate group the tmi values in the developed contour map showed good agreement with the original tmi map with an r2 value of 0 93 a mechanistic empirical model to determine equilibrium suction was developed in this study which was based on mitchell s steady state diffusivity equation and a functional relationship between tmi and mean annual moisture depth a gis based equilibrium suction contour map of the continental united states was generated by calculating the values for all map units using the developed mechanistic empirical approach therefore equilibrium suction value can be extracted at any geographic coordinate from this map a simplified regression model was developed to predict equilibrium suction from readily available and influential parameters such as tmi plasticity index and the dry suction value a parametric study was also conducted to evaluate the impact of tmi and vegetation on equilibrium suction for various soil classes and tmi ranges respectively equilibrium suction was plotted against tmi for all soil classes the aashto a 3 soil class had the shallowest slope and a 7 6 had the steepest one this was consistent with the fact that equilibrium suction values increased with increasing percentage of fine material similarly equilibrium suction versus fraction of vegetation were plotted at various tmi ranges and equilibrium suction decreased for all tmi ranges as surface vegetation increased however the steepest slope was observed for tmi 40 and shallowest for tmi 40 which indicated that the impact of vegetation on equilibrium suction was greater in humid areas having higher tmi values declaration of competing interest

6341,suction in subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction of the pavement the equilibrium suction has a direct influence on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil in the current mechanistic empirical pavement design guide equilibrium suction is determined based on the empirical relationship with water table depth however studies have shown that other critical factors also influence equilibrium suction in this study a new mechanistic empirical model is presented to predict equilibrium suction considering the effects of physical properties of the soil and climatic factors a simple regression model is also generated to predict the equilibrium suction from readily available parameters i e thornthwaite moisture index tmi plasticity index pi and dry suction value at surface u dry in the final section of this paper the effects of tmi and vegetation on equilibrium suction are evaluated for various soil classes and tmi ranges respectively a contour map of the equilibrium suction values for the entire continental united states has been generated using the geographic information system gis platform and followed by the model predictions keywords equilibrium suction thornthwaite moisture index geographic information system subgrade soil moisture active zone 1 introduction the pavement subgrade moisture condition is critical because it directly affects the strength and stiffness of pavement structure perera et al 2004 subgrade soils are usually unsaturated and the resilient modulus of the subgrade soil is highly dependent on the degree of saturation and the corresponding matric suction liang et al 2008 oloo et al 1998 wolfe and butalia 2004 khoury and zaman 2004 gu et al 2014 luo et al 2017 saha et al 2017 2018b zhang et al 2019 past studies showed that matric suction in the subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction aitchison and richards 1965 basma and ai suleiman 1991 hence accurate estimation of equilibrium suction underneath pavement structures is critical for determining the long term resilient modulus of subgrade soil which is further used to predict pavement performance an enhanced integrated climatic model eicm was implemented in the current aashtoware pavement me design to incorporate the climatic design inputs the eicm is a one dimensional heat and moisture flow program developed by the federal highway administration fhwa for predicting the moisture condition in subgrade soils the eicm used the depth to ground water table to compute moisture content and the corresponding suction in subgrade however this model would yield inaccurate suction values if the water table data is missing or the water table depth is greater than 7 m current studies demonstrated that many other factors affected the suction profile in addition to ground water table which included precipitation evapotranspiration field capacity etc russam and coleman 1961 coleman 1965 this study aimed to develop an improved prediction model of equilibrium suction which would take into account a variety of influence factors matric suction in soil reaches an equilibrium condition at a certain depth of the moisture active zone zm there are primarily two different approaches available to determine the equilibrium suction 1 correlation with a rational climatic index and 2 statistical model based on climatic factors and soil index properties a climatic index related to the soil environment is based on a process in which the potential for soil moisture exchange is determined by the frequency analysis of precipitation and evapotranspiration a number of climatic indices e g thornthwaite moisture index tmi thornthwaite 1948 and penman index penman 1963 were developed to correlate with various annual moisture balance indicators tmi was correlated with the depth of moisture active zone and equilibrium suction carpenter et al 1974 edris and lytton 1976 fityus et al 1998 lytton et al 2005 gay 1994 developed a relationship between mean annual moisture depth and tmi he used climatic data from 12 sites in texas to establish a relationship between tmi values and mean moisture depth the post tensioning institute pti 2004 and the australian standard as2870 2011 developed a correlation between the subgrade equilibrium suction and tmi however existing studies showed that suction beneath covered areas was dependent on both climatic factors and soil index properties russam and coleman 1961 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 zapata 1999 recently witczak et al 2006 proposed a statistical model for predicting equilibrium suction of subgrade soil based on p200 and wpi parameters where p200 is the percent of material passing no 200 0 075 mm sieve and wpi is the product of p200 and plasticity index pi these correlation models were developed by using a limited number of data sets that are highly variable to improve the prediction accuracy of equilibrium suction in a subgrade layer a mechanistic empirical approach was adopted in this study which involved the transient suction profile and soil water retention characteristics of soil as well as climatic factors a geographic information system gis is a platform to capture store manage and present all types of geographical data including equilibrium suction values through the gis database the users enable to input longitude and latitude of the specific location to extract the equilibrium suction value the gis database is also compatible with the current aashtoware pavement me design program which facilitates the determination of stiffness variation of subgrade soils the primary objective of this paper was to introduce a method to predict equilibrium suction from tmi and pi the following section described the generation of the tmi contour map in a gis platform this contour map provided the required input for determining the equilibrium suction of subgrade soil by utilizing a mechanistic empirical approach a contour map of equilibrium suction was plotted for the continental u s in the following a regression model was developed to predict equilibrium suction using tmi and pi subsequently a parametric study was described to evaluate the effect of soil class and vegetation on equilibrium suction the concluding section summarized the significant findings of this study 2 development of a gis based contour map of tmi tmi is a moisture index that reflects climate and soil humidity thornthwaite 1948 this index is calculated using soil moisture balance in terms of rainfall potential evapotranspiration and the depth of available moisture balance stored in the rooting zone of vegetation at a particular site fig 1 shows the tmi contour map of the united states originally developed by thornthwaite 1948 although many other methods were proposed to determine the tmi values in the past decades the original contour map was still widely used in many studies due to its simplicity and reliability chan and mostyn 2009 fox 2002 mitchell 2013 jewell and mitchell 2009 mckeen and johnson 1990 fityus et al 1998 er and rifat 2014 li and sun 2015 karunarathne et al 2016 however the regeneration of the original tmi map in gis platform is difficult because of the missing historical water storage data on a yearly basis olaiz et al 2018 performed a comparison study of the four different tmi calculation processes developed from 1948 to 2006 and concluded that the model developed by witczak et al 2006 matched closely with the original tmi calculation process accordingly this study adopted witczak s model to calculate the tmi value of the continental united states a detailed description of the process to develop the tmi map in the gis platform is presented as follows in this study a gis based tmi contour map was generated based on the precipitation and temperature metadata file the spatial metadata files were collected from prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate mapping system daly et al 1994 2002 2008 at oregon state university the prism mapping system was developed based on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate database which includes in situ measurements of temperature and precipitation from 5852 weather stations across the continental united states prism uses a weighted regression scheme to account for complex climate regimes associated with orography rain shadows temperature inversions slope aspect coastal proximity and other factors and depicts climatological normal from 1981 to 2010 at 30 arcsec 800 m resolution fig 2 shows the annual average precipitation p and temperature contour map of the united states in the gis platform the potential evapotranspiration was calculated using monthly average temperature ti for the specific site wilm et al 1944 an annual heat index hy was determined using eq 1 1 h y i 1 12 0 2 t i 1 54 the monthly potential evapotranspiration was quantified using eq 2 2 p e i 1 6 10 t i h y a where p e i is the potential evapotranspiration in the ith month and a 6 75 10 7 h y 3 7 71 10 5 h y 2 0 01792 h y 0 49239 the p e i value represents potential evapotranspiration over a period of 30 day with 12 hour daylight duration the effect of daily variations in daylight on monthly potential evapotranspiration were determined based on a correction factor di introduced by mckeen and johnson 1990 the corrected potential evapotranspiration was obtained using eq 3 3 p e i p e i d i n i 30 where p e i is the monthly corrected potential evapotranspiration unit cm di is the daylight correction factor for each month unit hrs n i is the number of days in the given month the average annual potential evapotranspiration p e y was calculated by summing p e i over a 12 month period as shown in eq 4 4 p e y i 1 12 p e i fig 3 depicts the calculated p e y map of continental united states on the gis platform finally the tmi value is calculated using eq 5 witczak et al 2006 and plotted in fig 4 5 tmi 75 p p e y 1 10 this study collected the tmi values at the specific locations from the original tmi map which are listed in table 1 snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 wray 1989 jayatilaka et al 1992 fig 5 compares the tmi values from the original map table 1 and the contour map fig 4 developed in this study using arcgis software tmi values were extracted from the developed map at the specific geographic coordinates shown in table 1 a statistical analysis was performed to determine the coefficient of determination r2 associated with the tmi values from original and developed contour maps this correlation resulted in an r2 value of 0 93 indicating that the developed tmi contour map was in good agreement with the original map the next section describes a mechanistic empirical approach used to determine equilibrium suction of the soil using the developed tmi map for a specific location to relate the tmi value with the soil properties the total map area of the continental united states was divided into 74 400 map units the map units define the map areas identified in the soil survey geographic ssurgo database that was developed by the national cooperative soil survey these areas were identified based on the soil type and other components that have unique properties interpretations and productivity the zonal distribution toolbar in arcgis software was used to calculate the average tmi value of each map unit 3 development of a mechanistic empirical model to determine equilibrium suction a mechanistic empirical method was developed to determine equilibrium suction which involved a steady state diffusion equation proposed by mitchell mitchell 1979 and a functional relationship between tmi and annual average moisture depth established by gay 1994 mitchell 1979 expressed matric suction at a depth z in the soil profile by solving a two dimensional diffusion equation with surface boundaries subject to suction change shown in eq 6 6 u z u e u 0 e π n α z where u z is the suction at depth z expressed on the pf scale u e is the equilibrium value of

suction at the surface corresponding to an air dry state and soil field capacity respectively the terms u dry z m and u wet z m denote the suction in dry and wet profiles respectively at a depth of zm the term u dry is assumed to be 4 5 pf water pressure at 104 5 cm 3 10 103 kpa and 5 7 pf water pressure at 105 7 cm 4 92 104 kpa for vegetation and non vegetation areas respectively whereas u wet

surface zm is at least two feet 60 9 cm deeper than the deepest vegetation root observed in the soil fpa 2017 however when there is no vegetation in the surface zm is the depth of desiccation several experimental studies were performed by fpa 2017 and lytton et al 1997 and the average depths of zm in non vegetation and fully vegetation area were estimated to be 9 39 feet 286 2 cm and 21 feet 640 1 cm respectively it is observed that the depth of zm is dependent on the amount of vegetation on the surface to accurately determine the depth of zm a vegetation cover map of continental united states is presented in the following section 3 1 calculation of the fraction of vegetation cover noaa climate data records cdr provide historical climate information using data from weather satellites normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data were collected from this dataset which was derived from surface reflectance data acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor this long term record spans from 1981 to 2013 and utilizes avhrr data from six noaa polar orbiting satellites ndvi data were collected in georeferenced tagged image file format geotiff with embedded geographic information for gis applications the method proposed by brunsell and gillies 2003 was used in this study to obtain the fraction of vegetation cover from ndvi the method scaled the ndvi to obtain the fraction of vegetation cover fr between bare soil and a full canopy and was expressed in eqs 7 and 8 7 n ndvi n d v i 0 ndv i max n d v i 0 8 f r n 2 where ndvi0 is the bare soil ndvi value set as 2000 and ndvimax is the maximum ndvi corresponding to full cover dense vegetation set as 10000 fig 7 shows the fr map for the continental united states calculated using the raster calculator function in arcgis the zm value for specific sites were then determined by linearly interpolating fr between the average zm of bare soil 286 2 cm and full cover vegetation 640 1 cm the calculated zm values were used to determine the maximum available moisture depth and thereby establish a relationship between maximum available moisture depth and the mean moisture depth 3 2 calculation of maximum available annual moisture depth dam maximum available annual moisture depth dam represents the maximum depth of moisture that is lost from soil during a transition from the wet state to the dry state at the root potential of resident vegetation it is determined by the area of volumetric water content profile between dry and wet states fig 8 illustrates the volumetric water content θ profile where total moisture is stored between θ dry and θ wet herein u dry z m and u wet z m are calculated using eq 6 when u e equals 3 0 pf water pressure at 103 cm 98 kpa the unsaturated diffusivity coefficient

α k sat θ w log h saturated soil water permeability ksat was collected for all map units from the natural resource conservation service nrcs database the expression for θ w log h in eq 9 is presented in appendix a the value of n was assumed to be 1 0 cycle per year for all sites the terms θ dry θ wet θ dry and θ wet were calculated using the swcc for a particular site the fredlund xing equation was used to estimate the relationship between matric suction and volumetric water content as shown in eqs 10 and 11 fredlund and xing 1994 10 θ w c h x θ sat l n e h a f b f c f where h represents matric suction in units of cm of water pressure and c h is a correction factor defined as 11 c h 1 ln 1 h h r ln 1 1 021 x 10 7 h r the four fitting parameters i e af bf cf and hr in eqs 10 and 11 were predicted using the artificial neural network ann model developed by saha et al 2018a soil physical properties such as gradation atterberg limits saturated volumetric water content θ sat and mean annual air temperature were used as input parameters and the fitting parameters are obtained as output finally dam can be expressed as the sum of areas abc and bcde in fig 8 or according to eqs 12 and 13 12 d am 0 z m θ wet z θ dry z 13 d am θ dry θ dry n π α 1 e n π α z m θ wet θ dry z m in the moisture balance process the moisture depth or soil moisture storage reaches an equilibrium condition which is denoted as the mean annual moisture depth dm the relationship between dam and dm will be described in the next section 3 3 relationship between mean annual moisture depth d m and maximum available annual moisture depth d am the mean annual moisture depth dm is not only dependent on water retention and diffusivity characteristics of soil but is also affected by climatic factors as discussed earlier tmi is an indicator of annual moisture balance of a specified location based on precipitation evaporation and runoff in this study gay s approach gay 1994 was adopted to incorporate climatic factors in addition to soil characteristics to estimate moisture depth at equilibrium he computed equilibrium moisture depth from the input of tmi annual precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe and the depth of maximum available moisture dam when tmi the difference between p and pe was positive water would be added to the annual moisture storage up to a maximum value of d am if tmi was negative soil moisture loss would occur and be subtracted from storage up to a minimum value of zero gay 1994 collected climatic data from 12 sites and developed the relationship between dm and tmi in order to fit a rational function between tmi and dm it is necessary to establish the limits of the function the dependent variable dm logically has a maximum possible value of d am and a minimum value of zero to establish the limits of the assumed independent variable tmi eq 6 was examined it is deduced from eq 6 that the minimum value of tmi occurs if there is no precipitation for the entire year under this circumstance the minimum value or lower bound of the tmi would be equal to 65 while the upper bound of tmi theoretically goes to infinity to establish the relationship between tmi and dm juarez badillo s approach was applied in this study juarez badillo 1975 the functional domains for the variables are shown in fig 9 the real domain for t tmi 65 and moisture depth d are 0 and 0 dam respectively the real domain for variable d is incomplete and therefore a function of f d is needed that is similar i e increasing in the same direction to the real domain of variable t likewise the formulation of volume by juarez badillo 1981 the following function represents the simplified function form for d that satisfies these boundary conditions 14 f d 1 d am d m 1 d am assuming a linear rate of change between f d and t and integrating them within the limits of the domains shown in fig 9 the final expression for dm is obtained in eq 17 the relationship between f d and t is established as 15 γ dt t df d f d where γ is a non dimensional parameter of proportionality introducing eq 14 into eq 15 and integrating between the limits of f d and t 16 γ ln t t 1 ln 1 d am d m 1 d am 1 d am d 1 1 d am 17 d m d am 1 d am d 1 d 1 t t 1 γ the parameters γ t1 and d1 were regressed against the measured values of the depth of mean annual moisture dm for 17 locations snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 and jayatilaka et al 1992 the resulting expressions of γ d1 and t1 are given by eqs 18 through 20 18 γ 0 0369 d am 19 d 1 0 269 d am 20 t 1 0 8418 d am equilibrium suction was then calculated using the dm value at each location which included the regression parameters eq 21 was used to calculate equilibrium suction a graphical illustration of this equation is shown in the appendix b 21 θ dry θ dry n π α 1 e n π α z m θ e θ dry z m d m to validate the prediction accuracy of the regression parameters a new set of measured suction data at equilibrium were collected from the literature snethen et al 1977 mckeen 1981 jayatilaka et el 1992 these were compared against the calculated equilibrium suction values and plotted in fig 10 the predicted suction values showed good agreement with the measure values hence these relationships facilitate the calculation of equilibrium suction for all map units in the united states equilibrium

process an empirical relationship was established to predict the equilibrium suction for various soil types from the tmi value this relationship and its development is presented in the next section 4 development of prediction models for equilibrium suction a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the significant parameters that are correlated with equilibrium suction the soil and climatic parameters used in the regression model were tmi pi u dry zm fr 1 α θ sat af bf and cf these parameters were selected from the developed equilibrium suction equation presented in eq 21 and the linear relationship between dam and dm expressed in eq 17 the parameters u dry α zm and fr are the independent variables that play significant role in the formulation of equilibrium suction model the relationship between volumetric water content θ and the soil suction u as shown in eqs 10 and 11 is dependent on four fitting parameters af bf cf and hr and saturated volumetric water content θ sat zapata et al 2003 demonstrated that soil suction of plastic soil is proportional to its specific surface area the pi is a simple indicator that reflects the specific surface area of soil and therefore significantly affects af bf and cf parameters the t ratio and the p value obtained from the f test were used to identify the significant variables in the regression model the p value less than 0 05 indicates the variable is significant at a 95 confidence level the t ratio is a ratio of the departure of an estimated parameter from its notional value and its standard error a higher absolute value of the t ratio corresponds to a smaller p value table 3 presents the results of the f test which were obtained from the commercially available matlab software the parameters tmi pi u dry and 1 α had p values less than 0 05 and therefore are significant variables for the equilibrium suction prediction model for the sake of simplicity the parameter 1 α was not included and only tmi pi and u dry were used for model development the developed regression equation for equilibrium suction is expressed in eq 22 22 u e p f 1 135 0 0066 t m i 0 012 p i 0 55 u dry it is observed from eq 22 that equilibrium suction pf has a positive correlation with pi and u dry but follows a negative relationship with tmi fig 13 shows the plot of calculated versus predicted equilibrium suction using eq 22 the r2 value of 0 80 indicated that the developed regression model was capable of accurately predicting equilibrium suction 4 1 relationship between tmi and equilibrium suction the calculated equilibrium suction values for all map units were categorized based on american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto soil classes and plotted against corresponding tmi values obtained from fig 4 an exponential trend line was fitted for each case to express the relationship between u e and tmi the standard deviation σ of the scattered suction values from the trend line were also calculated and the results are presented in fig 14 it is evident from fig 14 that the equilibrium suction u e value decreased as tmi increased for all the soil types this trend was in agreement with eq 6 because a greater tmi value indicated a larger difference between precipitation p and evapotranspiration pe and therefore a larger amount of water being stored within the moisture active zone larger θe resulted in a smaller u e value furthermore the a 3 soil class had the shallowest slope while the a 7 6 soil class had the steepest slope in the tmi ue plot which was consistent with the fact that u e increased with increasing percentage of fine material the σ values provide a measure of the dispersion of the data from the fitted trend line in the tmi ue plots in fig 14 σ values ranged from 0 09 to 0 34 which was within the allowable limit compared to the total range of equilibrium suction values 4 2 relationship between fraction of vegetation cover fr and equilibrium suction the amount of surface vegetation is a factor that is not typically considered in the calculation of equilibrium suction however fpa 2017 documented that vegetation has a major influence on soil moisture content within the root zone to consider the effect of vegetation on the surface a vegetation cover map was generated in this study for the continental united states in the gis platform fig 7 the calculated equilibrium suction values for each map unit were plotted against the corresponding fr value obtained from fig 7 a logarithmic trend line was fitted for each tmi range to establish a relationship between u e and fr the results are presented in fig 15 fig 15 clearly indicates that the magnitude of equilibrium suction pf decreased as the vegetation cover increased this was consistent with the fact that an increase of surface vegetation increased the depth of moisture active zone z m which was attributed to higher volumetric water content at equilibrium and a smaller equilibrium suction value fig 15 also shows that the slope of the trend line was steepest for tmi 40 and shallowest for tmi 40 indicating that the impact of vegetation on u e was likely to be greater in humid areas having higher tmi values pti 2004 bulut and nevels 2018 the range of σ values 0 18 0 24 indicated that the proposed model was accurate for predicting the range of equilibrium values 5 summary and conclusions this study developed an improved prediction model of equilibrium suction for subgrade soils based on mechanistic principles the equilibrium suction contour map accompanying the model allows for a simple and accurate determination of a baseline equilibrium suction values at any given latitude and longitude within the continental united states the incorporation of this model in an analysis approach will allow for a more reliable estimation of critical parameters such as subgrade resilient modulus and vertical movement due to swelling and shrinking of expansive clays thereby improving the prediction of pavement performance the major contributions of this study were summarized as follows a gis based tmi contour map of the continental united states was developed using precipitation and temperature data collected from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate group the tmi values in the developed contour map showed good agreement with the original tmi map with an r2 value of 0 93 a mechanistic empirical model to determine equilibrium suction was developed in this study which was based on mitchell s steady state diffusivity equation and a functional relationship between tmi and mean annual moisture depth a gis based equilibrium suction contour map of the continental united states was generated by calculating the values for all map units using the developed mechanistic empirical approach therefore equilibrium suction value can be extracted at any geographic coordinate from this map a simplified regression model was developed to predict equilibrium suction from readily available and influential parameters such as tmi plasticity index and the dry suction value a parametric study was also conducted to evaluate the impact of tmi and vegetation on equilibrium suction for various soil classes and tmi ranges respectively equilibrium suction was plotted against tmi for all soil classes the aashto a 3 soil class had the shallowest slope and a 7 6 had the steepest one this was consistent with the fact that equilibrium suction values increased with increasing percentage of fine material similarly equilibrium suction versus fraction of vegetation were plotted at various tmi ranges and equilibrium suction decreased for all tmi ranges as surface vegetation increased however the steepest slope was observed for tmi 40 and shallowest for tmi 40 which indicated that the impact of vegetation on equilibrium suction was greater in humid areas having higher tmi values declaration of competing interest

6342,due to shallow groundwater tables and easy water availability many people live in coastal areas additionally alluvial sediments from fluviatile and marine deposits are highly suitable for agricultural use making coastal settlement even more desirable however groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from widespread application of fertilizers creates difficulties for water management officials cut off walls are used to control seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers however until now the effect of cut off walls on the nitrate contamination of groundwater has been largely unknown in this paper the first investigation of the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater is discussed two sets of laboratory experiments one with and one without a subsurface cut off wall were performed to validate the effectiveness of the constructed numerical model the effects of the subsurface cut off wall height distance between the subsurface cut off wall and the saltwater boundary and infiltration rates on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater were analyzed results showed that after the construction of the subsurface cut off wall the domain mean velocity decreased the migration of nitrate pollutants to the saltwater boundary was reduced and the nitrate contaminated area expanded further the morphology of the nitrate pollution plumes changed an indentation appeared directly above the subsurface cut off wall the widths of the transition zones increased significantly and the transition zones became more diffuse as one approached the saltwater wedge three indices were developed to quantify the degree of nitrate contamination the relative height of the subsurface cut off wall h and the nitrate infiltration rate ni were the two most significant factors determining the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater near the subsurface cut off wall therefore we suggest that subsurface cut off walls be designed such that their height lies below an experimentally determined critical height thus reducing the infiltration rate of the contaminants produced during fertilization through water saving irrigation

attention hu et al 2017 rodriguez galiano et al 2018 wang et al 2018 excess nitrates in the human body are reduced to toxic nitrite and further converted to nitrosamines which pose a significant threat to human health davidson et al 2017 rojas fabro et al 2015 therefore the who and some countries have established drinking water standards limiting the maximum concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n to 10 11 3 mg l radfard et al 2018 since the 1960 s a high degree of nitrate pollution in groundwater has been reported globally in the united states burow et al 2010 conducted a series of statistical analyses on the no3 n content in 5101 wells nationwide and found that the no3 n content in 427 wells exceeded 10 mg l kringel et al 2016 analyzed 37 groundwater sources in central africa and found that the average no3 n concentration was 60 mg l with the highest concentration reaching 150 mg l in china the average no3 n concentration in the groundwaters of the seven provinces surrounding the bohai sea reached 11 9 mg l with about 34 1 of the groundwater samples exceeding the established limit lu et al 2019 zhang et al 1996 with the economic development of human society and population growth the degree of coastal groundwater exploitation has significantly increased bosello and de cian 2014 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2016 leading to a decrease in underground water levels and an increase in seawater intrusion si bosello and de cian 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 singh 2015 different engineering approaches have been adopted to alleviate and eventually prevent si such as pumping hydraulic barriers water injection barriers artificial recharge and cut off walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a ahmed 2017 allow 2012 botero acosta and donado 2015 hussain et al 2015 cut off walls can be further categorized into full section cut off walls subsurface cut off walls and suspended cut off walls abdoulhalik et al 2017 among these the subsurface cut off wall is the most common type used in engineering abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b luyun et al 2009 the subsurface cut off wall is embedded into the impervious bottom layer of an aquifer an opening at the top of the aquifer blocks the saltwater and allows inland freshwater discharge to the ocean abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b allow 2012 the effectiveness of subsurface cut off walls against si has been widely investigated ishida et al 2003 kaleris and ziogas 2013 luyun et al 2009 however few studies have been concerned with the influence of subsurface cut off walls on the groundwater flow field and groundwater pollution in coastal areas with agricultural and animal husbandry land nitrate is the pollutant found in the highest concentrations in groundwater du et al 2011 rajmohan et al 2009 van den brink et al 2007 many investigations of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers have been conducted via laboratory experiments zhang et al 2002 2001 and numerical simulations shammas and thunvik 2009 volker et al 2002 xin et al 2019 these investigations indicate that the contaminant transport processes are significantly influenced by variable density flow sea level rise aquifer heterogeneity and stratigraphy density of the contaminant and tidal oscillations however the number of investigations of nitrate migration in coastal aquifers under the effect of the subsurface cut off wall is insufficient yoshimoto et al 2013 found that the average concentrations of no3 n in groundwater were below 10 mg l before the construction of a cut off wall and the concentration reached 10 mg l after the cut off wall construction they developed a numerical model that estimated that the no3 n concentration would continue to rise by 0 79 1 46 mg l over the following 100 years lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 found that the construction of a subsurface cut off wall affected the groundwater level upstream of the wall by 4 km but the no3 n concentration did not change significantly kang and xu 2017 monitored the nitrate concentrations of the groundwater upstream and downstream of a subsurface cut off wall and found that the average nitrate concentration in the groundwater upstream was 9 92 mg l which was much higher than the 0 76 mg l measured downstream overall the previous studies have found that the construction of a subsurface cut off wall influences the water level and nitrate concentration in the groundwater upstream of the cut off wall however the spatial distribution of the nitrate concentration in the presence of a cut off wall has not been considered and the effects of a subsurface cut off wall on the prevention of si and nitrate contamination have not been quantitatively evaluated further the effect of a subsurface cut off wall on inland pollution and si has not been explored hence in our study we 1 investigate the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on the flow field nitrate distribution and seawater distribution in an unconfined coastal aquifer 2 evaluate the effects of the cut off wall height distance between the cut off wall and the saltwater boundary and nitrate infiltration rates on groundwater nitrate contamination 3 propose a new optimized construction scheme for cut off walls that can control si and reduce the nitrate contamination in groundwater a variable density flow and transport model feflow 7 0 is applied to investigate nitrate migration and distribution in an unconfined coastal aquifer two sets of laboratory experiments with and without a cut off wall were performed to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model the validated model was then used to predict the degree of nitrate contamination under various conditions 2 experimental methods 2 1 description of the experimental set up the laboratory seepage device included a seepage chamber a salt freshwater level control system described below and a pollution source simulation system fig 1 the dimensions of the central seepage chamber were 1 00 m 0 60 m 0 10 m and the freshwater and saltwater chambers were located on either side of the chamber two hard perforated plastic plates with a metal screen on each surface were inserted between the seepage chamber and the water chambers to prevent the artificial aquifer medium from flowing out of the seepage chamber two submersible pumps were connected to the inlet holes through silicone hoses to feed the system with water and the outflow holes were connected with silicone hoses to discharge water to maintain constant freshwater and saltwater levels in this way the salt freshwater water level control system was constructed the pollution source simulation system consisted of two nitrate solution distribution pipes and two peristaltic pumps kcp c kamoer the distribution pipes were made of rigid plastic pipe diameter 1 cm length 20 cm closed at the end and into each pipe ten uniformly distributed holes were drilled bore diameter of 1 5 mm spacing interval of 2 cm the pipes were embedded in the surface of the seepage chamber beside each other and the peristaltic pump controlled the water input and the nitrate infiltration rate 2 2 experiment materials white quartz sand with an effective particle size of 0 5 1 2 mm was used as the aquifer medium the water samples used were freshwater saltwater and a pollutant solution freshwater used in the experiment was taken directly from the tap in the laboratory saltwater was prepared by dissolving commercial sodium chloride and red food dye in tap water to obtain concentrations of 36 16 g l and 1 5 g l respectively the pollutant solution was prepared by dissolving kno3 in distilled water to a kno3 concentration of 0 725 g l resulting in a no3 n concentration of 100 mg l the prepared solutions were stored in three 75 l plastic buckets a 0 01 m thick rigid foam plastic was used as the material for the cut off wall 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments included a control which did not have a subsurface cut off wall and a lab scale model which did a summary of the experimental parameters is presented in table 1 the experimental results were compared with the numerical model to validate the effectiveness of the model setup first the seepage chamber was filled with layers of quartz sand each layer was saturated with water and compacted next nine needles were inserted into the positions corresponding to each observation point shown in fig 1 the densities of the kno3 and nacl solutions were measured by a densitometer da 300wg dahometer to be 1025 g l and 1004 g l respectively the hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on darcy s law under the constant head condition and found to be 300 m d the experiments were carried out successively in the first experiment si conditions without the cut off wall were assumed in the following experiment si conditions and the presence of the subsurface cut off wall were assumed at the start of each experiment freshwater was injected saturating the entire porous medium with freshwater next the submersible pump in the saltwater bucket was activated to feed the system with saltwater and promote seawater intrusion when the saltwater level was stable at 41 60 cm the two peristaltic pumps responsible for the nitrate pollution were activated and the flow rate of each pump was adjusted to 0 96 m3 h in the experiments without a cut off wall when the displacement of the saltwater wedge sw fell below 0 5 cm over 1 h a steady state was considered to have been reached the length of the sw was recorded and water samples were withdrawn from the nine observation points in the experiment with a subsurface cut off wall the water samples from the nine observation points were extracted every 30 min when the no3 n concentrations at all observation points remained constant a steady state was considered to have been reached and the experiment was terminated the no3 n concentrations in the water samples were measured using a spectrophotometer unico uv2800a hu et al 2017 the experimental results are compared to the numerical results below 3 numerical model 3 1 model conceptualization a vertical cross section of the groundwater flow and nitrate pollution plume contained by

constant nitrate concentration c 1s and variable nitrate infiltration rate ni m d across the top boundary are denoted by x1 and x2 respectively the remaining part of the top boundary гu and the bottom boundary гb are impervious to water and solutes the thickness of the aquifer is denoted by d the height of the subsurface cut off wall is h and its distance from гs is denoted by d for the sake of simplicity the denitrification process is not considered because this process does not occur on the laboratory scale 3 2 mathematical methods we model the density dependent flow and mass transport processes by considering a cross section of a coastal aquifer using the convective forms of the transport equations neglecting the forchheimer and brinkman effects the momentum balance is governed by the darcy equation in the form q k h χ e as we operated the experiments under constant controlled temperature conditions we can neglect the influence of temperature on buoyancy and assume that it only

feflow diersch 2013 3 3 model setup feflow 7 0 software has been widely used to solve variable density mass transport problems diersch 2013 and we used it to study the influence of the subsurface cut off wall on the distribution and degree of nitrate pollutants in groundwater over time the domain 1 00 m 0 40 m was discretized using the advancing front method into 16 960 triangular finite element cells the diameter of each element was 0 94 cm and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values were set to 0 001 m and 0 0001 m respectively which are within the range of the dispersivity values presented by abarca and prabhakar clement 2009 the elements in the area occupied by the cut off wall were considered to be inactive the fully implicit forward euler backward euler fe be method was used for simulation time control with the time step size set to 0 001 d and the initial time step length set to 1 10 8 d the full upwinding method was used in the model the density dependent flow transport equations led to symmetric and non symmetric matrices preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg was used to solve the symmetric linear system and preconditioned and post conditioned bicgstab was used to solve the non symmetric linear system the picard iteration scheme was used for solving the nonlinear system the values of the parameters in the numerical models were consistent with the experimental parameters which can be found in table 1 ni was set to 2 3 m d and a kno3 concentration of 725 mg l led to a no3 n concentration of 100 mg l the hydraulic conductivity was set to 300 m d nine observation points that were consistent with the positions of the experimental observation points were chosen 3 4 model validation a plot of the experimental versus the simulated no3 n concentrations at the 9 observation points in steady state is presented in fig 3 it is evident that the simulated and observed no3 n concentrations exhibited good correlation with a root mean square error of 1 0152 mg l the simulated length of the sw 50 6 cm and the experimental length of the sw 50 0 cm agreed well fig 4 contains a plot of the experimental and simulated no3 n concentrations over time at selected observation points for the scenario with the subsurface cut off wall observation points 1 2 4 and 7 did not exhibit nitrate accumulation observation point 9 was discarded because the process of sand excavation and refilling disturbed the in situ state thus making the experimental result inaccurate at the other four observation points 3 5 6 8 the experimental and simulated no3 n concentrations agreed well with an average significant correlation coefficient r2 of 0 92253 indicating that the feflow model can be successfully used to simulate nitrate migration and contamination in a coastal aquifer 3 5 simulation procedure in total four sets of 32 simulations were performed using the validated model to investigate the degree of nitrate contamination in the groundwater after the construction of the subsurface cut off wall in the first set of simulations two groups were considered those with and those without the subsurface cut off wall in the former group the relative heights of the subsurface cut off wall h equaled 62 5 of the thickness of aquifer and the relative distances between the cut off wall and the saltwater boundary d were 30 the nitrate infiltration rate ni for both groups was 2 3 m d in the second set of simulations cases with 10 different h values and the same d and ni values as above were considered in the third set of simulations cases with 9 different d values an h of 50 and the same ni as above were considered the fourth set of simulation included cases with 11 different ni values an h of 50 and a d of 30 other parameters used in the simulations were the same in all sets and are presented in table 1 the influence of the subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater was evaluated within each of the four sets of simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation methods hu et al 2005 used the indicator kriging method with a semivariogram model to assess nitrate contamination in groundwater using a threshold of 20 mg l no3 n to filter the raw data the spatial distribution range of nitrate is a common index used to evaluate the degree of nitrate contamination chen et al 2010 srivastava and ramanathan 2018 in this study a no3 n concentration of 10 mg l was used as the threshold which is within established drinking water standards no3 n to 10 11 3 mg l established by the who and many countries radfard et al 2018 the area enclosed by the 10 mg l concentration contour and the upper boundary was defined as the nitrate contamination area three pollution evaluation indexes were proposed the maximum depth of the contamination zone nd m fig 2 the nitrate contaminated area ns m2 fig 2 and the total dissolved kno3 mass in ω ng g some of the indices and variables were transformed to dimensionless form nd nd d the relative maximum nitrate pollution depth ns ns s the relative nitrate contaminated area s is the area of the domain which equals l d h h d the relative height of the subsurface cut off wall d d l the relative distance between the subsurface cut off wall and гs 4 2 influences of si and the subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination 4 2 1 nitrate contamination under the condition of si without the subsurface cut off wall the nitrate solution and saltwater have different densities and exist simultaneously in the domain to better understand the distribution of the nitrate pollutant the flow fields before and after the construction of the cut off wall were analyzed fig 5 a shows the flow field under the condition of si a low velocity zone 1 m d formed in the region occupied by the sw because the velocity inside the sw region was slow compared to the surface velocity chang and clement 2013 there was saltwater circulation within the sw region smith 2004 and a vertical flow component formed on the interface that carries the mass upward against the vertical gravitational force post et al 2007 the vertical flow component combined with the horizontal velocity component making the freshwater and mass migrate along the interface of the sw region as the height of the sw region increased and its boundary migrated towards the discharge zone the flow velocity accelerated fig 5a the maximum flow rate with a value of 18 95 m d appeared near the discharge zone and the mean velocity of the domain was 2 24 m d in the steady state a semi elliptic nitrate pollution plume fig 5c was formed in the upper portion of the aquifer nd and ns were 52 50 and 33 82 respectively the no3 n concentration was the highest greater than90 mg l around the nitrate infiltration zone and a narrow transition zone was formed at the edge of the plume zhang et al 2002 found that density was the main factor that influenced the shape of the pollution plume when it was low the contaminated zone was mainly concentrated in the upper portion of the aquifer with a relatively sharp outline this is consistent with our observations that the boundary of the nitrate contamination plume was very sharp we also observed that the pollution plume was contained in the upper portion of the aquifer because the density of the kno3 solution used was only 1 004 g cm3 4 2 2 nitrate contamination with the use of a subsurface cut off wall fig 5b shows the flow field patterns after construction of the subsurface cut off wall h 62 5 d 30 the sw was completely blocked outside the cut off wall the low velocity area on the left side of the cut off wall disappeared and a small high velocity zone formed directly above the cut off wall a fan shaped zone characterized by increasing velocity formed around the discharge zone the area of the low velocity 1 m d 2 m d zone on the left side of the cut off wall enlarged and the mean velocity decreased to 1 93 m d the nitrate migration ability decreased with the decrease in mean velocity which cause the nitrate contaminated area to expand and nd and ns to increase to 54 68 and 34 58 respectively the no3 n average concentration in the upstream aquifer increased from 24 23 mg l to 25 25 mg l a similar trend was reported in yoshimoto et al 2013 due to the action of the high velocity flow above the cut off wall the pollution plume became concave the width of the nitrate transition zone increased significantly and the nitrate pollution plume became more diffuse where it approached the saltwater interface fig 5d the latter observation is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2002 who reported that the front of the plume always becomes more diffuse as it approaches the saltwater interface 4 3 influence of subsurface cut off wall height on nitrate contamination the change in h significantly impacted the dimensions of the nitrate contaminated area see below but it did not cause a notable change in the seawater contaminated area fig 6 when h was 50 fig 6a and 60 fig 6b the nitrate pollution plumes were mainly concentrated in the upper portion of the aquifer the transition zones were narrow and the total mass of dissolved kno3 ng hardly changed fig 7 as h was increased to 80 fig 6c the nitrate contaminated area expanded and ng increased to 33 23 g the thickness of the low concentration transition zone above the saltwater region increased noticeably when h was further increased to 90 fig 6d nd ns and ng substantially increased to 81 50 55 95 and 45 25 g respectively in this case the aquifer was severely contaminated by nitrate the curve of the change in the mean velocity in the domain with h was parabolic concave down fig 8 which means that the velocity decreased as the cut off wall height increased wu et al 2016 found that this crossing velocity was the major factor affecting the extent of nitrate migration in saturated zones and that the vertical pollution depth increased with decreased crossing velocity when the cut off wall was tall the flow velocity rapidly decreased which ultimately led to a rapid increase in nd and ns in the aquifer fig 9 as h increased when h was lower than 65 nd and ns increased slowly as h increased with ns increasing by 0 94 on average for a 10 00 increase in h nd and ns began to increase more rapidly with respect to an increase in h starting at h 0 65 in the region 0 65 h 0 8 ns increased by 7 20 on average for a 10 00 increase in h however when h was higher than 80 nd and ns increased rapidly with respect to an increase in h with ns increasing by 13 98 on average for a 10 00 increase in h we thus denoted h 0 8 i e the height of the cut off wall when it is equal to 80 of the thickness of the aquifer as the critical height we conclude that cut off walls should be designed to be less than or equal to the critical height in order limit the nitrate contaminated area in groundwater aquifers 4 4 influence of the distance between the subsurface cut off wall and the saltwater boundary on nitrate contamination change in the relative distance between the subsurface cut off wall and гs d had little impact on the distribution of the nitrate pollutant but influenced the saltwater contaminated area significantly specifically the saltwater intruded further with increasing d fig 10 when d was increased from 15 to 35 ng hardly changed fig 11 and ns decreased very slightly fig 12 nd tended to decrease with increases in d because the concave configuration maintained a fixed distance from the cut off wall as the distance between the cut off wall and nd decreased nd decreased overall the changes in d had little impact on the distribution of the nitrate pollutant we note that the closer the cut off wall was to the saltwater boundary the taller the cut off wall needed to be to maintain its effectiveness in controlling si this increased ns indirectly therefore we suggest that cut off walls be constructed at positions such that the lowest possible cut off wall height that can still control si be less than or equal to the critical height in this way the dual purposes of controlling si and reducing nitrate contamination can be achieved simultaneously 4 5 influence of infiltration rate on nitrate contamination with subsurface cut off wall fig 13 shows the influence of ni on the distribution of nitrate and saltwater in steady state the changes in ni had little effect on the saltwater contaminated area when ni was low the nitrate pollution plume was distributed along the upper portion of the aquifer in an elongated ellipse fig 13a as ni 2 78 m d increased from 1 38 m d to 2 3 m d ng increased from 16 18 g to 21 79 g fig 14 with a 10 increase in ni leading to a 10 67 increase in ng with an increase in the infiltration rate the depth to which the nitrate pollution reached increased noticeably when the nitrate infiltration rates were 3 45 m d fig 13c and 3 68 m d ng values were 45 01 g and 49 71 g respectively for a 10 increase in ni ng increased by 15 66 on average ng increases were more rapid with respect to increases in ni when the latter value was more than 2 76 m d in all cases the nitrate contaminated area expanded to the upstream aquifer as can be seen from fig 15 the infiltration rate played a decisive role in the vertical migration of the nitrate pollutant nd increased linearly with respect to increases in ni with every 10 increase in ni leading to an average increase in nd of 4 12 when ni was lower than 2 76 m d ns increased linearly with an increase of 2 74 on average for a 10 increase in ni however when ni was greater than 2 76 m d the curve of ns versus ni had positive acceleration leading to an average increase in ns of 4 28 for a 10 increase in ni ni was identified as the main factor influencing the distribution of nitrate in groundwater thus reducing the infiltration rate during fertilization through water saving irrigation would be an effective way to prevent expansion of the area of nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall 5 conclusion in this study we used numerical simulations to investigate the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in steady state in a model coastal aquifer three indices nd ns and ng were used to analyze the influences of changes in h d and ni on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater resources fig 16 shows an overall comparison of the sensitivity of the parameters when h was lower than 65 ns increased slowly with an increase of 0 26 on average for a 10 00 increase in h there is an elevated increase starting from h 65 due to an accelerated increase in ns with respect to increases in h this parameter increased by 5 28 on average for a 10 00 increase in h d had very little impact on ns ns linearly increased with respect to an increase in ni with every 10 increase in ni leading to an average increase of 3 56 in nd thus we conclude that h and ni are key factors influencing the nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall h 65 d 25 n i 2 3 m d under si conditions without a subsurface cut off wall a low velocity zone 1 m d was formed due to the existence of the sw freshwater and nitrate migrated along the interface of the sw forming a semi elliptical pollution plume along the upper portion of the aquifer the mean velocity in the domain was 2 24 m d and nd and ns were 52 5 and 33 82 respectively after constructing the cut off wall the flow pattern became more complicated the area of the low velocity zone 1 2 m d enlarged the domain mean velocity decreased to 1 93 m d the nitrate contaminated area expanded and nd and ns increased to 54 68 and 34 58 respectively further the pollution plume caved inward just above the cut off wall the width of the transition zone increased and the nitrate pollution plume became more diffuse as it approached the saltwater transition zone changes in h had little effect on the size of the saltwater contaminated area but significantly influenced the nitrate distribution in groundwater ns and ng increased with increases in h we chose the height at which the cut off wall was 80 of the thickness of the aquifer to be the critical height when h was lower than the critical height ns slowly increased with respect to an increase in h when h was higher than the critical height ns increased rapidly 13 98 on average for a 10 00 increase in h therefore we suggest that subsurface cut off walls be designed such that their height is less than or equal to the critical height to avoid enlargement of the nitrate contaminated area in groundwater changes in d had a minor impact on the groundwater nitrate contamination but significantly influenced the size of the saltwater contaminated area which expanded with increases in d nd decreased with increasing d ns slightly decreased and ng hardly changed considering the dual effects of the subsurface cut off wall on si prevention and nitrate contamination we suggest that the subsurface cut off wall be constructed to control si and be less than or equal to the critical height changes in ni had little effect on the saltwater contaminated area but had a significant effect on nd ns and ng nd showed a linear increase with increases in ni a 10 increase in ni led to a 4 12 increase in nd when ni was lower than 2 76 m d ns increased linearly with an average increase of 2 74 for a 10 increase in ni however when ni was greater than 2 76 m d ns increased rapidly with a 10 increase in ni leading to a 4 28 increase in ns on average the increases in ng were also accelerated when ni was more than 2 76 m d thus reducing the infiltration rate by using water saving irrigation techniques would be an effective way to prevent the spread of nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall in field applications the dual effects of the height of the subsurface cut off wall on the si and nitrate contamination in groundwater should be considered in the wall s construction the minimum height of the cut off wall should be based on the height of sw where the wall is constructed typically the subsurface cut off wall is constructed close to the shoreline to increase the aquifer area but that increases the height of the wall and leads to nitrate contamination in the aquifer therefore the cut off wall should be constructed at a location such that its height is both less than the critical height and is able to control si in this way the wall can both control si and reduce nitrate contamination in the future we plan to perform studies that take denitrification and evaporation processes into account field denitrification kinetics will be studied and hydrogeological parameters will be measured to set up a field scale model and enhance the practical applicability of the theory developed herein declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors

6342,due to shallow groundwater tables and easy water availability many people live in coastal areas additionally alluvial sediments from fluviatile and marine deposits are highly suitable for agricultural use making coastal settlement even more desirable however groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from widespread application of fertilizers creates difficulties for water management officials cut off walls are used to control seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers however until now the effect of cut off walls on the nitrate contamination of groundwater has been largely unknown in this paper the first investigation of the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater is discussed two sets of laboratory experiments one with and one without a subsurface cut off wall were performed to validate the effectiveness of the constructed numerical model the effects of the subsurface cut off wall height distance between the subsurface cut off wall and the saltwater boundary and infiltration rates on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater were analyzed results showed that after the construction of the subsurface cut off wall the domain mean velocity decreased the migration of nitrate pollutants to the saltwater boundary was reduced and the nitrate contaminated area expanded further the morphology of the nitrate pollution plumes changed an indentation appeared directly above the subsurface cut off wall the widths of the transition zones increased significantly and the transition zones became more diffuse as one approached the saltwater wedge three indices were developed to quantify the degree of nitrate contamination the relative height of the subsurface cut off wall h and the nitrate infiltration rate ni were the two most significant factors determining the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater near the subsurface cut off wall therefore we suggest that subsurface cut off walls be designed such that their height lies below an experimentally determined critical height thus reducing the infiltration rate of the contaminants produced during fertilization through water saving irrigation

attention hu et al 2017 rodriguez galiano et al 2018 wang et al 2018 excess nitrates in the human body are reduced to toxic nitrite and further converted to nitrosamines which pose a significant threat to human health davidson et al 2017 rojas fabro et al 2015 therefore the who and some countries have established drinking water standards limiting the maximum concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n to 10 11 3 mg l radfard et al 2018 since the 1960 s a high degree of nitrate pollution in groundwater has been reported globally in the united states burow et al 2010 conducted a series of statistical analyses on the no3 n content in 5101 wells nationwide and found that the no3 n content in 427 wells exceeded 10 mg l kringel et al 2016 analyzed 37 groundwater sources in central africa and found that the average no3 n concentration was 60 mg l with the highest concentration reaching 150 mg l in china the average no3 n concentration in the groundwaters of the seven provinces surrounding the bohai sea reached 11 9 mg l with about 34 1 of the groundwater samples exceeding the established limit lu et al 2019 zhang et al 1996 with the economic development of human society and population growth the degree of coastal groundwater exploitation has significantly increased bosello and de cian 2014 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2016 leading to a decrease in underground water levels and an increase in seawater intrusion si bosello and de cian 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 singh 2015 different engineering approaches have been adopted to alleviate and eventually prevent si such as pumping hydraulic barriers water injection barriers artificial recharge and cut off walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a ahmed 2017 allow 2012 botero acosta and donado 2015 hussain et al 2015 cut off walls can be further categorized into full section cut off walls subsurface cut off walls and suspended cut off walls abdoulhalik et al 2017 among these the subsurface cut off wall is the most common type used in engineering abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b luyun et al 2009 the subsurface cut off wall is embedded into the impervious bottom layer of an aquifer an opening at the top of the aquifer blocks the saltwater and allows inland freshwater discharge to the ocean abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b allow 2012 the effectiveness of subsurface cut off walls against si has been widely investigated ishida et al 2003 kaleris and ziogas 2013 luyun et al 2009 however few studies have been concerned with the influence of subsurface cut off walls on the groundwater flow field and groundwater pollution in coastal areas with agricultural and animal husbandry land nitrate is the pollutant found in the highest concentrations in groundwater du et al 2011 rajmohan et al 2009 van den brink et al 2007 many investigations of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers have been conducted via laboratory experiments zhang et al 2002 2001 and numerical simulations shammas and thunvik 2009 volker et al 2002 xin et al 2019 these investigations indicate that the contaminant transport processes are significantly influenced by variable density flow sea level rise aquifer heterogeneity and stratigraphy density of the contaminant and tidal oscillations however the number of investigations of nitrate migration in coastal aquifers under the effect of the subsurface cut off wall is insufficient yoshimoto et al 2013 found that the average concentrations of no3 n in groundwater were below 10 mg l before the construction of a cut off wall and the concentration reached 10 mg l after the cut off wall construction they developed a numerical model that estimated that the no3 n concentration would continue to rise by 0 79 1 46 mg l over the following 100 years lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 found that the construction of a subsurface cut off wall affected the groundwater level upstream of the wall by 4 km but the no3 n concentration did not change significantly kang and xu 2017 monitored the nitrate concentrations of the groundwater upstream and downstream of a subsurface cut off wall and found that the average nitrate concentration in the groundwater upstream was 9 92 mg l which was much higher than the 0 76 mg l measured downstream overall the previous studies have found that the construction of a subsurface cut off wall influences the water level and nitrate concentration in the groundwater upstream of the cut off wall however the spatial distribution of the nitrate concentration in the presence of a cut off wall has not been considered and the effects of a subsurface cut off wall on the prevention of si and nitrate contamination have not been quantitatively evaluated further the effect of a subsurface cut off wall on inland pollution and si has not been explored hence in our study we 1 investigate the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on the flow field nitrate distribution and seawater distribution in an unconfined coastal aquifer 2 evaluate the effects of the cut off wall height distance between the cut off wall and the saltwater boundary and nitrate infiltration rates on groundwater nitrate contamination 3 propose a new optimized construction scheme for cut off walls that can control si and reduce the nitrate contamination in groundwater a variable density flow and transport model feflow 7 0 is applied to investigate nitrate migration and distribution in an unconfined coastal aquifer two sets of laboratory experiments with and without a cut off wall were performed to validate the effectiveness of the numerical model the validated model was then used to predict the degree of nitrate contamination under various conditions 2 experimental methods 2 1 description of the experimental set up the laboratory seepage device included a seepage chamber a salt freshwater level control system described below and a pollution source simulation system fig 1 the dimensions of the central seepage chamber were 1 00 m 0 60 m 0 10 m and the freshwater and saltwater chambers were located on either side of the chamber two hard perforated plastic plates with a metal screen on each surface were inserted between the seepage chamber and the water chambers to prevent the artificial aquifer medium from flowing out of the seepage chamber two submersible pumps were connected to the inlet holes through silicone hoses to feed the system with water and the outflow holes were connected with silicone hoses to discharge water to maintain constant freshwater and saltwater levels in this way the salt freshwater water level control system was constructed the pollution source simulation system consisted of two nitrate solution distribution pipes and two peristaltic pumps kcp c kamoer the distribution pipes were made of rigid plastic pipe diameter 1 cm length 20 cm closed at the end and into each pipe ten uniformly distributed holes were drilled bore diameter of 1 5 mm spacing interval of 2 cm the pipes were embedded in the surface of the seepage chamber beside each other and the peristaltic pump controlled the water input and the nitrate infiltration rate 2 2 experiment materials white quartz sand with an effective particle size of 0 5 1 2 mm was used as the aquifer medium the water samples used were freshwater saltwater and a pollutant solution freshwater used in the experiment was taken directly from the tap in the laboratory saltwater was prepared by dissolving commercial sodium chloride and red food dye in tap water to obtain concentrations of 36 16 g l and 1 5 g l respectively the pollutant solution was prepared by dissolving kno3 in distilled water to a kno3 concentration of 0 725 g l resulting in a no3 n concentration of 100 mg l the prepared solutions were stored in three 75 l plastic buckets a 0 01 m thick rigid foam plastic was used as the material for the cut off wall 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments included a control which did not have a subsurface cut off wall and a lab scale model which did a summary of the experimental parameters is presented in table 1 the experimental results were compared with the numerical model to validate the effectiveness of the model setup first the seepage chamber was filled with layers of quartz sand each layer was saturated with water and compacted next nine needles were inserted into the positions corresponding to each observation point shown in fig 1 the densities of the kno3 and nacl solutions were measured by a densitometer da 300wg dahometer to be 1025 g l and 1004 g l respectively the hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on darcy s law under the constant head condition and found to be 300 m d the experiments were carried out successively in the first experiment si conditions without the cut off wall were assumed in the following experiment si conditions and the presence of the subsurface cut off wall were assumed at the start of each experiment freshwater was injected saturating the entire porous medium with freshwater next the submersible pump in the saltwater bucket was activated to feed the system with saltwater and promote seawater intrusion when the saltwater level was stable at 41 60 cm the two peristaltic pumps responsible for the nitrate pollution were activated and the flow rate of each pump was adjusted to 0 96 m3 h in the experiments without a cut off wall when the displacement of the saltwater wedge sw fell below 0 5 cm over 1 h a steady state was considered to have been reached the length of the sw was recorded and water samples were withdrawn from the nine observation points in the experiment with a subsurface cut off wall the water samples from the nine observation points were extracted every 30 min when the no3 n concentrations at all observation points remained constant a steady state was considered to have been reached and the experiment was terminated the no3 n concentrations in the water samples were measured using a spectrophotometer unico uv2800a hu et al 2017 the experimental results are compared to the numerical results below 3 numerical model 3 1 model conceptualization a vertical cross section of the groundwater flow and nitrate pollution plume contained by the cut off wall ω are shown in fig 2 the left boundary is the freshwater boundary гf corresponding to h1 the constant hydraulic head of the freshwater flow the right boundary is the saltwater

constant nitrate concentration c 1s and variable nitrate infiltration rate ni m d across the top boundary are denoted by x1 and x2 respectively the remaining part of the top boundary гu and the bottom boundary гb are impervious to water and solutes the thickness of the aquifer is denoted by d the height of the subsurface cut off wall is h and its distance from гs is denoted by d for the sake of simplicity the denitrification process is not considered because this process does not occur on the laboratory scale 3 2 mathematical methods we model the density dependent flow and mass transport processes by considering a cross section of a coastal aquifer using the convective forms of the transport equations neglecting the forchheimer and brinkman effects the momentum balance is governed by the darcy equation in the form q k h χ e as we operated the experiments under constant controlled temperature conditions we can neglect the influence of temperature on buoyancy and assume that it only depends on the density of species k giving χ ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 k β ck c k c k 0 the solute expansion coefficient βck is defined by β ck α k c ks c k 0 the continuity equation for mass flow in steady state is

by d k ε d k i d m is the mechanical dispersion tensor which is a function of the velocity v d m β t v i β l β t v v v for the initial and boundary conditions we refer the reader to the guide book of feflow diersch 2013 3 3 model setup feflow 7 0 software has been widely used to solve variable density mass transport problems diersch 2013 and we used it to study the influence of the subsurface cut off wall on the distribution and degree of nitrate pollutants in groundwater over time the domain 1 00 m 0 40 m was discretized using the advancing front method into 16 960 triangular finite element cells the diameter of each element was 0 94 cm and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values were set to 0 001 m and 0 0001 m respectively which are within the range of the dispersivity values presented by abarca and prabhakar clement 2009 the elements in the area occupied by the cut off wall were considered to be inactive the fully implicit forward euler backward euler fe be method was used for simulation time control with the time step size set to 0 001 d and the initial time step length set to 1 10 8 d the full upwinding method was used in the model the density dependent flow transport equations led to symmetric and non symmetric matrices preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg was used to solve the symmetric linear system and preconditioned and post conditioned bicgstab was used to solve the non symmetric linear system the picard iteration scheme was used for solving the nonlinear system the values of the parameters in the numerical models were consistent with the experimental parameters which can be found in table 1 ni was set to 2 3 m d and a kno3 concentration of 725 mg l led to a no3 n concentration of 100 mg l the hydraulic conductivity was set to 300 m d nine observation points that were consistent with the positions of the experimental observation points were chosen 3 4 model validation a plot of the experimental versus the simulated no3 n concentrations at the 9 observation points in steady state is presented in fig 3 it is evident that the simulated and observed no3 n concentrations exhibited good correlation with a root mean square error of 1 0152 mg l the simulated length of the sw 50 6 cm and the experimental length of the sw 50 0 cm agreed well fig 4 contains a plot of the experimental and simulated no3 n concentrations over time at selected observation points for the scenario with the subsurface cut off wall observation points 1 2 4 and 7 did not exhibit nitrate accumulation observation point 9 was discarded because the process of sand excavation and refilling disturbed the in situ state thus making the experimental result inaccurate at the other four observation points 3 5 6 8 the experimental and simulated no3 n concentrations agreed well with an average significant correlation coefficient r2 of 0 92253 indicating that the feflow model can be successfully used to simulate nitrate migration and contamination in a coastal aquifer 3 5 simulation procedure in total four sets of 32 simulations were performed using the validated model to investigate the degree of nitrate contamination in the groundwater after the construction of the subsurface cut off wall in the first set of simulations two groups were considered those with and those without the subsurface cut off wall in the former group the relative heights of the subsurface cut off wall h equaled 62 5 of the thickness of aquifer and the relative distances between the cut off wall and the saltwater boundary d were 30 the nitrate infiltration rate ni for both groups was 2 3 m d in the second set of simulations cases with 10 different h values and the same d and ni values as above were considered in the third set of simulations cases with 9 different d values an h of 50 and the same ni as above were considered the fourth set of simulation included cases with 11 different ni values an h of 50 and a d of 30 other parameters used in the simulations were the same in all sets and are presented in table 1 the influence of the subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater was evaluated within each of the four sets of simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation methods hu et al 2005 used the indicator kriging method with a semivariogram model to assess nitrate contamination in groundwater using a threshold of 20 mg l no3 n to filter the raw data the spatial distribution range of nitrate is a common index used to evaluate the degree of nitrate contamination chen et al 2010 srivastava and ramanathan 2018 in this study a no3 n concentration of 10 mg l was used as the threshold which is within established drinking water standards no3 n to 10 11 3 mg l established by the who and many countries radfard et al 2018 the area enclosed by the 10 mg l concentration contour and the upper boundary was defined as the nitrate contamination area three pollution evaluation indexes were proposed the maximum depth of the contamination zone nd m fig 2 the nitrate contaminated area ns m2 fig 2 and the total dissolved kno3 mass in ω ng g some of the indices and variables were transformed to dimensionless form nd nd d the relative maximum nitrate pollution depth ns ns s the relative nitrate contaminated area s is the area of the domain which equals l d h h d the relative height of the subsurface cut off wall d d l the relative distance between the subsurface cut off wall and гs 4 2 influences of si and the subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination 4 2 1 nitrate contamination under the condition of si without the subsurface cut off wall the nitrate solution and saltwater have different densities and exist simultaneously in the domain to better understand the distribution of the nitrate pollutant the flow fields before and after the construction of the cut off wall were analyzed fig 5 a shows the flow field under the condition of si a low velocity zone 1 m d formed in the region occupied by the sw because the velocity inside the sw region was slow compared to the surface velocity chang and clement 2013 there was saltwater circulation within the sw region smith 2004 and a vertical flow component formed on the interface that carries the mass upward against the vertical gravitational force post et al 2007 the vertical flow component combined with the horizontal velocity component making the freshwater and mass migrate along the interface of the sw region as the height of the sw region increased and its boundary migrated towards the discharge zone the flow velocity accelerated fig 5a the maximum flow rate with a value of 18 95 m d appeared near the discharge zone and the mean velocity of the domain was 2 24 m d in the steady state a semi elliptic nitrate pollution plume fig 5c was formed in the upper portion of the aquifer nd and ns were 52 50 and 33 82 respectively the no3 n concentration was the highest greater than90 mg l around the nitrate infiltration zone and a narrow transition zone was formed at the edge of the plume zhang et al 2002 found that density was the main factor that influenced the shape of the pollution plume when it was low the contaminated zone was mainly concentrated in the upper portion of the aquifer with a relatively sharp outline this is consistent with our observations that the boundary of the nitrate contamination plume was very sharp we also observed that the pollution plume was contained in the upper portion of the aquifer because the density of the kno3 solution used was only 1 004 g cm3 4 2 2 nitrate contamination with the use of a subsurface cut off wall fig 5b shows the flow field patterns after construction of the subsurface cut off wall h 62 5 d 30 the sw was completely blocked outside the cut off wall the low velocity area on the left side of the cut off wall disappeared and a small high velocity zone formed directly above the cut off wall a fan shaped zone characterized by increasing velocity formed around the discharge zone the area of the low velocity 1 m d 2 m d zone on the left side of the cut off wall enlarged and the mean velocity decreased to 1 93 m d the nitrate migration ability decreased with the decrease in mean velocity which cause the nitrate contaminated area to expand and nd and ns to increase to 54 68 and 34 58 respectively the no3 n average concentration in the upstream aquifer increased from 24 23 mg l to 25 25 mg l a similar trend was reported in yoshimoto et al 2013 due to the action of the high velocity flow above the cut off wall the pollution plume became concave the width of the nitrate transition zone increased significantly and the nitrate pollution plume became more diffuse where it approached the saltwater interface fig 5d the latter observation is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2002 who reported that the front of the plume always becomes more diffuse as it approaches the saltwater interface 4 3 influence of subsurface cut off wall height on nitrate contamination the change in h significantly impacted the dimensions of the nitrate contaminated area see below but it did not cause a notable change in the seawater contaminated area fig 6 when h was 50 fig 6a and 60 fig 6b the nitrate pollution plumes were mainly concentrated in the upper portion of the aquifer the transition zones were narrow and the total mass of dissolved kno3 ng hardly changed fig 7 as h was increased to 80 fig 6c the nitrate contaminated area expanded and ng increased to 33 23 g the thickness of the low concentration transition zone above the saltwater region increased noticeably when h was further increased to 90 fig 6d nd ns and ng substantially increased to 81 50 55 95 and 45 25 g respectively in this case the aquifer was severely contaminated by nitrate the curve of the change in the mean velocity in the domain with h was parabolic concave down fig 8 which means that the velocity decreased as the cut off wall height increased wu et al 2016 found that this crossing velocity was the major factor affecting the extent of nitrate migration in saturated zones and that the vertical pollution depth increased with decreased crossing velocity when the cut off wall was tall the flow velocity rapidly decreased which ultimately led to a rapid increase in nd and ns in the aquifer fig 9 as h increased when h was lower than 65 nd and ns increased slowly as h increased with ns increasing by 0 94 on average for a 10 00 increase in h nd and ns began to increase more rapidly with respect to an increase in h starting at h 0 65 in the region 0 65 h 0 8 ns increased by 7 20 on average for a 10 00 increase in h however when h was higher than 80 nd and ns increased rapidly with respect to an increase in h with ns increasing by 13 98 on average for a 10 00 increase in h we thus denoted h 0 8 i e the height of the cut off wall when it is equal to 80 of the thickness of the aquifer as the critical height we conclude that cut off walls should be designed to be less than or equal to the critical height in order limit the nitrate contaminated area in groundwater aquifers 4 4 influence of the distance between the subsurface cut off wall and the saltwater boundary on nitrate contamination change in the relative distance between the subsurface cut off wall and гs d had little impact on the distribution of the nitrate pollutant but influenced the saltwater contaminated area significantly specifically the saltwater intruded further with increasing d fig 10 when d was increased from 15 to 35 ng hardly changed fig 11 and ns decreased very slightly fig 12 nd tended to decrease with increases in d because the concave configuration maintained a fixed distance from the cut off wall as the distance between the cut off wall and nd decreased nd decreased overall the changes in d had little impact on the distribution of the nitrate pollutant we note that the closer the cut off wall was to the saltwater boundary the taller the cut off wall needed to be to maintain its effectiveness in controlling si this increased ns indirectly therefore we suggest that cut off walls be constructed at positions such that the lowest possible cut off wall height that can still control si be less than or equal to the critical height in this way the dual purposes of controlling si and reducing nitrate contamination can be achieved simultaneously 4 5 influence of infiltration rate on nitrate contamination with subsurface cut off wall fig 13 shows the influence of ni on the distribution of nitrate and saltwater in steady state the changes in ni had little effect on the saltwater contaminated area when ni was low the nitrate pollution plume was distributed along the upper portion of the aquifer in an elongated ellipse fig 13a as ni 2 78 m d increased from 1 38 m d to 2 3 m d ng increased from 16 18 g to 21 79 g fig 14 with a 10 increase in ni leading to a 10 67 increase in ng with an increase in the infiltration rate the depth to which the nitrate pollution reached increased noticeably when the nitrate infiltration rates were 3 45 m d fig 13c and 3 68 m d ng values were 45 01 g and 49 71 g respectively for a 10 increase in ni ng increased by 15 66 on average ng increases were more rapid with respect to increases in ni when the latter value was more than 2 76 m d in all cases the nitrate contaminated area expanded to the upstream aquifer as can be seen from fig 15 the infiltration rate played a decisive role in the vertical migration of the nitrate pollutant nd increased linearly with respect to increases in ni with every 10 increase in ni leading to an average increase in nd of 4 12 when ni was lower than 2 76 m d ns increased linearly with an increase of 2 74 on average for a 10 increase in ni however when ni was greater than 2 76 m d the curve of ns versus ni had positive acceleration leading to an average increase in ns of 4 28 for a 10 increase in ni ni was identified as the main factor influencing the distribution of nitrate in groundwater thus reducing the infiltration rate during fertilization through water saving irrigation would be an effective way to prevent expansion of the area of nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall 5 conclusion in this study we used numerical simulations to investigate the influence of a subsurface cut off wall on nitrate contamination in steady state in a model coastal aquifer three indices nd ns and ng were used to analyze the influences of changes in h d and ni on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater resources fig 16 shows an overall comparison of the sensitivity of the parameters when h was lower than 65 ns increased slowly with an increase of 0 26 on average for a 10 00 increase in h there is an elevated increase starting from h 65 due to an accelerated increase in ns with respect to increases in h this parameter increased by 5 28 on average for a 10 00 increase in h d had very little impact on ns ns linearly increased with respect to an increase in ni with every 10 increase in ni leading to an average increase of 3 56 in nd thus we conclude that h and ni are key factors influencing the nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall h 65 d 25 n i 2 3 m d under si conditions without a subsurface cut off wall a low velocity zone 1 m d was formed due to the existence of the sw freshwater and nitrate migrated along the interface of the sw forming a semi elliptical pollution plume along the upper portion of the aquifer the mean velocity in the domain was 2 24 m d and nd and ns were 52 5 and 33 82 respectively after constructing the cut off wall the flow pattern became more complicated the area of the low velocity zone 1 2 m d enlarged the domain mean velocity decreased to 1 93 m d the nitrate contaminated area expanded and nd and ns increased to 54 68 and 34 58 respectively further the pollution plume caved inward just above the cut off wall the width of the transition zone increased and the nitrate pollution plume became more diffuse as it approached the saltwater transition zone changes in h had little effect on the size of the saltwater contaminated area but significantly influenced the nitrate distribution in groundwater ns and ng increased with increases in h we chose the height at which the cut off wall was 80 of the thickness of the aquifer to be the critical height when h was lower than the critical height ns slowly increased with respect to an increase in h when h was higher than the critical height ns increased rapidly 13 98 on average for a 10 00 increase in h therefore we suggest that subsurface cut off walls be designed such that their height is less than or equal to the critical height to avoid enlargement of the nitrate contaminated area in groundwater changes in d had a minor impact on the groundwater nitrate contamination but significantly influenced the size of the saltwater contaminated area which expanded with increases in d nd decreased with increasing d ns slightly decreased and ng hardly changed considering the dual effects of the subsurface cut off wall on si prevention and nitrate contamination we suggest that the subsurface cut off wall be constructed to control si and be less than or equal to the critical height changes in ni had little effect on the saltwater contaminated area but had a significant effect on nd ns and ng nd showed a linear increase with increases in ni a 10 increase in ni led to a 4 12 increase in nd when ni was lower than 2 76 m d ns increased linearly with an average increase of 2 74 for a 10 increase in ni however when ni was greater than 2 76 m d ns increased rapidly with a 10 increase in ni leading to a 4 28 increase in ns on average the increases in ng were also accelerated when ni was more than 2 76 m d thus reducing the infiltration rate by using water saving irrigation techniques would be an effective way to prevent the spread of nitrate contamination in groundwater near a subsurface cut off wall in field applications the dual effects of the height of the subsurface cut off wall on the si and nitrate contamination in groundwater should be considered in the wall s construction the minimum height of the cut off wall should be based on the height of sw where the wall is constructed typically the subsurface cut off wall is constructed close to the shoreline to increase the aquifer area but that increases the height of the wall and leads to nitrate contamination in the aquifer therefore the cut off wall should be constructed at a location such that its height is both less than the critical height and is able to control si in this way the wall can both control si and reduce nitrate contamination in the future we plan to perform studies that take denitrification and evaporation processes into account field denitrification kinetics will be studied and hydrogeological parameters will be measured to set up a field scale model and enhance the practical applicability of the theory developed herein declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors

g schneider and hook 2010 o reilly et al 2015 have found an increase in the mean wst ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 c in lakes and reservoirs around the globe with trend toward continued changes due to alterations in air temperature which is the main driving factor of wst in these ecosystems schmid et al 2014 this change in mean water temperature can lead to significant changes in ecosystem biological processes such as the mineralization rate of organic carbon and the phytoplankton primary productivity darchambeau et al 2014 gudasz et al 2015 kehoe et al 2015 as well as the interactions

consuming and difficult to apply to large areas gholizadeh melesse and reddi 2016 especially with frequent measurements in recent years remote sensing techniques have been used successfully to evaluate wst in inland waters such as lakes and reservoirs giardino et al 2015 bresciani et al 2011 sima et al 2013 crosman and horel 2009 remote sensing tools provide an enormous amount of information allowing spatial coverage of remote sites and large areas chao rodriguez et al 2014 pinel et al 2017 politi et al 2012 furthermore they have the advantage of providing publicly available

and landsat images wloczyk et al 2006 lamaro et al 2013 however most of these satellites collect wst data twice a day every 16 days leading to some uncertainty in estimates of daily and monthly

2014 different models are available for this purpose such as iph eco fragoso et al 2009 elcom hodges 2000 dyresm caedym hamilton and schladow 1997 and pclake janse 2005 the models differ mainly with

curtarelli et al 2014a frassl et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and to evaluate variations in heat fluxes e g mcgloin et al 2014 granger and hedstrom 2011 however most of these studies were conducted using a short time scale or were based mainly on remote sensing techniques which tends to limit the observation identification of seasonal patterns in winter due to the number of cloudy images especially in extreme weather conditions coupling between numerical modeling and remote sensing techniques can improve comprehension of how different thermal processes are affected by weather conditions but large scale spatio temporal variations of the wst and heat flux dynamics over long time scales remain underexplored this study presents a new approach using in situ measurements modis land surface

subtropical lake located on the brazil uruguay border 32 00 to 33 00 s 52 00 to 54 00 w the lake has a surface area of ca 4000 km2 is 190 km long along the main axis and averages 40 km wide the maximum depth is 10 m with a mean depth of 4 5 m the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1200 mm to 1450 mm and the mean annual temperature is 16 c kottek et al 2006 the lake is connected to the larger patos lagoon surface area ca 10 000 km2 through the são gonçalo channel which is approximately 76 km long the water flow in the channel is controlled by a sluice dam system which prevents seawater from entering the lake during the dry season and controls the lake volume lake mirim is also important for navigation connecting cities in southern brazil to cities in northern uruguay the main sub basins contributing to lake mirim are located on the west shore where the cebollati jaguarão and tacuari rivers are the main tributaries lake mirim water is used mainly for irrigating rice fields as well as a water supply for surrounding urban areas lake mangueira also a large shallow subtropical coastal lake is located east of lake mirim covering a surface area of ca 820 km2 with a mean depth of 2 6 m and maximum depth of 6 5 m this lake has been studied for several years resulting in a concise dataset of physical chemical and biological variables bohnenberger et al 2017 cavalcanti et al 2016

modis lst products we used the approach proposed by zhang et al 2014 where the authors examined the lst changes of 52 lakes on the tibetan plateau validating the modis wst product from in situ lst data collected at only one location as in situ measurements of wst in lake mirim were not available the modis lst data were validated using the concise dataset available for lake mangueira which has a similar genesis and hydro geomorphological characteristics to lake mirim kotzian and marques 2004 schwartzbold and schafer 1984 the lake mangueira wst dataset is part of an ongoing project and we

area 3 5 spatial and temporal analysis of the wst and heat budget in order to assess the modis wst variability against the simulated water temperature variability we selected seven points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 distributed over lake mirim fig 3a we directly compare the simulated water temperature in each point with the modis derived wst for this the modis lst data 1 km resolution were resampled to a 500 m spatial resolution compatible with the bathymetric grid in view of the difficulty of performing a daily analysis for each point we select the days with available clear sky images and with all daytime and nighttime time series data available for each point for example on january 28 2003 modis lst provided two groups of data per day for each of the seven selected points fig 3b to evaluate the accuracy of the ipheco model the coefficient of determination r2 bias root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 were calculated comparing the median of wst simulated from iph eco versus the median of the modis derived wst boxplot at the seven selected points in the lake the analysis of the spatial variations of mean values of wst between lake areas i e littoral and limnetic zones for different time frequencies i e daily monthly seasonal inter annual was carried out using the visit software freely available at https wci

means varied over a narrower range from 17 85 c in 2008 to 20 95 c in 2010 fig 4 a the simulated wst tended to decrease for 2008 and 2009 annual mean ranging from 17 85 c to 17 92 c for certain years shallow areas i e littoral zones were warmer than deep areas i e limnetic zone showing the heterogeneity of the wst in lake mirim fig 4a regarding the impact of river inflows on wsts there was no marked spatial variations in the annual mean of wst the monthly mean values showed wide seasonal variation with an increase in the wst in summer january to march and a decrease in winter july to september fig 4b in addition during spring october to december and autumn april to june the wst showed greater spatial heterogeneity compared to summer and winter seasons with greater spatial homogeneity of water surface temperatures 4 2 3 simulated surface heat fluxes the mean annual values maximum and minimum values and standard deviations sd for all six simulated heat flux components net solar short wave radiation atmospheric longwave radiation water longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes and the effective surface heat balance for the 2001 2010 period are shown in table 1 the atmospheric longwave radiation al is the main heat source for the lake with an annual mean of 303 38 w m 2 nevertheless most of al is compensated by the longwave emission from the water wl for which the annual mean is 336 01 w m 2 for the period simulated 2001 2010 the lake experienced a heat gain where the effective surface heat flux reached an annual mean of 157 17 w m 2 fig 5 shows monthly mean values w m 2 of the simulated heat fluxes the model results indicated marked seasonal dynamics for all six heat fluxes the effective surface heat flux fig 5a shows that december january and february were the months when the lake received the most heat especially in shallow areas reaching a maximum of 569 30 w m 2 in january from june to july the lake experienced some heat loss which was highest in june in the limnetic zone 1 4 w m 2 for the radiative components the net solar short wave radiation was the second most important heat source for the lake reaching a maximum of 650 20 w m 2 in january and a minimum of 55 20 w m 2 in june fig 5b the atmospheric longwave radiation al reached its maximum in february 358 40 w m 2 and minimum in july 248 00 w m 2 fig 5c the longwave emission from the water wl showed maximum heat loss in february 372 70 w m 2 and minimum in august 299 70 w m 2 fig 5d regarding the monthly course of the nonradiative components fig 5e and 5f the maximum monthly heat loss due to sensible heat flux reached maximum values in january 13 87 w m 2 and minimum values in july 27 13 w m 2 the monthly mean maximum heat loss by latent heat flux evaporation was 132 1 w m 2 in january and the lowest heat loss by evaporation was in august 12 41 w m 2 the mean annual heat loss due to evaporation was 51 14 w m 2 table 2 regarding the heat flux from the river inflows fig 6 the cebollati river is the main heat flux input that cause a cooling effect june and warming effect september in the lake the characteristic cooling starts in june fig 6b because air and lake water temperatures exceed the inflow temperature at this time the maximum warming in the period 2001 2010 occurred 2002 reaching an annual average of 8 06 w m 2 from cebollati river and 4 17 w m 2 from jaguarão river table 2 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of in situ wst and modis lst in this study modis derived wst showed a good correspondence with in situ measurements of wst at three the modis derived wst showed good correspondence with in situ measurements of wst at three sampling points north central and south in lake mangueira fig 2 so that it represented all components of variability such as the extreme maximum 2002 and minimum values 2007 and the seasonal dynamics of the wst a smaller positive bias was found for the central point at the deepest part of the lake which may be associated with the differences in depth among the sampling points ke and song 2014 kozlov et al 2014 as well as the weather conditions such as the wind both speed and direction which also can increase the evaporation rates and influence in the cool skin effect in water surface temperature fairall et al 1996 tavares et al 2019 the accuracy of our results was consistent with the accuracies found in previous studies e g chavula et al 2009 crosman and horel 2009 liu et al 2015 phillips et al 2016 sima et al 2013 tavares et al 2019 xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 2018 suggesting the reliability of this approach 5 2 water surface temperature modeling spatial and temporal patterns the iph eco model compared to the validated modis derived water surface temperature wst successfully represented the wst in lake mirim in all the years of the simulation showing good agreement for the seven points analyzed p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 even for maximum value 2007 and minimum value 2009 periods and the seasonal dynamics of the wst our results indicated that the wst simulated for the seven points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 indicating heterogeneity in the wst in lake mirim and suggesting that a spatially distributed approach be used in order to assess the wst properly it is well known that shallower areas mean depth up to 4 5 m may show wide day to day variations in water levels these areas are influenced directly by the solar radiation leading to more fluctuations in the wst than in deep areas as has been found in similar environments missaghi and hondzo 2010 soulignac et al 2017 regarding the annual mean of the simulated wst patterns the results indicated a slight tendency toward cooling in the lake showing lower wsts in 2008 and 2009 mean 17 92 c this result is not in agreement with the global tendency indicated by schneider and hook 2010 o reilly et al 2015 and schmid et al 2014 mainly for deep lakes the decreasing tendency observed in this study may be due to decreases in the air temperature as the observed air temperature at the santa vitória weather station showed a slight decrease in the 2000 2010 period fedrizzi et al 2015 the annual mean of the simulated wst also allowed the identification of distinct thermal zones along the lake along the shoreline i e the littoral zone which showed higher mean wst values and the central region i e the limnetic zone which showed lower mean wst values the warming began in the shallower waters and shoreline areas while the central part of the lake stayed cooler for a longer period this is due to the low thermal mass of the shallower areas where the wst decreases more rapidly than in deeper areas wells and sherman 2001 shallower areas have a lower heat capacity and respond faster to changes in atmospheric forcing than deeper zones liu et al 2011 simulated values of the monthly mean wst revealed a higher spatial homogeneity in winter due to hydrodynamic patterns influenced by strong winds which increase the lake mixing during this season similar patterns in the spatial and temporal variability of the wst were observed in lake mangueira cavalcanti et al 2016 fragoso et al 2011 where the wst tends to be more homogeneous in winter 5 3 modeled surface heat budget the simulated surface heat fluxes indicated marked seasonal variation in the monthly mean of the effective surface heat balance in lake mirim as expected the lake receives more heat in summer than in winter in summer months the northern part of the lake gains more heat than the southern part this gain begins in the shallower areas while in deeper areas the effective surface heat tends to be more homogeneous in spring and autumn a key driving factor explaining this behavior is the wind because of the large surface area 4000 km2 primarily longitudinal orientation and shallow waters mean depth 4 5 m the wind stress produces seiches that can result in wide variations in the lake s water level up to 3 m between the south and north ends munar et al 2018 in addition the strong northwest winds along the lake in this period can lead warmer water masses and raise the water levels in the southern end of the lake as found in similar environments such as patos lagoon fernandes et al 2002 2005 and lake mangueira fragoso et al 2011 regarding the radiation components the atmospheric longwave radiation al is the dominant heat input into the lake followed by the net solar short wave radiation j sn which reaches maximum levels in summer february and minimum levels in winter july august as expected these heat inputs are compensated by the water longwave radiation wl which causes the most heat loss in summer february similar behavior was observed in other lakes fink et al 2014a heiskanen et al 2015 and reservoirs alcântara et al 2010a 2010b curtarelli et al 2014a where most of the heat input is compensated by the water longwave radiation the non radiation components sensible and latent heat flux showed a similar behavior where the heat loss reaches maximum levels in summer february and minimum levels in winter july august indeed most of the time the lake loses heat and releases energy through sensible and latent heat exchanges with the atmosphere especially in shallower waters and nearshore areas these heat losses sensible and latent which depend on the wind speed and water vapor or the temperature gradient zhao and liu 2018 were due to higher air temperature and vapor pressure than the wst showing the influence of warmth and moisture on air masses shao et al 2015 our results revealed that the heat loss due to latent flux was higher than the sensible flux indicating that most of the energy released is due to evaporation and the atmospheric saturation this can be due to increasing incoming surface solar radiation and water vapor pressure deficit in summer fink et al 2014a wang et al 2018 additionally the large surface area and the shallow waters of lake mirim can rapidly increase the loss of energy through heat exchange with the atmosphere granger and hedstrom 2011 phillips et al 2016 indeed the latent heat flux showed an annual course with a minimum of 12 4 w m 2 in winter and a maximum of 131 1 w m 2 in summer although no study was performed previously in lake mirim these values are within the range found by fink et al 2014a for lake constance european alps for the 1984 2011 period minimum of 15 3 w m 2 in winter and maximum of 76 0 w m 2 in summer another key factor that contributes to increasing the evaporation in the lake is the external forcing factors such as wind both speed and direction which increases the evaporation in shallow water accelerating the heat fluxes in these environments the turbulence caused by the wind refreshes the air above the water and prevents it from becoming saturated which changes the surface area over which heat is lost to the atmosphere o sullivan and reynolds 2005 feng and li 2010 the results also indicated that the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget nevertheless the river inflows mainly the cebollati river cause a local effect over the simulated wst in the lake fig 6b which can lead mixing regime shifts from dimictic to warm monomictic kirillin et al 2013 and affect the stratification heat and nutrient fluxes and biota råman vinnå et al 2017 5 4 model capability and limitations the coupled models proved to be suitable for representing the wst dynamic and the heat fluxes radiative latent and sensible components in lake mirim the smallest wst peaks were reproduced although with some biases december 2004 and february 2010 this can be explained by errors in the input data temperature and precipitation biases associated with the modis derived lst product mod11a1 phillips et al 2016 or errors in the numerical solution methods discretization and iteration errors of the coupled models wu 2008 these limitations have also been invoked in other studies fink et al 2014a råman vinnå et al 2017 although wst studies in lake mirim have not been conducted previously our approach coupling a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic model with validated modis derived water surface temperature well represented the wst and surface heat fluxes dynamics in the lake describing the spatial and temporal daily monthly seasonal and inter annual variations these spatial and temporal patterns are difficult to explore using other approaches such as remote sensing techniques where the cloud cover and the number of available clear sky images is a limitation during some seasons especially autumn and winter alcântara et al 2010b crosman and horel 2009 sima et al 2013 although a longer time span would give a more stable result there are limitations to extend the simulation to account for more recent years the lake water levels monitoring suffered from a great loss in continuity in more recent years due to the official monitoring agency intermittent funding another uncertainly is related to the sluice system operation in the são gonçalo channel which is a hard task to reproduce for additional years without an uninterrupted continuous monitoring of the lake water level munar et al 2018 6 conclusion in summary we have described the first attempt to investigate the pattern of the long term water surface temperature and surface heat fluxes in a large subtropical shallow lake coupling distributed hydrological modeling and hydrodynamic modeling with remote sensing techniques our findings indicated that the atmospheric longwave radiation is the main heat input for lake mirim which is mostly compensated by the longwave radiation emitted from the lake s water surface another source of heat loss is through the latent heat flux i e increase in the evaporation rate due to increases in incoming surface solar radiation and atmospheric saturation where the shallow water due to the low thermal mass responds more rapidly to atmospheric forcings e g wind stress relative humidity air temperature shortwave radiation compared to the deeper water in addition the heat flux from the river inflows which are a point source of thermal contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake and does not cause marked spatial variations in the annual mean of wst the present study goes beyond the previously reported work being the first long term and synoptic scale approach in lake mirim allowing us to contribute to an improved understanding of the main physical processes surface heat budget that occur in this ecosystem the overall methodology proposed here could be used as a tool to improve the comprehension of dynamics of systems under anthropic and natural stressors ecosystem functions and services and helping to support effective water system management furthermore this approach may be

6343,assessment of large scale temperature dynamics and heat fluxes in shallow lakes requires comprehensive modeling capabilities to simulate water interactions the processes related to the heat budget and their driving forces in this study we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water surface temperature wst and surface heat fluxes for the period between january 2001 and december 2010 in lake mirim a large surface area ca 4000 km2 shallow lake on the brazil uruguay border the aquatic ecosystem was examined using in situ wst measurements modis land surface temperature

g schneider and hook 2010 o reilly et al 2015 have found an increase in the mean wst ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 c in lakes and reservoirs around the globe with trend toward continued changes due to alterations in air temperature which is the main driving factor of wst in these ecosystems schmid et al 2014 this change in mean water temperature can lead to significant changes in ecosystem biological processes such as the mineralization rate of organic carbon and the phytoplankton primary productivity darchambeau et al 2014 gudasz et al 2015 kehoe et al 2015 as well as the interactions and energy fluxes between the atmosphere and the water surface alcântara et al 2010b zhang et al 2014 the conventional method to evaluate wst relies on in situ measurements and is expensive time consuming and difficult to apply to large areas gholizadeh melesse and reddi 2016 especially with frequent measurements in recent years remote sensing techniques have been used successfully to evaluate wst in inland waters such as lakes and reservoirs giardino et al 2015 bresciani et al 2011 sima et al 2013 crosman and horel 2009 remote sensing tools provide an enormous amount of information allowing spatial coverage of remote sites and large areas chao rodriguez et al 2014 pinel et al 2017 politi et al 2012 furthermore they have the advantage of providing publicly available datasets in many cases trumpickas et al 2009 some studies have estimated wst by employing different satellites such as the aster mission steissberg et al 2005 gillespie et al 1998 schneider et al 2009 and landsat images wloczyk et al 2006 lamaro et al 2013 however most of these satellites collect wst data twice a day every 16 days leading to some uncertainty in estimates of daily and monthly

aquatic ecosystems has been an efficient tool to understand the main physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic environments such as lakes and reservoirs e g ji 2017 shiflet and shiflet 2014 different models are available for this purpose such as iph eco fragoso et al 2009 elcom hodges 2000 dyresm caedym hamilton and schladow 1997 and pclake janse 2005 the models differ mainly with respect to physical processes related to vertical mixing and heat budget computation while complex three dimensional models are of interest in deep lakes where stratification plays a key role throughout the year ofir et al 2017 recknagel et al 2014 large shallow lakes are polymictic with strong vertical mixing year round for long term numerical simulations one can rely on two dimensional or even one dimensional models since these models are capable of appropriately simulating the free surface thermodynamics cavalcanti et al 2016 fragoso et al 2011 trolle et al 2011 hipsey et al 2017

2014a and govern physical mixing convective cooling heating macintyre and melack 1995 macintyre et al 2002 for modeling of large aquatic ecosystems the assessment of the effect of large scale and horizontal advection on temperature dynamics requires a greater understanding of the capabilities of the model to represent the interactions between physical processes and the heat balance at the water surface recently the synergy between numerical modeling and remote sensing techniques has been applied in lakes and reservoirs to estimate short term variations i e diurnal weekly on wst e g curtarelli et al 2014a frassl et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and to evaluate variations in heat fluxes e g mcgloin et al 2014 granger and hedstrom 2011 however most of these studies were conducted using a short time scale or were based mainly on remote sensing techniques which tends to limit the observation identification of seasonal patterns in winter due to the number of cloudy images especially in extreme weather conditions coupling between numerical modeling and remote sensing techniques can improve comprehension of how different thermal processes are affected by weather conditions but large scale spatio temporal variations of the wst and heat flux dynamics over long time scales remain underexplored this study presents a new approach using in situ measurements modis land surface temperature lst data and coupling between a distributed large scale hydrological model and a hydrodynamic water quality model aiming to simultaneously assess the water surface temperature and surface heat flux dynamics on a long term time scale besides the spatial and temporal variability daily monthly seasonal and inter annual of lake water surface temperature the relative importance of each process related to the heat budget on the lake surface and the heat flux from the river inflows was also quantified and is discussed here 2 study area and materials lake mirim fig 1 is a large shallow subtropical lake located on the brazil uruguay border 32 00 to 33 00 s 52 00 to 54 00 w the lake has a surface area of ca 4000 km2 is 190 km long along the main axis and averages 40 km wide the maximum depth is 10 m with a mean depth of 4 5 m the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1200 mm to 1450 mm and the mean annual temperature is 16 c kottek et al 2006 the lake is connected to the larger patos lagoon surface area ca 10 000 km2 through the são gonçalo channel which is approximately 76 km long the water flow in the channel is controlled by a sluice dam system which prevents seawater from entering the lake during the dry season and controls the lake volume lake mirim is also important for navigation connecting cities in southern brazil to cities in northern uruguay the main sub basins contributing to lake mirim are located on the west shore where the cebollati jaguarão and tacuari rivers are the main tributaries lake mirim water is used mainly for irrigating rice fields as well as a water supply for surrounding urban areas lake mangueira also a large shallow subtropical coastal lake is located east of lake mirim covering a surface area of ca 820 km2 with a mean depth of 2 6 m and maximum depth of 6 5 m this lake has been studied for several years resulting in a concise dataset of physical chemical and biological variables bohnenberger et al 2017 cavalcanti et al 2016

discarded due to the presence of clouds shadows on the measurement sites or to the bad quality of the images from modis quality product control roy et al 2002 the modis reprojection tool was used to transform the sinusoidal projection images isin all the mod11a1 lst images were processed and analyzed using a matlab routine 2 1 2 in situ wst data and modis lst validation in order to validate the modis lst products we used the approach proposed by zhang et al 2014 where the authors examined the lst changes of 52 lakes on the tibetan plateau validating the modis wst product from in situ lst data collected at only one location as in situ measurements of wst in lake mirim were not available the modis lst data were validated using the concise dataset available for lake mangueira which has a similar genesis and hydro geomorphological characteristics to lake mirim kotzian and marques 2004 schwartzbold and schafer 1984 the lake mangueira wst dataset is part of an ongoing project and we chose to use the wst field data from january 2001 through december 2010 these data were collected at three sampling points in the north central and south parts of lake mangueira taman tamac and tamas respectively fig 1 measured two or three times a year all measurements were carry out during the morning and water surface temperature was considered steady during this time of day therefore there was no variation in time between temperature measurements and satellite overpass modis lst data is taken at approximately 10 30 h local time details about the validation process of modis lst products in

meteorological data were collected at three meteorological stations near the lake see fig 1 the period of simulation was set from 1 january 2001 to 31 december 2010 and the simulation was performed using a computational time step of 60 s since we are focusing on assessing the spatiotemporal variability of wst and heat fluxes over the lake mirim using the calibrated period a validation phase was not required the implicitness factor θ was chosen as 0 55 and the drying threshold of computational cells was set to 0 05 m casulli and cattani 1994 the bottom boundary condition was parameterized

area 3 5 spatial and temporal analysis of the wst and heat budget in order to assess the modis wst variability against the simulated water temperature variability we selected seven points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 distributed over lake mirim fig 3a we directly compare the simulated water temperature in each point with the modis derived wst for this the modis lst data 1 km resolution were resampled to a 500 m spatial resolution compatible with the bathymetric grid in view of the difficulty of performing a daily analysis for each point we select the days with available clear sky images and with all daytime and nighttime time series data available for each point for example on january 28 2003 modis lst provided two groups of data per day for each of the seven selected points fig 3b to evaluate the accuracy of the ipheco model the coefficient of determination r2 bias root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 were calculated comparing the median of wst simulated from iph eco versus the median of the modis derived wst boxplot at the seven selected points in the lake the analysis of the spatial variations of mean values of wst between lake areas i e littoral and limnetic zones for different time frequencies i e daily monthly seasonal inter annual was carried out using the visit software freely available at https wci

points were chosen randomly along the lake s main axis tukey s hsd test showed a significant difference p 0 05 among the seven points for the simulated wst table 1 suggesting that lake mirim shows

means varied over a narrower range from 17 85 c in 2008 to 20 95 c in 2010 fig 4 a the simulated wst tended to decrease for 2008 and 2009 annual mean ranging from 17 85 c to 17 92 c for certain years shallow areas i e littoral zones were warmer than deep areas i e limnetic zone showing the heterogeneity of the wst in lake mirim fig 4a regarding the impact of river inflows on wsts there was no marked spatial variations in the annual mean of wst the monthly mean values showed wide seasonal variation with an increase in the wst in summer january to march and a decrease in winter july to september fig 4b in addition during spring october to december and autumn april to june the wst showed greater spatial heterogeneity compared to summer and winter seasons with greater spatial homogeneity of water surface temperatures 4 2 3 simulated surface heat fluxes the mean annual values maximum and minimum values and standard deviations sd for all six simulated heat flux components net solar short wave radiation atmospheric longwave radiation water longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes and the effective surface heat balance for the 2001 2010 period are shown in table 1 the atmospheric longwave radiation al is the main heat source for the lake with an annual mean of 303 38 w m 2 nevertheless most of al is compensated by the longwave emission from the water wl for which the annual mean is 336 01 w m 2 for the period simulated 2001 2010 the lake experienced a heat gain where the effective surface heat flux reached an annual mean of 157 17 w m 2 fig 5 shows monthly mean values w m 2 of the simulated heat fluxes the model results indicated marked seasonal dynamics for all six heat fluxes the effective surface heat flux fig 5a shows that december january and february were the months when the lake received the most heat especially in shallow areas reaching a maximum of 569 30 w m 2 in january from june to july the lake experienced some heat loss which was highest in june in the limnetic zone 1 4 w m 2 for the radiative components the net solar short wave radiation was the second most important heat source for the lake reaching a maximum of 650 20 w m 2 in january and a minimum of 55 20 w m 2 in june fig 5b the atmospheric longwave radiation al reached its maximum in february 358 40 w m 2 and minimum in july 248 00 w m 2 fig 5c the longwave emission from the water wl showed maximum heat loss in february 372 70 w m 2 and minimum in august 299 70 w m 2 fig 5d regarding the monthly course of the nonradiative components fig 5e and 5f the maximum monthly heat loss due to sensible heat flux reached maximum values in january 13 87 w m 2 and minimum values in july 27 13 w m 2 the monthly mean maximum heat loss by latent heat flux evaporation was 132 1 w m 2 in january and the lowest heat loss by evaporation was in august 12 41 w m 2 the mean annual heat loss due to evaporation was 51 14 w m 2 table 2 regarding the heat flux from the river inflows fig 6 the cebollati river is the main heat flux input that cause a cooling effect june and warming effect september in the lake the characteristic cooling starts in june fig 6b because air and lake water temperatures exceed the inflow temperature at this time the maximum warming in the period 2001 2010 occurred 2002 reaching an annual average of 8 06 w m 2 from cebollati river and 4 17 w m 2 from jaguarão river table 2 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of in situ wst and modis lst in this study modis derived wst showed a good correspondence with in situ measurements of wst at three the modis derived wst showed good correspondence with in situ measurements of wst at three sampling points north central and south in lake mangueira fig 2 so that it represented all components of variability such as the extreme maximum 2002 and minimum values 2007 and the seasonal dynamics of the wst a smaller positive bias was found for the central point at the deepest part of the lake which may be associated with the differences in depth among the sampling points ke and song 2014 kozlov et al 2014 as well as the weather conditions such as the wind both speed and direction which also can increase the evaporation rates and influence in the cool skin effect in water surface temperature fairall et al 1996 tavares et al 2019 the accuracy of our results was consistent with the accuracies found in previous studies e g chavula et al 2009 crosman and horel 2009 liu et al 2015 phillips et al 2016 sima et al 2013 tavares et al 2019 xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 2018 suggesting the reliability of this approach 5 2 water surface temperature modeling spatial and temporal patterns the iph eco model compared to the validated modis derived water surface temperature wst successfully represented the wst in lake mirim in all the years of the simulation showing good agreement for the seven points analyzed p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 even for maximum value 2007 and minimum value 2009 periods and the seasonal dynamics of the wst our results indicated that the wst simulated for the seven points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 indicating heterogeneity in the wst in lake mirim and suggesting that a spatially distributed approach be used in order to assess the wst properly it is well known that shallower areas mean depth up to 4 5 m may show wide day to day variations in water levels these areas are influenced directly by the solar radiation leading to more fluctuations in the wst than in deep areas as has been found in similar environments missaghi and hondzo 2010 soulignac et al 2017 regarding the annual mean of the simulated wst patterns the results indicated a slight tendency toward cooling in the lake showing lower wsts in 2008 and 2009 mean 17 92 c this result is not in agreement with the global tendency indicated by schneider and hook 2010 o reilly et al 2015 and schmid et al 2014 mainly for deep lakes the decreasing tendency observed in this study may be due to decreases in the air temperature as the observed air temperature at the santa vitória weather station showed a slight decrease in the 2000 2010 period fedrizzi et al 2015 the annual mean of the simulated wst also allowed the identification of distinct thermal zones along the lake along the shoreline i e the littoral zone which showed higher mean wst values and the central region i e the limnetic zone which showed lower mean wst values the warming began in the shallower waters and shoreline areas while the central part of the lake stayed cooler for a longer period this is due to the low thermal mass of the shallower areas where the wst decreases more rapidly than in deeper areas wells and sherman 2001 shallower areas have a lower heat capacity and respond faster to changes in atmospheric forcing than deeper zones liu et al 2011 simulated values of the monthly mean wst revealed a higher spatial homogeneity in winter due to hydrodynamic patterns influenced by strong winds which increase the lake mixing during this season similar patterns in the spatial and temporal variability of the wst were observed in lake mangueira cavalcanti et al 2016 fragoso et al 2011 where the wst tends to be more homogeneous in winter 5 3 modeled surface heat budget the simulated surface heat fluxes indicated marked seasonal variation in the monthly mean of the effective surface heat balance in lake mirim as expected the lake receives more heat in summer than in winter in summer months the northern part of the lake gains more heat than the southern part this gain begins in the shallower areas while in deeper areas the effective surface heat tends to be more homogeneous in spring and autumn a key driving factor explaining this behavior is the wind because of the large surface area 4000 km2 primarily longitudinal orientation and shallow waters mean depth 4 5 m the wind stress produces seiches that can result in wide variations in the lake s water level up to 3 m between the south and north ends munar et al 2018 in addition the strong northwest winds along the lake in this period can lead warmer water masses and raise the water levels in the southern end of the lake as found in similar environments such as patos lagoon fernandes et al 2002 2005 and lake mangueira fragoso et al 2011 regarding the radiation components the atmospheric longwave radiation al is the dominant heat input into the lake followed by the net solar short wave radiation j sn which reaches maximum levels in summer february and minimum levels in winter july august as expected these heat inputs are compensated by the water longwave radiation wl which causes the most heat loss in summer february similar behavior was observed in other lakes fink et al 2014a heiskanen et al 2015 and reservoirs alcântara et al 2010a 2010b curtarelli et al 2014a where most of the heat input is compensated by the water longwave radiation the non radiation components sensible and latent heat flux showed a similar behavior where the heat loss reaches maximum levels in summer february and minimum levels in winter july august indeed most of the time the lake loses heat and releases energy through sensible and latent heat exchanges with the atmosphere especially in shallower waters and nearshore areas these heat losses sensible and latent which depend on the wind speed and water vapor or the temperature gradient zhao and liu 2018 were due to higher air temperature and vapor pressure than the wst showing the influence of warmth and moisture on air masses shao et al 2015 our results revealed that the heat loss due to latent flux was higher than the sensible flux indicating that most of the energy released is due to evaporation and the atmospheric saturation this can be due to increasing incoming surface solar radiation and water vapor pressure deficit in summer fink et al 2014a wang et al 2018 additionally the large surface area and the shallow waters of lake mirim can rapidly increase the loss of energy through heat exchange with the atmosphere granger and hedstrom 2011 phillips et al 2016 indeed the latent heat flux showed an annual course with a minimum of 12 4 w m 2 in winter and a maximum of 131 1 w m 2 in summer although no study was performed previously in lake mirim these values are within the range found by fink et al 2014a for lake constance european alps for the 1984 2011 period minimum of 15 3 w m 2 in winter and maximum of 76 0 w m 2 in summer another key factor that contributes to increasing the evaporation in the lake is the external forcing factors such as wind both speed and direction which increases the evaporation in shallow water accelerating the heat fluxes in these environments the turbulence caused by the wind refreshes the air above the water and prevents it from becoming saturated which changes the surface area over which heat is lost to the atmosphere o sullivan and reynolds 2005 feng and li 2010 the results also indicated that the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget nevertheless the river inflows mainly the cebollati river cause a local effect over the simulated wst in the lake fig 6b which can lead mixing regime shifts from dimictic to warm monomictic kirillin et al 2013 and affect the stratification heat and nutrient fluxes and biota råman vinnå et al 2017 5 4 model capability and limitations the coupled models proved to be suitable for representing the wst dynamic and the heat fluxes radiative latent and sensible components in lake mirim the smallest wst peaks were reproduced although with some biases december 2004 and february 2010 this can be explained by errors in the input data temperature and precipitation biases associated with the modis derived lst product mod11a1 phillips et al 2016 or errors in the numerical solution methods discretization and iteration errors of the coupled models wu 2008 these limitations have also been invoked in other studies fink et al 2014a råman vinnå et al 2017 although wst studies in lake mirim have not been conducted previously our approach coupling a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic model with validated modis derived water surface temperature well represented the wst and surface heat fluxes dynamics in the lake describing the spatial and temporal daily monthly seasonal and inter annual variations these spatial and temporal patterns are difficult to explore using other approaches such as remote sensing techniques where the cloud cover and the number of available clear sky images is a limitation during some seasons especially autumn and winter alcântara et al 2010b crosman and horel 2009 sima et al 2013 although a longer time span would give a more stable result there are limitations to extend the simulation to account for more recent years the lake water levels monitoring suffered from a great loss in continuity in more recent years due to the official monitoring agency intermittent funding another uncertainly is related to the sluice system operation in the são gonçalo channel which is a hard task to reproduce for additional years without an uninterrupted continuous monitoring of the lake water level munar et al 2018 6 conclusion in summary we have described the first attempt to investigate the pattern of the long term water surface temperature and surface heat fluxes in a large subtropical shallow lake coupling distributed hydrological modeling and hydrodynamic modeling with remote sensing techniques our findings indicated that the atmospheric longwave radiation is the main heat input for lake mirim which is mostly compensated by the longwave radiation emitted from the lake s water surface another source of heat loss is through the latent heat flux i e increase in the evaporation rate due to increases in incoming surface solar radiation and atmospheric saturation where the shallow water due to the low thermal mass responds more rapidly to atmospheric forcings e g wind stress relative humidity air temperature shortwave radiation compared to the deeper water in addition the heat flux from the river inflows which are a point source of thermal contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake and does not cause marked spatial variations in the annual mean of wst the present study goes beyond the previously reported work being the first long term and synoptic scale approach in lake mirim allowing us to contribute to an improved understanding of the main physical processes surface heat budget that occur in this ecosystem the overall methodology proposed here could be used as a tool to improve the comprehension of dynamics of systems under anthropic and natural stressors ecosystem functions and services and helping to support effective water system management furthermore this approach may be

6344,evapotranspiration et and its dominant controls show obvious elevational pattern on the qinghai tibet plateau due to heterogeneous environmental conditions regulated by altitude to understand better how and why et varies at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed this study measured and retrieved soil moisture solar radiation and et data between 3300 m and 4700 m and further investigated the influence of water and energy conditions on et results showed that the mean annual terrestrial et was 343 and 360 mm in this watershed in 2014 and 2015 respectively the higher et mainly appeared in the midstream of shaliu river and on the southern region of qinghai lake while the sand land on the east of qinghai lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest values the et increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude and its peak value appeared at 3600 3700 m the dominant controls for et switched from water conditions to energy conditions with the increase of elevation the maximum limited fraction predicted value actual value predicted value 100 of et by water condition soil moisture content achieved 11 2 and 10 1 at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were 7 3 and 5 4 at 3300 3650 m respectively the maximum limited fraction of et by energy condition shortwave radiation and air temperature achieved 24 4 and 29 8 at 4650 4700 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were 10 8 and 11 9 at 3650 4700 m respectively overall the energy conditions were more influential factors limiting the et in the entire watershed and this conclusion is critical for the management of regional terrestrial ecosystem with future climate change keywords solar radiation air temperature soil moisture content evapotranspiration qinghai lake watershed 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important component of energy and water fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere and hence is a critical driver of earth s climate system at different scales zhang et al 2016 due to the complex interaction between water soil air and plant evapotranspiration is affected simultaneously by solar radiation temperature wind speed humidity plant properties and soil moisture allen et al 1998 among which solar radiation and temperature determine how much energy is available for evapotranspiration while soil moisture determines how much water can be evapotranspired by soil and plant the integration of energy and water not only dominates the hydrologic cycle but also has profound influence on ecological functions nemani et al 2003 seddon et al 2016 simulated results by the simultaneous heat and water shaw model demonstrated that the energy and water limited effect should be included in the methods to estimate evapotranspiration in cold and dry climates sun et al 2016 due to varying topography climate plant and soil energy and water conditions in mountain areas are always highly heterogeneous and have diverse influences on evapotranspiration li et al 2008 goulden and bales 2014 found that water limitation decreased with the increase of elevation to 1000 m and cold limitation increased with elevation above 2000 m in california s sierra nevada usa however there are still some critical challenges for understanding the control of water and energy conditions on evapotranspiration in mountain areas firstly though soil moisture is a more direct and fundamental factor affecting evapotranspiration process than precipitation the preferred indicator of water condition at large scale was mostly precipitation because of its accessibility e g zhang and wilmking 2010 goulden and bales 2014 nevertheless the spatial pattern of soil moisture and precipitation may mismatch owing to complex infiltration processes wei and dirmeyer 2012 sun et al 2015 secondly previous studies mainly focused on the effect of temperature on evapotranspiration while solar radiation was usually neglected even though it also plays a key role in the variation of evaporation roderick and farquhar 2002 therefore it is essential to systematically evaluate the influence of soil moisture temperature and solar radiation on evapotranspiration in mountain areas which are widespread throughout the world the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest plateau in the world with an average elevation greater than 4000 m above sea level asl because of the unique atmospheric circulation and fragile high altitude ecosystem the qinghai tibet plateau is particularly sensitive to climate change yao et al 2013 observational data showed that the surface temperatures increased 1 8 c from 1960 to 2007 on the qinghai tibet plateau which was more rapid than both its surrounding regions and the global mean rate wang et al 2008 one of the key reasons for this significant warming may be the increase of surface shortwave radiation pan et al 2017 moreover the spatial pattern of warming was heterogeneous which led to different hydrologic and ecological responses on the qinghai tibet plateau qin et al 2009 found that the warming rate increased between 3000 m and 4800 m and then became stable near the highest elevations zhang and wilmking 2010 also revealed that trees were mainly limited by temperature at higher elevations and showed an obvious drought stress signal at lower elevations in the qinghai south mountain overall the temperature variation has profound influence on evapotranspiration change and ecological dynamic on the qinghai tibet plateau and their spatial pattern exhibits high heterogeneity however the complex interactions between evapotranspiration soil moisture solar radiation and temperature at different altitudes have not been studied in detail two fundamental questions remain i how do the evapotranspiration and corresponding environmental factors change with the increase of altitude ii to what extent do the water and energy conditions limit evapotranspiration on the qinghai tibet plateau the objective of this study therefore was to identify the elevational pattern of evapotranspiration and quantitatively determine its control by soil moisture solar radiation and air temperature at different altitudes taking the qinghai lake watershed as a focused example 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai lake watershed is located in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau and lies in the high altitude cold and semiarid climate zone fig 1 qinghai lake is the largest inland saline lake in china with an altitude above 3194 m asl it is a closed catchment lake with no surface water outflow and receives drainage from a watershed of 29661 km2 ma et al 2018 therefore qinghai lake watershed is an ideal place to study the hydrological cycle and water budget in the alpine region the mean annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation between 1960 and 2015 in the qinghai lake watershed were 0 13 c 355 and 925 mm respectively the soil types are classified as haplic kastanozem and cryi haplic kastanozem according to the world reference base for soil resources hu et al 2016a the dominant vegetation types are kobresia meadow kmd potentilla fruticosa shrub pfsh and achnatherum splendens steppe asst and they accounted for more than 75 of the total land area in the entire watershed 2 2 soil investigations in the entire catchment fifty soil moisture sample plots were selected randomly in our field campaign liu et al 2017 fig 1 which represent the dominant topography soil and vegetation in the qinghai lake watershed each sample plot has a length and width of 2000 m to cover at least one intact modis pixel see 2 4 and five sample points were set up at the center and four corners within each sample plot respectively then soil moisture content at the depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 50 cm for all the sample points was measured by the gravimetric method in july and august 2015 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile soil bulk density at the same depths for all the sample points was measured by the core method in august 2015 walter et al 2016 the average value of five sample points was used to represent the mean soil moisture content and soil bulk density of each sample plot in addition the soil moisture instrument ech2o 5te decagon devices usa was used to measure soil moisture content at 10 20 40 60 100 cm depth in the kmd pfsh and asst respectively with 10 min intervals fig 1 the location vegetation and soil properties of these three sites were described in zhang et al 2016 the calibration method of the ech2o 5te sensor to measure soil moisture content can be found in li et al 2013 2 3 meteorological observations the eddy covariance ec system was used to measure energy and water flux in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem and on the qinghai lake fig 1 the observation and calculation method of solar radiation sensible heat latent heat precipitation lake level and other meteorological parameters can be found in li et al 2016 and ma et al 2018 2 4 soil moisture retrieval previous study showed that the surface soil moisture is more relevant to the ts ndvi relationship relationship between land surface temperature ts and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi than to the ts friedl and davis 1994 based on the ts ndvi relationship space sandholt et al 2002 analyzed the scatterplot between these two parameters and defined temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi as follows 1 tvdi t s t s min t s max t s min where t s is the land surface temperature c of any pixel t s min is the minimum land surface temperature c for a given ndvi value and corresponds to the wet edge of the ts ndvi relationship space ts min a1 b1ndvi where a1 and b1 are coefficients of the regression equation for the wet edge of soil moisture content t s max represents the maximum land surface temperature c for a given ndvi value and corresponds to the dry edge of the ts ndvi relationship space ts max a2 b2 ndvi where a2 and b2 are coefficients of the regression equation for the dry edge of soil moisture content tvdi 1 indicates a limited moisture supply at the dry edge while tvdi 0 indicates an unlimited moisture supply at the wet edge if the correlations between soil moisture content in various soil layers and tvdi are significant the monitoring tvdi can reveal the soil water conditions at the corresponding depths wang et al 2010 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets were used to retrieve soil moisture in the qinghai lake watershed because the field measurements of soil moisture content in the whole watershed only lasted 7 days in each month the retrieval and validation of soil moisture content was performed at the daily scale the proposed soil moisture content was generated using the daily modis land surface temperature product mod11a1 and 16 day modis vegetation indices product mod13a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km respectively the measured soil moisture content in the whole watershed in august 2015 was used to obtain the correlation between soil moisture content and tvdi and the measured values in july 2015 were used to validate the retrieved results meanwhile the retrieved mean monthly soil moisture content from january 2014 to december 2015 in the kmd ecosystem was compared with the measured value by ech2o method 2 5 solar radiation retrieval net radiation r n w m 2 can be expressed as 2 r n r swd r swu r lwd r lwu where r swd r swu r lwd and r lwu are the incoming shortwave outgoing shortwave incoming longwave and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 respectively the calculation of shortwave radiation and longwave radiation was the same as tian et al 2013 all parameters for the retrieval of solar radiation by eq 2 except air temperature can be obtained directly or indirectly from modis datasets 16 day mcd43b3 8 day mod11a2 16 day mod13a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km respectively the air temperature was obtained from national meteorological stations china http data cma cn en and further interpolated to the whole catchment with a spatial resolution of 1 km by the gradient plus inverse distance squared method nalder and wein 1998 the retrieved r n was validated with the measured r n in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem respectively 2 6 evapotranspiration retrieval the three temperature model was used to retrieve evapotranspiration and it is based on the surface energy balance equation as follows qiu et al 1996 1998 3 let r n g h where let is the latent heat flux w m 2 in which l is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 106 w m 2 mm 1 and et is the evapotranspiration mm g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 that can be calculated as 4 h ρ a c p t s t a r a where ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure mj kg 1 c 1 t a is the air temperature c r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 supposing there is a small reference surface of dry soil with no water and the atmosphere conditions around the reference surface are not modified significantly then the r a of the dry soil and around the dry soil are approximately equal under this condition due to the lack of water the let in the dry soil is negligible therefore the r a can be calculated as qiu et al 1998 1999 5 r a ρ a c p t sd t a r n s d g d where t sd r n s d and g d are the soil temperature c net radiation w m 2 and soil heat flux w m 2 of the reference dry soil respectively thus by combining eqs 3 5 soil evaporation l e s w m 2 can be calculated as 6 l e s r n s g r n s d g d t sm t a t sd t a where r n s and t sm are the net radiation w m 2 and surface temperature c of the actual soil respectively the calculation method of r n s g r n s d g d t sm and t sd in eq 6 can be found in tian et al 2013 with the same method an imitation canopy a canopy without transpiration was introduced and the r a can be estimated as qiu et al 1996 1999 7 r a ρ a c p t cp t a r n c p where t cp and r n c p are surface temperature c and net radiation w m 2 of the imitation canopy respectively by combining eqs 3 4 and 7 vegetation transpiration l e c w m 2 can be calculated as 8 l e c r n c r n c p t cm t a t cp t a where r nc and t cm are net radiation w m 2 and surface temperature c of the actual canopy respectively the calculation method of r n c r n c p t cm and t cp in eq 8 can be found in tian et al 2013 eqs 6 and 8 can only be used in pure soil and pure vegetated pixels for the mixed pixels of soil and vegetation let w m 2 can be weighed as tian et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 9 let 1 f l e s f l e c 10 f ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where f is the fractional canopy coverage dimensionless ndv i min and ndv i max are the ndvi threshold equal to 0 and 0 75 respectively carlson et al 1995 when the instantaneous et is estimated the daily et can be derived as follows jackson et al 1983 11 e t d e t i 2 n e π sin π t n e where e t d is the daily et mm and e t i is the instantaneous et mm n e is the daily number of et hours h equaling to the time interval between sunrise and sunset minus two tian et al 2013 t is the time interval h between sunrise and the remote sensing data collecting time the retrieved et was validated with the measured et by eddy covariance method at the ecosystem scale and with the calculated et by water balance method at the watershed scale the annual water balance equation for the land and the qinghai lake can be expressed as follows respectively 12 e t land p land r δ s w s 13 r e lake δ s lake p lake where e t land is the calculated terrestrial evapotranspiration mm by water balance equation p land is the terrestrial precipitation mm and was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset http dam itpcas ac cn rs q data chen et al 2011 r is the runoff mm to qinghai lake and was calculated by eq 13 δ s w s is the soil water storage change mm and was calculated by the retrieved soil moisture content and the measured soil bulk density e lake is the measured evaporation mm by the eddy covariance method on the qinghai lake li et al 2016 δ s lake is the water storage change mm in the qinghai lake and was calculated by the measured lake level p lake is the measured precipitation mm on the qinghai lake 2 7 statistical analysis the longwave radiation was calculated by the land surface temperature and air temperature tian et al 2013 to avoid the internal effect of temperature on net radiation shortwave radiation was used as the indicator of solar radiation in multiple regression analysis the variation partitioning could identify common and unique contributions to model prediction and is more suitable than analyzing the individual contributions of regressors via their partial correlation coefficients peres neto et al 2006 therefore it was firstly used to estimate the interactive influence of different hydrothermal factors mean annual shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content on annual evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 at all altitudes with 50 m intervals using canoco 5 0 http www canoco5 com then the curve fitting method was used to analyze the correlation between annual evapotranspiration and corresponding influence factors at particular altitudes with spss 20 0 ibm usa in 2014 and 2015 respectively lastly the annual evapotranspiration was predicted by the best fitting equation at other altitudes based on the actual and predicted annual evapotranspiration its limited fraction was estimated as follows goulden and bales 2014 14 l f i e t p i e t a e t p i 100 where l f i is the limited fraction by influence factor i e t p i is the predicted annual et mm by influence factor i e t a is the actual annual et mm retrieved by the remote sensing method the performance of all models was evaluated by the mean absolute error mae mm and mean absolute percent error mape which is defined as xiong et al 2015 15 mae 1 n i 1 n m i o i 16 mape 100 o 1 n i 1 n m i o i where m i and o i are the paired model retrieval and observation values respectively n is the number of data points o is the mean value of the observations 3 results 3 1 model validation the correlation between soil moisture content above 30 cm depth and tvdi was significant in the qinghai lake watershed p 0 001 fig a1 indicating that the tvdi method can be used to estimate soil moisture condition to a depth of 30 cm in the study area moreover with the increase of soil depth the coefficient of determination gradually decreased indicating that the model performance is better for the retrieval of shallow soil moisture content than for the deep soil these results were consistent with the studies in yongding river basin china wang et al 2010 and in argentine pampas argentina holzman et al 2014 at both the plot and the watershed scales the retrieved soil moisture content had a significant positive correlation with the measured value p 0 001 fig a2 therefore the tvdi method can be used to analyze both the temporal variation and the spatial pattern of soil moisture content in the qinghai lake watershed the variability of measured soil moisture content is higher than retrieved value mainly because the former one only represented the soil moisture condition at one or five points while the latter one was the average value of one modis pixel about 1 km2 the retrieved net radiation had high consistency with the measured one fig a3 the mean values of retrieved net radiation in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem were 346 367 and 364 w m 2 from 2014 to 2015 while the measured values at the same time were 342 370 and 344 w m 2 respectively the mape of retrieved net radiation in kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem were 8 9 8 8 and 10 2 respectively therefore the estimation of net radiation in the qinghai lake watershed was reliable and the values could be further used to analyze the influence of solar radiation on evapotranspiration at the ecosystem scale the retrieved monthly evapotranspiration had similar temporal trends with the measured data by eddy covariance method fig 2 for the kmd ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 478 mm and 487 mm while the measured values were 487 mm and 474 mm respectively for the pfsh ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 468 mm and 495 mm while the measured values were 492 mm and 459 mm respectively for the asst ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 435 mm and 490 mm while the measured values were 433 mm and 465 mm respectively therefore the mae of retrieved evapotranspiration were all less than 8 for three domain terrestrial ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed moreover the model performance was better for the kmd ecosystem than for the pfsh and asst ecosystem because the latter two were patchy vegetation and the hydrological processes had obvious difference between vegetation patches and interpatch zones jiang et al 2017 at the watershed scale the mean retrieved evapotranspiration on the land was 343 mm and 360 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding values calculated by water balance equation were 341 mm and 375 mm fig 3 therefore the relative errors were 0 6 and 4 0 indicating perfect performance of the three temperature model for evapotranspiration retrieval in the qinghai lake watershed 3 2 spatial pattern of evapotranspiration the retrieved terrestrial evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed ranged from 183 to 541 mm in 2014 and from 148 to 600 mm in 2015 respectively fig 4 indicating the spatial variability of the former is smaller than the latter though the mean annual evapotranspiration in 2014 was 17 mm lower than that in 2015 the spatial pattern in these two years was similar the higher value mainly appeared in the midstream of shaliu river and on the southern region of qinghai lake while the sand land on the east of qinghai lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest evapotranspiration we analyzed the characteristics of hydrothermal conditions at 3300 4700 m and the area at this altitude range accounted for 87 of the total land area in the qinghai lake watershed the shortwave radiation ranged between 510 and 520 w m 2 below 3900 m and had no obvious changes in these areas fig 5 however it decreased remarkably with the increase of altitude above 3900 m especially in 2014 and the maximum difference between 2014 and 2015 achieved 23 w m 2 at 4300 4350 m the mean annual air temperature in both 2014 and 2015 decreased with the increase of altitude and their lapse rates were about 0 60 and 0 64 c per 100 m respectively it was lower in 2014 than that in 2015 below 4000 m and was opposite above 4000 m the soil moisture content increased with the increase of altitude and the rise rate in 2014 was higher than that in 2015 its average value was slightly lower in 2014 0 23 m3 m 3 than that in 2015 0 24 m3 m 3 below 4200 m and was opposite above 4200 m the evapotranspiration increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude and both the maximum values appeared at 3600 3700 m in 2014 and 2015 moreover it was higher in 2015 than that in 2014 at all altitudes and the maximum difference achieved 27 mm at 4150 4200 m 3 3 water and energy influence on evapotranspiration the variation partitioning results showed that the shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content could explain 94 2 and 93 8 of the spatial variation of evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 6 however the single explained percentages of each of them were all less than 22 while the couple explained percentages of each two of them were all less than 20 the integration of all of them achieved 51 3 and 48 2 in 2014 and 2015 respectively therefore the spatial variation of evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed was controlled synchronously by shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content based on the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration water condition soil moisture content and energy condition shortwave radiation air temperature in the qinghai lake watershed we can infer that the best hydrothermal conditions for maximum evapotranspiration appear at approximately 3650 m and our field measurement also showed that the plant at this altitude had the maximum stomatal conductance the evapotranspiration was mainly controlled by water condition below 3650 m and by energy condition above 3650 m the evapotranspiration had significant logarithmic correlation with soil moisture content at 3300 3650 m and the slope in 2015 was larger than that in 2014 fig 7 the evapotranspiration showed strong exponential correlation with both shortwave radiation and air temperature at 3650 4700 m and its rate of change became quicker with the increase of shortwave radiation and slower with the increase of air temperature the evapotranspiration was predicted simultaneously by its binary regression with shortwave radiation and air temperature at 3650 4700 m energy predicted and by its logarithmic relation with soil moisture content at 3300 3650 m water predicted the predicted evapotranspiration was about 43 mm and 39 mm higher than the actual evapotranspiration at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding difference was approximately 96 mm and 127 mm at 4650 4700 m therefore the maximum limited fraction of evapotranspiration by water condition soil moisture content achieved 11 2 and 10 1 at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were about 7 3 and 5 4 at 3300 3650 m respectively fig 8 the maximum limited fraction of evapotranspiration by energy condition solar radiation and air temperature achieved 24 4 and 29 8 at 4650 4700 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were about 10 8 and 11 9 at 3650 4700 m respectively therefore the energy conditions were the primary factors limiting the evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed and its limitation was higher in 2015 than that in 2014 this result was consistent with the findings of haibei alpine meadow ecosystem research station in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau i e soil temperature dominated the ecological process while the effect of soil moisture was small hu et al 2016b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in soil moisture retrieval soil moisture content is a more reasonable indicator of water condition than precipitation for evapotranspiration estimation especially in mountain areas technology has advanced considerably to determine soil moisture at a point in the past decades with the development of varied electrical sensors robinson et al 2008 however there are still many challenges to obtain soil moisture at large scale and in freeze thaw regions for example the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products is generally hampered by the scale mismatch between in situ observations and satellite footprints wanders et al 2012 the soil moisture content in the qinghai lake watershed was retrieved by the tvdi method and further used to calculate soil water storage and analyze the influence of water condition on evapotranspiration the calculated soil water storage change from 1 january to 31 december in the entire catchment was 34 9 and 3 4 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively the relative error of retrieved soil moisture content was less than 9 comparing with the measured values by the gravimetric method in july 2015 even with the maximum error the uncertainty of retrieved soil moisture storage change was less than 7 mm and only accounted for about 2 of the annual evapotranspiration therefore though the coefficient of determination r2 between retrieved and measured soil moisture content at the whole watershed was only 0 45 fig a2 the estimated evapotranspiration at the watershed scale is much better fig 3 meanwhile the spatial distribution of retrieved soil moisture also had the similar pattern with the field measured results i e the kmd and pfsh ecosystem had relatively high soil moisture whereas the asst ecosystem had relatively low soil moisture zhang and li 2017 however the correlation between soil moisture content and tvdi in this study was only based on the growing season data hence its applicability for the retrieval of soil moisture during non growing season should be evaluated previous study showed that during the long winter period from november to march soil was frozen and liquid soil water content was very low in the qinghai lake watershed zhang and li 2017 therefore further study on the retrieval and validation of soil moisture content during freezing thawing processes is necessary 4 2 water and energy influence on evapotranspiration at different altitudes water and energy conditions had profound influence on evapotranspiration at different spatial scales cammalleri et al 2012 yan et al 2012 however the influence mechanisms were varied at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed below 3650 m both the shortwave radiation and the air temperature were high whereas the soil moisture content was low therefore the evapotranspiration was mainly limited by water condition and will increase with the rising of soil moisture content this is consistent with the findings from wu et al 2016 i e the achnatherum splendens predominantly used shallow soil water over the entire growing seasons regardless of soil water availability at 3650 3900 m both the evapotranspiration and the air temperature decreased with the increase of altitude while there was no significant changing trend of shortwave radiation indicating that the air temperature was the main influence factor at this elevation range this was consistent with the findings from seddon et al 2016 i e alpine regions showed strong sensitivity to temperature at 3900 4350 m the evapotranspiration shortwave radiation and air temperature all decreased with the increase of altitude however both the evapotranspiration and the shortwave radiation in 2014 were lower than these in 2015 while the air temperature was opposite indicating that the influence of shortwave radiation was larger than air temperature at this elevation range above 4350 m both the evapotranspiration and the air temperature in 2014 were higher than these in 2015 while the shortwave radiation was opposite indicating that the influence of air temperature was larger than shortwave radiation at this elevation range these results were also verified by the measured data at the ecosystem scale ma et al 2018 i e the dominant factors for evapotranspiration changed from water conditions to temperature conditions with increasing elevation they are also consistent with the simulation results obtained in mongolia i e evapotranspiration maintains a negative relationship with temperature under the water limited condition but a positive relationship with temperature under the energy limited condition sun et al 2016 considering the area of different altitudes the evapotranspiration in approximately 28 3 40 1 and 31 6 of the area at 3300 4700 m in the qinghai lake watershed were primarily influenced by soil moisture content shortwave radiation and air temperature respectively however our results were only based on the annual data in 2014 and 2015 and there may be some differences for other years and in different months 4 3 variation of evapotranspiration with climate change the response of evapotranspiration to climate change is still unsettled on one hand the rise of air temperature is expected to make near surface air drier and result in an increase of evapotranspiration on the other hand the widespread decreases in solar irradiance due to increasing cloud coverage and aerosol concentration will weaken or even outweigh the influence by rising air temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 previous study showed that the high emission rcp 8 5 would lead as much as 4 1 c warming expand high rates of evapotranspiration 700 m elevation upslope and increase basin evapotranspiration by 28 for 2085 2100 in california s sierra nevada usa goulden and bales 2014 however this study only considered the rise of air temperature but the potential influence of precipitation and solar radiation change was not considered for the entire qinghai tibet plateau previous study showed that the obvious increase of temperature in the high altitude area qin et al 2009 will accelerate vegetation growth increase evapotranspiration shen et al 2015 enhance glacier melt yao et al 2012 and the overlap of precipitation and temperature change may result in runoff reduction yang et al 2014 qinghai lake watershed showed a warming trend of 0 31 c per decade and no significant changing trend of precipitation from 1961 to 2012 cui and li 2016 meanwhile according to the in situ measurement at the gangcha weather station in the qinghai lake watershed solar radiation decreased slightly over the past 50 years because the evapotranspiration in 3650 3900 m was mainly influenced by air temperature we can infer that the warming climate will enhance the soil evaporation and plant transpiration hence expand the maximum evapotranspiration upslope and increase annual evapotranspiration in 3650 3900 m this inference has also been validated by the swim model i e the increase of evapotranspiration for 2081 2100 would concentrate on the midstream of qinghai lake watershed zhou et al 2017 however to what extent the evapotranspiration will increase under different future climate change scenarios need to be further studied via modeling 5 conclusions this research seek to show the elevational pattern of evapotranspiration and its controls by water and energy conditions at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed the evapotranspiration increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude with its peak value appeared at 3600 3700 m our field investigation also found the maximum stomatal conductance and soil carbon density at this altitude range indicating the preferred hydrothermal conditions and the critical ecological functions at the middle elevation in these mountain areas the evapotranspiration was controlled by water conditions at lower elevation and by energy conditions at upper elevation but the latter ones were more influential factors limiting the evapotranspiration in the entire watershed considering the change of air temperature and solar radiation projected for future climate in this region the maximum evapotranspiration with best hydrothermal conditions will likely expand upslope along the elevation and the annual evapotranspiration will increase in the future these results provide enhanced understanding of not only the spatial pattern of energy and water fluxes on the qinghai tibet plateau but also the potential paths of hydrologic process and ecological evolution with climate change in cold and dry regions which is critical for the management of regional and even global terrestrial ecosystem declaration of competing interest

6344,evapotranspiration et and its dominant controls show obvious elevational pattern on the qinghai tibet plateau due to heterogeneous environmental conditions regulated by altitude to understand better how and why et varies at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed this study measured and retrieved soil moisture solar radiation and et data between 3300 m and 4700 m and further investigated the influence of water and energy conditions on et results showed that the mean annual terrestrial et was 343 and 360 mm in this watershed in 2014 and 2015 respectively the higher et mainly appeared in the midstream of shaliu river and on the southern region of qinghai lake while the sand land on the east of qinghai lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest values the et increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude and its peak value appeared at 3600 3700 m the dominant controls for et switched from water conditions to energy conditions with the increase of elevation the maximum limited fraction predicted value actual value predicted value 100 of et by water condition soil moisture content achieved 11 2 and 10 1 at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were 7 3 and 5 4 at 3300 3650 m respectively the maximum limited fraction of et by energy condition shortwave radiation and air temperature achieved 24 4 and 29 8 at 4650 4700 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were 10 8 and 11 9 at 3650 4700 m respectively overall the energy conditions were more influential factors limiting the et in the entire watershed and this conclusion is critical for the management of regional terrestrial ecosystem with future climate change keywords solar radiation air temperature soil moisture content evapotranspiration qinghai lake watershed 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important component of energy and water fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere and hence is a critical driver of earth s climate system at different scales zhang et al 2016 due to the complex interaction between water soil air and plant evapotranspiration is affected simultaneously by solar radiation temperature wind speed humidity plant properties and soil moisture allen et al 1998 among which solar radiation and temperature determine how much energy is available for evapotranspiration while soil moisture determines how much water can be evapotranspired by soil and plant the integration of energy and water not only dominates the hydrologic cycle but also has profound influence on ecological functions nemani et al 2003 seddon et al 2016 simulated results by the simultaneous heat and water shaw model demonstrated that the energy and water limited effect should be included in the methods to estimate evapotranspiration in cold and dry climates sun et al 2016 due to varying topography climate plant and soil energy and water conditions in mountain areas are always highly heterogeneous and have diverse influences on evapotranspiration li et al 2008 goulden and bales 2014 found that water limitation decreased with the increase of elevation to 1000 m and cold limitation increased with elevation above 2000 m in california s sierra nevada usa however there are still some critical challenges for understanding the control of water and energy conditions on evapotranspiration in mountain areas firstly though soil moisture is a more direct and fundamental factor affecting evapotranspiration process than precipitation the preferred indicator of water condition at large scale was mostly precipitation because of its accessibility e g zhang and wilmking 2010 goulden and bales 2014 nevertheless the spatial pattern of soil moisture and precipitation may mismatch owing to complex infiltration processes wei and dirmeyer 2012 sun et al 2015 secondly previous studies mainly focused on the effect of temperature on evapotranspiration while solar radiation was usually neglected even though it also plays a key role in the variation of evaporation roderick and farquhar 2002 therefore it is essential to systematically evaluate the influence of soil moisture temperature and solar radiation on evapotranspiration in mountain areas which are widespread throughout the world the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest plateau in the world with an average elevation greater than 4000 m above sea level asl because of the unique atmospheric circulation and fragile high altitude ecosystem the qinghai tibet plateau is particularly sensitive to climate change yao et al 2013 observational data showed that the surface temperatures increased 1 8 c from 1960 to 2007 on the qinghai tibet plateau which was more rapid than both its surrounding regions and the global mean rate wang et al 2008 one of the key reasons for this significant warming may be the increase of surface shortwave radiation pan et al 2017 moreover the spatial pattern of warming was heterogeneous which led to different hydrologic and ecological responses on the qinghai tibet plateau qin et al 2009 found that the warming rate increased between 3000 m and 4800 m and then became stable near the highest elevations zhang and wilmking 2010 also revealed that trees were mainly limited by temperature at higher elevations and showed an obvious drought stress signal at lower elevations in the qinghai south mountain overall the temperature variation has profound influence on evapotranspiration change and ecological dynamic on the qinghai tibet plateau and their spatial pattern exhibits high heterogeneity however the complex interactions between evapotranspiration soil moisture solar radiation and temperature at different altitudes have not been studied in detail two fundamental questions remain i how do the evapotranspiration and corresponding environmental factors change with the increase of altitude ii to what extent do the water and energy conditions limit evapotranspiration on the qinghai tibet plateau the objective of this study therefore was to identify the elevational pattern of evapotranspiration and quantitatively determine its control by soil moisture solar radiation and air temperature at different altitudes taking the qinghai lake watershed as a focused example 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai lake watershed is located in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau and lies in the high altitude cold and semiarid climate zone fig 1 qinghai lake is the largest inland saline lake in china with an altitude above 3194 m asl it is a closed catchment lake with no surface water outflow and receives drainage from a watershed of 29661 km2 ma et al 2018 therefore qinghai lake watershed is an ideal place to study the hydrological cycle and water budget in the alpine region the mean annual air temperature precipitation and evaporation between 1960 and 2015 in the qinghai lake watershed were 0 13 c 355 and 925 mm respectively the soil types are classified as haplic kastanozem and cryi haplic kastanozem according to the world reference base for soil resources hu et al 2016a the dominant vegetation types are kobresia meadow kmd potentilla fruticosa shrub pfsh and achnatherum splendens steppe asst and they accounted for more than 75 of the total land area in the entire watershed 2 2 soil investigations in the entire catchment fifty soil moisture sample plots were selected randomly in our field campaign liu et al 2017 fig 1 which represent the dominant topography soil and vegetation in the qinghai lake watershed each sample plot has a length and width of 2000 m to cover at least one intact modis pixel see 2 4 and five sample points were set up at the center and four corners within each sample plot respectively then soil moisture content at the depths of 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 50 cm for all the sample points was measured by the gravimetric method in july and august 2015 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile soil bulk density at the same depths for all the sample points was measured by the core method in august 2015 walter et al 2016 the average value of five sample points was used to represent the mean soil moisture content and soil bulk density of each sample plot in addition the soil moisture instrument ech2o 5te decagon devices usa was used to measure soil moisture content at 10 20 40 60 100 cm depth in the kmd pfsh and asst respectively with 10 min intervals fig 1 the location vegetation and soil properties of these three sites were described in zhang et al 2016 the calibration method of the ech2o 5te sensor to measure soil moisture content can be found in li et al 2013 2 3 meteorological observations the eddy covariance ec system was used to measure energy and water flux in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem and on the qinghai lake fig 1 the observation and calculation method of solar radiation sensible heat latent heat precipitation lake level and other meteorological parameters can be found in li et al 2016 and ma et al 2018 2 4 soil moisture retrieval previous study showed that the surface soil moisture is more relevant to the ts ndvi relationship relationship between land surface temperature ts and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi than to the ts friedl and davis 1994 based on the ts ndvi relationship space sandholt et al 2002 analyzed the scatterplot between these two parameters and defined temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi as follows 1 tvdi t s t s min t s max t s min where t s is the land surface temperature c of any pixel t s min is the minimum land surface temperature c for a given ndvi value and corresponds to the wet edge of the ts ndvi relationship space ts min a1 b1ndvi where a1 and b1 are coefficients of the regression equation for the wet edge of soil moisture content t s max represents the maximum land surface temperature c for a given ndvi value and corresponds to the dry edge of the ts ndvi relationship space ts max a2 b2 ndvi where a2 and b2 are coefficients of the regression equation for the dry edge of soil moisture content tvdi 1 indicates a limited moisture supply at the dry edge while tvdi 0 indicates an unlimited moisture supply at the wet edge if the correlations between soil moisture content in various soil layers and tvdi are significant the monitoring tvdi can reveal the soil water conditions at the corresponding depths wang et al 2010 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets were used to retrieve soil moisture in the qinghai lake watershed because the field measurements of soil moisture content in the whole watershed only lasted 7 days in each month the retrieval and validation of soil moisture content was performed at the daily scale the proposed soil moisture content was generated using the daily modis land surface temperature product mod11a1 and 16 day modis vegetation indices product mod13a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km respectively the measured soil moisture content in the whole watershed in august 2015 was used to obtain the correlation between soil moisture content and tvdi and the measured values in july 2015 were used to validate the retrieved results meanwhile the retrieved mean monthly soil moisture content from january 2014 to december 2015 in the kmd ecosystem was compared with the measured value by ech2o method 2 5 solar radiation retrieval net radiation r n w m 2 can be expressed as 2 r n r swd r swu r lwd r lwu where r swd r swu r lwd and r lwu are the incoming shortwave outgoing shortwave incoming longwave and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 respectively the calculation of shortwave radiation and longwave radiation was the same as tian et al 2013 all parameters for the retrieval of solar radiation by eq 2 except air temperature can be obtained directly or indirectly from modis datasets 16 day mcd43b3 8 day mod11a2 16 day mod13a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km respectively the air temperature was obtained from national meteorological stations china http data cma cn en and further interpolated to the whole catchment with a spatial resolution of 1 km by the gradient plus inverse distance squared method nalder and wein 1998 the retrieved r n was validated with the measured r n in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem respectively 2 6 evapotranspiration retrieval the three temperature model was used to retrieve evapotranspiration and it is based on the surface energy balance equation as follows qiu et al 1996 1998 3 let r n g h where let is the latent heat flux w m 2 in which l is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 106 w m 2 mm 1 and et is the evapotranspiration mm g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 that can be calculated as 4 h ρ a c p t s t a r a where ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure mj kg 1 c 1 t a is the air temperature c r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 supposing there is a small reference surface of dry soil with no water and the atmosphere conditions around the reference surface are not modified significantly then the r a of the dry soil and around the dry soil are approximately equal under this condition due to the lack of water the let in the dry soil is negligible therefore the r a can be calculated as qiu et al 1998 1999 5 r a ρ a c p t sd t a r n s d g d where t sd r n s d and g d are the soil temperature c net radiation w m 2 and soil heat flux w m 2 of the reference dry soil respectively thus by combining eqs 3 5 soil evaporation l e s w m 2 can be calculated as 6 l e s r n s g r n s d g d t sm t a t sd t a where r n s and t sm are the net radiation w m 2 and surface temperature c of the actual soil respectively the calculation method of r n s g r n s d g d t sm and t sd in eq 6 can be found in tian et al 2013 with the same method an imitation canopy a canopy without transpiration was introduced and the r a can be estimated as qiu et al 1996 1999 7 r a ρ a c p t cp t a r n c p where t cp and r n c p are surface temperature c and net radiation w m 2 of the imitation canopy respectively by combining eqs 3 4 and 7 vegetation transpiration l e c w m 2 can be calculated as 8 l e c r n c r n c p t cm t a t cp t a where r nc and t cm are net radiation w m 2 and surface temperature c of the actual canopy respectively the calculation method of r n c r n c p t cm and t cp in eq 8 can be found in tian et al 2013 eqs 6 and 8 can only be used in pure soil and pure vegetated pixels for the mixed pixels of soil and vegetation let w m 2 can be weighed as tian et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 9 let 1 f l e s f l e c 10 f ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where f is the fractional canopy coverage dimensionless ndv i min and ndv i max are the ndvi threshold equal to 0 and 0 75 respectively carlson et al 1995 when the instantaneous et is estimated the daily et can be derived as follows jackson et al 1983 11 e t d e t i 2 n e π sin π t n e where e t d is the daily et mm and e t i is the instantaneous et mm n e is the daily number of et hours h equaling to the time interval between sunrise and sunset minus two tian et al 2013 t is the time interval h between sunrise and the remote sensing data collecting time the retrieved et was validated with the measured et by eddy covariance method at the ecosystem scale and with the calculated et by water balance method at the watershed scale the annual water balance equation for the land and the qinghai lake can be expressed as follows respectively 12 e t land p land r δ s w s 13 r e lake δ s lake p lake where e t land is the calculated terrestrial evapotranspiration mm by water balance equation p land is the terrestrial precipitation mm and was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset http dam itpcas ac cn rs q data chen et al 2011 r is the runoff mm to qinghai lake and was calculated by eq 13 δ s w s is the soil water storage change mm and was calculated by the retrieved soil moisture content and the measured soil bulk density e lake is the measured evaporation mm by the eddy covariance method on the qinghai lake li et al 2016 δ s lake is the water storage change mm in the qinghai lake and was calculated by the measured lake level p lake is the measured precipitation mm on the qinghai lake 2 7 statistical analysis the longwave radiation was calculated by the land surface temperature and air temperature tian et al 2013 to avoid the internal effect of temperature on net radiation shortwave radiation was used as the indicator of solar radiation in multiple regression analysis the variation partitioning could identify common and unique contributions to model prediction and is more suitable than analyzing the individual contributions of regressors via their partial correlation coefficients peres neto et al 2006 therefore it was firstly used to estimate the interactive influence of different hydrothermal factors mean annual shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content on annual evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 at all altitudes with 50 m intervals using canoco 5 0 http www canoco5 com then the curve fitting method was used to analyze the correlation between annual evapotranspiration and corresponding influence factors at particular altitudes with spss 20 0 ibm usa in 2014 and 2015 respectively lastly the annual evapotranspiration was predicted by the best fitting equation at other altitudes based on the actual and predicted annual evapotranspiration its limited fraction was estimated as follows goulden and bales 2014 14 l f i e t p i e t a e t p i 100 where l f i is the limited fraction by influence factor i e t p i is the predicted annual et mm by influence factor i e t a is the actual annual et mm retrieved by the remote sensing method the performance of all models was evaluated by the mean absolute error mae mm and mean absolute percent error mape which is defined as xiong et al 2015 15 mae 1 n i 1 n m i o i 16 mape 100 o 1 n i 1 n m i o i where m i and o i are the paired model retrieval and observation values respectively n is the number of data points o is the mean value of the observations 3 results 3 1 model validation the correlation between soil moisture content above 30 cm depth and tvdi was significant in the qinghai lake watershed p 0 001 fig a1 indicating that the tvdi method can be used to estimate soil moisture condition to a depth of 30 cm in the study area moreover with the increase of soil depth the coefficient of determination gradually decreased indicating that the model performance is better for the retrieval of shallow soil moisture content than for the deep soil these results were consistent with the studies in yongding river basin china wang et al 2010 and in argentine pampas argentina holzman et al 2014 at both the plot and the watershed scales the retrieved soil moisture content had a significant positive correlation with the measured value p 0 001 fig a2 therefore the tvdi method can be used to analyze both the temporal variation and the spatial pattern of soil moisture content in the qinghai lake watershed the variability of measured soil moisture content is higher than retrieved value mainly because the former one only represented the soil moisture condition at one or five points while the latter one was the average value of one modis pixel about 1 km2 the retrieved net radiation had high consistency with the measured one fig a3 the mean values of retrieved net radiation in the kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem were 346 367 and 364 w m 2 from 2014 to 2015 while the measured values at the same time were 342 370 and 344 w m 2 respectively the mape of retrieved net radiation in kmd pfsh and asst ecosystem were 8 9 8 8 and 10 2 respectively therefore the estimation of net radiation in the qinghai lake watershed was reliable and the values could be further used to analyze the influence of solar radiation on evapotranspiration at the ecosystem scale the retrieved monthly evapotranspiration had similar temporal trends with the measured data by eddy covariance method fig 2 for the kmd ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 478 mm and 487 mm while the measured values were 487 mm and 474 mm respectively for the pfsh ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 468 mm and 495 mm while the measured values were 492 mm and 459 mm respectively for the asst ecosystem the retrieved evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 were 435 mm and 490 mm while the measured values were 433 mm and 465 mm respectively therefore the mae of retrieved evapotranspiration were all less than 8 for three domain terrestrial ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed moreover the model performance was better for the kmd ecosystem than for the pfsh and asst ecosystem because the latter two were patchy vegetation and the hydrological processes had obvious difference between vegetation patches and interpatch zones jiang et al 2017 at the watershed scale the mean retrieved evapotranspiration on the land was 343 mm and 360 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding values calculated by water balance equation were 341 mm and 375 mm fig 3 therefore the relative errors were 0 6 and 4 0 indicating perfect performance of the three temperature model for evapotranspiration retrieval in the qinghai lake watershed 3 2 spatial pattern of evapotranspiration the retrieved terrestrial evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed ranged from 183 to 541 mm in 2014 and from 148 to 600 mm in 2015 respectively fig 4 indicating the spatial variability of the former is smaller than the latter though the mean annual evapotranspiration in 2014 was 17 mm lower than that in 2015 the spatial pattern in these two years was similar the higher value mainly appeared in the midstream of shaliu river and on the southern region of qinghai lake while the sand land on the east of qinghai lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest evapotranspiration we analyzed the characteristics of hydrothermal conditions at 3300 4700 m and the area at this altitude range accounted for 87 of the total land area in the qinghai lake watershed the shortwave radiation ranged between 510 and 520 w m 2 below 3900 m and had no obvious changes in these areas fig 5 however it decreased remarkably with the increase of altitude above 3900 m especially in 2014 and the maximum difference between 2014 and 2015 achieved 23 w m 2 at 4300 4350 m the mean annual air temperature in both 2014 and 2015 decreased with the increase of altitude and their lapse rates were about 0 60 and 0 64 c per 100 m respectively it was lower in 2014 than that in 2015 below 4000 m and was opposite above 4000 m the soil moisture content increased with the increase of altitude and the rise rate in 2014 was higher than that in 2015 its average value was slightly lower in 2014 0 23 m3 m 3 than that in 2015 0 24 m3 m 3 below 4200 m and was opposite above 4200 m the evapotranspiration increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude and both the maximum values appeared at 3600 3700 m in 2014 and 2015 moreover it was higher in 2015 than that in 2014 at all altitudes and the maximum difference achieved 27 mm at 4150 4200 m 3 3 water and energy influence on evapotranspiration the variation partitioning results showed that the shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content could explain 94 2 and 93 8 of the spatial variation of evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 6 however the single explained percentages of each of them were all less than 22 while the couple explained percentages of each two of them were all less than 20 the integration of all of them achieved 51 3 and 48 2 in 2014 and 2015 respectively therefore the spatial variation of evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed was controlled synchronously by shortwave radiation air temperature and soil moisture content based on the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration water condition soil moisture content and energy condition shortwave radiation air temperature in the qinghai lake watershed we can infer that the best hydrothermal conditions for maximum evapotranspiration appear at approximately 3650 m and our field measurement also showed that the plant at this altitude had the maximum stomatal conductance the evapotranspiration was mainly controlled by water condition below 3650 m and by energy condition above 3650 m the evapotranspiration had significant logarithmic correlation with soil moisture content at 3300 3650 m and the slope in 2015 was larger than that in 2014 fig 7 the evapotranspiration showed strong exponential correlation with both shortwave radiation and air temperature at 3650 4700 m and its rate of change became quicker with the increase of shortwave radiation and slower with the increase of air temperature the evapotranspiration was predicted simultaneously by its binary regression with shortwave radiation and air temperature at 3650 4700 m energy predicted and by its logarithmic relation with soil moisture content at 3300 3650 m water predicted the predicted evapotranspiration was about 43 mm and 39 mm higher than the actual evapotranspiration at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 respectively while the corresponding difference was approximately 96 mm and 127 mm at 4650 4700 m therefore the maximum limited fraction of evapotranspiration by water condition soil moisture content achieved 11 2 and 10 1 at 3300 3350 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were about 7 3 and 5 4 at 3300 3650 m respectively fig 8 the maximum limited fraction of evapotranspiration by energy condition solar radiation and air temperature achieved 24 4 and 29 8 at 4650 4700 m in 2014 and 2015 and the corresponding mean area weighted values were about 10 8 and 11 9 at 3650 4700 m respectively therefore the energy conditions were the primary factors limiting the evapotranspiration in the qinghai lake watershed and its limitation was higher in 2015 than that in 2014 this result was consistent with the findings of haibei alpine meadow ecosystem research station in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau i e soil temperature dominated the ecological process while the effect of soil moisture was small hu et al 2016b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in soil moisture retrieval soil moisture content is a more reasonable indicator of water condition than precipitation for evapotranspiration estimation especially in mountain areas technology has advanced considerably to determine soil moisture at a point in the past decades with the development of varied electrical sensors robinson et al 2008 however there are still many challenges to obtain soil moisture at large scale and in freeze thaw regions for example the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products is generally hampered by the scale mismatch between in situ observations and satellite footprints wanders et al 2012 the soil moisture content in the qinghai lake watershed was retrieved by the tvdi method and further used to calculate soil water storage and analyze the influence of water condition on evapotranspiration the calculated soil water storage change from 1 january to 31 december in the entire catchment was 34 9 and 3 4 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively the relative error of retrieved soil moisture content was less than 9 comparing with the measured values by the gravimetric method in july 2015 even with the maximum error the uncertainty of retrieved soil moisture storage change was less than 7 mm and only accounted for about 2 of the annual evapotranspiration therefore though the coefficient of determination r2 between retrieved and measured soil moisture content at the whole watershed was only 0 45 fig a2 the estimated evapotranspiration at the watershed scale is much better fig 3 meanwhile the spatial distribution of retrieved soil moisture also had the similar pattern with the field measured results i e the kmd and pfsh ecosystem had relatively high soil moisture whereas the asst ecosystem had relatively low soil moisture zhang and li 2017 however the correlation between soil moisture content and tvdi in this study was only based on the growing season data hence its applicability for the retrieval of soil moisture during non growing season should be evaluated previous study showed that during the long winter period from november to march soil was frozen and liquid soil water content was very low in the qinghai lake watershed zhang and li 2017 therefore further study on the retrieval and validation of soil moisture content during freezing thawing processes is necessary 4 2 water and energy influence on evapotranspiration at different altitudes water and energy conditions had profound influence on evapotranspiration at different spatial scales cammalleri et al 2012 yan et al 2012 however the influence mechanisms were varied at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed below 3650 m both the shortwave radiation and the air temperature were high whereas the soil moisture content was low therefore the evapotranspiration was mainly limited by water condition and will increase with the rising of soil moisture content this is consistent with the findings from wu et al 2016 i e the achnatherum splendens predominantly used shallow soil water over the entire growing seasons regardless of soil water availability at 3650 3900 m both the evapotranspiration and the air temperature decreased with the increase of altitude while there was no significant changing trend of shortwave radiation indicating that the air temperature was the main influence factor at this elevation range this was consistent with the findings from seddon et al 2016 i e alpine regions showed strong sensitivity to temperature at 3900 4350 m the evapotranspiration shortwave radiation and air temperature all decreased with the increase of altitude however both the evapotranspiration and the shortwave radiation in 2014 were lower than these in 2015 while the air temperature was opposite indicating that the influence of shortwave radiation was larger than air temperature at this elevation range above 4350 m both the evapotranspiration and the air temperature in 2014 were higher than these in 2015 while the shortwave radiation was opposite indicating that the influence of air temperature was larger than shortwave radiation at this elevation range these results were also verified by the measured data at the ecosystem scale ma et al 2018 i e the dominant factors for evapotranspiration changed from water conditions to temperature conditions with increasing elevation they are also consistent with the simulation results obtained in mongolia i e evapotranspiration maintains a negative relationship with temperature under the water limited condition but a positive relationship with temperature under the energy limited condition sun et al 2016 considering the area of different altitudes the evapotranspiration in approximately 28 3 40 1 and 31 6 of the area at 3300 4700 m in the qinghai lake watershed were primarily influenced by soil moisture content shortwave radiation and air temperature respectively however our results were only based on the annual data in 2014 and 2015 and there may be some differences for other years and in different months 4 3 variation of evapotranspiration with climate change the response of evapotranspiration to climate change is still unsettled on one hand the rise of air temperature is expected to make near surface air drier and result in an increase of evapotranspiration on the other hand the widespread decreases in solar irradiance due to increasing cloud coverage and aerosol concentration will weaken or even outweigh the influence by rising air temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 previous study showed that the high emission rcp 8 5 would lead as much as 4 1 c warming expand high rates of evapotranspiration 700 m elevation upslope and increase basin evapotranspiration by 28 for 2085 2100 in california s sierra nevada usa goulden and bales 2014 however this study only considered the rise of air temperature but the potential influence of precipitation and solar radiation change was not considered for the entire qinghai tibet plateau previous study showed that the obvious increase of temperature in the high altitude area qin et al 2009 will accelerate vegetation growth increase evapotranspiration shen et al 2015 enhance glacier melt yao et al 2012 and the overlap of precipitation and temperature change may result in runoff reduction yang et al 2014 qinghai lake watershed showed a warming trend of 0 31 c per decade and no significant changing trend of precipitation from 1961 to 2012 cui and li 2016 meanwhile according to the in situ measurement at the gangcha weather station in the qinghai lake watershed solar radiation decreased slightly over the past 50 years because the evapotranspiration in 3650 3900 m was mainly influenced by air temperature we can infer that the warming climate will enhance the soil evaporation and plant transpiration hence expand the maximum evapotranspiration upslope and increase annual evapotranspiration in 3650 3900 m this inference has also been validated by the swim model i e the increase of evapotranspiration for 2081 2100 would concentrate on the midstream of qinghai lake watershed zhou et al 2017 however to what extent the evapotranspiration will increase under different future climate change scenarios need to be further studied via modeling 5 conclusions this research seek to show the elevational pattern of evapotranspiration and its controls by water and energy conditions at different altitudes in the qinghai lake watershed the evapotranspiration increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude with its peak value appeared at 3600 3700 m our field investigation also found the maximum stomatal conductance and soil carbon density at this altitude range indicating the preferred hydrothermal conditions and the critical ecological functions at the middle elevation in these mountain areas the evapotranspiration was controlled by water conditions at lower elevation and by energy conditions at upper elevation but the latter ones were more influential factors limiting the evapotranspiration in the entire watershed considering the change of air temperature and solar radiation projected for future climate in this region the maximum evapotranspiration with best hydrothermal conditions will likely expand upslope along the elevation and the annual evapotranspiration will increase in the future these results provide enhanced understanding of not only the spatial pattern of energy and water fluxes on the qinghai tibet plateau but also the potential paths of hydrologic process and ecological evolution with climate change in cold and dry regions which is critical for the management of regional and even global terrestrial ecosystem declaration of competing interest
