25290,process based ecosystem models are increasingly used to estimate the carbon and water exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere these models inevitably suffer from deficiencies and uncertainties which should be thoroughly examined to better understand the processes governing the ecosystem dynamics in this paper we systematically explored the uncertainties in model predictions of changbaishan cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest using the simplified photosynthesis and evapo transpiration sipnet model and eddy flux and meteorological data from 2004 to 2009 we first screened out 21 key parameters from 42 model parameters using morris global sensitivity analysis method and then estimated their probability distributions through markov chain monte carlo technique two optimization set ups i e using observed net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee only and using observed nee and evapotranspiration et simultaneously were conducted to detect the different constraints of different observations on model parameters four parameters were well constrained using observed nee only including photosynthesis and respiration related parameters while seven parameters were well constrained using measured nee and et simultaneously four of which were water related parameters obviously more information can be derived from the simultaneous optimization since there was additional process information in water flux observation the modeled et of the nee and et optimization set up had a much better fit to measured values than the nee only optimization set up r2 0 70 vs r2 0 30 although the modeled nee from the two set ups had a good fit to the observations r2 0 85 vs r2 0 83 this implied that assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously can improve the parameterization and overall performance of the model then we quantified the uncertainties in model predictions using monte carlo simulation and trace them to specific parameter and parameter interactions through sobol variance decomposition method the uncertainties of five outputs of interest in cbs site nee gross primary productivity gpp ecosystem respiration re et and transpiration t were 50 82 22 35 21 25 9 98 and 19 54 respectively the uncertainty in predicted nee was much larger since nee is a small difference between two large fluxes i e gpp and re the maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw were classified as highly sensitive parameters for all outputs of interest in cbs site contributing more than 70 of the uncertainties in all outputs except nee the importance of these two parameters holds for one subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation and one subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest too therefore these two parameters and their underlying processes should be a focus of future model research plant trait data collection and field measurement at least for the sites in this study this can help connect the model simulation research and field data collection making them mutually informative keywords sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis morris global sensitivity analysis method markov chain monte carlo mcmc sobol variance decomposition method 1 introduction forest ecosystems functioning as a significant carbon sink play an important role in the global terrestrial carbon cycle dixon et al 1994 fang et al 2001 pan et al 2011 in the context of a changing climate understanding the exchanges of mass and energy between forests and atmosphere is of paramount importance since the response of the terrestrial biosphere is still one of the largest sources of uncertainty in future climate projections ballantyne et al 2017 bonan 2008 dietze et al 2013 friedlingstein et al 2014 heimann and reichstein 2008 sitch et al 2008 with the rapid development of eddy flux networks remote sensing techniques and other observing systems large amounts of data have been collected covering different spatial and temporal scales raupach et al 2005 scholze et al 2017 however no one data source incorporates all the information about the underlying ecosystem processes dietze et al 2013 the great need for understanding the ecosystem processes contributed to the evolution of process based ecosystem models which are increasingly used to estimate the carbon and water fluxes of ecosystems aber and federer 1992 bonan et al 2002 dufrene et al 2005 pappas et al 2013 sellers et al 1986 however different models have different degrees of complexity and abstraction inherently uncertain in the case of model structure friedlingstein et al 2014 lin et al 2011 updegraff et al 2010 in addition uncertainty also stems from imprecisely known model parameters and driving variables however the observations of model parameters are greatly lacking or not available or contain errors lin et al 2011 medlyn et al 2005 parameter uncertainty is usually a dominant source of uncertainty since process based ecosystem models are complex and contain many parameters dietze et al 2013 the uncertainties in simulated carbon and water fluxes have been acknowledged being as important as the predicted values themselves larocque et al 2008 in order to reduce these uncertainties the first step would be to quantify them and determine the contribution of each model parameter thereby helping us better understand which error source should get priority and be constrained in the future there have been large quantities of literature to quantify model uncertainty but the studies that systematically quantify the uncertainties in model outputs and trace to specific parameters and their interactions are relatively few dietze et al 2013 larocque et al 2008 lin et al 2011 macbean et al 2016 ren et al 2013a smith and heath 2001 monte carlo mc method was applied most often to quantify the output uncertainty and it can also rank parameters for uncertainty contribution when combined with multiple linear regressions larocque et al 2008 verbeeck et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 one limitation of mc method is that it cannot quantify the uncertainty contributions of model parameter interactions while sobol variance decomposition method can apportion the total output variance to components that stem from each parameter and the interactions between them pianosi et al 2017 saltelli 2002 sobol 1993 tarantola et al 2006 safta et al 2015 the combination of mc and sobol methods will effectively accomplish the uncertainty quantification and partitioning of the model predictions however the bottleneck in implementation is the specification of uncertainty of model parameters expressed as probability density functions pdfs where information are limited dietze et al 2013 keenan et al 2013 larocque et al 2008 radtke et al 2001 model data fusion technique mdf which combines the prior information about parameters and observations such as carbon and water fluxes provides a way to directly inform the model and derive posterior probability distributions of model parameters macbean et al 2016 raupach et al 2005 ricciuto et al 2011 williams et al 2005 zobitz et al 2011 since process based models have large number of parameters it would be helpful to identify key parameters controlling model behavior through parameter screening using sensitivity analysis approach at first quillet et al 2013 tang et al 2007a we have proposed a methodological framework for systematic uncertainty analysis of process based ecosystem models in a previous paper combining the aforementioned four procedures i e sensitivity analysis method one at a time oat mdf technique markov chain monte carlo mcmc mc uncertainty quantification method and sobol variance decomposition technique ren et al 2013a the framework provides a paradigm for systematic and quantitative uncertainty analysis of ecosystem models and has been successfully applied in a subtropical coniferous plantation of china ren et al 2013a however it has not been tested and employed in other types of ecosystems and still has several limitations needing further research one of the limitations is that the oat method is a local sensitivity analysis method which is very sensitive to the initial values of model parameters in this research we replace the oat method with morris global sensitivity analysis technique which is more appropriate when the model is non linear and non monotonic to overcome this limitation and then use the improved framework to conduct systematic uncertainty analysis with a simple process based model for a broad leaved korean pine mixed forest the overall objectives of this paper are threefold 1 determine the key model parameters of the simplified photosynthesis and evapotranspiration sipnet model in changbaishan cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest in china through morris global sensitivity analysis 2 perform two optimization set ups i e carbon flux only and both carbon and water fluxes assimilated to compare the estimated posterior distributions of key parameters and the informed model performance 3 quantify the uncertainty in predicted carbon and water fluxes based on the better informed model and determine how much each key parameter and their interactions contribute to the prediction uncertainty thereby helping identify future research priorities at least for this specific site 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and observational data the changbaishan forest site cbs 42 24 n 128 05 e 738 m of chinaflux is a broad leaved korean pine mixed forest located in jilin province which is the dominant vegetation type of northeastern china yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2006b the forest has a temperate continental climate controlled by monsoon zhang et al 2012 the annual mean temperature is 3 6 c and annual precipitation is 695 mm guan et al 2005 the forest is dominated by korean pine pinus koriaensis tuan linden tilia amurensis mono maple acer mimo manchurian ash fraxinus mandshurica mongolian oak quercus monogolica elm ulmus glabra with an average forest age of more than 200 year old and average canopy height of about 26 m guan et al 2005 zhang et al 2006b there is 40 coverage of understory consisting of multi species broad leaved shrub and the soil is dark brown forest soil zhang et al 2006a the data used in this paper is half hourly meteorological and eddy covariance flux data of cbs site from january 2004 to december 2009 the data of the first three years are applied to inform the model i e estimate the posterior probability distributions of model parameters and the remaining three years are used to validate the informed model the data of the year 2004 are selected to perform the parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of model predictions the specific data employed are air temperature soil temperature precipitation photosynthetic active radiation par water vapor pressure wind speed net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee evapotranspiration et gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re the chinaflux data processing system li et al 2008 liu et al 2009 2012 was used to conduct quality control gap filling and separation of the flux data the gaps in carbon flux data were filled using the nonlinear regression method michaelis menten and lloyd tayor equations and the separation was conducted in the meantime the latent heat flux was gap filled using look up table method and divided by the product of the latent heat of vaporization and the water density to derive et because the model is run at half daily time step day and night we aggregated the half hourly meteorological and flux data to half daily scale the length of each day or night time step is calculated based on the determination of sunrise and sunset times using the latitude of cbs site and the date braswell et al 2005 additionally related literature data are also collected such as the prior information of model parameters consisting of initial values and variation ranges braswell et al 2005 gu 2007 liu 2011 sacks et al 2006 yu and sun 2008 yu et al 2005 zhang 2008 zheng 2009 zhou 2013 2 2 the sipnet ecosystem model the ecosystem model that we used in this paper is the sipnet model a simplified version of pnet model aber and federer 1992 braswell et al 2005 hu et al 2010 moore et al 2008 ren et al 2013a sacks et al 2006 2007 zobitz et al 2008 2014 the model simulates the carbon dynamics between the atmosphere and three carbon pools i e two vegetation carbon pools and a soil carbon pool and a sub model of soil moisture is incorporated to simulate the water flux dynamics many versions of the model have evolved from the earliest and simplest version described by braswell et al 2005 in this paper the carbon dynamics modeling is referenced from braswell et al 2005 and the soil moisture modeling is referred to that of sacks et al 2007 the detailed description of the model is documented in appendix b there are 42 parameters including initial conditions governing the model s behavior which are listed in table 1 the model runs at half daily time step day and night to facilitate the separation of photosynthesis and respiration processes it is driven by six climate variables including average air temperature average soil temperature precipitation par water vapor pressure and wind speed 2 3 morris global sensitivity analysis model parameter sensitivity analysis has been generally acknowledged as a helpful parameter screening tool that can be used to identify key parameters controlling the model behavior tang et al 2007a the method chosen here is morris global sensitivity analysis method in this method the parameter space is discretized and the possible parameter values are restricted to be inside a k dimensional p level grid where k is the number of parameters and p is the number of levels pappas et al 2013 the elementary effects of parameters are defined as the ratios of the output response changes to the changes in parameters morris 1991 the method is composed of a series of randomized oat designs thus a series of elementary effects can be derived for each parameter quillet et al 2013 the mean μ and standard deviation σ of the elementary effects of each parameter are used to describe the parameter sensitivity a high μ value indicates that the parameter has an important overall influence on the output and a high σ value implies that either the parameter is interacting with other parameters or has nonlinear effects on the outputs it is noteworthy that we should select several outputs of interest for sensitivity analysis and the following uncertainty analysis in this paper we focused on the modeling of carbon and water fluxes so nee gpp re et and transpiration t are chosen as our outputs of interest since the outputs of sipnet model are time series the sums of the outputs of interest in the whole year of 2004 are used for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis 2 4 markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter estimation a variation of markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm i e metropolis simulated annealing algorithm ren et al 2013a is used to estimate the probability distributions of key model parameters the method is based on the metropolis hastings algorithm in combination with simulated annealing braswell et al 2005 hastings 1970 metropolis et al 1953 sacks et al 2007 there are three techniques including random walk relaxation of acceptance criteria and adjustment of the jump distance which can limit the false convergence to local optima and evidently improve the speed of convergence to global optimum zobitz et al 2011 the algorithm involves iteratively proposing a new set of parameters based on the current accepted set running the model with the new set and comparing the model output with observed data then the new set of parameters is accepted or rejected with some probability given by the ratio of the likelihoods of generating values that are close to the observed data under the new and current set of parameters when the acceptance rate converges to a specific threshold we can say that the chain has reached convergence braswell et al 2005 keenan et al 2012 to further ensure the convergence we abandon the first 100 000 iterations after convergence then iterate 400 000 times for the analysis of statistics the likelihood function is similar with that described by braswell et al 2005 specifically we assume that the measured nee values differ from the model predicted values according to a mean zero gaussian error model then the likelihood function lnee can be expressed as in eq 1 1 l n e e i 1 m 1 2 π σ n e e e x i η i 2 2 σ n e e 2 where m is the number of nee data points xi and ηi are the measured and modeled nee respectively and σnee is the standard deviation on each nee data point at half daily scale which can be approximated using eq 2 following braswell et al 2005 2 σ n e e 1 m i 1 m x i η i 2 if we assimilate multiple data streams simultaneously for example nee and et then the likelihood function l is expressed as the product of partial likelihood functions eq 3 the calculation of let and σet is similar with that of lnee and σnee 3 l l n e e l e t i 1 m 1 2 π σ n e e e x i η i 2 2 σ n e e 2 j 1 n 1 2 π σ e t e x j η j 2 2 σ e t 2 this method can combine the prior information about parameters and the observed data and generate random samples of parameters from the approximately real distributions dietze et al 2013 prior distributions of estimated parameters were assumed to be uniform keenan et al 2013 zobitz et al 2014 and data from published studies are the primary sources of prior values radtke et al 2001 different kinds of measured data are assimilated to constrain different processes in order to explore the implicit information in observed carbon and water fluxes we performed two optimization set ups the first one is only using observed nee to inform the model and the second one is using the observations of both nee and et to constrain the model simultaneously 2 5 uncertainty analysis quantification and partitioning 2 5 1 monte carlo uncertainty analysis historically only a single set of parameters was used to run an ecosystem model providing a point estimate of the model outputs without accounting for parameter uncertainty lebauer et al 2013 in order to propagate the uncertainty in key model parameters to the uncertainty in outputs of interest monte carlo numerical simulation approach mc is employed in this paper the method iteratively samples from pdfs of key model parameters which are derived using mcmc technique and runs the model using the sampled values of key parameters for 1 500 000 times then the ensembles of outputs can be used to approximate the pdfs of the model outputs and calculate the output statistics such as mean standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv 2 5 2 sobol variance decomposition method in addition to quantify the overall uncertainties in model predictions it is crucial to trace them to specific parameter and highlight the most influential parameters for the purpose of reducing uncertainty in the future the sobol variance decomposition method proposed by sobol 1993 and improved by saltelli 2002 and tarantola et al 2006 is used to quantify the amount of variance that each key model parameter contributes on the variance of model output the underlying assumption is that all the information about model uncertainty can be captured by the output variance pappas et al 2013 specifically in sobol method the variance of the model output is decomposed into components that come from individual parameters as well as parameter interactions pianosi et al 2017 tang et al 2007b assuming the key model parameters are independent the variance decomposition can be expressed by eq 4 4 v y i v i i j i v i j v 12 k the sobol sensitivity indices i e first order sensitivity si eq 5 second order sensitivity sij eq 6 and total order sensitivity sti eq 7 are used to describe the main effect contribution the interaction effects between two parameters and the overall contribution of each key parameter on the output variance 5 s i v i v v e y x i v 6 s i j v i j v v e y x i x j v i v j v 7 s t i 1 v i v v v e y x i v sti is the most comprehensive measure of the uncertainty contribution of each parameter since it represents the sum of all variance contributions involving that parameter tang et al 2007b if a parameter has small si and large sti then the parameter influences the model output by interactions with other parameters and we can identify the specific interaction strengths of this parameter with other parameters through sij the details of the principles and implementations about the sobol method are well documented by saltelli 2002 and lilburne and tarantola 2009 it should be noted that we did not account the uncertainty in driving variables in the uncertainty quantification and decomposition because it is hard to quantify the uncertainty in the measured data of driving variables instead we performed a computational experiment using the informed sipnet model by reducing and increasing the observed values of air temperature and precipitation to investigate the responses of the modeled fluxes to variations of environmental variables 3 results 3 1 morris screening of key parameters the results of morris global sensitivity analysis are displayed in fig 1 where the sensitivity measures μ σ of each parameter are plotted for each output of interest numbers on the right of the points in fig 1 represent the parameter id in table 1 recall that μ reflects the overall influence of a parameter on the output and σ indicates that the parameter has nonlinear effects or interacts with other parameters if μ and σ are both large then the associated parameter has a strong influence on the output involving nonlinearity or interactions and if the opposite then the parameter has negligible influence on the output the euclidean distance between μ σ and the origin is used to represent the importance of parameters relative to each other pappas et al 2013 the key parameters can be determined based on the scatter plot of μ and σ or their euclidean distance for the output variables of nee and et every subplot of fig 1 has a cluster of points around the origin i e μ and σ are close to 0 and also has some points evidently separated from the cluster which can be identified as sensitive parameters since different ecosystem processes and parameters have different effects on different carbon and water fluxes the identification of influential parameters depends on the output of interest in this paper we use the union of sensitive parameters of the output variables nee and et as key parameters of the sipnet model among the 42 model parameters 21 parameters are located outside the ellipses of fig 1a and d these 21 parameters are selected as key model parameters among which 11 parameters are for both nee and et 9 for only nee and 1 for only et these parameters can be classified into five groups 1 initial state values parameter id 2 3 4 initial lai laii initial soil carbon content cs 0 initial soil moisture content as fraction of wc ws 0 cs 0 and ws 0 is a sensitive parameter for nee and et respectively and laii is a sensitive parameter for both nee and et 2 photosynthesis related parameters parameter id 6 7 8 9 10 13 14 maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max average daily maximum photosynthesis as fraction of a max ad foliar maintenance respiration as fraction of a max kf minimum temperature for photosynthesis t min optimum temperature for photosynthesis topt half saturation point of par photosynthesis relationship par1 2 canopy par extinction coefficient k kf t min and par1 2 are sensitive parameters for nee and the rest are sensitive parameters for both nee and et 3 respiration related parameters parameter id 22 25 26 27 vegetation respiration q10 q10 v soil respiration rate at 0 c and moisture saturated soil ks soil respiration q10 q10 s scalar determining the effect of soil moisture on soil respiration rsm these are all sensitive parameters for nee 4 water related parameters parameter id 31 33 34 36 fraction of soil water removable in one day f vpd water use efficiency relationship kwue soil water holding capacity wc scalar relating soil resistance to soil wetness rsoil 1 these are all sensitive parameters for both nee and et 5 tree physiology related parameters parameter id 38 39 40 fractional carbon content of leaves cfrac carbon content of leaves on a per area basis slw fraction of net primary productivity npp allocated to leaf growth al al is a sensitive parameter for nee and cfrac and slw are sensitive parameters for both nee and et 3 2 parameter estimation and informed model performance 3 2 1 results of parameter estimation we estimated the posterior distributions of 21 key parameters of sipnet model using two parameter estimation set ups one with only observed nee assimilated and the other one with both measured nee and et assimilated figs 2 and 3 showed the posterior distributions of key parameters of the two set ups respectively when only nee data are used to constrain the model four parameters are well constrained including two photosynthesis related parameters par1 2 t min and two respiration related parameters q10 v rsm when et data are also used to constrain the model seven parameters are well constrained including two photosynthesis related parameters par1 2 t min one respiration related parameters q10 v and four water related parameters f kwue wc rsoil 1 although one respiration related parameter rsm is no longer well constrained four water related parameters become well constrained because of the implicit information in observed et the uncertainties in 21 key parameters defined as the coefficient of variation ranged from 0 87 to 86 89 with an average value of 15 91 when optimized using nee flux only when et data were also optimized the uncertainties of most parameters decreased with the uncertainty ranged from 0 80 to 33 77 averaged at 10 43 the maximum uncertainty decreased by 61 and the mean uncertainty decreased by 34 3 2 2 modeling of carbon and water fluxes we modeled the carbon and water fluxes in 2007 2009 for cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest using the sipnet model parameterized with measured nee data only and with both nee and et data fig 4 showed the validation of the half daily nee and et simulations compared with measured values modeled nee of both parameterizations had good fit to the measured data fig 4a c though the coefficient of determination r2 of nee and et optimization was a little lower than nee only optimization r2 0 83 vs r2 0 85 and the root mean square error rmse was a little higher rmse 0 96 g c m 2 vs rmse 1 03 g c m 2 as for modeled et the nee and et optimization had much better fit to the measured values than nee only optimization fig 4b d r2 increased from 0 30 to 0 70 and rmse dropped from 0 07 cm to 0 05 cm we can see that when incorporating et data into optimization the modeling of et was improved dramatically in addition we also simulated the carbon and water fluxes using the model with initial parameter values and compared the mean seasonal variations of modeled nee and et for the optimized and default model results with the observations fig 5 we can see that the seasonal variations of modeled nee deviated from the observations when using default model but when observations are used to constrain the model the modeled nee and et improved significantly 3 3 uncertainty quantification and partitioning 3 3 1 quantification of output uncertainty we performed the mc simulations using the posterior distributions of the nee and et optimization fig 3 to quantify the uncertainties in the five outputs of interest the distributions of the modeled total nee gpp re et and t of the year 2004 for cbs site are approximately following normal distribution fig 6 the statistics such as mean std and relative uncertainty ru defined as cv of all the outputs of interest are calculated from mc simulations table 2 in table 2 the sum of measured nee gpp re and et of the year 2004 are derived from the eddy covariance measurements while the measured transpiration is lacking the simulated values of nee gpp and re are 237 73 120 82 g c m 2 yr 1 1198 20 267 77 g c m 2 yr 1 960 48 204 14 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively underestimated compared to observed values of 304 63 g c m 2 yr 1 1376 82 g c m 2 yr 1 1072 19 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively the mean of modeled et is 48 31 4 82 cm m 2 yr 1 close to the measured value of 45 79 cm m 2 yr 1 the measured values of nee gpp re and et are within one standard deviation of their distributions the relative uncertainties in the outputs are widely distinct 50 82 for nee 22 35 for gpp 21 25 for re 9 98 for et and 19 54 for t table 2 it is clear that the uncertainty in nee is much larger than gpp and re 3 3 2 partitioning of output uncertainty sobol variance decomposition method is applied to apportion the overall uncertainty in output variables to individual parameters as well as parameter interactions table 3 showed the ranking of 21 key parameters according to their uncertainty contributions to the outputs of interest i e nee gpp re et and t parameters with uncertainty contribution larger than 10 are seen as highly sensitive parameters which are shaded with dark grey in table 3 the parameters whose uncertainty contributions are larger than 1 are classified as sensitive parameters shaded with light grey in table 3 for all the outputs of interest their sums of si are less than 100 ranging from 86 79 to 97 23 this implies that the parameter interaction terms are remarkably small and mostly negligible the direct influences of each parameter drive the overall output variance of the informed model in cbs forest we can see that the ranking of parameters are different if we take different output variable into consideration as for nee there are four highly sensitive parameters a max cs 0 ks slw contributing more than 70 of the uncertainty of modeled nee the photosynthesis related parameter maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and tree physiology related parameter carbon content of leaves slw impact nee through influencing both gpp and re while the two respiration related parameters initial soil carbon content cs 0 soil respiration rate at 0 c and moisture saturated soil ks influence nee through impacting re sensitive parameters for nee include f wc ad q10 s q10 v cfrac t min and kf where f wc ad t min influence nee through gpp q10 s q10 v kf impact nee through re and cfrac influences nee through both gpp and re as for et more than 70 of the output uncertainty is attributable to the two highly sensitive parameters a max and slw there are six sensitive parameters for et including wc cfrac f rsoil 1 ad and laii accounting for 26 of the output uncertainty of et among these eight highly sensitive and sensitive parameters almost all of them impact et through t except rsoil 1 which influences et through soil evaporation all of these can be partly anticipated by looking through the structure of sipnet model so it is urgent to include model structure into the uncertainty analysis framework in the future for gpp re et and t their sums of all first order sensitivity values are all larger than 95 very close to 100 while for nee the sum of all first order sensitivity values is only 86 79 much smaller than 100 the interaction effects of parameters on nee are much larger than that on other output variables so we further analyzed the interaction among parameters for nee fig 7 showed the second order sobol sensitivity indices for the output variable nee the interaction between maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max parameter id 6 and carbon content of leaves slw parameter id 38 is the largest and the interaction contributions of these two parameters with others are the strongest in addition the base soil respiration ks parameter id 25 interacts evidently with the initial soil carbon content cs 0 parameter id 3 as well as the soil respiration q10 q10 s parameter id 26 4 discussion in this paper we performed systematic uncertainty analysis of the simulated carbon and water fluxes in cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest site based on the informed sipnet model and the improved version of the uncertainty analysis framework proposed by ren et al 2013a key parameters were determined by morris global sensitivity analysis instead of oat local sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty estimated using mcmc and eddy covariance data was propagated to output uncertainty using mc simulation the sobol variance decomposition method was employed to quantify the contribution of each key parameter and the interactions to the output uncertainty this method framework may have the potential to help identify the potentially important data collection in the future thereby stimulating further cooperation between modelers and field investigators and improving model performance keenan et al 2011 lebauer et al 2013 the uncertainty contribution of each parameter is the integration of parameter sensitivity and parameter uncertainty lebauer et al 2013 in this study we did not consider the uncertainty in input data and model structure and the initial conditions are included in the definition of parameters so the only way to reduce output uncertainty is to reduce parameter uncertainty to demonstrate the constraint of different data on model parameters two parameter estimation set ups were used one with measured nee only and the other with both nee and et the results showed that only four photosynthesis and respiration related parameters par1 2 t min q10 v rsm can be well constrained in the first set up as for the second set up although one respiration parameter was less constrained four more water related parameters f kwue wc rsoil 1 become well constrained because of the adding of measured et data in addition the uncertainties in most parameters were evidently reduced in the second set up assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously improved the parameterization and overall performance of the model this indicates that different kinds of data constrain parameters of different ecosystem processes previous studies have revealed that multi source data can better constrain ecosystem model dietze et al 2013 kaminski and mathieu 2017 macbean et al 2016 raupach et al 2005 although some data sources may be redundant in the presence of other relevant data keenan et al 2013 we should try more data from multiple sources and with different time scales to better constrain the model parameters in the future we quantified the uncertainties in output variables using mc simulations and found that the uncertainty in nee is much larger than gpp and re table 2 consistent with the result reported by zhang et al 2012 the net ecosystem carbon exchange is the balance between the ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration i e nee is a small difference between the two large fluxes of gpp and re a little variation of either gpp or re will lead to a large variation in nee so the uncertainty in nee is much larger the amplitudes of uncertainties in nee gpp re are bigger than those reported by zhang et al 2012 this may be due to the following several reasons first the ecosystem models used are different second the key parameters were determined using different sensitivity analysis methods morris in this paper and oat in zhang et al 2012 third zhang et al 2012 assumed the coefficient of variations of all key parameters were 10 while in this paper the relative uncertainties of key parameters were estimated through model data fusion ranging from 0 80 to 33 77 the mean simulated summation in 2004 of carbon flux components were underestimated compared to observed values fig 6 the underestimation of gpp is because the peak summer daytime carbon uptake is underestimated and the underestimation of re is due to the underestimated peak nighttime respiration as for nee the peak carbon uptake is bigger than the peak respiration and the flattening in peak uptake side is much more evident than the peak respiration side fig 4c thus leading to the underestimation of nee among the 21 key parameters selected by morris method maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw are highly sensitive parameters for all five outputs contributing more than 70 of the uncertainties in all outputs except nee table 3 the tree physiology parameter slw is used to scale the photosynthetic rate from leaf level to ecosystem level the results clearly indicate that the maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw play an important role in the modeling of carbon and water exchanges in cbs forest this is because of the coupling between the carbon and water dynamics in the informed model however these two parameters are poorly constrained by eddy covariance observations fig 3 thus should be a focus of the collection of existed trait data in literature or trait databases such as try kattge et al 2011 and future field measurement at least for cbs site to see if these results hold in multiple sites we selected another two typical forest ecosystems along the north south transect of east china i e qianyanzhou qyz subtropical coniferous plantation and dinghushan dhs subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest see table c1 in appendix c for site information and performed the whole procedure i e parameter screening parameter estimation uncertainty quantification and partitioning the parameters a max and slw were also the most important parameters for qyz site which contributed more than two thirds of the uncertainty in predicted nee and et ren et al 2013a for dhs site a max and slw contributed around 30 of the uncertainty in nee and more than 50 of the uncertainty in et data not shown these three chinaflux sites represent three typical forest ecosystems in china i e temperate mixed forest subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation and subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest despite the specific sensitivity values and parameter rankings are different among these three types of ecosystems the importance of parameters a max and slw are consistent the influential effects of a max and slw may be attributed to the oversimplified expression of photosynthesis process in sipnet model many factors closely related to the photosynthetic rate are not accounted for in the model structure for example diffuse radiation fertilization effect mercado et al 2009 ren et al 2013b we assumed model parameters were constant but in fact there may be seasonal variations in some parameters for example wang et al 2007 stated that a seasonally varying v cmax and j max in cbm csiro biosphere model yielded better predictions of nee than a constant v cmax and j max for deciduous forests the neglecting of the seasonal variation in parameters may also affect our findings in addition lebauer et al 2013 found that the importance of model parameters sla and vc max dropped considerably when available trait data were incorporated so it is possible to reduce the model uncertainty significantly by refining the photosynthesis process and parameters we did not account for the uncertainty in the driving variables because it is hard to quantify the uncertainty in the measured data of driving variables instead we investigated the responses of the modeled fluxes to variations of environmental variables fig 8 the relationships between the variations of air temperature and cumulative carbon and water fluxes are non linear and non monotonic fig 8a c e g i the net carbon fixation of cbs forest may start to decrease if the amplitude of air temperature increase is larger than 20 fig 8a the relationship between variations of precipitation and cumulative carbon and water fluxes was different which showed a generally increasing trend fig 8b d f h j the slope of the response curve reached its maximum when the precipitation reduction was 50 70 this means the carbon and water fluxes are more sensitive to precipitation when the precipitation is low if the precipitation in cbs decreases the net carbon fixation will decrease evidently furthermore the response curves seem more reasonable when parameterized using both nee and et than using nee only this is probably because the implicit information about water exchange in measured et was included in the nee and et optimization this further confirms that the sipnet model parameterized using nee and et simultaneously is better than that parameterized only using nee this paper addressed some limitations of the uncertainty analysis framework described by ren et al 2013a first we replaced oat local sensitivity analysis method with morris global sensitivity analysis method second we complemented the sobol variance decomposition procedure in the framework with the calculation of parameter interaction effects however there are still several limitations needing further research to address for example the uncertainties in model structure and driving variables were not considered in the framework the autocorrelation of nee and et residuals and the covariance between nee and et residuals were not incorporated in the parameter estimation and in sobol method we did not consider the correlation between parameters 5 conclusions overall the ultimate purpose of uncertainty analysis is to reduce uncertainty the systematic parameter screening parameter estimation uncertainty quantification and partitioning conducted in this paper helped us identify the model parameters that have the strongest effect on the uncertainty of model predictions in cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest site and establish the connection and feedback between model simulation and data collection to some extent thereby reducing uncertainty in the future the main results are as follows we compared the posterior distributions of the 21 key parameters using measured nee only vs both nee and et in the mcmc optimization more water related parameters became well constrained in the latter optimization because measured et implicitly contain information about ecosystem water dynamics though the modeled nee of both optimizations had good fit to the measured data the modeled et in the nee and et optimization had much better fit to the measured values this indicates that assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously can evidently improve the parameterization and performance of the model the uncertainties in the modeled nee gpp re et and t are 50 82 22 35 21 25 9 98 and 19 54 respectively the uncertainty of nee is much higher than gpp and re since nee is the small difference of gpp and re among the 21 key parameters maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw were classified as highly sensitive parameters for all five outputs of interest to reduce uncertainty we should focus on these two parameters in the trait data collection and field observation and concentrate on the underlying processes of these two parameters in the future model development this is not only suitable for cbs temperate mixed forest but also for qyz

25290,process based ecosystem models are increasingly used to estimate the carbon and water exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere these models inevitably suffer from deficiencies and uncertainties which should be thoroughly examined to better understand the processes governing the ecosystem dynamics in this paper we systematically explored the uncertainties in model predictions of changbaishan cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest using the simplified photosynthesis and evapo transpiration sipnet model and eddy flux and meteorological data from 2004 to 2009 we first screened out 21 key parameters from 42 model parameters using morris global sensitivity analysis method and then estimated their probability distributions through markov chain monte carlo technique two optimization set ups i e using observed net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee only and using observed nee and evapotranspiration et simultaneously were conducted to detect the different constraints of different observations on model parameters four parameters were well constrained using observed nee only including photosynthesis and respiration related parameters while seven parameters were well constrained using measured nee and et simultaneously four of which were water related parameters obviously more information can be derived from the simultaneous optimization since there was additional process information in water flux observation the modeled et of the nee and et optimization set up had a much better fit to measured values than the nee only optimization set up r2 0 70 vs r2 0 30 although the modeled nee from the two set ups had a good fit to the observations r2 0 85 vs r2 0 83 this implied that assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously can improve the parameterization and overall performance of the model then we quantified the uncertainties in model predictions using monte carlo simulation and trace them to specific parameter and parameter interactions through sobol variance decomposition method the uncertainties of five outputs of interest in cbs site nee gross primary productivity gpp ecosystem respiration re et and transpiration t were 50 82 22 35 21 25 9 98 and 19 54 respectively the uncertainty in predicted nee was much larger since nee is a small difference between two large fluxes i e gpp and re the maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw were classified as highly sensitive parameters for all outputs of interest in cbs site contributing more than 70 of the uncertainties in all outputs except nee the importance of these two parameters holds for one subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation and one subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest too therefore these two parameters and their underlying processes should be a focus of future model research plant trait data collection and field measurement at least for the sites in this study this can help connect the model simulation research and field data collection making them mutually informative keywords sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis morris global sensitivity analysis method markov chain monte carlo mcmc sobol variance decomposition method 1 introduction forest ecosystems functioning as a significant carbon sink play an important role in the global terrestrial carbon cycle dixon et al 1994 fang et al 2001 pan et al 2011 in the context of a changing climate understanding the exchanges of mass and energy between forests and atmosphere is of paramount importance since the response of the terrestrial biosphere is still one of the largest sources of uncertainty in future climate projections ballantyne et al 2017 bonan 2008 dietze et al 2013 friedlingstein et al 2014 heimann and reichstein 2008 sitch et al 2008 with the rapid development of eddy flux networks remote sensing techniques and other observing systems large amounts of data have been collected covering different spatial and temporal scales raupach et al 2005 scholze et al 2017 however no one data source incorporates all the information about the underlying ecosystem processes dietze et al 2013 the great need for understanding the ecosystem processes contributed to the evolution of process based ecosystem models which are increasingly used to estimate the carbon and water fluxes of ecosystems aber and federer 1992 bonan et al 2002 dufrene et al 2005 pappas et al 2013 sellers et al 1986 however different models have different degrees of complexity and abstraction inherently uncertain in the case of model structure friedlingstein et al 2014 lin et al 2011 updegraff et al 2010 in addition uncertainty also stems from imprecisely known model parameters and driving variables however the observations of model parameters are greatly lacking or not available or contain errors lin et al 2011 medlyn et al 2005 parameter uncertainty is usually a dominant source of uncertainty since process based ecosystem models are complex and contain many parameters dietze et al 2013 the uncertainties in simulated carbon and water fluxes have been acknowledged being as important as the predicted values themselves larocque et al 2008 in order to reduce these uncertainties the first step would be to quantify them and determine the contribution of each model parameter thereby helping us better understand which error source should get priority and be constrained in the future there have been large quantities of literature to quantify model uncertainty but the studies that systematically quantify the uncertainties in model outputs and trace to specific parameters and their interactions are relatively few dietze et al 2013 larocque et al 2008 lin et al 2011 macbean et al 2016 ren et al 2013a smith and heath 2001 monte carlo mc method was applied most often to quantify the output uncertainty and it can also rank parameters for uncertainty contribution when combined with multiple linear regressions larocque et al 2008 verbeeck et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 one limitation of mc method is that it cannot quantify the uncertainty contributions of model parameter interactions while sobol variance decomposition method can apportion the total output variance to components that stem from each parameter and the interactions between them pianosi et al 2017 saltelli 2002 sobol 1993 tarantola et al 2006 safta et al 2015 the combination of mc and sobol methods will effectively accomplish the uncertainty quantification and partitioning of the model predictions however the bottleneck in implementation is the specification of uncertainty of model parameters expressed as probability density functions pdfs where information are limited dietze et al 2013 keenan et al 2013 larocque et al 2008 radtke et al 2001 model data fusion technique mdf which combines the prior information about parameters and observations such as carbon and water fluxes provides a way to directly inform the model and derive posterior probability distributions of model parameters macbean et al 2016 raupach et al 2005 ricciuto et al 2011 williams et al 2005 zobitz et al 2011 since process based models have large number of parameters it would be helpful to identify key parameters controlling model behavior through parameter screening using sensitivity analysis approach at first quillet et al 2013 tang et al 2007a we have proposed a methodological framework for systematic uncertainty analysis of process based ecosystem models in a previous paper combining the aforementioned four procedures i e sensitivity analysis method one at a time oat mdf technique markov chain monte carlo mcmc mc uncertainty quantification method and sobol variance decomposition technique ren et al 2013a the framework provides a paradigm for systematic and quantitative uncertainty analysis of ecosystem models and has been successfully applied in a subtropical coniferous plantation of china ren et al 2013a however it has not been tested and employed in other types of ecosystems and still has several limitations needing further research one of the limitations is that the oat method is a local sensitivity analysis method which is very sensitive to the initial values of model parameters in this research we replace the oat method with morris global sensitivity analysis technique which is more appropriate when the model is non linear and non monotonic to overcome this limitation and then use the improved framework to conduct systematic uncertainty analysis with a simple process based model for a broad leaved korean pine mixed forest the overall objectives of this paper are threefold 1 determine the key model parameters of the simplified photosynthesis and evapotranspiration sipnet model in changbaishan cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest in china through morris global sensitivity analysis 2 perform two optimization set ups i e carbon flux only and both carbon and water fluxes assimilated to compare the estimated posterior distributions of key parameters and the informed model performance 3 quantify the uncertainty in predicted carbon and water fluxes based on the better informed model and determine how much each key parameter and their interactions contribute to the prediction uncertainty thereby helping identify future research priorities at least for this specific site 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and observational data the changbaishan forest site cbs 42 24 n 128 05 e 738 m of chinaflux is a broad leaved korean pine mixed forest located in jilin province which is the dominant vegetation type of northeastern china yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2006b the forest has a temperate continental climate controlled by monsoon zhang et al 2012 the annual mean temperature is 3 6 c and annual precipitation is 695 mm guan et al 2005 the forest is dominated by korean pine pinus koriaensis tuan linden tilia amurensis mono maple acer mimo manchurian ash fraxinus mandshurica mongolian oak quercus monogolica elm ulmus glabra with an average forest age of more than 200 year old and average canopy height of about 26 m guan et al 2005 zhang et al 2006b there is 40 coverage of understory consisting of multi species broad leaved shrub and the soil is dark brown forest soil zhang et al 2006a the data used in this paper is half hourly meteorological and eddy covariance flux data of cbs site from january 2004 to december 2009 the data of the first three years are applied to inform the model i e estimate the posterior probability distributions of model parameters and the remaining three years are used to validate the informed model the data of the year 2004 are selected to perform the parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of model predictions the specific data employed are air temperature soil temperature precipitation photosynthetic active radiation par water vapor pressure wind speed net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee evapotranspiration et gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re the chinaflux data processing system li et al 2008 liu et al 2009 2012 was used to conduct quality control gap filling and separation of the flux data the gaps in carbon flux data were filled using the nonlinear regression method michaelis menten and lloyd tayor equations and the separation was conducted in the meantime the latent heat flux was gap filled using look up table method and divided by the product of the latent heat of vaporization and the water density to derive et because the model is run at half daily time step day and night we aggregated the half hourly meteorological and flux data to half daily scale the length of each day or night time step is calculated based on the determination of sunrise and sunset times using the latitude of cbs site and the date braswell et al 2005 additionally related literature data are also collected such as the prior information of model parameters consisting of initial values and variation ranges braswell et al 2005 gu 2007 liu 2011 sacks et al 2006 yu and sun 2008 yu et al 2005 zhang 2008 zheng 2009 zhou 2013 2 2 the sipnet ecosystem model the ecosystem model that we used in this paper is the sipnet model a simplified version of pnet model aber and federer 1992 braswell et al 2005 hu et al 2010 moore et al 2008 ren et al 2013a sacks et al 2006 2007 zobitz et al 2008 2014 the model simulates the carbon dynamics between the atmosphere and three carbon pools i e two vegetation carbon pools and a soil carbon pool and a sub model of soil moisture is incorporated to simulate the water flux dynamics many versions of the model have evolved from the earliest and simplest version described by braswell et al 2005 in this paper the carbon dynamics modeling is referenced from braswell et al 2005 and the soil moisture modeling is referred to that of sacks et al 2007 the detailed description of the model is documented in appendix b there are 42 parameters including initial conditions governing the model s behavior which are listed in table 1 the model runs at half daily time step day and night to facilitate the separation of photosynthesis and respiration processes it is driven by six climate variables including average air temperature average soil temperature precipitation par water vapor pressure and wind speed 2 3 morris global sensitivity analysis model parameter sensitivity analysis has been generally acknowledged as a helpful parameter screening tool that can be used to identify key parameters controlling the model behavior tang et al 2007a the method chosen here is morris global sensitivity analysis method in this method the parameter space is discretized and the possible parameter values are restricted to be inside a k dimensional p level grid where k is the number of parameters and p is the number of levels pappas et al 2013 the elementary effects of parameters are defined as the ratios of the output response changes to the changes in parameters morris 1991 the method is composed of a series of randomized oat designs thus a series of elementary effects can be derived for each parameter quillet et al 2013 the mean μ and standard deviation σ of the elementary effects of each parameter are used to describe the parameter sensitivity a high μ value indicates that the parameter has an important overall influence on the output and a high σ value implies that either the parameter is interacting with other parameters or has nonlinear effects on the outputs it is noteworthy that we should select several outputs of interest for sensitivity analysis and the following uncertainty analysis in this paper we focused on the modeling of carbon and water fluxes so nee gpp re et and transpiration t are chosen as our outputs of interest since the outputs of sipnet model are time series the sums of the outputs of interest in the whole year of 2004 are used for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis 2 4 markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter estimation a variation of markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm i e metropolis simulated annealing algorithm ren et al 2013a is used to estimate the probability distributions of key model parameters the method is based on the metropolis hastings algorithm in combination with simulated annealing braswell et al 2005 hastings 1970 metropolis et al 1953 sacks et al 2007 there are three techniques including random walk relaxation of acceptance criteria and adjustment of the jump distance which can limit the false convergence to local optima and evidently improve the speed of convergence to global optimum zobitz et al 2011 the algorithm involves iteratively proposing a new set of parameters based on the current accepted set running the model with the new set and comparing the model output with observed data then the new set of parameters is accepted or rejected with some probability given by the ratio of the likelihoods of generating values that are close to the observed data under the new and current set of parameters when the acceptance rate converges to a specific threshold we can say that the chain has reached convergence braswell et al 2005 keenan et al 2012 to further ensure the convergence we abandon the first 100 000 iterations after convergence then iterate 400 000 times for the analysis of statistics the likelihood function is similar with that described by braswell et al 2005 specifically we assume that the measured nee values differ from the model predicted values according to a mean zero gaussian error model then the likelihood function lnee can be expressed as in eq 1 1 l n e e i 1 m 1 2 π σ n e e e x i η i 2 2 σ n e e 2 where m is the number of nee data points xi and ηi are the measured and modeled nee respectively and σnee is the standard deviation on each nee data point at half daily scale which can be approximated using eq 2 following braswell et al 2005 2 σ n e e 1 m i 1 m x i η i 2 if we assimilate multiple data streams simultaneously for example nee and et then the likelihood function l is expressed as the product of partial likelihood functions eq 3 the calculation of let and σet is similar with that of lnee and σnee 3 l l n e e l e t i 1 m 1 2 π σ n e e e x i η i 2 2 σ n e e 2 j 1 n 1 2 π σ e t e x j η j 2 2 σ e t 2 this method can combine the prior information about parameters and the observed data and generate random samples of parameters from the approximately real distributions dietze et al 2013 prior distributions of estimated parameters were assumed to be uniform keenan et al 2013 zobitz et al 2014 and data from published studies are the primary sources of prior values radtke et al 2001 different kinds of measured data are assimilated to constrain different processes in order to explore the implicit information in observed carbon and water fluxes we performed two optimization set ups the first one is only using observed nee to inform the model and the second one is using the observations of both nee and et to constrain the model simultaneously 2 5 uncertainty analysis quantification and partitioning 2 5 1 monte carlo uncertainty analysis historically only a single set of parameters was used to run an ecosystem model providing a point estimate of the model outputs without accounting for parameter uncertainty lebauer et al 2013 in order to propagate the uncertainty in key model parameters to the uncertainty in outputs of interest monte carlo numerical simulation approach mc is employed in this paper the method iteratively samples from pdfs of key model parameters which are derived using mcmc technique and runs the model using the sampled values of key parameters for 1 500 000 times then the ensembles of outputs can be used to approximate the pdfs of the model outputs and calculate the output statistics such as mean standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv 2 5 2 sobol variance decomposition method in addition to quantify the overall uncertainties in model predictions it is crucial to trace them to specific parameter and highlight the most influential parameters for the purpose of reducing uncertainty in the future the sobol variance decomposition method proposed by sobol 1993 and improved by saltelli 2002 and tarantola et al 2006 is used to quantify the amount of variance that each key model parameter contributes on the variance of model output the underlying assumption is that all the information about model uncertainty can be captured by the output variance pappas et al 2013 specifically in sobol method the variance of the model output is decomposed into components that come from individual parameters as well as parameter interactions pianosi et al 2017 tang et al 2007b assuming the key model parameters are independent the variance decomposition can be expressed by eq 4 4 v y i v i i j i v i j v 12 k the sobol sensitivity indices i e first order sensitivity si eq 5 second order sensitivity sij eq 6 and total order sensitivity sti eq 7 are used to describe the main effect contribution the interaction effects between two parameters and the overall contribution of each key parameter on the output variance 5 s i v i v v e y x i v 6 s i j v i j v v e y x i x j v i v j v 7 s t i 1 v i v v v e y x i v sti is the most comprehensive measure of the uncertainty contribution of each parameter since it represents the sum of all variance contributions involving that parameter tang et al 2007b if a parameter has small si and large sti then the parameter influences the model output by interactions with other parameters and we can identify the specific interaction strengths of this parameter with other parameters through sij the details of the principles and implementations about the sobol method are well documented by saltelli 2002 and lilburne and tarantola 2009 it should be noted that we did not account the uncertainty in driving variables in the uncertainty quantification and decomposition because it is hard to quantify the uncertainty in the measured data of driving variables instead we performed a computational experiment using the informed sipnet model by reducing and increasing the observed values of air temperature and precipitation to investigate the responses of the modeled fluxes to variations of environmental variables 3 results 3 1 morris screening of key parameters the results of morris global sensitivity analysis are displayed in fig 1 where the sensitivity measures μ σ of each parameter are plotted for each output of interest numbers on the right of the points in fig 1 represent the parameter id in table 1 recall that μ reflects the overall influence of a parameter on the output and σ indicates that the parameter has nonlinear effects or interacts with other parameters if μ and σ are both large then the associated parameter has a strong influence on the output involving nonlinearity or interactions and if the opposite then the parameter has negligible influence on the output the euclidean distance between μ σ and the origin is used to represent the importance of parameters relative to each other pappas et al 2013 the key parameters can be determined based on the scatter plot of μ and σ or their euclidean distance for the output variables of nee and et every subplot of fig 1 has a cluster of points around the origin i e μ and σ are close to 0 and also has some points evidently separated from the cluster which can be identified as sensitive parameters since different ecosystem processes and parameters have different effects on different carbon and water fluxes the identification of influential parameters depends on the output of interest in this paper we use the union of sensitive parameters of the output variables nee and et as key parameters of the sipnet model among the 42 model parameters 21 parameters are located outside the ellipses of fig 1a and d these 21 parameters are selected as key model parameters among which 11 parameters are for both nee and et 9 for only nee and 1 for only et these parameters can be classified into five groups 1 initial state values parameter id 2 3 4 initial lai laii initial soil carbon content cs 0 initial soil moisture content as fraction of wc ws 0 cs 0 and ws 0 is a sensitive parameter for nee and et respectively and

sensitive parameter for nee and cfrac and slw are sensitive parameters for both nee and et 3 2 parameter estimation and informed model performance 3 2 1 results of parameter estimation we estimated the posterior distributions of 21 key parameters of sipnet model using two parameter estimation set ups one with only observed nee assimilated and the other one with both measured nee and et assimilated figs 2 and 3 showed the posterior distributions of key parameters of the two set ups respectively when only nee data are used to constrain the model four parameters are well constrained including two photosynthesis related parameters par1 2 t min and two respiration related parameters q10 v rsm when et data are also used to constrain the model seven parameters are well constrained including two photosynthesis related parameters par1 2 t min one respiration related parameters q10 v and four water related parameters f kwue wc rsoil 1 although one respiration related parameter rsm is no longer well constrained four water related parameters become well constrained because of the implicit information in observed et the uncertainties in 21 key parameters defined as the coefficient of variation ranged from 0 87 to 86 89 with an average value of 15 91 when optimized using nee flux only when et data were also optimized the uncertainties of most parameters decreased with the uncertainty ranged from 0 80 to 33 77 averaged at 10 43 the maximum uncertainty decreased by 61 and the mean uncertainty decreased by 34 3 2 2 modeling of carbon and water fluxes we modeled the carbon and water fluxes in 2007 2009 for cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest using the sipnet model parameterized with measured nee data only and with both nee and et data fig 4 showed the validation of the half daily nee and et simulations compared with measured values modeled nee of both parameterizations had good fit to the measured data fig 4a c though the coefficient of determination r2 of nee and et optimization was a little lower than nee only optimization r2 0 83 vs r2 0 85 and the root mean square error rmse was a little higher rmse 0 96 g c m 2 vs rmse 1 03 g c m 2 as for modeled et the nee and et optimization had much better fit to the measured values than nee only optimization fig 4b d r2 increased from 0 30 to 0 70 and rmse dropped from 0 07 cm to 0 05 cm we can see that when incorporating et data into optimization the modeling of et was improved dramatically in addition we also simulated the carbon and water fluxes using the model with initial parameter values and compared the mean seasonal variations of modeled nee and et for the optimized and default model results with the observations fig 5 we can see that the seasonal variations of modeled nee deviated from the observations when using default model but when observations are used to constrain the model the modeled nee and et improved significantly 3 3 uncertainty quantification and partitioning 3 3 1 quantification of output uncertainty we performed the mc simulations using the posterior distributions of the nee and et optimization fig 3 to quantify the uncertainties in the five outputs of interest the distributions of the modeled total nee gpp re et and t of the year 2004 for cbs site are approximately following normal distribution fig 6 the statistics such as mean std and relative uncertainty ru defined as cv of all the outputs of interest are calculated from mc simulations table 2 in table 2 the sum of measured nee gpp re and et of the year 2004 are derived from the eddy covariance measurements while the measured transpiration is lacking the simulated values of nee gpp and re are 237 73 120 82 g c m 2 yr 1 1198 20 267 77 g c m 2 yr 1 960 48 204 14 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively underestimated compared to observed values of 304 63 g c m 2 yr 1 1376 82 g c m 2 yr 1 1072 19 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively the mean of modeled et is 48 31 4 82 cm m 2 yr 1 close to the measured value of 45 79 cm m 2 yr 1 the measured values of nee gpp re and et are within one standard deviation of their distributions the relative uncertainties in the outputs are widely distinct 50 82 for nee 22 35 for gpp 21 25 for re 9 98 for et and 19 54 for t table 2 it is clear that the uncertainty in nee is much larger than gpp and re 3 3 2 partitioning of output uncertainty sobol variance decomposition method is applied to apportion the overall uncertainty in output variables to individual parameters as well as parameter interactions table 3 showed the ranking of 21 key parameters according to their uncertainty contributions to the outputs of interest i e nee gpp re et and t parameters with uncertainty contribution larger than 10 are seen as highly sensitive parameters which are shaded with dark grey in table 3 the parameters whose uncertainty contributions are larger than 1 are classified as sensitive parameters shaded with light grey in table 3 for all the outputs of interest their sums of si are less than 100 ranging from 86 79 to 97 23 this implies that the parameter interaction terms are remarkably small and mostly negligible the direct influences of each parameter drive the overall output variance of the informed model in cbs forest we can see that the ranking of parameters are different if we take different output variable into consideration as for nee there are four highly sensitive parameters a max cs 0 ks slw contributing more than 70 of the uncertainty of modeled nee the photosynthesis related parameter maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and tree physiology related parameter carbon content of leaves slw impact nee through influencing both gpp and re while the two respiration related parameters initial soil carbon content cs 0 soil respiration rate at 0 c and moisture saturated soil ks influence nee through impacting re sensitive parameters for nee include f wc ad q10 s q10 v cfrac t min and kf where f wc ad t min influence nee through gpp q10 s q10 v kf impact nee through re and cfrac influences nee through both gpp and re as for et more than 70 of the output uncertainty is attributable to the two highly sensitive parameters a max and slw there are six sensitive parameters for et including wc cfrac f rsoil 1 ad and laii accounting for 26 of the output uncertainty of et among these eight highly sensitive and sensitive parameters almost all of them impact et through t except rsoil 1 which influences et through soil evaporation all of these can be partly anticipated by looking through the structure of sipnet model so it is urgent to include model structure into the uncertainty analysis framework in the future for gpp re et and t their sums of all first order sensitivity values are all larger than 95 very close to 100 while for nee the sum of all first order sensitivity values is only 86 79 much smaller than 100 the interaction effects of parameters on nee are much larger than that on other output variables so we further analyzed the interaction among parameters for nee fig 7 showed the second order sobol sensitivity indices for the output variable nee the interaction between maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max parameter id 6 and carbon content of leaves slw parameter id 38 is the largest and the interaction contributions of these two parameters with others are the strongest in addition the base soil respiration ks parameter id 25 interacts evidently with the initial soil carbon content cs 0 parameter id 3 as well as the soil respiration q10 q10 s parameter id 26 4 discussion in this paper we performed systematic uncertainty analysis of the simulated carbon and water fluxes in cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest site based on the informed sipnet model and the improved version of the uncertainty analysis framework proposed by ren et al 2013a key parameters were determined by morris global sensitivity analysis instead of oat local sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty estimated using mcmc and eddy covariance data was propagated to output uncertainty using mc simulation the sobol variance decomposition method was employed to quantify the contribution of each key parameter and the interactions to the output uncertainty this method framework may have the potential to help identify the potentially important data collection in the future thereby stimulating further cooperation between modelers and field investigators and improving model performance keenan et al 2011 lebauer et al 2013 the uncertainty contribution of each parameter is the integration of parameter sensitivity and parameter uncertainty lebauer et al 2013 in this study we did not consider the uncertainty in input data and model structure and the initial conditions are included in the definition of parameters so the only way to reduce output uncertainty is to reduce parameter uncertainty to demonstrate the constraint of different data on model parameters two parameter estimation set ups were used one with measured nee only and the other with both nee and et the results showed that only four photosynthesis and respiration related parameters par1 2 t min q10 v rsm can be well constrained in the first set up as for the second set up although one respiration parameter was less constrained four more water related parameters f kwue wc rsoil 1 become well constrained because of the adding of measured et data in addition the uncertainties in most parameters were evidently reduced in the second set up assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously improved the parameterization and overall performance of the model this indicates that different kinds of data constrain parameters of different ecosystem processes previous studies have revealed that multi source data can better constrain ecosystem model dietze et al 2013 kaminski and mathieu 2017 macbean et al 2016 raupach et al 2005 although some data sources may be redundant in the presence of other relevant data keenan et al 2013 we should try more data from multiple sources and with different time scales to better constrain the model parameters in the future we quantified the uncertainties in output variables using mc simulations and found that the uncertainty in nee is much larger than gpp and re table 2 consistent with the result reported by zhang et al 2012 the net ecosystem carbon exchange is the balance between the ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration i e nee is a small difference between the two large fluxes of gpp and re a little variation of either gpp or re will lead to a large variation in nee so the uncertainty in nee is much larger the amplitudes of uncertainties in nee gpp re are bigger than those reported by zhang et al 2012 this may be due to the following several reasons first the ecosystem models used are different second the key parameters were determined using different sensitivity analysis methods morris in this paper and oat in zhang et al 2012 third zhang et al 2012 assumed the coefficient of variations of all key parameters were 10 while in this paper the relative uncertainties of key parameters were estimated through model data fusion ranging from 0 80 to 33 77 the mean simulated summation in 2004 of carbon flux components were underestimated compared to observed values fig 6 the underestimation of gpp is because the peak summer daytime carbon uptake is underestimated and the underestimation of re is due to the underestimated peak nighttime respiration as for nee the peak carbon uptake is bigger than the peak respiration and the flattening in peak uptake side is much more evident than the peak respiration side fig 4c thus leading to the underestimation of nee among the 21 key parameters selected by morris method maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw are highly sensitive parameters for all five outputs contributing more than 70 of the uncertainties in all outputs except nee table 3 the tree physiology parameter slw is used to scale the photosynthetic rate from leaf level to ecosystem level the results clearly indicate that the maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw play an important role in the modeling of carbon and water exchanges in cbs forest this is because of the coupling between the carbon and water dynamics in the informed model however these two parameters are poorly constrained by eddy covariance observations fig 3 thus should be a focus of the collection of existed trait data in literature or trait databases such as try kattge et al 2011 and future field measurement at least for cbs site to see if these results hold in multiple sites we selected another two typical forest ecosystems along the north south transect of east china i e qianyanzhou qyz subtropical coniferous plantation and dinghushan dhs subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest see table c1 in appendix c for site information and performed the whole procedure i e parameter screening parameter estimation uncertainty quantification and partitioning the parameters a max and slw were also the most important parameters for qyz site which contributed more than two thirds of the uncertainty in predicted nee and et ren et al 2013a for dhs site a max and slw contributed around 30 of the uncertainty in nee and more than 50 of the uncertainty in et data not shown these three chinaflux sites represent three typical forest ecosystems in china i e temperate mixed forest subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation and subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest despite the specific sensitivity values and parameter rankings are different among these three types of ecosystems the importance of parameters a max and slw are consistent the influential effects of a max and slw may be attributed to the oversimplified expression of photosynthesis process in sipnet model many factors closely related to the photosynthetic rate are not accounted for in the model structure for example diffuse radiation fertilization effect mercado et al 2009 ren et al 2013b we assumed model parameters were constant but in fact there may be seasonal variations in some parameters for example wang et al 2007 stated that a seasonally varying v cmax and j max in cbm csiro biosphere model yielded better predictions of nee than a constant v cmax and j max for deciduous forests the neglecting of the seasonal variation in parameters may also affect our findings in addition lebauer et al 2013 found that the importance of model parameters sla and vc max dropped considerably when available trait data were incorporated so it is possible to reduce the model uncertainty significantly by refining the photosynthesis process and parameters we did not account for the uncertainty in the driving variables because it is hard to quantify the uncertainty in the measured data of driving variables instead we investigated the responses of the modeled fluxes to variations of environmental variables fig 8 the relationships between the variations of air temperature and cumulative carbon and water fluxes are non linear and non monotonic fig 8a c e g i the net carbon fixation of cbs forest may start to decrease if the amplitude of air temperature increase is larger than 20 fig 8a the relationship between variations of precipitation and cumulative carbon and water fluxes was different which showed a generally increasing trend fig 8b d f h j the slope of the response curve reached its maximum when the precipitation reduction was 50 70 this means the carbon and water fluxes are more sensitive to precipitation when the precipitation is low if the precipitation in cbs decreases the net carbon fixation will decrease evidently furthermore the response curves seem more reasonable when parameterized using both nee and et than using nee only this is probably because the implicit information about water exchange in measured et was included in the nee and et optimization this further confirms that the sipnet model parameterized using nee and et simultaneously is better than that parameterized only using nee this paper addressed some limitations of the uncertainty analysis framework described by ren et al 2013a first we replaced oat local sensitivity analysis method with morris global sensitivity analysis method second we complemented the sobol variance decomposition procedure in the framework with the calculation of parameter interaction effects however there are still several limitations needing further research to address for example the uncertainties in model structure and driving variables were not considered in the framework the autocorrelation of nee and et residuals and the covariance between nee and et residuals were not incorporated in the parameter estimation and in sobol method we did not consider the correlation between parameters 5 conclusions overall the ultimate purpose of uncertainty analysis is to reduce uncertainty the systematic parameter screening parameter estimation uncertainty quantification and partitioning conducted in this paper helped us identify the model parameters that have the strongest effect on the uncertainty of model predictions in cbs broad leaved korean pine mixed forest site and establish the connection and feedback between model simulation and data collection to some extent thereby reducing uncertainty in the future the main results are as follows we compared the posterior distributions of the 21 key parameters using measured nee only vs both nee and et in the mcmc optimization more water related parameters became well constrained in the latter optimization because measured et implicitly contain information about ecosystem water dynamics though the modeled nee of both optimizations had good fit to the measured data the modeled et in the nee and et optimization had much better fit to the measured values this indicates that assimilating carbon and water fluxes simultaneously can evidently improve the parameterization and performance of the model the uncertainties in the modeled nee gpp re et and t are 50 82 22 35 21 25 9 98 and 19 54 respectively the uncertainty of nee is much higher than gpp and re since nee is the small difference of gpp and re among the 21 key parameters maximum net co2 assimilation rate a max and carbon content of leaves slw were classified as highly sensitive parameters for all five outputs of interest to reduce uncertainty we should focus on these two parameters in the trait data collection and field observation and concentrate on the underlying processes of these two parameters in the future model development this is not only suitable for cbs temperate mixed forest but also for qyz

25291,to describe the cascading spread problem of ecosystem vulnerability with continuous disturbance we propose a novel model based on object function geopetri net ofgpnm the model makes ecological environment petri net fully reflect in ecological environment system in a graphical manner on this basis we design four dynamic indicators i e vulnerability adaptability state of cascade spread state probability for each sub ecosystem and two global indicators i e scale of cascade spread and scale rate for entire ecosystem taking shenfu coal field in shaanxi province of china as case study we simulate the impact of accumulative vulnerability and dynamic evolution of three states over time the results showed that depending on different states of the subsystem the factors used to maintain the balance of system s original state are also different the results showed that cyclic structure of petri net based on the fluidity of a river made the ecosystem more vulnerable than acyclic structure the results also showed that the emission rate of mine dust q 0 the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ had great effect on achieving the optimal state of ecosystem q 0 played an important role in slowing occurrence time of cascade spread the rational investments by government in ecological construction and pollution management are the key to balancing economic expenditure with ecological benefits the obtained results were quite convincing to prove the novel contribution of this research to the field of vulnerability with cascading spread analysis which might continue to be the reference for restoration and reconstruction of the environment keywords ecological environment system vulnerability with cascading spread object function geopetri net dust migration optimal state 1 introduction the term vulnerability was originated from natural disaster research in the 1960s janssen et al 2006 as an important analytical tool in sustainability science wang et al 2017a b zhang et al 2017 the vulnerability research has been widely used in ecology collin and melloul 2003 semeraro et al 2016 vulnerability is generally thought to be the resistance or resilience of the ecosystem in response to external and internal disturbances the simulation and analysis of vulnerability are the key way to assess whether the environment is deteriorating hong et al 2016 therefore the study of ecosystem vulnerability not only provides a scientific foundation for the restoration and reconstruction of the fragile environment but also is an important prerequisite for regional sustainable development which makes it the basis of ecological environment management zhang et al 2017 from the perspective of the system ecology components of vulnerability are characterized by cause and effect relationships chang et al 2017 many researches has extensively studied the impact on the ecosystem under the background of natural disturbances such as typhoon huang et al 2011 drought brown et al 2016 and sea water intrusion danladi et al 2017 there are studies to explore the impact caused by human activities chi et al 2017 especially by the long distance migration of pollutants on the ecological environment as early as 1960s griffin et al 1968 found that asian dust could be transported to the north pacific and deposited on the seafloor on this basis gao et al 2009 studied the long range transport of asian dust and its effects on marine ecosystem bisquert et al 2017 connected mining waste with nearby ecosystem by the process of atmospheric deposition and thought that the metallic mining waste had adverse health effects on population living whether in the natural or human disturbance response it is undeniable that analysis and simulation of the ecological environment vulnerability are from the point of view of the results until now less attention has been paid to the phenomenon of cascading spread from one to other ecological subsystems caused by pollutant migration especially by mine dust in addition the evolution process of cascading vulnerability is generally neglected it is remarkable that ecosystem does not always demonstrate vulnerability under any disturbance wang et al 2017a b as we all know vulnerability is the inherent property originated from the internal of the system kochunov and li 1993 only when its damage caused by disturbance exceeds a certain threshold can the vulnerability be manifested chen and chen 2010 in fact ecological environment system ees is defined as a complex and stable cascade system different ecological subsystems in the ees are closely related and restricted to each other by material and energy flow they maintain the stability and balance of the biosphere when one subsystem is disturbed by external disturbance the subsystem can still maintain stability over a short period of time because of its self adjustment capacity however as the time goes by the vulnerability will exceed the allowable ecological threshold at this point the self adjustment of the subsystem decreases or disappears and the phenomenon of collapse in the subsystem occurs wang et al 2015 because of the relationship between different ecological subsystems in structure and function the pollutants from interference source will be migrated and settled over a long distance and spread all over the ees so the collapse of a subsystem may lead to cascading effect and others may collapse one after another with the deepening of external interference the ecological environment is increasingly fragile and eventually will be like domino effect which results in a complete collapse of the entire ees the previous researches on the problem of vulnerability with cascade spread focused on the power system xue et al 2017 warnier et al 2017 industrial symbiosis network zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2017a b li et al 2017 cluster supply network wang and xiao 2016 and other fields rarely on the ecological environment the methods used to solve this problem are also divided into three categories complex network theory disaster dynamics and geopetri net model the vulnerability of ecosystem environment is strongly regional and dynamically variable over time li et al 2008 srinivasan et al 2013 in summary the extant methods suffer from the following limitations when they are applied in the field of ecological environment firstly the model of complex network tends to describe the topology of the system and cascading relationships between nodes depend greatly on the degree of node vulnerability of cascade spread based on complex network model is to discuss the impact on the whole system when the failure node is removed zeng et al 2013 disaster dynamics model is often defined as the function of time and it has a massive advantage to simulate the evolution process of the vulnerability with cascade spread over time li and chen 2014 helbing and kühnert 2003 nevertheless these mentioned models could not comprehensively reveal the time and geographical features of ecological environment therefore the methods are unable to adequately show that the failure node is how to spread on the geographical and logical space moreover the traditional petri net is synchronization concurrency sequentiality peterson 1981 karmakar and dasgupta 2011 joyce et al 2011 which is regarded as a dynamic simulation tool the concepts of petri net for gis so called geopetri net is powerful process control and graphic performance ability ge et al 2010 it is well suited to represent the geographical and logical interactions in a system zhou and reniers 2016 but geopetri net is commonly used to simulate the failure probability of the place by transferring number of the tokens zhou and reniers 2016 sultana and chen 2009 there is at a loss to dynamically calculate the multiple variables associated with the place which makes geopetri net model becomes a major obstacle to the application of simulation and analysis of vulnerability cascade spread therefore the existing methods cannot comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the spatial cascade and temporal evolution and these methods cannot be used to simulate the phenomenon of vulnerability cascading spread under the disturbance in the ees in consideration of the above three shortcomings this paper introduces the concept of function into geopetri net a new modeling method is established namely ecosystem vulnerability of cascade spread model based on object function geopetri net ecosystem vulnerability with cascading spread based on object function geopetri net ofgpn the structure of the article is shown in fig 1 the main purpose of this paper is to use the model of ofgpn to simulate the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread caused by continuous disturbances in the ees aiming to solve the following 6 problems 1 how to make elements of the petri net fully reflect in the ees and construct cascade petri net of ecological environment 2 how to use the model of ofgpn to describe the problem of vulnerability with cascading spread caused by continuous interference 3 on the basis of the traditional object petri nets how to define its triggering rules in the ofgpnm and then redefine the vulnerability with cascading spread characteristics 4 how to determine the ecological threshold and analyze the relationship between vulnerability and threshold and then define state of the object places 5 how to achieve an optimum status in the process of cascade spread 6 how to apply ofgpnm to a case study determine the suitable setting of parameters in the model and analyze the influence of parameter setting on the vulnerability cascading propagation 2 methodology 2 1 construction of ecological environment petri net the cascade effect links ecological processes with human disturbance following a pattern similar to the industrial chain which provides insight into the complex relationship between human and environment notte et al 2017 according to the connectivity of the water area in the geographical position the wetland cascade ecosystem was built hatvani et al 2017 han et al 2017 established a dune meadow cascade ecosystem in horqin sandy land of china on this foundation according to the directions of pollutant migration and the geographical relationship between ecological subsystems this paper constructs the ecological environment petri net based on gis to study the cascading problem of ecological environment vulnerability in this paper we abstract the ees into a petri net of ecological environment and the specific methods of constructing petri net are as follows 1 the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net this path is the key to build a petri net of ecological environment the pollutants that are continuously discharged from the source can be migrated and settled at long distance under the influence of meteorological factors so this section attempts to trace the trajectory of pollutant migration and the trajectory is regarded as cascade spread path of ecological environment petri net in study of trajectory tracking hysplit model has better performance than others flexpart 6 2 of the norwegian institute for air research and calpuff 5 8 of the u s environmental protection agency makra et al 2011 hysplit 4 mainly uses airflow dynamics model to simulate the long range migration of pollutants forward trajectory and analyzes its diffusion direction and distance in view of the large uncertainty and the limited significance of single trajectory stohl 1998 clustering a large number of three dimensional trajectories is a more reliable method for reflecting the diffusion path of the pollutant based on the airflow characteristics thus forward trajectory clustering path of the hyslit model is abstracted as the vulnerability cascade spread path of the ecological environment petri net 2 the object place of ecological environment petri net the object place is one of the core members of the ecological environment petri net it is a subsystem that abstracts the complete structure and function from ees firstly pollution source is taken as the starting point and others are searched on the cascade spread path then all the subsystems including town yellow river 1 yellow river 2 mountain sandy land and park are abstracted as object places finally the state and behavior of different subsystems are regarded as the attribute and function respectively the sketch of the abstract relations between object place and ecological subsystem is shown in fig 2 thus the subsystem is abstracted as an object place with oriented object features 3 the transition of ecological environment petri net it is a bridge which connects one object place with others on the basis of 2 the relationships between subsystems are abstracted from ees including virtual association and true association virtual association is the logical relationship in the ecological environment petri net which reflects the cumulative influence on subsystem under the disturbances true association is geological relationship which shows the cascading effect the former is graphically represented virtual transition in ofgpn model while the latter is expressed true transition the steps of determining the transition are divided into four parts 1 add virtual transition a virtual transition is added to each object place from itself to itself 2 determine whether there is a geospatial relationship between the two object places on the same cascading spread path if so a true transition is established between them at the same time the pre and post arcs are added 3 check whether or not there is the connectivity between the object places based on 2 if it exists for example yellow river in shaanxi and shanxi and yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi on the first path in fig 9 the two are merged into the same place in other words if the two object places on the same cluster path are the same type and have the connectivity in the geographic location they can be treated as an object place in the process of constructing petri net the structural redundancy is largely avoided which is the advantage of object petri net 4 determine the association between multiple cascade spread paths the relation of multiple paths is described as the principles of and and or which is the same as the traditional petri net 4 ecological environment petri net for the cascading problem of vulnerability the ees is abstracted as ecological environment petri net ecological subsystems are abstracted as object place the relations between subsystems are abstracted as transitions the purpose of this paper is to use the related elements of the ecological environment petri net to simulate the dynamic evolution process of ees vulnerability cascade spread 2 2 description of ofgpn model the ofgpn model is a mathematical representation of ecological environment petri net the model is structured as a eight tuple ofgpn p t i o λ fire s e 1 p p 1 p 2 p n is a finite set of object places and n 0 p stands for subsystem and n stands for the number of subsystems pi a f has two components a is a finite set of attributes and can be split into subsets as and ad gathering respectively the static and dynamic attributes a s x 1 x 2 x k is used to describe the inherent characteristics of object place including geographic data and pollutant indicators and as is input to the model a d x k 1 x k 2 x l is used to describe multiple variable characteristics of object place including vulnerability adaptability the states of cascade spread steady status the status of load the status of collapse and status probability and ad is calculated by the function in ofgpn a s a d a a s a d ϕ f f k 1 f k 2 f l is a finite set of functions which t is the number of iterations or time a d f t a s f f a s a s a d a d f is used to update ad and the concrete formulas are defined in sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 2 t t 1 t 2 t m is a finite set of transitions and m 0 stands for the number of transitions t stands for the relationship between subsystems which can be split into subsets vt and tt gathering respectively the virtual and true transitions vt represents the self accumulation relation in logic and is expressed in dotted lines tt indicates the relationships of the probability and the full probability accumulation in the geospatial and is expressed by a solid lines 3 i δ 1 δ 2 δ m is a finite and propositional set of pre arcs which is from bags of object places to transitions i represented triggering conditions for cascade spread the possible propositions of i are δ i x i t h i t h i x i γ t h i x i γ t h i which xi refers to vulnerability without specification below thi is the load threshold γthi γ 1 is the collapse threshold 4 o ε 1 ε 2 ε m is a finite set of post arcs which is from transitions to bags of object places o stands for positive and negative effect the value has two kinds of and indicates that the change positively promotes the vulnerability of the object place while represents a negative effect 5 λ λ 1 λ 2 λ m is a finite set of cascade spread rate corresponding to transition which λ 1 t 0 t 0 is the average time of pollutant migration to the object place 6 fire p t is triggering state and stands for the occurrence degree of cascade spread p i p f i r e p i 0 1 f i r e p i 1 means that transition is triggered and cascade spread must occur f i r e p i 0 means that transition will not be triggered and cascade spread will not happen otherwise the transition is triggered by the probability of load state and the formula is described in detail in section 2 3 3 7 s t is the scale of cascade spread and e is the rate of cascade spread scale which are the global indicators of ees section 2 3 4 is defined in detail above all the biggest difference between object function petri net and traditional object petri net is that multiple indicators in object place can be dynamically calculates taking the positive response relationship between river subsystem and town subsystem as an example the graphically description and the trigger process of the ofgpn model are shown in fig 3 in two subsystems of river pj and town pi we define four functions f 5 f 8 for four dynamic indicators vulnerability x 5 adaptability x 6 state of cascade spread x 7 state probability x 8 when the transition is triggered the token is moved from pj to pi four dynamic indicators in pi are dynamically updated as the token moves which makes the entire petri net model dynamically calculated 2 3 model of vulnerability with cascade spread based ofgpn the cascading spread analysis of the vulnerability mainly includes four parts 1 to clarify the triggering rule of ofgpn two different kinds of scenarios are now introduced in section 2 3 1 2 to redefine the new vulnerability with the cascading characteristic based on the concept of typical vulnerability in section 2 3 2 3 how does the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread occur 4 what are the cascading impacts on the whole ees how to achieve the optimal state 2 3 1 scenarios of the ofgpn 2 3 1 1 scenarios of accumulation for the triggering rules of petri net huang 2010 defines four kinds of rules in fuzzy petri net for knowledge system expression ge et al 2010 defines several rules in geopetri net which has made some achievements in simulation of the geographic spatial relation the above studies mainly define the triggering rules as and or and other form of combination on the work of predecessors this paper defines triggering rules in ofgpn the rules are used to represent not only the sequence of cascade spread but also the degree of cascade sensitivity δ x i from the previous object place the three rules correspond to the three states of the cascade spread in the ecological environment petri nets fig 4 a and c are the exception of b rule1 self accumulation as depicted in fig 4 a if t h j x j then δ x i t δ t 0 in rule1 a virtual transition vt is added to object place itself practical significance of the self accumulation is when pollutants enter the subsystem pj they will not immediately have a cascading effect on pi but the impact on the pj will continue to accumulate due to self adjustment ability of ecological subsystem it can remain stable in the short term until the vulnerability of the object place exceeds the ecological load threshold therefore the transition will not be triggered the phenomenon of cascade spread will not occur and m pj 0 in this rule pj has no cascading effect on pi and the vulnerability of pj is self accumulation with time rule2 probability accumulation as depicted in fig 4 b if t h j x j γ t h j then δ x i t δ t x j t δ t m p j rule2 is to establish the fuzzy cascade spread relation on the geographical space for the object place pi and pj in most of the previous cascade models whether the cascade spread occurs or not is only quantified by two values of 0 and 1 when fire 0 token does not trigger cascading spread does not occur and the object place maintains stability when fire 1 it would be in the opposite case according to the actual situation of ees there is often an intermediate state from the state of stability to collapse for example the continuous discharge of pollutants in the mining area will cause the temporary deterioration of the ecological environment in the surrounding areas because of the massive and mature ess and the effective government regulation the temporary deterioration of the mining area does not lead to the collapse of the mine subsystem which means that the ees should be resilient thus the state of short term deterioration is set to a probability value m pj and is defined as load at the same time the transition is triggered in rule2 and the degree of cascade sensitivity δ x i also increases with the probability m pj until it increases to 1 rule3 full probability accumulation as depicted in fig 4 c if x j γ t h j then δ x i t δ t x j t δ t in rule3 the transition is triggered and the cascade spread occurs δ x i increases with the maximum probability i e m pj 1 2 3 1 2 scenarios of sequence the above scenarios of accumulation respectively have carried on the definition from the logic rule 1 and spatial rule 2 3 relationships now we try to take both relationships into account the petri net representation of the sequential scenarios is as shown in fig 5 since xi is gradually increasing and γ 1 it can be seen the priority relationships between the three triggering conditions the self accumulation is the highest priority in scenarios of accumulation followed by probability accumulation in other words the virtual transitions have higher trigger priorities than true transitions the trigger mode in fig 5 is the same as the mode of if pi then p 1 or p 2 in the traditional petri net huang 2010 ge et al 2010 in particular the difference between them is the trigger mode the former is triggered by proposition about the priority relationship for pre arc while the latter is triggered by probability based on prior knowledge as mentioned in section 2 1 the object places yellow river p 1 and p 3 are extracted from a cascade spread path and they have connectivity on the geographic space as shown in fig 6 a the object places of p 1 and p 3 can be merged as shown in fig 6 b we can see that the petri net in fig 6 b appears the cyclic structure in order to avoid the deadlock of token in the cyclic structure the priority of the pre arc should be explained in the petri net in case of multiple true transitions associated with the same object place the scenario of sequence depends on the sequence that the object places are extracted from cascade spread path for example p 1 is associated with p 2 and p 4 through two true transitions in fig 6 b referring to the sequence in fig 6 a the p 2 will be triggered before p 4 the pre arc in fig 6 b is labeled with the trigger sequence of token 2 3 2 vulnerability based on ofgpn in the ecological environment petri net the vulnerability is one of the dynamic attributes of object place although researchers have different views on the concept of vulnerability o brien et al 2004 li et al 2008 kochunov and li 1993 it is believed that vulnerability consists of three parts exposure sensitivity and adaptability yohe and tol 2002 adger 2006 in cascade system the impacts from its causative nodes are commonly regarded as the cascade spread effect chen et al 2010 li and chen 2014 in this paper the definition of the vulnerability with cascading characteristic not only consists of the above three parts but also considers the degree of cascade sensitivity from other object places therefore the vulnerability of object place pi is mainly related to the following factors the vulnerability of last moment the degree of cascade sensitivity of this moment self adaptability of this moment and internal distraction of this moment for time t δt the vulnerability xi t δt of object place is simulated by the following function 1 x i t δ t x i t λ δ x i t δ t e t δ t τ x i t δ t ξ i t δ t in formula 1 the four items of the right hand side are corresponding to the four factors mentioned above according to the scenarios of accumulation in section 2 3 1 formula 1 can be transformed into formula 2 in detail 2 x i t δ t x i t e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ t h j x j x i t λ i x j t δ t m p j e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ t h j x j γ t h j x i t λ i x j t δ t e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ x j γ t h j the vulnerability x i t is shown as the first item when t 0 x i 0 is the initial vulnerability of object place the computing method of x i 0 is as shown in formula 3 x i 0 is the function of pollutant indicators which are related in external disturbance now we simulate the continuous discharge of pollutants and lead to the fragility of the ecosystem so the concentration of pollutants is a factor to characterize the external disturbance which is mentioned in formula 5 the main purpose of the second item is to mimic the degree of cascade sensitivity with scenarios of the ofgpn the item has been described in section 2 3 1 in this item λ i is cascade spread rate in the third item τ i 0 is self adaptive coefficient which is closely related to the structure and function of the ecological subsystem itself the richer and more mature the structure and function of the subsystem are the stronger ability of self adaptability is if so the value of the self adaptive coefficient τ i tends towards infinitude otherwise the value of the self adaptive coefficient τ i tends to 0 with the increasing t this item will decrease or even disappear the fourth item represents internal disturbance f μ σ is a formula which is a normal distribution with expectation μ and covariance σ 2 3 3 analysis of the state and probability with cascade spread in order to analyze the state and probability with cascade spread the state with cascade spread is defined as the following three types steady status status of load and status of collapse the steady state is in a relatively mature ecological subsystem as long as the vulnerability caused by the external disturbance does not exceed the load threshold the structure and function of the ecological subsystem will not change that is the subsystem has the ability to maintain or restore its relative stability the status of load is that vulnerability has exceeded the load threshold but has not exceeded the collapse threshold in this status the structure and function have not yet been completely lost the subsystem still has the ability to recover at this time the subsystem begins to appear the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread the status of collapse is that the vulnerability has exceeded the collapse threshold and its function and structure have been completely lost the degree of cascade sensitivity has the most obvious impact in this status from the above definition we can see whether the cascade propagation phenomenon occurs or not and how much impact has on other subsystems if it happens which have a close relationship with the two ecological thresholds therefore identifying these two thresholds is an important part in this section before that the initial vulnerability x i 0 is defined as follows 3 x i 0 k 1 n η k c k c 0 in formula 3 n is the number of pollutant indicators η k is the kth coefficient of pollutant indicator c k is the kth concentration of pollutant indicator including numerical simulation or measured value c 0 is the kth concentration limits for pollutant indicator in fact the determination of xi 0 can be changed according to the actual situation of environmental assessment the gaussian model will be used to simulate the concentration of any object place on the ecological environment petri net the gaussian model is one of the most recognized methods for calculating the concentration of pollutants at a point eiharbawi et al 2008 it assumes that the migration of pollutants is the gauss distribution and the standard deviation depends on the distance between the pollutants from the source of emission or the duration from the beginning of the release according to the improved gaussian model he et al 2010 a real time system for monitoring the concentration of toxic pollutants in the dynamic diffusion process is developed with gis correspondingly which is effective and simple for prediction and evaluation of pollutants diffusion namely 4 c x y 0 2 q 0 2 π 1 5 σ x σ y σ z e x x 0 2 2 σ x 2 e y y 0 2 2 σ y 2 e x 0 2 2 σ z 2 in this paper the model is used to calculate the concentration of 3d clustering trajectory on the hysplit4 owing to ignoring the height of toxic pollutants in the vertical direction of trajectory the above model can be improved which is shown in formula 5 5 c x y z t ρ i q 0 4 π x σ y σ z 1 2 exp μ 4 x y 2 σ y z 2 σ z in formulas 4 and 5 q 0 is the emission rate of pollutants μ is wind speed x y and z are the distances between the pollutants from the source of emission in x y and z directions σx σy and σz denote the coefficients of diffusion in x y and z directions respectively which is related to weather and average wind speed he et al 2010 ρ i is the contribution of clustering trajectory i tipping points in complex systems may imply risks of unwanted collapse but also opportunities for positive change scheffer et al 2012 on these points the occurrence of thresholds is imminent bowker et al 2014 in the real world it is difficult or even impossible to determine ecological thresholds that depend on vegetation geomorphology hydrology geography climate land and so on engle 2011 when the subsystem is disturbed by the external environment the initial vulnerability xi 0 reflects the function and structure of the subsystem itself so this paper assumes that the load threshold thi of each object place is proportional to the initial vulnerability x i 0 q max under the maximum allowable emission rate of pollutants 6 t h i α 1 x i 0 q max where α 0 is the tolerance parameter on the one hand it depicts the ability of the subsystem to resist or suffer with external disturbance the pollution of mine dust on the other hand the parameter reflects that governmental agencies could provide investment proportion in constructing and protecting ecological environment system the greater the cost of investment is the greater the parameter α is the greater the ability of the ecosystem to resist external pollution and the more stable the ecosystem is according to above definitions the probability distribution with cascade spread m pi of the object place is defined as follows 7 m p i 0 t h i x i steady status x i t t h i γ t h i t h i t h i x i γ t h i status of load 1 x i γ t h i status of collapse in formula 7 γ 1 is the resilience parameter which largely determines the time of ecosystem in collapse state in the actual world the parameter γ depicts government s contribution to improvement the structure and function after polluted ecosystem in detail the parameter reflects that governmental agencies could provide investment proportion in putting pollution under control the greater the parameter γ is the greater the load capacity of ecosystem is to avoid a massive collapse of the whole ecosystem the more cost of the pollution management will be invested based on the minimum of scale of cascading spread the existing research on ecosystem is how to ensure the reasonable investment therefore the selection of two parameters is not only the key to balance economic input and ecological benefits but also is a very important issue in cascade spread research 2 3 4 analysis of the scale with cascade spread to describe the cascade spread scope of the vulnerability in the ecological environment petri net we first introduce the concept of the scale with cascade spread it depicts the cascade spread of any object place at any time in the whole ecological environment petri net the scale with cascade spread is defined as formula 8 8 s t 1 n j 1 n m p j in formula 8 n is the number of object place m pj is the probability with cascade spread as shown in formula 7 the rate of cascade spread scale is defined as following 9 e t 1 t s t where t is the number of iterations or time for the whole system the smaller the e is the smaller the probability of cascade spread in the number of iterations occurs on the contrary the bigger the e is the greater the probability of cascade spread is according to formulas 7 and 8 e is closely related to α and γ the purpose of establishing the model is to ensure that the system has the minimum e under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time the model can further ensure that the investment of the whole ecological environment should be reasonable namely the parameters selection of α and γ is just right therefore the model of the scale with cascade spread is as follows 10 min e α γ min t 1 t s t min 1 n t 1 t j 1 n m p i t t t s t 1 3 a case study 3 1 study area and datasets the shenfu coal field 38 52 39 27 n 110 05 110 50 e is located in the northernmost part of shaanxi province east of the yellow river as the boundary west of shaanxi and mongolia border the south of coal seam outcrops the area of shenfu coal field is 5829 56 km2 tao et al 2010 location of study area and surrounding provinces is shown in fig 7 the original ecological environment of shenfu coal field is aeolian and loess landform the natural conditions are tough and the desertification of the soil and water is serious which make the primary geology and ecological environment fragile tao et al 2010 in addition the irrational exploitation of mineral resources has exacerbated the vulnerability of ecological subsystem in mining areas with the occurrence of long distance migration mine dust accumulates in cascade spread path of ecological environment petri net once the vulnerability of the object place exceeds the ecological threshold the self adaptability of ecological subsystem will decrease or disappear and the subsystem becomes more fragile which causes a partial collapse of a certain subsystem wang et al 2015 due to the logical and geospatial relationships between the various subsystems the vulnerability spreads across all subsystems and the collapse of one subsystem may lead to the collapse of the other subsystems that depend on them causing the entire ees completely crash for the test area base data were obtained from 1 meteorological data acquired from global data assimilation system gdas ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 2 image data which obtained from hysplit4 0 google earth and arcgis10 2 3 historical weather data http www tianqihoubao com lishi and 4 other data obtained from published articles the software of microsoft visual basic 6 0 is used to calculate and simulate the results in the model of ofgpn 3 2 cascade petri net construction of ecological environment cascade petri net construction of ecological environment is divided into the following steps the first step is to use forward trajectory of hysplit4 model to obtain the long range migration path of mine dust with air mass in this study 36 h forward trajectories are calculated one time a day 00utc from january 1 to december 31 2016 using hysplit version 4 0 the starting location for the trajectories is the environmental monitoring station in shenmu latitude 38 83 n longitude 110 5 e at an elevation of 100 m above ground level an elevation of 100 m is selected because it is easy to observe the effect of ecological environment caused by dust but also avoid toxicological effect of the material and dust in air toxicological based on tvs total spatial variance draxler et al 2012a b that minimizes the intra cluster differences among trajectories while maximizes the inter cluster differences the 696 forward trajectories are clustered into 6 cluster mean forward trajectories as shown in fig 8 the second step is to make six cluster mean forward trajectories show in the arcgis overlaid with vector data such as towns rivers mountains sand parks etc in order to improve shortcoming of the hysplit model with rough maps lei et al 2010 and improve recognition of ecological subsystem the information of six trajectories is imported into arcgis10 2 as shown in fig 9 the last step is to extract the cascade petri net of ecological environment based on the trajectory in fig 9 description of object places and their details on six cluster mean forwards trajectories is shown in table 1 it is particularly emphasized that the first path red line across the yellow river in shaanxi and shanxi p 2 passes hequ country p 3 cross the yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi p 4 and reaches huairen country p 5 the flow direction of the yellow river on the first path is from p 4 to p 2 and is marked in fig 9 owing to the fluidity of the yellow river the pollution is not limited to the area where the pollution occurs but can quickly affect the downstream and even the ecological environment of the whole river therefore p 4 and p 2 are merged into the same place particularly the fourth trajectory should be abandoned because there is no subsystem to be extracted so far the cascade petri net has been finished as shown in fig 10 3 3 initialization of vulnerability in ofgpn the dust floats in the air and absorbs a lot of heavy metals due to the capability of long distance transmission and the significant effect on environment yuan and sun 2016 heavy metals are regard as the pollutant indicators different minerals contain different kinds of heavy metals and the proportion of heavy metals is not the same in this study pb hg cd cr and as were selected as pollution indicators in the object place the xi 0 is calculated by formula 3 the toxicity coefficients of heavy metals are regarded as the weight of pollutant indicator the concentration limits and the toxicity coefficients for heavy metals are as shown in table 2 the above heavy metals accounted for 30 percent of mine dust and the proportion of pb hg cd cr and as is 3 2 1 4 1 according to the above description the concentration of each object place in fig 10 is calculated according to formula 5 using formula 6 calculates the initial vulnerability x i 0 q max under the maximum allowable emission rate of mine dust as shown in table 3 results of concentration and initial vulnerability xi 0 under different emission rates for each object place can be seen in tables 5 and table a1 of appendix a 3 4 description of parameters in ecological simulation process appendix b lists the pseudo code of the ecological simulation process of the model of ofgpn and the input and output values of the sub models in simulation process the description and selection of parameters are shown in table 4 4 simulation results 4 1 state transition of ecosystem in the process of cascade spread dynamic evolution of three states reflects the turning point of the degeneration from quantitative change to qualitative change this process and updates for four dynamic indicators are represented by the model of ofgpn in section 4 1 green place indicates ecosystem is in stable state load state is represented by the orange place red place shows ecosystem is in collapse state a solid point represents token taking the fifth path acyclic structure and the first path cyclic structure as examples parameter settings are as follows q 0 21 kg h α 0 2 γ 5 and the simulation results are as shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively fig 11 a shows that tokens of mu us sandland p 21 yellow river p 22 and yinshan p 23 start from itself and goes back to its original position when t 1 in the meantime four dynamic indicators including vulnerability adaptability the states of cascade spread and status probability are updated once based on the rule of self accumulation in fig 4 a curves of dynamic indicators are under the diagram of the evolution of state transition as we can see each subsystem on the fifth path is in stable state in fig 11 a fig 11 b and c shows that orange tokens in mu us sandland and yellow river are transferred to the next subsystem one after another it represents the two subsystems are in load status when t 26 and t 33 respectively according to the rule of probability accumulation in fig 4 b four dynamic indicators are updated a comparison among fig 11 d and e shows that when t 53 61 all the subsystems are in load state while when t 62 yellow river first collapsed therefore the moment of t 61 is the critical time when the degradation of the ecosystem is complete and irreversible under specified parameters the optimal state of ecosystem in section 2 3 4 is in fig 11 d that is there is no collapsed subsystem in this moment as you can see from fig 11 f all subsystems on the fifth path are in the state of collapse and the function and structure of subsystems have been completely lost fig 12 a shows the original state on the first path according to the description of study case we combine the yellow river in shanxi and shaanxi p 2 with yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi p4 as shown in fig 12 b fig 12 e shows that when t 24 27 all the subsystems on the first path are in load state while when t 28 in fig f the yellow river is in collapse state therefore fig 12 e is the optimal state of ecosystem from the curves of the adaptability and vulnerability in fig 11 we can see that the sub system with stable state has low vulnerability and the adaptability its self adaptability value is at a high level while the subsystem is in collapse state vulnerability is out of control and its adaptability is close to zero overall figs 11 and 12 show that based on both acyclic and cyclic structures state transition of ecosystem diffuses from the source of pollution along the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net 4 2 cascade spread of vulnerability the first part is simulated on basis of section 3 in ofgpn model other parameter settings are as follows q 0 21 kg h α 0 2 γ 5 and the simulation results are as shown in fig 13 the curves of vulnerability the left hand side of the axis and probability the right hand side of the axis for 22 object places are displayed in fig 13 and the curve of probability m pi reflects the state with cascade spread of object place in fig 13 a we can see that 1 when the object place is in stable status m pi 0 there is a linear relationship between the vulnerability and the number of iterations or time 2 the greater the concentration external disturbance of the object place is the more fragile the ecological subsystem is and its self adaptability gradually reduced as time goes on when 0 m pi 1 the phenomenon of cascade spread takes place and there is an exponential increase in vulnerability in especial when the object place is in collapse status m pi 1 the change rate of vulnerability is obviously greater than the load status from fig 13 a c and e acyclic structure we can see that when the phenomenon of cascade spread does not take place the order of vulnerability is x 15 x 20 x 16 x 17 x 18 x 19 when the phenomenon of cascade spread takes place the order of ultimate vulnerability is x 16 x 15 x 17 x 18 x 19 x 20 the reason for this is that the vulnerability of the object place pi is affected by the cascade spread of pi 1 associated with pi which makes the ecosystem more vulnerable from fig 13 b and d with cyclic structure we can see that object places of p 2 p 4 p 9 p 13 with cyclic structure are easy to be more fragile than the others that is on the same cascade spread path 4 3 scale of cascade spread and parameters selection since the cascade spread scope of the vulnerability s t is described and characterized by sensitive parameters of the emission rate of mine dust q 0 the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ the relations between these controllable parameters and s t in ofgpnm are discussed below firstly the influence of q 0 on s t is discussed in fig 12 as we all know the maximum allowable emission rates of mine dust correspond to the heights of exhaust funnel according to the local standards of chongqing db 50 418 2016 the emission limits of mine dust are specified the height of exhaust funnel of 15 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m corresponding to the maximum allowable emission rates of q 0 1 9 kg h 3 1 kg h 12 kg h 21 kg h 32 8 kg h other parameters are α 0 2 γ 5 taking yellow river p 6 as example the curves of the adaptability and state probability are shown in fig 14 under five different emission rates table 5 shows the results of concentration under different emission rates for each subsystem from the fig 14 and table 5 we can see that the greater the emission rate of mine dust is the greater the concentration of the subsystem is the earlier the time of cascading spread occurs and the more fragile the ecological subsystem is on the basis of section 2 3 the relations between the different emission rates of mine dust q 0 and scope of the vulnerability s t are shown in fig 15 from the fig 15 when α 0 2 and γ 5 the range of q 0 12 kg h can ensure that the whole ecological environment petri net does not appear phenomenon of large scale collapse in addition the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ are considered comprehensively in the next article under different emission rates to take the q 0 21 kg h as example we look for the tipping points of α and γ in the simulation α 0 3 and the iteration step is 0 1 γ 1 20 and the iteration step is 2 the simulation results are as displayed in fig 16 in fig 16 the rectangular symbol of a shows that the values of α and γ are too small and the whole ecosystem has been in collapse status at the 70th iteration the rectangular symbol of b displays that the values of α and γ are too big and the ecosystem does not collapse in the limited number of iterations then the color curves of meeting the constraints in section 2 3 4 are presented in fig 16 in formula 10 when α 0 1 and γ 0 9 α 0 2 and γ 0 7 α 0 5 and γ 5 α 1 and γ 3 in fig 16 the values of e are 56 7712 56 7021 53 0514 and 45 3296 respectively it can be seen that when the emission rate is q 0 21 kg h α 1 and γ 3 are the optimal values 5 discussion 5 1 factors to improve different states accumulative process of vulnerability and dynamic evolution of three states can change over time figs 11 and 12 depending on different states of the subsystem the factors used to maintain the balance of system s original state are also different the vulnerability of ecosystem function and structure is reversible under steady state and load state while the collapse state is irreversible for the subsystem in stable state self adjustment ability of ecological environment is the key to maintain the original state fig 11 a for the subsystem in load state it is necessary to eliminate the interference to reduce the vulnerability of the ecosystem so that the ecosystem can be rebalanced fig 11 b and c for the subsystem in collapse state there is an irreversible and complete change in the ecosystem and the vulnerability has not been changed we suggest that decision makers establish a corresponding early warning system and take different protective measures based on different states 5 2 cyclic and acyclic structure based on both acyclic and cyclic structures the diffusion directions of state transition are the same figs 11 and 12 that is both are from the source of pollution along the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net but subsystem in petri net with cyclic structure is not only easy to be more fragile than the others but also could accelerate the cascading spread time of occurring fig 13 which is very consistent with the reality in the ees in actual river subsystem because of the fluidity of the yellow river the pollution is not limited to the area where the pollution occurs but can quickly affect the downstream and even the ecological environment of the whole river on the other hand river is the main drinking water and the pollutants can directly poison the human body and can also indirectly harm human health through the food chain and irrigated farmland wang et al 2015 therefore the ecological environment has cyclic structure to enhance the connectivity between subsystems which quickens the mobility among subsystems and the vulnerability increases 5 3 optimal state of ecosystem 5 3 1 emission rate of mine dust based on the improved gaussian model the emission rate of mine dust greatly largely determines the concentration of dust under specified meteorological factors the greater the concentration of the subsystem is the earlier the time of cascading spread occurs and the more fragile the ecological subsystem is fig 14 and table 5 in addition the farther the pollution source is from the subsystem the smaller the concentration of the subsystem and the ecological subsystem is not easily fragile table 4 based on the emission limits of mine dust db 50 418 2016 appropriately improving height of exhaust funnel reduces the vulnerability of the ecosystem and reduces the occurrence time of cascade spread fig 15 when the emission rate q 0 increases in order to avoid collapse of ecosystems the government should invest more in ecological construction and protection all in all the control of the emission rate from the source effectively avoids the irreversible or even collapse of the ecosystem 5 3 2 tolerance parameter and resilience parameter on condition of the given α the greater γ is the greater ecological threshold is the greater investment costs in pollution management are and the smaller the probability of collapse is we further assume that γ is big enough at the moment the subsystems are mostly in load status although cascading spread occurs the whole system is basically difficult to achieve the state of collapse yet it is very difficult for government to increase investment of pollution management regardless of the costs in real life namely it is impossible for the resilience parameter γ to increase to infinity similarly in the case of given γ α cannot be infinitely increased according to the model in section 2 3 4 we should ensure that the system has the minimum e under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time which can then ensure that the investment of the whole ecological environment should be reasonable only in this way can the entire ecological system be optimal fig 16 in the process of simulation the parameters selection of α and γ not only provide guidance for setting ecological thresholds in section 2 3 4 but also play an significant role in the cascade spread process of ecological environment petri net in general we should take the following measures to make the entire ecosystem achieve an optimum status based on the above discussion firstly we suggest the relevant government departments should step up their monitoring and supervising of mining company to control dust emissions from the source secondly we should try to increase the innovation and introduction of ecological restoration to promote the reverse transfer from the load state to the stable state thirdly the pollution discharge point of mining enterprises should avoid rivers as far as possible and choose a more stable ecological subsystem finally according to the value of tolerance parameter and the resilience parameter a scientific and rational investment plan in ecological construction and pollution management is the key to balancing economic expenditure with ecological benefits by the above measures we can ensure that the system has the minimum of scale of cascading spread under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time so that the vulnerability of the whole ecosystem is reduced and the optimal state of the ecosystem is achieved 5 4 advantages of ofgpnm applied to ecological discipline most of the existing researches on cascaded failure centers on complex network theory zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2017a b li et al 2017 which discuss the redistribution of the load after the failure node is removed in the actual ecological environment with the long distance migration of mine dust subsystem won t stop being contaminated because of its failure and the damage to the subsystem is accumulated over time this is one of the biggest differences between ecological environment and the other s networks this paper aims at analyzing the change of system s four dynamic indicators with the long distance migration of mine dust instead of analyzing the change of system s topology there is little research on the cascading spread of multiple different ecosystems under the migration of pollutants based on meteorological factors based on the ofgpn model to simulate ecosystem vulnerability with cascading spread caused by dust migration this research has the following advantages 1 the construction of ecological environment petri net has regional characteristic as a graphical and mathematical modeling tool the model of ofgpn integrates the advantages of petri net and gis based on the long distance migration of mine dust the ecological environment petri net is constructed in this petri net meteorological data and geographic information data of gis are defined into the model of ofgpn it makes ofgpnm not only have the abilities of traditional petri net for process control and graphic presentation but also have the advantages of gis in handling geospatial information 2 the simulation and analysis of state transition shows dynamic evolution ability in ofgpnm the transfer of token from one to another is actually the update of dynamic indicators in the iterative process it represents the accumulative process of increasingly deteriorating ecosystems under the disturbance of mine dust the color change after token transfer is in fact the state change of subsystem which represents the turning point of the degeneration from quantitative change to qualitative change in cascade spread once the token is triggered the entire model of ofgpn is dynamically updated 3 the ofgpn model provides an object oriented structure because object oriented technology is a more compact and structured model venkatesh and zhou 1998 it can define ecological subsystem as the same object place and indicators as the attributes of object place therefore according to different needs the four dynamic indicators vulnerability adaptability state of cascade spread state probability can be added modified and deleted easily which doesn t change structure of ofgpnm fig 3 in addition not only the reusability villani et al 2005 but also the applicability of the ofgpn can be also improved 6 conclusions the model of ofgpn was developed to explore the cascading spread problem of ecosystem vulnerability caused by mine dust in ecological environment system the results of this paper had a solid foundation to in depth study of ecosystem vulnerability with the cascade spread under the interference of mine dust the results also had a valuable reference in both protecting and maintaining the ecological system in a healthy and steady development the ofgpn model provided an integrated framework and the function driven approach up to now a lot of ecological vulnerability assessment methods had been created these methods could be used as functions of the ofgpn model to update the dynamic indicators of ecological subsystem and existing evaluation indicators could also be used as pollutant indicators of the static attributes therefore the framework of vulnerability cascade spread had been more widely used the future work includes 1 how to make the cascade spread path for single source extend to the cascade spread region for multiple sources and construct the ecological

25291,to describe the cascading spread problem of ecosystem vulnerability with continuous disturbance we propose a novel model based on object function geopetri net ofgpnm the model makes ecological environment petri net fully reflect in ecological environment system in a graphical manner on this basis we design four dynamic indicators i e vulnerability adaptability state of cascade spread state probability for each sub ecosystem and two global indicators i e scale of cascade spread and scale rate for entire ecosystem taking shenfu coal field in shaanxi province of china as case study we simulate the impact of accumulative vulnerability and dynamic evolution of three states over time the results showed that depending on different states of the subsystem the factors used to maintain the balance of system s original state are also different the results showed that cyclic structure of petri net based on the fluidity of a river made the ecosystem more vulnerable than acyclic structure the results also showed that the emission rate of mine dust q 0 the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ had great effect on achieving the optimal state of ecosystem q 0 played an important role in slowing occurrence time of cascade spread the rational investments by government in ecological construction and pollution management are the key to balancing economic expenditure with ecological benefits the obtained results were quite convincing to prove the novel contribution of this research to the field of vulnerability with cascading spread analysis which might continue to be the reference for restoration and reconstruction of the environment keywords ecological environment system vulnerability with cascading spread object function geopetri net dust migration optimal state 1 introduction the term vulnerability was originated from natural disaster research in the 1960s janssen et al 2006 as an important analytical tool in sustainability science wang et al 2017a b zhang et al 2017 the vulnerability research has been widely used in ecology collin and melloul 2003 semeraro et al 2016 vulnerability is generally thought to be the resistance or resilience of the ecosystem in response to external and internal disturbances the simulation and analysis of vulnerability are the key way to assess whether the environment is deteriorating hong et al 2016 therefore the study of ecosystem vulnerability not only provides a scientific foundation for the restoration and reconstruction of the fragile environment but also is an important prerequisite for regional sustainable development which makes it the basis of ecological environment management zhang et al 2017 from the perspective of the system ecology components of vulnerability are characterized by cause and effect relationships chang et al 2017 many researches has extensively studied the impact on the ecosystem under the background of natural disturbances such as typhoon huang et al 2011 drought brown et al 2016 and sea water intrusion danladi et al 2017 there are studies to explore the impact caused by human activities chi et al 2017 especially by the long distance migration of pollutants on the ecological environment as early as 1960s griffin et al 1968 found that asian dust could be transported to the north pacific and deposited on the seafloor on this basis gao et al 2009 studied the long range transport of asian dust and its effects on marine ecosystem bisquert et al 2017 connected mining waste with nearby ecosystem by the process of atmospheric deposition and thought that the metallic mining waste had adverse health effects on population living whether in the natural or human disturbance response it is undeniable that analysis and simulation of the ecological environment vulnerability are from the point of view of the results until now less attention has been paid to the phenomenon of cascading spread from one to other ecological subsystems caused by pollutant migration especially by mine dust in addition the evolution process of cascading vulnerability is generally neglected it is remarkable that ecosystem does not always demonstrate vulnerability under any disturbance wang et al 2017a b as we all know vulnerability is the inherent property originated from the internal of the system kochunov and li 1993 only when its damage caused by disturbance exceeds a certain threshold can the vulnerability be manifested chen and chen 2010 in fact ecological environment system ees is defined as a complex and stable cascade system different ecological subsystems in the ees are closely related and restricted to each other by material and energy flow they maintain the stability and balance of the biosphere when one subsystem is disturbed by external disturbance the subsystem can still maintain stability over a short period of time because of its self adjustment capacity however as the time goes by the vulnerability will exceed the allowable ecological threshold at this point the self adjustment of the subsystem decreases or disappears and the phenomenon of collapse in the subsystem occurs wang et al 2015 because of the relationship between different ecological subsystems in structure and function the pollutants from interference source will be migrated and settled over a long distance and spread all over the ees so the collapse of a subsystem may lead to cascading effect and others may collapse one after another with the deepening of external interference the ecological environment is increasingly fragile and eventually will be like domino effect which results in a complete collapse of the entire ees the previous researches on the problem of vulnerability with cascade spread focused on the power system xue et al 2017 warnier et al 2017 industrial symbiosis network zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2017a b li et al 2017 cluster supply network wang and xiao 2016 and other fields rarely on the ecological environment the methods used to solve this problem are also divided into three categories complex network theory disaster dynamics and geopetri net model the vulnerability of ecosystem environment is strongly regional and dynamically variable over time li et al 2008 srinivasan et al 2013 in summary the extant methods suffer from the following limitations when they are applied in the field of ecological environment firstly the model of complex network tends to describe the topology of the system and cascading relationships between nodes depend greatly on the degree of node vulnerability of cascade spread based on complex network model is to discuss the impact on the whole system when the failure node is removed zeng et al 2013 disaster dynamics model is often defined as the function of time and it has a massive advantage to simulate the evolution process of the vulnerability with cascade spread over time li and chen 2014 helbing and kühnert 2003 nevertheless these mentioned models could not comprehensively reveal the time and geographical features of ecological environment therefore the methods are unable to adequately show that the failure node is how to spread on the geographical and logical space moreover the traditional petri net is synchronization concurrency sequentiality peterson 1981 karmakar and dasgupta 2011 joyce et al 2011 which is regarded as a dynamic simulation tool the concepts of petri net for gis so called geopetri net is powerful process control and graphic performance ability ge et al 2010 it is well suited to represent the geographical and logical interactions in a system zhou and reniers 2016 but geopetri net is commonly used to simulate the failure probability of the place by transferring number of the tokens zhou and reniers 2016 sultana and chen 2009 there is at a loss to dynamically calculate the multiple variables associated with the place which makes geopetri net model becomes a major obstacle to the application of simulation and analysis of vulnerability cascade spread therefore the existing methods cannot comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the spatial cascade and temporal evolution and these methods cannot be used to simulate the phenomenon of vulnerability cascading spread under the disturbance in the ees in consideration of the above three shortcomings this paper introduces the concept of function into geopetri net a new modeling method is established namely ecosystem vulnerability of cascade spread model based on object function geopetri net ecosystem vulnerability with cascading spread based on object function geopetri net ofgpn the structure of the article is shown in fig 1 the main purpose of this paper is to use the model of ofgpn to simulate the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread caused by continuous disturbances in the ees aiming to solve the following 6 problems 1 how to make elements of the petri net fully reflect in the ees and construct cascade petri net of ecological environment 2 how to use the model of ofgpn to describe the problem of vulnerability with cascading spread caused by continuous interference 3 on the basis of the traditional object petri nets how to define its triggering rules in the ofgpnm and then redefine the vulnerability with cascading spread characteristics 4 how to determine the ecological threshold and analyze the relationship between vulnerability and threshold and then define state of the object places 5 how to achieve an optimum status in the process of cascade spread 6 how to apply ofgpnm to a case study determine the suitable setting of parameters in the model and analyze the influence of parameter setting on the vulnerability cascading propagation 2 methodology 2 1 construction of ecological environment petri net the cascade effect links ecological processes with human disturbance following a pattern similar to the industrial chain which provides insight into the complex relationship between human and environment notte et al 2017 according to the connectivity of the water area in the geographical position the wetland cascade ecosystem was built hatvani et al 2017 han et al 2017 established a dune meadow cascade ecosystem in horqin sandy land of china on this foundation according to the directions of pollutant migration and the geographical relationship between ecological subsystems this paper constructs the ecological environment petri net based on gis to study the cascading problem of ecological environment vulnerability in this paper we abstract the ees into a petri net of ecological environment and the specific methods of constructing petri net are as follows 1 the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net this path is the key to build a petri net of ecological environment the pollutants that are continuously discharged from the source can be migrated and settled at long distance under the influence of meteorological factors so this section attempts to trace the trajectory of pollutant migration and the trajectory is regarded as cascade spread path of ecological environment petri net in study of trajectory tracking hysplit model has better performance than others flexpart 6 2 of the norwegian institute for air research and calpuff 5 8 of the u s environmental protection agency makra et al 2011 hysplit 4 mainly uses airflow dynamics model to simulate the long range migration of pollutants forward trajectory and analyzes its diffusion direction and distance in view of the large uncertainty and the limited significance of single trajectory stohl 1998 clustering a large number of three dimensional trajectories is a more reliable method for reflecting the diffusion path of the pollutant based on the airflow characteristics thus forward trajectory clustering path of the hyslit model is abstracted as the vulnerability cascade spread path of the ecological environment petri net 2 the object place of ecological environment petri net the object place is one of the core members of the ecological environment petri net it is a subsystem that abstracts the complete structure and function from ees firstly pollution source is taken as the starting point and others are searched on the cascade spread path then all the subsystems including town yellow river 1 yellow river 2 mountain sandy land and park are abstracted as object places finally the state and behavior of different subsystems are regarded as the attribute and function respectively the sketch of the abstract relations between object place and ecological subsystem is shown in fig 2 thus the subsystem is abstracted as an object place with oriented object features 3 the transition of ecological environment petri net it is a bridge which connects one object place with others on the basis of 2 the relationships between subsystems are abstracted from ees including virtual association and true association virtual association is the logical relationship in the ecological environment petri net which reflects the cumulative influence on subsystem under the disturbances true association is geological relationship which shows the cascading effect the former is graphically represented virtual transition in ofgpn model while the latter is expressed true transition the steps of determining the transition are divided into four parts 1 add virtual transition a virtual transition is added to each object place from itself to itself 2 determine whether there is a geospatial relationship between the two object places on the same cascading spread path if so a true transition is established between them at the same time the pre and post arcs are added 3 check whether or not there is the connectivity between the object places based on 2 if it exists for example yellow river in shaanxi and shanxi and yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi on the first path in fig 9 the two are merged into the same place in other words if the two object places on the same cluster path are the same type and have the connectivity in the geographic location they can be treated as an object place in the process of constructing petri net the structural redundancy is largely avoided which is the advantage of object petri net 4 determine the association between multiple cascade spread paths the relation of multiple paths is described as the principles of and and or which is the same as the traditional petri net 4 ecological environment petri net for the cascading problem of vulnerability the ees is abstracted as ecological environment petri net ecological subsystems are abstracted as object place the relations between subsystems are abstracted as transitions the purpose of this paper is to use the related elements of the ecological environment petri net to simulate the dynamic evolution process of ees vulnerability cascade spread 2 2 description of ofgpn model the ofgpn model is a mathematical representation of ecological environment petri net the model is structured as a eight tuple ofgpn p t i o λ fire s e 1 p p 1 p 2 p n is a finite set of object places and n 0 p stands for subsystem and n stands for the number of subsystems pi a f has two components a is a finite set of attributes and can be split into subsets as and ad gathering respectively the static and dynamic attributes a s x 1 x 2 x k is used to describe the inherent characteristics of object place including geographic data and pollutant indicators and as is input to the model a d x k 1 x k 2 x l is used to describe multiple variable characteristics of object place including vulnerability adaptability the states of cascade spread steady status the status of load the status of collapse and status probability and ad is calculated by the function in ofgpn a s a d a a s a d ϕ f f k 1 f k 2 f l is a finite set of functions which t is the number of iterations or time a d f t a s f f a s a s a d a d f is used to update ad and the concrete formulas are defined in sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 2 t t 1 t 2 t m is a finite set of transitions and m 0 stands for the number of transitions t stands for the relationship between subsystems which can be split into subsets vt and tt gathering respectively the virtual and true transitions vt represents the self accumulation relation in logic and is expressed in dotted lines tt indicates the relationships of the probability and the full probability accumulation in the geospatial and is expressed by a solid lines 3 i δ 1 δ 2 δ m is a finite and propositional set of pre arcs which is from bags of object places to transitions i represented triggering conditions for cascade spread the possible propositions of i are δ i x i t h i t h i x i γ t h i x i γ t h i which xi refers to vulnerability without specification below thi is the load threshold γthi γ 1 is the collapse threshold 4 o ε 1 ε 2 ε m is a finite set of post arcs which is from transitions to bags of object places o stands for positive and negative effect the value has two kinds of and indicates that the change positively promotes the vulnerability of the object place while represents a negative effect 5 λ λ 1 λ 2 λ m is a finite set of cascade spread rate corresponding to transition which λ 1 t 0 t 0 is the average time of pollutant migration to the object place 6 fire p t is triggering state and stands for the occurrence degree of cascade spread p i p f i r e p i 0 1 f i r e p i 1 means that transition is triggered and cascade spread must occur f i r e p i 0 means that transition will not be triggered and cascade spread will not happen otherwise the transition is triggered by the probability of load state and the formula is described in detail in section 2 3 3 7 s t is the scale of cascade spread and e is the rate of cascade spread scale which are the global indicators of ees section 2 3 4 is defined in detail above all the biggest difference between object function petri net and traditional object petri net is that multiple indicators in object place can be dynamically calculates taking the positive response relationship between river subsystem and town subsystem as an example the graphically description and the trigger process of the ofgpn model are shown in fig 3 in two subsystems of river pj and town pi we define four functions f 5 f 8 for four dynamic indicators vulnerability x 5 adaptability x 6 state of cascade spread x 7 state probability x 8 when the transition is triggered the token is moved from pj to pi four dynamic indicators in pi are dynamically updated as the token moves which makes the entire petri net model dynamically calculated 2 3 model of vulnerability with cascade spread based ofgpn the cascading spread analysis of the vulnerability mainly includes four parts 1 to clarify the triggering rule of ofgpn two different kinds of scenarios are now introduced in section 2 3 1 2 to redefine the new vulnerability with the cascading characteristic based on the concept of typical vulnerability in section 2 3 2 3 how does the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread occur 4 what are the cascading impacts on the whole ees how to achieve the optimal state 2 3 1 scenarios of the ofgpn 2 3 1 1 scenarios of accumulation for the triggering rules of petri net huang 2010 defines four kinds of rules in fuzzy petri net for knowledge system expression ge et al 2010 defines several rules in geopetri net which has made some achievements in simulation of the geographic spatial relation the above studies mainly define the triggering rules as and or and other form of combination on the work of predecessors this paper defines triggering rules in ofgpn the rules are used to represent not only the sequence of cascade spread but also the degree of cascade sensitivity δ x i from the previous object place the three rules correspond to the three states of the cascade spread in the ecological environment petri nets fig 4 a and c are the exception of b rule1 self accumulation as depicted in fig 4 a if t h j x j then δ x i t δ t 0 in rule1 a virtual transition vt is added to object place itself practical significance of the self accumulation is when pollutants enter the subsystem pj they will not immediately have a cascading effect on pi but the impact on the pj will continue to accumulate due to self adjustment ability of ecological subsystem it can remain stable in the short term until the vulnerability of the object place exceeds the ecological load threshold therefore the transition will not be triggered the phenomenon of cascade spread will not occur and m pj 0 in this rule pj has no cascading effect on pi and the vulnerability of pj is self accumulation with time rule2 probability accumulation as depicted in fig 4 b if t h j x j γ t h j then δ x i t δ t x j t δ t m p j rule2 is to establish the fuzzy cascade spread relation on the geographical space for the object place pi and pj in most of the previous cascade models whether the cascade spread occurs or not is only quantified by two values of 0 and 1 when fire 0 token does not trigger cascading spread does not occur and the object place maintains stability when fire 1 it would be in the opposite case according to the actual situation of ees there is often an intermediate state from the state of stability to collapse for example the continuous discharge of pollutants in the mining area will cause the temporary deterioration of the ecological environment in the surrounding areas because of the massive and mature ess and the effective government regulation the temporary deterioration of the mining area does not lead to the collapse of the mine subsystem which means that the ees should be resilient thus the state of short term deterioration is set to a probability value m pj and is defined as load at the same time the transition is triggered in rule2 and the degree of cascade sensitivity δ x i also increases with the probability m pj until it increases to 1 rule3 full probability accumulation as depicted in fig 4 c if x j γ t h j then δ x i t δ t x j t δ t in rule3 the transition is triggered and the cascade spread occurs δ x i increases with the maximum probability i e m pj 1 2 3 1 2 scenarios of sequence the above scenarios of accumulation respectively have carried on the definition from the logic rule 1 and spatial rule 2 3 relationships now we try to take both relationships into account the petri net representation of the sequential scenarios is as shown in fig 5 since xi is gradually increasing and γ 1 it can be seen the priority relationships between the three triggering conditions the self accumulation is the highest priority in scenarios of accumulation followed by probability accumulation in other words the virtual transitions have higher trigger priorities than true transitions the trigger mode in fig 5 is the same as the mode of if pi then p 1 or p 2 in the traditional petri net huang 2010 ge et al 2010 in particular the difference between them is the trigger mode the former is triggered by proposition about the priority relationship for pre arc while the latter is triggered by probability based on prior knowledge as mentioned in section 2 1 the object places yellow river p 1 and p 3 are extracted from a cascade spread path and they have connectivity on the geographic space as shown in fig 6 a the object places of p 1 and p 3 can be merged as shown in fig 6 b we can see that the petri net in fig 6 b appears the cyclic structure in order to avoid the deadlock of token in the cyclic structure the priority of the pre arc should be explained in the petri net in case of multiple true transitions associated with the same object place the scenario of sequence depends on the sequence that the object places are extracted from cascade spread path for example p 1 is associated with p 2 and p 4 through two true transitions in fig 6 b referring to the sequence in fig 6 a the p 2 will be triggered before p 4 the pre arc in fig 6 b is labeled with the trigger sequence of token 2 3 2 vulnerability based on ofgpn in the ecological environment petri net the vulnerability is one of the dynamic attributes of object place although researchers have different views on the concept of vulnerability o brien et al 2004 li et al 2008 kochunov and li 1993 it is believed that vulnerability consists of three parts exposure sensitivity and adaptability yohe and tol 2002 adger 2006 in cascade system the impacts from its causative nodes are commonly regarded as the cascade spread effect chen et al 2010 li and chen 2014 in this paper the definition of the vulnerability with cascading characteristic not only consists of the above three parts but also considers the degree of cascade sensitivity from other object places therefore the vulnerability of object place pi is mainly related to the following factors the vulnerability of last moment the degree of cascade sensitivity of this moment self adaptability of this moment and internal distraction of this moment for time t δt the vulnerability xi t δt of object place is simulated by the following function 1 x i t δ t x i t λ δ x i t δ t e t δ t τ x i t δ t ξ i t δ t in formula 1 the four items of the right hand side are corresponding to the four factors mentioned above according to the scenarios of accumulation in section 2 3 1 formula 1 can be transformed into formula 2 in detail 2 x i t δ t x i t e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ t h j x j x i t λ i x j t δ t m p j e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ t h j x j γ t h j x i t λ i x j t δ t e t δ t τ x i t δ t f μ σ x j γ t h j the vulnerability x i t is shown as the first item when t 0 x i 0 is the initial vulnerability of object place the computing method of x i 0 is as shown in formula 3 x i 0 is the function of pollutant indicators which are related in external disturbance now we simulate the continuous discharge of pollutants and lead to the fragility of the ecosystem so the concentration of pollutants is a factor to characterize the external disturbance which is mentioned in formula 5 the main purpose of the second item is to mimic the degree of cascade sensitivity with scenarios of the ofgpn the item has been described in section 2 3 1 in this item λ i is cascade spread rate in the third item τ i 0 is self adaptive coefficient which is closely related to the structure and function of the ecological subsystem itself the richer and more mature the structure and function of the subsystem are the stronger ability of self adaptability is if so the value of the self adaptive coefficient τ i tends towards infinitude otherwise the value of the self adaptive coefficient τ i tends to 0 with the increasing t this item will decrease or even disappear the fourth item represents internal disturbance f μ σ is a formula which is a normal distribution with expectation μ and covariance σ 2 3 3 analysis of the state and probability with cascade spread in order to analyze the state and probability with cascade spread the state with cascade spread is defined as the following three types steady status status of load and status of collapse the steady state is in a relatively mature ecological subsystem as long as the vulnerability caused by the external disturbance does not exceed the load threshold the structure and function of the ecological subsystem will not change that is the subsystem has the ability to maintain or restore its relative stability the status of load is that vulnerability has exceeded the load threshold but has not exceeded the collapse threshold in this status the structure and function have not yet been completely lost the subsystem still has the ability to recover at this time the subsystem begins to appear the phenomenon of vulnerability cascade spread the status of collapse is that the vulnerability has exceeded the collapse threshold and its function and structure have been completely lost the degree of cascade sensitivity has the most obvious impact in this status from the above definition we can see whether the cascade propagation phenomenon occurs or not and how much impact has on other subsystems if it happens which have a close relationship with the two ecological thresholds therefore identifying these two thresholds is an important part in this section before that the initial vulnerability x i 0 is defined as follows 3 x i 0 k 1 n η k c k c 0 in formula 3 n is the number of pollutant indicators η k is the kth coefficient of pollutant indicator c k is the kth concentration of pollutant indicator including numerical simulation or measured value c 0 is the kth concentration limits for pollutant indicator in fact the determination of xi 0 can be changed according to the actual situation of environmental assessment the gaussian model will be used to simulate the concentration of any object place on the ecological environment petri net the gaussian model is one of the most recognized methods for calculating the concentration of pollutants at a point eiharbawi et al 2008 it assumes that the migration of pollutants is the gauss distribution and the standard deviation depends on the distance between the pollutants from the source of emission or the duration from the beginning of the release according to the improved gaussian model he et al 2010 a real time system for monitoring the concentration of toxic pollutants in the dynamic diffusion process is developed with gis correspondingly which is effective and simple for prediction and evaluation of pollutants diffusion namely 4 c x y 0 2 q 0 2 π 1 5 σ x σ y σ z e x x 0 2 2 σ x 2 e y y 0 2 2 σ y 2 e x 0 2 2 σ z 2 in this paper the model is used to calculate the concentration of 3d clustering trajectory on the hysplit4 owing to ignoring the height of toxic pollutants in the vertical direction of trajectory the above model can be improved which is shown in formula 5 5 c x y z t ρ i q 0 4 π x σ y σ z 1 2 exp μ 4 x y 2 σ y z 2 σ z in formulas 4 and 5 q 0 is the emission rate of pollutants μ is wind speed x y and z are the distances between the pollutants from the source of emission in x y and z directions σx σy and σz denote the coefficients of diffusion in x y and z directions respectively which is related to weather and average wind speed he et al 2010 ρ i is the contribution of clustering trajectory i tipping points in complex systems may imply risks of unwanted collapse but also opportunities for positive change scheffer et al 2012 on these points the occurrence of thresholds is imminent bowker et al 2014 in the real world it is difficult or even impossible to determine ecological thresholds that depend on vegetation geomorphology hydrology geography climate land and so on engle 2011 when the subsystem is disturbed by the external environment the initial vulnerability xi 0 reflects the function and structure of the subsystem itself so this paper assumes that the load threshold thi of each object place is proportional to the initial vulnerability x i 0 q max under the maximum allowable emission rate of pollutants 6 t h i α 1 x i 0 q max where α 0 is the tolerance parameter on the one hand it depicts the ability of the subsystem to resist or suffer with external disturbance the pollution of mine dust on the other hand the parameter reflects that governmental agencies could provide investment proportion in constructing and protecting ecological environment system the greater the cost of investment is the greater the parameter α is the greater the ability of the ecosystem to resist external pollution and the more stable the ecosystem is according to above definitions the probability distribution with cascade spread m pi of the object place is defined as follows 7 m p i 0 t h i x i steady status x i t t h i γ t h i t h i t h i x i γ t h i status of load 1 x i γ t h i status of collapse in formula 7 γ 1 is the resilience parameter which largely determines the time of ecosystem in collapse state in the actual world the parameter γ depicts government s contribution to improvement the structure and function after polluted ecosystem in detail the parameter reflects that governmental agencies could provide investment proportion in putting pollution under control the greater the parameter γ is the greater the load capacity of ecosystem is to avoid a massive collapse of the whole ecosystem the more cost of the pollution management will be invested based on the minimum of scale of cascading spread the existing research on ecosystem is how to ensure the reasonable investment therefore the selection of two parameters is not only the key to balance economic input and ecological benefits but also is a very important issue in cascade spread research 2 3 4 analysis of the scale with cascade spread to describe the cascade spread scope of the vulnerability in the ecological environment petri net we first introduce the concept of the scale with cascade spread it depicts the cascade spread of any object place at any time in the whole ecological environment petri net the scale with cascade spread is defined as formula 8 8 s t 1 n j 1 n m p j in formula 8 n is the number of object place m pj is the probability with cascade spread as shown in formula 7 the rate of cascade spread scale is defined as following 9 e t 1 t s t where t is the number of iterations or time for the whole system the smaller the e is the smaller the probability of cascade spread in the number of iterations occurs on the contrary the bigger the e is the greater the probability of cascade spread is according to formulas 7 and 8 e is closely related to α and γ the purpose of establishing the model is to ensure that the system has the minimum e under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time the model can further ensure that the investment of the whole ecological environment should be reasonable namely the parameters selection of α and γ is just right therefore the model of the scale with cascade spread is as follows 10 min e α γ min t 1 t s t min 1 n t 1 t j 1 n m p i t t t s t 1 3 a case study 3 1 study area and datasets the shenfu coal field 38 52 39 27 n 110 05 110 50 e is located in the northernmost part of shaanxi province east of the yellow river as the boundary west of shaanxi and mongolia border the south of coal seam outcrops the area of shenfu coal field is 5829 56 km2 tao et al 2010 location of study area and surrounding provinces is shown in fig 7 the original ecological environment of shenfu coal field is aeolian and loess landform the natural conditions are tough and the desertification of the soil and water is serious which make the primary geology and ecological environment fragile tao et al 2010 in addition the irrational exploitation of mineral resources has exacerbated the vulnerability of ecological subsystem in mining areas with the occurrence of long distance migration mine dust accumulates in cascade spread path of ecological environment petri net once the vulnerability of the object place exceeds the ecological threshold the self adaptability of ecological subsystem will decrease or disappear and the subsystem becomes more fragile which causes a partial collapse of a certain subsystem wang et al 2015 due to the logical and geospatial relationships between the various subsystems the vulnerability spreads across all subsystems and the collapse of one subsystem may lead to the collapse of the other subsystems that depend on them causing the entire ees completely crash for the test area base data were obtained from 1 meteorological data acquired from global data assimilation system gdas ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov pub archives gdas1 2 image data which obtained from hysplit4 0 google earth and arcgis10 2 3 historical weather data http www tianqihoubao com lishi and 4 other data obtained from published articles the software of microsoft visual basic 6 0 is used to calculate and simulate the results in the model of ofgpn 3 2 cascade petri net construction of ecological environment cascade petri net construction of ecological environment is divided into the following steps the first step is to use forward trajectory of hysplit4 model to obtain the long range migration path of mine dust with air mass in this study 36 h forward trajectories are calculated one time a day 00utc from january 1 to december 31 2016 using hysplit version 4 0 the starting location for the trajectories is the environmental monitoring station in shenmu latitude 38 83 n longitude 110 5 e at an elevation of 100 m above ground level an elevation of 100 m is selected because it is easy to observe the effect of ecological environment caused by dust but also avoid toxicological effect of the material and dust in air toxicological based on tvs total spatial variance draxler et al 2012a b that minimizes the intra cluster differences among trajectories while maximizes the inter cluster differences the 696 forward trajectories are clustered into 6 cluster mean forward trajectories as shown in fig 8 the second step is to make six cluster mean forward trajectories show in the arcgis overlaid with vector data such as towns rivers mountains sand parks etc in order to improve shortcoming of the hysplit model with rough maps lei et al 2010 and improve recognition of ecological subsystem the information of six trajectories is imported into arcgis10 2 as shown in fig 9 the last step is to extract the cascade petri net of ecological environment based on the trajectory in fig 9 description of object places and their details on six cluster mean forwards trajectories is shown in table 1 it is particularly emphasized that the first path red line across the yellow river in shaanxi and shanxi p 2 passes hequ country p 3 cross the yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi p 4 and reaches huairen country p 5 the flow direction of the yellow river on the first path is from p 4 to p 2 and is marked in fig 9 owing to the fluidity of the yellow river the pollution is not limited to the area where the pollution occurs but can quickly affect the downstream and even the ecological environment of the whole river therefore p 4 and p 2 are merged into the same place particularly the fourth trajectory should be abandoned because there is no subsystem to be extracted so far the cascade petri net has been finished as shown in fig 10 3 3 initialization of vulnerability in ofgpn the dust floats in the air and absorbs a lot of heavy metals due to the capability of long distance transmission and the significant effect on environment yuan and sun 2016 heavy metals are regard as the pollutant indicators different minerals contain different kinds of heavy metals and the proportion of heavy metals is not the same in this study pb hg cd cr and as were selected as pollution indicators in the object place the xi 0 is calculated by formula 3 the toxicity coefficients of heavy metals are regarded as the weight of pollutant indicator the concentration limits and the toxicity coefficients for heavy metals are as shown in table 2 the above heavy metals accounted for 30 percent of mine dust and the proportion of pb hg cd cr and as is 3 2 1 4 1 according to the above description the concentration of each object place in fig 10 is calculated according to formula 5 using formula 6 calculates the initial vulnerability x i 0 q max under the maximum allowable emission rate of mine dust as shown in table 3 results of concentration and initial vulnerability xi 0 under different emission rates for each object place can be seen in tables 5 and table a1 of appendix a 3 4 description of parameters in ecological simulation process appendix b lists the pseudo code of the ecological simulation process of the model of ofgpn and the input and output values of the sub models in simulation process the description and selection of parameters are shown in table 4 4 simulation results 4 1 state transition of ecosystem in the process of cascade spread dynamic evolution of three states reflects the turning point of the degeneration from quantitative change to qualitative change this process and updates for four dynamic indicators are represented by the model of ofgpn in section 4 1 green place indicates ecosystem is in stable state load state is represented by the orange place red place shows ecosystem is in collapse state a solid point represents token taking the fifth path acyclic structure and the first path cyclic structure as examples parameter settings are as follows q 0 21 kg h α 0 2 γ 5 and the simulation results are as shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively fig 11 a shows that tokens of mu us sandland p 21 yellow river p 22 and yinshan p 23 start from itself and goes back to its original position when t 1 in the meantime four dynamic indicators including vulnerability adaptability the states of cascade spread and status probability are updated once based on the rule of self accumulation in fig 4 a curves of dynamic indicators are under the diagram of the evolution of state transition as we can see each subsystem on the fifth path is in stable state in fig 11 a fig 11 b and c shows that orange tokens in mu us sandland and yellow river are transferred to the next subsystem one after another it represents the two subsystems are in load status when t 26 and t 33 respectively according to the rule of probability accumulation in fig 4 b four dynamic indicators are updated a comparison among fig 11 d and e shows that when t 53 61 all the subsystems are in load state while when t 62 yellow river first collapsed therefore the moment of t 61 is the critical time when the degradation of the ecosystem is complete and irreversible under specified parameters the optimal state of ecosystem in section 2 3 4 is in fig 11 d that is there is no collapsed subsystem in this moment as you can see from fig 11 f all subsystems on the fifth path are in the state of collapse and the function and structure of subsystems have been completely lost fig 12 a shows the original state on the first path according to the description of study case we combine the yellow river in shanxi and shaanxi p 2 with yellow river in inner mongolia and shanxi p4 as shown in fig 12 b fig 12 e shows that when t 24 27 all the subsystems on the first path are in load state while when t 28 in fig f the yellow river is in collapse state therefore fig 12 e is the optimal state of ecosystem from the curves of the adaptability and vulnerability in fig 11 we can see that the sub system with stable state has low vulnerability and the adaptability its self adaptability value is at a high level while the subsystem is in collapse state vulnerability is out of control and its adaptability is close to zero overall figs 11 and 12 show that based on both acyclic and cyclic structures state transition of ecosystem diffuses from the source of pollution along the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net 4 2 cascade spread of vulnerability the first part is simulated on basis of section 3 in ofgpn model other parameter settings are as follows q 0 21 kg h α 0 2 γ 5 and the simulation results are as shown in fig 13 the curves of vulnerability the left hand side of the axis and probability the right hand side of the axis for 22 object places are displayed in fig 13 and the curve of probability m pi reflects the state with cascade spread of object place in fig 13 a we can see that 1 when the object place is in stable status m pi 0 there is a linear relationship between the vulnerability and the number of iterations or time 2 the greater the concentration external disturbance of the object place is the more fragile the ecological subsystem is and its self adaptability gradually reduced as time goes on when 0 m pi 1 the phenomenon of cascade spread takes place and there is an exponential increase in vulnerability in especial when the object place is in collapse status m pi 1 the change rate of vulnerability is obviously greater than the load status from fig 13 a c and e acyclic structure we can see that when the phenomenon of cascade spread does not take place the order of vulnerability is x 15 x 20 x 16 x 17 x 18 x 19 when the phenomenon of cascade spread takes place the order of ultimate vulnerability is x 16 x 15 x 17 x 18 x 19 x 20 the reason for this is that the vulnerability of the object place pi is affected by the cascade spread of pi 1 associated with pi which makes the ecosystem more vulnerable from fig 13 b and d with cyclic structure we can see that object places of p 2 p 4 p 9 p 13 with cyclic structure are easy to be more fragile than the others that is on the same cascade spread path 4 3 scale of cascade spread and parameters selection since the cascade spread scope of the vulnerability s t is described and characterized by sensitive parameters of the emission rate of mine dust q 0 the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ the relations between these controllable parameters and s t in ofgpnm are discussed below firstly the influence of q 0 on s t is discussed in fig 12 as we all know the maximum allowable emission rates of mine dust correspond to the heights of exhaust funnel according to the local standards of chongqing db 50 418 2016 the emission limits of mine dust are specified the height of exhaust funnel of 15 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m corresponding to the maximum allowable emission rates of q 0 1 9 kg h 3 1 kg h 12 kg h 21 kg h 32 8 kg h other parameters are α 0 2 γ 5 taking yellow river p 6 as example the curves of the adaptability and state probability are shown in fig 14 under five different emission rates table 5 shows the results of concentration under different emission rates for each subsystem from the fig 14 and table 5 we can see that the greater the emission rate of mine dust is the greater the concentration of the subsystem is the earlier the time of cascading spread occurs and the more fragile the ecological subsystem is on the basis of section 2 3 the relations between the different emission rates of mine dust q 0 and scope of the vulnerability s t are shown in fig 15 from the fig 15 when α 0 2 and γ 5 the range of q 0 12 kg h can ensure that the whole ecological environment petri net does not appear phenomenon of large scale collapse in addition the tolerance parameter α and the resilience parameter γ are considered comprehensively in the next article under different emission rates to take the q 0 21 kg h as example we look for the tipping points of α and γ in the simulation α 0 3 and the iteration step is 0 1 γ 1 20 and the iteration step is 2 the simulation results are as displayed in fig 16 in fig 16 the rectangular symbol of a shows that the values of α and γ are too small and the whole ecosystem has been in collapse status at the 70th iteration the rectangular symbol of b displays that the values of α and γ are too big and the ecosystem does not collapse in the limited number of iterations then the color curves of meeting the constraints in section 2 3 4 are presented in fig 16 in formula 10 when α 0 1 and γ 0 9 α 0 2 and γ 0 7 α 0 5 and γ 5 α 1 and γ 3 in fig 16 the values of e are 56 7712 56 7021 53 0514 and 45 3296 respectively it can be seen that when the emission rate is q 0 21 kg h α 1 and γ 3 are the optimal values 5 discussion 5 1 factors to improve different states accumulative process of vulnerability and dynamic evolution of three states can change over time figs 11 and 12 depending on different states of the subsystem the factors used to maintain the balance of system s original state are also different the vulnerability of ecosystem function and structure is reversible under steady state and load state while the collapse state is irreversible for the subsystem in stable state self adjustment ability of ecological environment is the key to maintain the original state fig 11 a for the subsystem in load state it is necessary to eliminate the interference to reduce the vulnerability of the ecosystem so that the ecosystem can be rebalanced fig 11 b and c for the subsystem in collapse state there is an irreversible and complete change in the ecosystem and the vulnerability has not been changed we suggest that decision makers establish a corresponding early warning system and take different protective measures based on different states 5 2 cyclic and acyclic structure based on both acyclic and cyclic structures the diffusion directions of state transition are the same figs 11 and 12 that is both are from the source of pollution along the cascading spread path of ecological environment petri net but subsystem in petri net with cyclic structure is not only easy to be more fragile than the others but also could accelerate the cascading spread time of occurring fig 13 which is very consistent with the reality in the ees in actual river subsystem because of the fluidity of the yellow river the pollution is not limited to the area where the pollution occurs but can quickly affect the downstream and even the ecological environment of the whole river on the other hand river is the main drinking water and the pollutants can directly poison the human body and can also indirectly harm human health through the food chain and irrigated farmland wang et al 2015 therefore the ecological environment has cyclic structure to enhance the connectivity between subsystems which quickens the mobility among subsystems and the vulnerability increases 5 3 optimal state of ecosystem 5 3 1 emission rate of mine dust based on the improved gaussian model the emission rate of mine dust greatly largely determines the concentration of dust under specified meteorological factors the greater the concentration of the subsystem is the earlier the time of cascading spread occurs and the more fragile the ecological subsystem is fig 14 and table 5 in addition the farther the pollution source is from the subsystem the smaller the concentration of the subsystem and the ecological subsystem is not easily fragile table 4 based on the emission limits of mine dust db 50 418 2016 appropriately improving height of exhaust funnel reduces the vulnerability of the ecosystem and reduces the occurrence time of cascade spread fig 15 when the emission rate q 0 increases in order to avoid collapse of ecosystems the government should invest more in ecological construction and protection all in all the control of the emission rate from the source effectively avoids the irreversible or even collapse of the ecosystem 5 3 2 tolerance parameter and resilience parameter on condition of the given α the greater γ is the greater ecological threshold is the greater investment costs in pollution management are and the smaller the probability of collapse is we further assume that γ is big enough at the moment the subsystems are mostly in load status although cascading spread occurs the whole system is basically difficult to achieve the state of collapse yet it is very difficult for government to increase investment of pollution management regardless of the costs in real life namely it is impossible for the resilience parameter γ to increase to infinity similarly in the case of given γ α cannot be infinitely increased according to the model in section 2 3 4 we should ensure that the system has the minimum e under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time which can then ensure that the investment of the whole ecological environment should be reasonable only in this way can the entire ecological system be optimal fig 16 in the process of simulation the parameters selection of α and γ not only provide guidance for setting ecological thresholds in section 2 3 4 but also play an significant role in the cascade spread process of ecological environment petri net in general we should take the following measures to make the entire ecosystem achieve an optimum status based on the above discussion firstly we suggest the relevant government departments should step up their monitoring and supervising of mining company to control dust emissions from the source secondly we should try to increase the innovation and introduction of ecological restoration to promote the reverse transfer from the load state to the stable state thirdly the pollution discharge point of mining enterprises should avoid rivers as far as possible and choose a more stable ecological subsystem finally according to the value of tolerance parameter and the resilience parameter a scientific and rational investment plan in ecological construction and pollution management is the key to balancing economic expenditure with ecological benefits by the above measures we can ensure that the system has the minimum of scale of cascading spread under the conditions that the system does not collapse at any time so that the vulnerability of the whole ecosystem is reduced and the optimal state of the ecosystem is achieved 5 4 advantages of ofgpnm applied to ecological discipline most of the existing researches on cascaded failure centers on complex network theory zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2017a b li et al 2017 which discuss the redistribution of the load after the failure node is removed in the actual ecological environment with the long distance migration of mine dust subsystem won t stop being contaminated because of its failure and the damage to the subsystem is accumulated over time this is one of the biggest differences between ecological environment and the other s networks this paper aims at analyzing the change of system s four dynamic indicators with the long distance migration of mine dust instead of analyzing the change of system s topology there is little research on the cascading spread of multiple different ecosystems under the migration of pollutants based on meteorological factors based on the ofgpn model to simulate ecosystem vulnerability with cascading spread caused by dust migration this research has the following advantages 1 the construction of ecological environment petri net has regional characteristic as a graphical and mathematical modeling tool the model of ofgpn integrates the advantages of petri net and gis based on the long distance migration of mine dust the ecological environment petri net is constructed in this petri net meteorological data and geographic information data of gis are defined into the model of ofgpn it makes ofgpnm not only have the abilities of traditional petri net for process control and graphic presentation but also have the advantages of gis in handling geospatial information 2 the simulation and analysis of state transition shows dynamic evolution ability in ofgpnm the transfer of token from one to another is actually the update of dynamic indicators in the iterative process it represents the accumulative process of increasingly deteriorating ecosystems under the disturbance of mine dust the color change after token transfer is in fact the state change of subsystem which represents the turning point of the degeneration from quantitative change to qualitative change in cascade spread once the token is triggered the entire model of ofgpn is dynamically updated 3 the ofgpn model provides an object oriented structure because object oriented technology is a more compact and structured model venkatesh and zhou 1998 it can define ecological subsystem as the same object place and indicators as the attributes of object place therefore according to different needs the four dynamic indicators vulnerability adaptability state of cascade spread state probability can be added modified and deleted easily which doesn t change structure of ofgpnm fig 3 in addition not only the reusability villani et al 2005 but also the applicability of the ofgpn can be also improved 6 conclusions the model of ofgpn was developed to explore the cascading spread problem of ecosystem vulnerability caused by mine dust in ecological environment system the results of this paper had a solid foundation to in depth study of ecosystem vulnerability with the cascade spread under the interference of mine dust the results also had a valuable reference in both protecting and maintaining the ecological system in a healthy and steady development the ofgpn model provided an integrated framework and the function driven approach up to now a lot of ecological vulnerability assessment methods had been created these methods could be used as functions of the ofgpn model to update the dynamic indicators of ecological subsystem and existing evaluation indicators could also be used as pollutant indicators of the static attributes therefore the framework of vulnerability cascade spread had been more widely used the future work includes 1 how to make the cascade spread path for single source extend to the cascade spread region for multiple sources and construct the ecological environment petri net suffered the disturbance of multiple sources 2 how to determine cross impacts under the disturbance from multiple sources acknowledgments the article is supported by humanities

25292,disease resistant potato varieties can play a key role in sustainable control of potato late blight however when these varieties are more widely used resistance breakdown can occur as a result of pathogen adaptation here we focussed on potato cultivation in the netherlands where new single gene resistant varieties have been introduced over the last ten years this new generation of late blight resistant varieties has moderate yield levels and does not meet all market requirements as a result adoption rates for resistant varieties have been low so far we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to simulate potato production disease spread and pathogen evolution at the landscape level we analysed how late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the spatial deployment of a resistant variety with a lower potential yield than susceptible varieties the model was applied to an agricultural region in the netherlands 596 km2 and was run for a period of 36 years using daily weather data as input for crop growth and disease dynamics the short and long term effects of the deployment of a resistant variety were analysed with the model with respect to short term dynamics years were analysed independently to study between year variation the model demonstrated that in most years susceptible fields without fungicide application suffered severe yield losses and resistant fields performed better despite their lower potential yield resistance breakdown was observed in a small fraction of fields with the resistant variety but this did not affect mean potato yield or disease incidence in the short term since it occurred at the end of the growing season increasing the fraction of potato fields with the resistant variety strongly reduced late blight infection within a landscape with respect to the long term effects the model showed the emergence and spread of a virulent strain over time the virulent strain gradually took over the pathogen population decreasing mean potato yields from fields with the resistant variety this occurred in all landscape compositions where the resistant variety was deployed to different extents it was found that low as well as high proportions of fields with the resistant variety could increase durability of resistance with these findings the model provided more insight into the opportunities and risks related to the use of plant resistance in disease control an important and sustainable disease management strategy keywords phytophthora infestans agent based modelling host pathogen interactions cropping patterns pathogen evolution resistance management 1 introduction pests and diseases can cause large yield losses in potato production and therefore management strategies are required to secure production levels one of the main diseases in potato is late blight caused by phytophthora infestans the application of fungicides is currently the most widely used method to control the disease however this involves high costs and the chemicals are harmful to the environment haverkort et al 2008 one of the important strategies that could lead to more sustainable control is the use of disease resistant potato varieties genes that have resistance against late blight were first discovered in the beginning of the twentieth century fry 2008 when potato varieties contain these so called major resistance genes they cannot get infected by pathogens that do not have a matching virulence gene gene for gene interactions flor 1971 these genes have been used in classical breeding programs to develop resistant varieties however when they became more widely used resistance breakdown occurred due to pathogen adaptation resulting in the emergence of new virulent pathogen strains fry 2008 nowadays breeders aim to identify new resistance genes from wild relatives which can be used to develop resistant varieties with single or multiple resistance genes stacking through classical breeding or genetic engineering haverkort et al 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 since resistance genes are scarce and it takes large investments to develop new varieties it is important to protect new varieties from resistance breakdown here we focussed on the netherlands which has a high potato cultivation density and a suitable climate for late blight development in years with favourable weather for the disease moderate temperatures and high humidity early infection with late blight results in major yield losses in organic potato production where the use of chemicals for disease control is not allowed therefore organic farmers could potentially benefit from the use of resistant potato varieties a new generation of single gene resistant varieties appeared on the dutch market in 2007 however these new varieties have a moderate yield level and do not meet all the market requirements due to slightly different quality traits compared to those of regular susceptible varieties nuijten et al 2017 there is currently insufficient supply of resistant seed potatoes for the entire organic market but the sector aims to expand the production of late blight resistant varieties to completely service the organic market over the coming years bionext 2017 to analyse the effectiveness of crop resistance in late blight control we used a spatially explicit modelling approach it is important to analyse management strategies at the landscape level because late blight is characterised by long distance dispersal and the spatial arrangement of potato crops can affect the spread of the disease skelsey et al 2010 hossard et al 2015 lô pelzer et al 2010 furthermore since evolutionary processes can take multiple years resistance durability should be assessed over longer time periods to analyse these spatial and temporal dynamics modelling is a useful approach particularly compared to field experiments which require more resources and are more constrained in space and time the model we developed was used to simulate the effect of the spatial deployment of a resistant potato variety on late blight dynamics and potato yield several modelling approaches that analyse the effect of deployment strategies on durability of disease resistant crops can be found in the literature these studies draw different conclusions based on the model assumptions the outputs considered and on the host pathogen system analysed fabre et al 2012 pink and puddephat 1999 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for example model studies differ in their assumptions as to whether costs are associated with virulence meaning that virulent pathogens can have a reduced fitness compared to the wild type under standard conditions fabre et al 2012 existing studies have also simulated the emergence of virulence differently as the virulent strain can either be already present in the pathogen population in a very small proportion or it has to emerge as a result of mutation lof et al 2017 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for the case of potato late blight skelsey et al 2010 showed that deployment of a partially resistant variety was able to curb the spread of the disease partially resistant varieties slow down the epidemic in the field but cannot completely prevent infection the most effective strategies were those that reduced the density of potato in the landscape or increased the proportion of area with the resistant potato variety when pathogen adaptation is not taken into account building on the existing research our study focussed on the use of complete resistance as a result of resistance genes specifically we analysed how late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the deployment of a resistant variety our study is premised on several assumptions we assume that the virulent strain has to emerge by mutations during spore production and no costs are associated with virulence this is supported by experimental data that showed only few or no relations between fitness costs and virulence montarry et al 2010 schöber and turkensteen 1992 secondly it was also found that pathogenicity can rapidly evolve within clonal lineages of p infestans as a result of mutation goodwin et al 1995 although the sexual life cycle of p infestans also contributes to genetic diversity by the production of oospores it was not taken into account in this study for model simplicity the emerging patterns of the spread of the disease at the landscape level result from interactions between spatial processes of host pathogen dynamics and management strategies with each acting on different temporal scales to capture this complexity we used an agent based modelling approach agent based models have been recognised as highly suitable for representing heterogeneous collections of interacting entities in a spatial environment in which biophysical processes occur an 2012 we developed submodels for late blight dynamics and crop growth and management processes as input for the agent based model late blight management practices included in the model relate to current conventional and organic practices e g with or without fungicide application 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the model description follows the overview design concepts and details odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 the model was implemented in netlogo version 5 2 0 wilensky 1999 a version of the model is available on the openabm website http www openabm org 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate the spatial dynamics of potato late blight to analyse whether resistant varieties can be used effectively for sustainable disease control we analysed how disease severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the fraction of fields across a landscape with a disease resistant potato variety 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model comprises three hierarchical levels grid cells agricultural fields cluster of grid cells and the abiotic environment as input for the model data from the noordoostpolder a dutch agricultural landscape was used the noordoostpolder is a region of 596 km² with about 380 km² of arable land of which 24 is used for potato production see fig 1 the model is grid based 133 129 cells and the grid cells representing an area of 200 200 m2 4 ha are clustered into agricultural fields the grid cells are characterised by location field number and crop type further the grid cells with potato are also characterised by potato variety susceptible or resistant fungicide use and variables and parameters for crop growth and late blight infection see table 1 we consider only one type of susceptible and resistant variety with one resistance gene although the yield potential may increase with the introduction of other resistant varieties for our model we assume the resistant variety has a lower potential yield compared to the susceptible variety this is reflected in the crop growth parameters grid cells belonging to the same field have the same field number potato variety and fungicide use two types of late blight are distinguished in the model the wild type and the virulent strain the wild type can only infect the susceptible variety of potato while the virulent strain can also infect the resistant variety at the start of the simulation only the wild type is present the virulent strain can emerge during the growing season as the result of mutation when a grid cell is infected spores are produced that are dispersed to nearby cells where they can cause infections for more details on model processes see section 2 1 3 and section 2 1 7 since late blight development and crop growth is weather dependent we used measured weather data from may 1 to september 30 153 days for 36 years 1981 2016 as model input section 2 1 3 these years represent a range of weather conditions for crop growth and late blight dynamics 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the time step of the model is one day and processes related to crop and disease dynamics are updated daily we simulate the growing season from may 1 to september 30 153 days for 36 years at the start of each growing season state variables are reset and late blight infections are initialised in randomly selected potato grid cells for every time step meteorological data is loaded and used as input to simulate crop growth and disease dynamics processes impacting crop and disease dynamics are processed in the following order 1 fungicide application 2 calculate rates leaf area development tuber growth lesion expansion and spore production 3 spore dispersal 4 update states lai yield lesion stages latent infectious and no longer infectious phase and disease severity and 5 haulm destruction for more details on model processes see section 2 1 7 at the end of each year larger scale aggregate variables are calculated from individual cell data on potato yield and late blight infection see section 2 2 initial model values and parameters are shown in table 2 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles the representations of ecological processes were derived from a validated framework developed by skelsey 2008 with modifications to allow for analysis of resistance breakdown and durability at the landscape level 2 1 4 2 emergence late blight dynamics within the landscape emerge from the interaction between disease dispersal and distribution and management of potato fields including fungicide application and potato variety susceptible resistant important model output at the landscape level is the fraction of infected susceptible and resistant potato fields with the wild type and virulent strains of late blight potato yield is also an emergent property since it is the result of crop characteristics late blight dynamics and the weather 2 1 4 3 interaction interaction is only modelled implicitly by spatial interactions related to disease dispersal 2 1 4 4 stochasticity at the start of each simulation run management strategies fungicide application and potato variety are randomly divided over the potato fields furthermore at the beginning of each year the infection starts in a randomly chosen fraction of potato grid cells last spores are dispersed by wind and the wind direction is randomly selected see section 2 1 7 2 1 4 5 collectives potato grid cells are clustered in agricultural fields with each field having the same fungicide use and potato variety 2 1 4 6 observation data collected from the agent based model at the end of each growing season includes the fraction of infected potato cells disease incidence and infected resistant fields and potato yield the data is collected separately for the susceptible and the resistant fields with and without fungicide application and for infections with the wild type and virulent strain of late blight at the end of each year aggregate variables are calculated over the whole landscape and stored the modelling interface presents various graphs that show the dynamics of the model outputs over time 2 1 5 initialisation geographical data was used as input for the model including the allocation of potato fields management strategies were randomly divided over the potato fields potato variety and fungicide use the fraction of susceptible fields with fungicide application was set at 0 90 the fraction of resistant potato fields was varied between model runs see section 2 2 model scenarios were run using two different settings with and without carry over effects of the virulent strain between years in this way years were analysed independently but also in a time series to analyse resistance durability over longer time periods the initial values of crop growth and late blight infection are provided in table 2 2 1 6 input data geographical data from the noordoostpolder was used as input for the model fig 1 crop rotation is not taken into account in the model because we don t expect crop rotation to have a strong effect on the model results in this region farm fields are usually clustered around the homestead and the proportion of potato in the rotation is high varying from 1 3 in conventional to 1 6 in organic farming systems as a result crop rotation only slightly changes the distances between potato fields while rotation could affect the number of initial infections this was kept constant between years since it was not relevant to compare different rotations in this case measured meteorological data from the weather station marknesse in the noordoostpolder was used as input for the model knmi 2016 since data from marknesse was incomplete before 1994 weather data from the eelde station 70 km from the study area from 1981 to 1993 was used to obtain a longer time series mean daily temperature and total daily radiation were calculated and used as input in the submodel simulating crop growth we used pearson s correlation to compare the data at the two sites for the years that data from both weather stations was available 1994 2016 data indicating days suitable for blight development see definition of blight day below showed a correlation of r 0 77 suggesting that the weather experienced at both stations is similar hourly weather data from may 1 to september 30 the potato growing season were analysed for the years 1981 until 2016 to determine if a day was suitable for p infestans sporangia to cause an infection i e a blight day we used rules that were based on the hourly temperature and relative humidity during a 24 h period as published by skelsey et al 2009a the first rule states that an infection hour is defined as an hour where the temperature is between 5 and 27 c and the relative humidity is greater than 90 the second rule is related to the number of consecutive infection hours required to allow germination to reach completion in a 24 h period therefore the mean temperature during consecutive infection hours tinf c is used for 5 tinf 10 16 consecutive infection hours are required for 10 tinf 15 10 consecutive infection hours are required for 15 tinf 20 16 consecutive infection hours are required for 20 tinf 27 22 consecutive infection hours are required and for tinf 5 and tinf 27 spore germination does not occur skelsey et al 2009a the 24 h period runs from 16 00 h to 16 00 h to ensure that the cut off between time steps lies within the relative dry period of the day due to lower temperatures during the night the relative humidity is usually higher we made some modifications to these rules in our model infection could also occur with lower temperatures of tinf between 5 and 10 c and consecutive infection hours were slightly reduced because of increased aggressiveness as a result of pathogen adaptation cooke et al 2011 if the conditions of the rules are met new infections can occur as a result of spore germination if the conditions are not met the newly produced spores cannot cause infections and eventually die since we assume spores live only 24 h based on this analysis a list with favourable days for late blight development was given as input to the model 2 1 7 submodels below we present an overview of the model processes an overview of variables and parameters used in this study can be found in tables 1 and 2 2 1 7 1 crop growth to simulate leaf area development we use equations for foliar development according to richards 1959 to calculate leaf area expansion we use the leaf area index lai crop growth starts on the 1st of may t 1 and the initial leaf area index laii is set at 0 05 for both varieties leaf area expansion is simulated using thermal time accumulation growing degree days the change in lai is calculated using two equations one before the onset of senescence which is determined by a fixed number of degree days tl ᵒc day and one after the onset of senescence in both equations lai is proportional to the mean daily temperature tc with a base temperature of 2 ᵒc tc t tb the maximum leaf area laim and a net growth rate rg before the onset of senescence eq 1 or a net death rate rd after the onset of

dry matter content dmc and light extinction coefficient k eq 3 3 d y d t q l u e 1 e k l a i 100 d m c 1 d s 2 100 10 with respect to crop growth processes we assume that the resistant and susceptible potato varieties only differ in terms of their light use efficiency resulting in a lower potential yield for the resistant variety compared to the susceptible variety tuber growth is reduced by the fraction of infected plant tissue multiplied by two since an increase in latent area is assumed to cause an equal loss of non lesion covered leaf area van oijen 1992 2 1 7 2 late blight dynamics 2 1 7 2 1 initial infections at the beginning of each season the infection starts in a fraction of potato grid cells fi which are randomly selected across the landscape random initiation is justified with field data that shows that a large number of initial infections are caused by infected seed tubers which are randomly distributed over farms evenhuis et al 2007 secondly no evidence has been found for late blight hotspots i e reoccurring initial infections in the same area over multiple years raatjes and kessel 2003 the fraction of initially infected potato fields is set at 0 02 infections ha 1 which is based on 1 infection source per 200 ha in a landscape where approximately 25 of the area consists of potato fields susceptible varieties zwankhuizen et al 1998 at the start of the simulation initial infections belong to the wild type strain which can only develop in fields with the susceptible variety the infection is initialised with an area of 0 01 m2 of infected leaf tissue per grid cell lsi to analyse the population dynamics of the wild type and virulent strains over time between year survival of these two strains is included the fraction of initially infected potato fields is kept constant but the ratio between initial infections of the wild type and virulent strains could change over time the ratio between the total disease severity of the wild type and virulent strains at the end of the previous growing season is used to calculate the number of initial infections of the wild type and virulent strains in the following year this process can be turned on and off in the model if it is turned off all initial infections belong to the wild type at the start of each year 2 1 7 2 2 lesion expansion for simulating the spread of the disease we use an aged structured population model including a latent infectious and no longer infectious phase of lesions skelsey et al 2010 when spores germinate the new lesions first enter a latent phase of five days after which they become infectious and produce spores after the infectious phase one day lesions are added to the pool of no longer infectious tissue existing but no longer infectious lesions expand over time and produce new infectious tissue according to a lesion growth rate rl new infections resulting from spore germination can only occur on blight days see section 2 1 6 but the expansion of existing lesions occurs at every time step the area of infected leaf tissue per stage of the disease is simulated for the two strains over time table 1 these variables are used to calculate the disease severity ds described as the percentage of infected leaf tissue per grid cell the disease severity is calculated separately for the wild type and virulent strains a grid cell can get infected with the wild type and the virulent strains at the same time and the infection processes of both strains are modelled identically and simultaneously 2 1 7 2 3 spore production based on the area of infectious plant tissue inf and the sporulation intensity si spores m 2 of infected leaf area a number of spores are produced per grid cell sp eq 4 spore production is calculated separately for the wild type and virulent strains 4 s p t i n f t 1 s i as explained above virulent spores can emerge as a result of mutation during spore production of the wild type strain in fields with the susceptible variety of potatoes eq 5 5 s p t v s p t w f m the plasticity of pathogenicity in the genome of p infestans results in rapid adaptation goodwin et al 1995 however the exact mutation rate is unknown in other species the mutation rate the natural mutation frequency per nucleotide was estimated between 10 9 and 10 7 kondrashov and kondrashov 2010 therefore the mutation frequency fm in the model was set at 10 7 in light of the rapid adaptation of p infestans this corresponds to a single nucleotide mutation which can overcome a single gene resistant variety after spore dispersal and survival the remaining viable spores can germinate and cause infection in susceptible or resistant fields 2 1 7 2 4 spore dispersal a small fraction of the produced spores the escape fraction fe is dispersed to other grid cells where they can cause new infections the remaining spores contribute to the disease severity in the same grid cell the escape fraction is used to calculate the number of produced spores that escapes the canopy and are available for long distance dispersal skelsey et al 2009b this variable is negatively correlated to the leaf area index and is affected by the wind speed eq 6 6 f e e l a i v d k v u where vd deposition velocity and kv von kármán constant the mean wind speed u is set at 3 m s 1 which was the mean wind speed on blight days according to the weather data depending on the wind direction selected randomly each day spores are dispersed from one of the four sides of the infected grid cell up to a distance of 1000 m in a sensitivity analysis we explored the effect of wind direction on the model results data on wind direction was analysed northeast 21 southeast 14 southwest 39 and northwest 26 on blight days and implemented in the model using probabilities but this did not affect the model results dispersal coefficients represent the fraction of spores arriving in grid cells according to their distance from the source dispersal coefficients are calculated using the gaussian plume model skelsey et al 2008 spijkerboer et al 2002 and are determined for distances between 100 and 900 m with 200 m intervals length of one grid cell it was assumed that spores have to disperse from the centre of the infected grid cell to the edge of a neighbouring cell to cause infection since late blight spores are dispersed by wind they can travel over larger distances than those included in our study zwankhuizen et al 1998 however a model study by hossard et al 2015 showed that a characterisation of the landscape within 500 m around a resistant field was sufficient to analyse resistance durability for a wind dispersing pathogen therefore we believe that a dispersal distance of 1000 m is sufficient for the purpose of our study after spore dispersal the number of spores in each potato grid cell is calculated this is the sum of spores that arrived via dispersal and spores that were produced in the cell only a fraction of the spores survives and is able to germinate the number of germinating spores is affected by the infection efficiency ie the deposition efficiency de and the spore survival fraction fs when one or more spores germinate these spores enter the latent phase l 1 and the corresponding area of infected leaf tissue is calculated using the average lesion size lsa the processes related to spore dispersal only occur on blight days since favourable weather is required for the germination of newly produced spores 2 1 7 2 5 fungicide application protective fungicides are used on a fraction of fields with the susceptible variety for disease control which reduces the infection efficiency ie of the spores skelsey et al 2009b fungicides are applied at weekly intervals starting on the day of crop emergence the infection efficiency is described as the fraction of spores present that are able to infect the host when fungicides are applied the infection efficiency is reduced to 1 of the original value meaning that 99 of the spores are eliminated during the days following application the fungicides gradually degrade and the infection efficiency increases again the infection efficiency is calculated with eq 7 7 i e i e m i n i e m a x i e m i n 1 t 50 t t a β where iemin minimum infection efficiency directly after fungicide application iemax maximum infection efficiency without fungicide application t50 the time at which 50 of the fungicides are ineffective set at 9 days t time day of the year ta day of last application β shape factor which is negatively correlated with the time needed to reach iemax when the disease severity in a grid cell exceeds 1 it is assumed that curative fungicides are applied which have a similar effect on infection efficiency as protective fungicides and in addition reduce the expansion of existing lesions by a factor of 0 1 cf 2 1 7 2 6 haulm destruction when the total disease severity in potato grid cells reaches 5 the potato haulm is destroyed according to dutch governmental regulations nvwa 2008 in these grid cells leaf and tuber growth stops directly and the disease can no longer disperse to other fields since disease severity per grid cell is limited to 5 competition for space was not included in the model 2 2 model simulation scenarios the model was used to analyse several scenarios we used a baseline scenario with a fraction of 0 9 susceptible fields 0 1 resistant fields and 0 9 of the susceptible fields receiving fungicide applications this roughly represents the current situation in the case study region which has a small number of organic farmers who do not apply fungicides and a small number of farmers growing a resistant potato variety the baseline scenario was used for detailed analysis of host pathogen interactions within and between years with a particular focus on the influence of weather conditions secondly we explored the effect of the deployment of the resistant variety on disease control by adjusting the fraction of resistant fields composing the landscape referred to as landscape composition the fraction of resistant fields was varied between 0 00 0 95 with intervals of 0 10 using a value of 0 95 instead of 1 00 for all landscape compositions model runs were executed twice years were analysed independently without carry over effects between years but also in a time series to analyse resistance durability over longer time periods in this way short and long term effects of the deployment of potato varieties were compared for each scenario simulation runs were repeated 10 times we analysed potato yield and variables related to late blight infection the following output variables were calculated from individual grid cell data 1 potato yield 2 disease incidence the percentage of infected potato grid cells with a disease severity 1 skelsey et al 2010 3 infected resistant fields the percentage of resistant potato grid cells in the landscape infected with the virulent strain 4 establishment risk the mean risk of establishment of the virulent strain due to between year survival therefore we analysed the percentage of years that the virulent strain emerged and survived the winter resulting in initial infections in the following year and 5 take over time the number of years it takes after establishment until 90 of the total disease severity is caused by the virulent strain 2 3 sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters which have a strong effect on the model output a local sensitivity analysis was carried out hamby 1994 ten broeke et al 2016 most of the parameter values were derived from literature and those with large uncertainties were included in a sensitivity analysis using the baseline scenario table 3 these parameters included initial parameter values and some of the parameters related to crop growth and late blight dynamics parameter values were varied individually by 20 above or below their reference values table 3 and simulation runs were repeated 10 times 3 results 3 1 short term dynamics weather variability late blight severity and impact the percentage of blight days between may and september for the period between 1981 and 2016 is presented in fig 2 blight days as well as the relative humidity seemed to decrease over time a multiple regression analysis with daily mean relative humidity and temperature as independent variables showed that these variables could explain 75 6 p 0 001 and 2 8 p 0 05 of the variation in blight days respectively the 36 years of data simulated with the baseline scenario showed that disease incidence and potato yield varied between years and were affected by the number of blight days fig 3 each year was analysed independently showing the host pathogen dynamics within a season the mean disease incidence per year ranged between 15 and 55 and increased with more blight days there was only small variation between model runs showing that the disease incidence is mainly affected by the number of blight days due to the fixed number of initial infection sources a minimum late blight incidence was observed although most fields are protected by fungicides the large fraction of susceptible potato fields in the landscape resulted in high levels of disease incidence in some of the years in the baseline scenario resistance breakdown occurred and the percentage of infected resistant fields grid cells was variable overall we observed an increase in the number of infected resistant fields in the years with a larger number of blight days fig 3b the mean percentage of infected resistant fields in a year reached a maximum of 8 4 7 2 sd indicating that only parts of the resistant fields were infected with the virulent strain the model showed that resistance breakdown occurred late in the season the mean day of the year that the first case of resistance breakdown was reported was day 95 22 sd august 3 and the earliest reporting of resistance breakdown was on day 50 june 19 in many years resistance breakdown did not occur or was very low even in years with a high percentage of blight days on the other hand resistance breakdown was observed in years with a low percentage of blight days moreover large variation in resistance breakdown was observed between model runs the variability between years and model runs showed the random nature of this event resistance breakdown can occur in years with high and low late blight incidence and it is affected by random processes such as the allocation of potato varieties across the landscape and initial infection sources potato yields are shown in fig 3c in general susceptible fields with fungicide application had higher potato yields than resistant fields and susceptible fields without fungicides potato yields in fungicide treated susceptible fields were relatively stable between years indicating that fungicides effectively suppress the disease within a field in years with low infection pressure the susceptible fields both with and without fungicides performed better than the resistant fields this was as expected given the assumption in the model that the resistant variety has a potentially lower yield than the susceptible variety with the increasing number of blight days resistant fields reached higher yield levels compared to the susceptible fields without fungicides showing a strong effect of late blight infection on yield loss in untreated susceptible fields a small decrease in mean potato yield was observed in both resistant fields and susceptible fields treated with fungicides with an increasing percentage of blight days this was largely the result of a negative correlation between blight days and temperature and radiation influencing crop growth pearson correlation blight days and temperature b 0 387 and p 0 020 blight days and radiation b 0 791 and p 0 001 we also observed small yield losses due to late blight infection in these fields when we only consider the short term dynamics the effect of resistance breakdown on yield was low because of the low level of infected resistant fields and its late moment of occurrence in the season the model showed that an increasing proportion of resistant fields resulted in a strong decrease in disease incidence across the landscape fig 4 years were analysed independently and mean values were calculated over 36 years given that infections mainly occur in susceptible fields the variation in disease incidence between years decreased with larger fractions of resistant fields fig 4a this result also shows that random processes including the spatial allocation of initial infection sources and potato varieties have a strong effect on disease dispersal in susceptible fields and differ between years and model runs the disease incidence in susceptible fields without fungicides strongly decreased when the fraction of resistant fields in the landscape was larger than 0 50 fig 4b a larger fraction of resistant fields in the landscape reduced the number of sites where initial infections could develop at the start of the growing season mean values of 183 and 9 initial infection sources with a fraction of 0 00 and 0 95 resistant fields respectively secondly during the season the potato fields with the resistant variety acted as a barrier for disease dispersal preventing infection in susceptible potato fields the decrease in disease incidence also resulted in reduced yield losses in susceptible fields without fungicide application fig 4c while no effect was observed on potato yields of resistant fields or susceptible fields with fungicide application 3 2 long term dynamics pathogen evolution and durability of resistance fig 5 shows an example of the model results for long term dynamics simulated with the baseline scenario the simulation results of disease dynamics over longer periods show that in the baseline scenario after some years 2 8 resistance breakdown occurred and the virulent strain gradually took over the late blight population fig 5a the virulent strain has an advantage since it can infect both the resistant and susceptible fields while the wild type can only infect the susceptible fields establishment of the virulent strain over time also resulted in increased levels of infected resistant fields and in turn yield losses fig 5b the yield of the resistant fields eventually dropped below that of the susceptible fields without fungicides when all resistant fields got infected with the virulent strain establishment of the virulent strain occurred in all landscape compositions where the resistant variety was grown but deployment strategies of potato varieties does influence resistance durability increasing the fraction of resistant fields from 0 1 to 0 5 increased the risk of establishment of the virulent strain fig 6 a with more resistant potato fields in the landscape there is an increased risk that virulent spores emerging from susceptible fields can spread to fields of the resistant variety resulting in more rapid spread of the virulent strain when the fraction of resistant fields increased beyond 0 5 the risk of establishment decreased again probably as a result of the reduced infection pressure once the virulent strain survives the winter it gradually takes over the pathogen population the take over time is relatively short and decreases rapidly with increasing fractions of resistant fields fig 6b the virulent strain has two major advantages compared to the wild type firstly it can infect both the resistant and susceptible varieties and secondly it can spread quickly through the resistant fields since we assume that these fields are not protected by fungicides when considering establishment risk and take over time together we found that with a small fraction of resistant fields there was a small risk of establishment of the virulent strain and it took more time to take over the pathogen population on the other hand with a large fraction of resistant fields the establishment risk of the virulent strain is even smaller but once establishment occurs it takes a short time to take over the population therefore low as well as high cropping ratios of resistant fields can increase resistance durability 3 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis show the effects of varying individual parameters on the model output in the baseline scenario table 3 the effect on model output is presented as the percentage of change related to the reference value varying the parameters had small effects on simulated potato yields with the exception of those directly related to crop growth such as light use efficiency the parameters related to late blight only influenced mean yield of susceptible fields without fungicides to a maximum value of 5 simulated disease incidence was affected by potato late blight parameters where changing the lesion growth rate of late blight rl showed the strongest effect varying the leaf area growth and death rates also had a strong effect on the disease incidence since leaf area development influences disease severity at the field level percentage of infected leaf tissue the percentage of infected resistant fields after resistance breakdown and establishment risk were affected by up to 45 when varying parameters related to spore dispersal and survival in contrast no strong effects were observed on the take over time it was found that increased aggressiveness of the pathogen related to sporulation intensity infection efficiency spore survival and mutation reduced the take over time of the virulent strain however the effects were rather small max 15 and inconsistent probably due to the variation in this output variable 4 discussion the model showed the short and long term effects of the deployment of a late blight resistant potato variety with respect to short term effects increasing the fraction of resistant fields strongly decreased the disease incidence in a landscape this was the result of the decreasing number of initial infection sources that can only develop in susceptible fields after a certain threshold was reached resistant fields acted as barriers preventing spread to neighbouring fields resistance breakdown was observed late in the season in a small fraction of resistant fields per year and therefore did not have a strong effect on the mean potato yield of resistant fields or disease incidence in the short term in the model we assumed that the resistant potato variety had a lower potential yield compared to the susceptible variety with respect to potato yields in many years resistant fields performed better than susceptible fields not protected by fungicides due to yield losses by late blight infection this demonstrated that resistant varieties can be very effective in the control of potato late blight and growing these varieties would help organic farmers to achieve acceptable yield levels conventional farmers could also benefit from the use of resistant varieties when economic and environmental costs related to fungicide application are considered furthermore it is expected that the yield potential will increase with the introduction of new resistant varieties which will make them more attractive to farmers organic farmers growing susceptible varieties could also benefit from resistant varieties since this reduces the infection pressure in the landscape leading to higher yield on fields that are not treated with fungicides however susceptible fields can also act as sources of infection leading to the emergence of virulent strains and resistance breakdown over the longer term these results show the potential benefits of growing a resistant variety but also the risk of resistance breakdown when analysing the long term effects of deploying a resistant variety across a landscape the model showed resistance breakdown by the emergence and spread of a virulent strain mean potato yields of resistant fields decreased over time when no countermeasures were taken this occurred in all landscape compositions but durability of resistance could be increased by maintaining either low 0 2 or high 0 8 fractions of resistant fields in the netherlands new single gene resistant varieties were introduced to the market in 2007 nuijten et al 2017 these were mainly developed for the organic sector which is currently responsible for 1 of the total dutch potato production cbs 2016 the proportion of organic production is slightly higher in this case study area with approximately 9 of the arable land in the province being used for organic farming after a severe late blight epidemic in 2016 stakeholders in the organic potato supply chain including breeding companies farmers organisations and retail agreed to upscale the development of late blight resistant varieties bionext 2017 which could also lead to an increase in organic potato production according to the model results the risk of establishment of a virulent strain increases when larger proportions of fields are cultivated with a resistant variety with the same resistance gene an implication of these results is that in the scaling up phase of using a resistant variety breeding companies and farmers must be aware of the risk of resistance breakdown the model showed that resistance breakdown can occur in years with low as well high disease incidence meaning that the risk is ever present additional management strategies are needed to prevent resistance breakdown and spread of the new virulent strain several resistance management strategies have been proposed in the literature to increase resistance durability such as spatial and temporal allocation of resistant varieties with different sources of resistance genes combining resistance genes in one variety gene stacking and combining resistant varieties with reduced application of fungicides mundt 2014 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 furthermore the results from our study suggest that the use of early potato varieties that can be harvested early in the season could decrease the risk of resistance breakdown since this was mainly observed at the end of the growing season secondly destroying the haulm immediately after an infection in the resistant variety could prevent spread and establishment of the virulent strain model studies can be used to analyse the effectiveness of these additional resistance management strategies at the landscape level lof et al 2017 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for the implementation of such resistance management strategies concerted effort among stakeholders is required in a previous analysis on potato late blight it was concluded that control of potato late blight is influenced by both social and ecological factors as well as their interactions pacilly et al 2016 farmers play a key role since they make decisions on crop management but they are strongly influenced by other stakeholders such as traders breeders and policy makers each pushing their own objectives and interests our model framework also allows the implementation of decision making processes to analyse social ecological interactions and this will be carried out as a next step in this research unfortunately no data was available on late blight dynamics at the landscape level over time to validate the model results the model can be described as a so called mid range model the aim is neither to exactly model the situation in a certain region nor to make a purely theoretical point gilbert 2008 therefore it was used to identify trends rather than making predictions for the future although no time or space specific data for this or other case studies are available to validate the model the trends observed in the model output can be supported by previous findings on late blight dynamics and other modelling studies since yield limiting factors other than late blight infection were not included in the model simulated yields are higher than the actual potato yields of farmers cbs 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 on average potato yields in organic potato production are 30 50 lower than yields in conventional production tamm et al 2004 the model showed similar trends when comparing simulated yields of susceptible fields with and without fungicide application secondly previous model estimations by skelsey et al 2010 showed that increasing the fraction of fields with a resistant variety strongly reduced disease incidence following similar trends found in our study with respect to resistance durability the model showed the emergence of the virulent strain that resulted in resistance breakdown after some years this process whereby the virulent strain is able to establish in the population and make resistance less effective each year has also been observed several times after the introduction of single gene resistant varieties fry 2008 the model showed that high 0 8 as well as low 0 2 fractions of resistant fields could increase the resistance durability of a resistant variety in practice the conventional approach is to introduce low fractions of resistant varieties to the potato cultivation area since this can reduce the selection pressure on the pathogen population pink and puddephat 1999 however these studies assume that the virulent strain is already present in the pathogen population and after the introduction of the resistant variety this population can rapidly increase van den bosch and gilligan 2003 showed that resistance breakdown can be delayed by low and high cropping proportions of the resistant variety they used similar assumptions as in our study no fitness costs are involved related to resistance and the virulent strain must emerge by mutations in the asexual life cycle they used several measures for resistance durability and showed that the time after which the virulent strain appears in the population comparable to the establishment risk in our study can be extended by small as well as large fractions of resistant fields in the landscape secondly as in our study they reported that the time until the virulent genotype takes over the population would decrease with larger fractions of the resistant variety van den bosch and gilligan 2003 in agreement with previous literature our results also show that it is important to look at different measures to analyse resistance durability theories that describe interactions between spatial diversity and dispersal can be used to explain the observed patterns related to disease severity resistance breakdown and the fraction of resistant hosts the janzen connell hypothesis shows that interactions between hosts and pathogens shape the composition and density of species in the landscape gilbert 2002 in addition the dispersal scaling hypothesis states that dispersal is affected by habitat size and dispersal distance where an increase in habitat size is described as a positive dispersal force and an increase in dispersal distance as a negative dispersal force skelsey et al 2013 these two competing forces result in a pattern where dispersal is maximised at intermediate scales our modelling results show that increasing the fraction of resistant fields until a certain point leads to a higher risk of infection with the virulent strain with higher fractions of resistant fields virulent spores have an increased chance of arriving in these fields however when the fraction of resistant fields increases the fraction of susceptible fields goes down since these fields host the wild type strain this reduces disease severity fig 4a given that the virulent spores are the result of mutations in the wild type population the risk of emergence of virulent spores decreases with a lower fraction of susceptible fields these trade offs result in the pattern observed in fig 6b which shows the highest risk of establishment of the virulent strain occurs with about equal proportions of susceptible and resistant fields in the landscape once the virulent strain has established it will take over the pathogen population and this process goes faster with larger fractions of resistant fields fig 6b to analyse the effect of weather variability on late blight dynamics the number of blight days was calculated and used as input for the model this parameter represents the potentially suitable conditions for late blight development during the season overall a decreasing trend in the percentage of blight days was observed over the modelled years as a result of decreasing humidity which is possibly the result of climate change despite the relatively low numbers of blight days in the last decade early and severe late blight epidemics were still observed in the netherlands in 2007 2012 and 2016 infections with late blight resulted in major losses to yield in organic potato production knuivers 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 this can partly be explained by the fact that potato late blight strains became more aggressive as a result of sexual reproduction cooke et al 2011 increased aggressiveness of the pathogen was observed by shorter life cycles a greater temperature range a shorter infection period more leaf spots per life cycle and the occurrence of stem lesions cooke et al 2011 in the netherlands for a long time only one mating type was present but after the introduction of the second type around 1980 the pathogen is also able to reproduce sexually drenth 1994 this led to a diverse pathogen population with an increased adaptability to its host and environment it is therefore likely that p infestans will be able to adapt to new conditions as a result of climate change in the future van den hurk et al 2014 although changes in pathogen aggressiveness were not included in the model the sensitivity analysis shows that parameter values on late blight development can have a strong effect on disease incidence at the landscape level overall the model framework has proven very suitable to analyse host pathogen interactions within a landscape as influenced by management strategies and scenarios of environmental change including climate change 5 conclusions in this paper we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to analyse the effect of the deployment of a resistant potato variety on late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield the model showed that in the short term growing a resistant variety can be beneficial in many years potato yields of the resistant variety was higher than that of the susceptible variety not protected by fungicides increasing the fraction of potato fields with the resistant variety strongly reduced late blight infection within a landscape but additional management strategies are required to prevent resistance breakdown and establishment of a new virulent late blight population the model showed that low 0 2 as well as high 0 8 fractions of fields across the landscape with a resistant potato variety could increase resistance durability these findings provide greater insight into the opportunities and risks related to the use of resistance in disease control the model can be used to evaluate newly proposed sustainable disease management strategies the results are comparable to findings from existing model studies on resistance durability of other host pathogen systems we developed a model that explores host pathogen processes for the case of potato late blight in a landscape in the netherlands however the model can be easily adapted to simulate other case studies despite the risk of resistance breakdown plant breeders and researchers continue to search for new resistance genes to tackle crop disease new molecular techniques make it easier to introgress and combine resistance genes in new or existing varieties by classical breeding or genetic engineering which makes modelling studies such as this very relevant to allow ex ante assessment of these changes

25292,disease resistant potato varieties can play a key role in sustainable control of potato late blight however when these varieties are more widely used resistance breakdown can occur as a result of pathogen adaptation here we focussed on potato cultivation in the netherlands where new single gene resistant varieties have been introduced over the last ten years this new generation of late blight resistant varieties has moderate yield levels and does not meet all market requirements as a result adoption rates for resistant varieties have been low so far we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to simulate potato production disease spread and pathogen evolution at the landscape level we analysed how late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the spatial deployment of a resistant variety with a lower potential yield than susceptible varieties the model was applied to an agricultural region in the netherlands 596 km2 and was run for a period of 36 years using daily weather data as input for crop growth and disease dynamics the short and long term effects of the deployment of a resistant variety were analysed with the model with respect to short term dynamics years were analysed independently to study between year variation the model demonstrated that in most years susceptible fields without fungicide application suffered severe yield losses and resistant fields performed better despite their lower potential yield resistance breakdown was observed in a small fraction of fields with the resistant variety but this did not affect mean potato yield or disease incidence in the short term since it occurred at the end of the growing season increasing the fraction of potato fields with the resistant variety strongly reduced late blight infection within a landscape with respect to the long term effects the model showed the emergence and spread of a virulent strain over time the virulent strain gradually took over the pathogen population decreasing mean potato yields from fields with the resistant variety this occurred in all landscape compositions where the resistant variety was deployed to different extents it was found that low as well as high proportions of fields with the resistant variety could increase durability of resistance with these findings the model provided more insight into the opportunities and risks related to the use of plant resistance in disease control an important and sustainable disease management strategy keywords phytophthora infestans agent based modelling host pathogen interactions cropping patterns pathogen evolution resistance management 1 introduction pests and diseases can cause large yield losses in potato production and therefore management strategies are required to secure production levels one of the main diseases in potato is late blight caused by phytophthora infestans the application of fungicides is currently the most widely used method to control the disease however this involves high costs and the chemicals are harmful to the environment haverkort et al 2008 one of the important strategies that could lead to more sustainable control is the use of disease resistant potato varieties genes that have resistance against late blight were first discovered in the beginning of the twentieth century fry 2008 when potato varieties contain these so called major resistance genes they cannot get infected by pathogens that do not have a matching virulence gene gene for gene interactions flor 1971 these genes have been used in classical breeding programs to develop resistant varieties however when they became more widely used resistance breakdown occurred due to pathogen adaptation resulting in the emergence of new virulent pathogen strains fry 2008 nowadays breeders aim to identify new resistance genes from wild relatives which can be used to develop resistant varieties with single or multiple resistance genes stacking through classical breeding or genetic engineering haverkort et al 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 since resistance genes are scarce and it takes large investments to develop new varieties it is important to protect new varieties from resistance breakdown here we focussed on the netherlands which has a high potato cultivation density and a suitable climate for late blight development in years with favourable weather for the disease moderate temperatures and high humidity early infection with late blight results in major yield losses in organic potato production where the use of chemicals for disease control is not allowed therefore organic farmers could potentially benefit from the use of resistant potato varieties a new generation of single gene resistant varieties appeared on the dutch market in 2007 however these new varieties have a moderate yield level and do not meet all the market requirements due to slightly different quality traits compared to those of regular susceptible varieties nuijten et al 2017 there is currently insufficient supply of resistant seed potatoes for the entire organic market but the sector aims to expand the production of late blight resistant varieties to completely service the organic market over the coming years bionext 2017 to analyse the effectiveness of crop resistance in late blight control we used a spatially explicit modelling approach it is important to analyse management strategies at the landscape level because late blight is characterised by long distance dispersal and the spatial arrangement of potato crops can affect the spread of the disease skelsey et al 2010 hossard et al 2015 lô pelzer et al 2010 furthermore since evolutionary processes can take multiple years resistance durability should be assessed over longer time periods to analyse these spatial and temporal dynamics modelling is a useful approach particularly compared to field experiments which require more resources and are more constrained in space and time the model we developed was used to simulate the effect of the spatial deployment of a resistant potato variety on late blight dynamics and potato yield several modelling approaches that analyse the effect of deployment strategies on durability of disease resistant crops can be found in the literature these studies draw different conclusions based on the model assumptions the outputs considered and on the host pathogen system analysed fabre et al 2012 pink and puddephat 1999 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for example model studies differ in their assumptions as to whether costs are associated with virulence meaning that virulent pathogens can have a reduced fitness compared to the wild type under standard conditions fabre et al 2012 existing studies have also simulated the emergence of virulence differently as the virulent strain can either be already present in the pathogen population in a very small proportion or it has to emerge as a result of mutation lof et al 2017 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for the case of potato late blight skelsey et al 2010 showed that deployment of a partially resistant variety was able to curb the spread of the disease partially resistant varieties slow down the epidemic in the field but cannot completely prevent infection the most effective strategies were those that reduced the density of potato in the landscape or increased the proportion of area with the resistant potato variety when pathogen adaptation is not taken into account building on the existing research our study focussed on the use of complete resistance as a result of resistance genes specifically we analysed how late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the deployment of a resistant variety our study is premised on several assumptions we assume that the virulent strain has to emerge by mutations during spore production and no costs are associated with virulence this is supported by experimental data that showed only few or no relations between fitness costs and virulence montarry et al 2010 schöber and turkensteen 1992 secondly it was also found that pathogenicity can rapidly evolve within clonal lineages of p infestans as a result of mutation goodwin et al 1995 although the sexual life cycle of p infestans also contributes to genetic diversity by the production of oospores it was not taken into account in this study for model simplicity the emerging patterns of the spread of the disease at the landscape level result from interactions between spatial processes of host pathogen dynamics and management strategies with each acting on different temporal scales to capture this complexity we used an agent based modelling approach agent based models have been recognised as highly suitable for representing heterogeneous collections of interacting entities in a spatial environment in which biophysical processes occur an 2012 we developed submodels for late blight dynamics and crop growth and management processes as input for the agent based model late blight management practices included in the model relate to current conventional and organic practices e g with or without fungicide application 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the model description follows the overview design concepts and details odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 the model was implemented in netlogo version 5 2 0 wilensky 1999 a version of the model is available on the openabm website http www openabm org 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate the spatial dynamics of potato late blight to analyse whether resistant varieties can be used effectively for sustainable disease control we analysed how disease severity resistance durability and potato yield are affected by the fraction of fields across a landscape with a disease resistant potato variety 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model comprises three hierarchical levels grid cells agricultural fields cluster of grid cells and the abiotic environment as input for the model data from the noordoostpolder a dutch agricultural landscape was used the noordoostpolder is a region of 596 km² with about 380 km² of arable land of which 24 is used for potato production see fig 1 the model is grid based 133 129 cells and the grid cells representing an area of 200 200 m2 4 ha are clustered into agricultural fields the grid cells are characterised by location field number and crop type further the grid cells with potato are also characterised by potato variety susceptible or resistant fungicide use and variables and parameters for crop growth and late blight infection see table 1 we consider only one type of susceptible and resistant variety with one resistance gene although the yield potential may increase with the introduction of other resistant varieties for our model we assume the resistant variety has a lower potential yield compared to the susceptible variety this is reflected in the crop growth parameters grid cells belonging to the same field have the same field number potato variety and fungicide use two types of late blight are distinguished in the model the wild type and the virulent strain the wild type can only infect the susceptible variety of potato while the virulent strain can also infect the resistant variety at the start of the simulation only the wild type is present the virulent strain can emerge during the growing season as the result of mutation when a grid cell is infected spores are produced that are dispersed to nearby cells where they can cause infections for more details on model processes see section 2 1 3 and section 2 1 7 since late blight development and crop growth is weather dependent we used measured weather data from may 1 to september 30 153 days for 36 years 1981 2016 as model input section 2 1 3 these years represent a range of weather conditions for crop growth and late blight dynamics 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the time step of the model is one day and processes related to crop and disease dynamics are updated daily we simulate the growing season from may 1 to september 30 153 days for 36 years at the start of each growing season state variables are reset and late blight infections are initialised in randomly selected potato grid cells for every time step meteorological data is loaded and used as input to simulate crop growth and disease dynamics processes impacting crop and disease dynamics are processed in the following order 1 fungicide application 2 calculate rates leaf area development tuber growth lesion expansion and spore production 3 spore dispersal 4 update states lai yield lesion stages latent infectious and no longer infectious phase and disease severity and 5 haulm destruction for more details on model processes see section 2 1 7 at the end of each year larger scale aggregate variables are calculated from individual cell data on potato yield and late blight infection see section 2 2 initial model values and parameters are shown in table 2 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles the representations of ecological processes were derived from a validated framework developed by skelsey 2008 with modifications to allow for analysis of resistance breakdown and durability at the landscape level 2 1 4 2 emergence late blight dynamics within the landscape emerge from the interaction between disease dispersal and distribution and management of potato fields including fungicide application and potato variety susceptible resistant important model output at the landscape level is the fraction of infected susceptible and resistant potato fields with the wild type and virulent strains of late blight potato yield is also an emergent property since it is the result of crop characteristics late blight dynamics and the weather 2 1 4 3 interaction interaction is only modelled implicitly by spatial interactions related to disease dispersal 2 1 4 4 stochasticity at the start of each simulation run management strategies fungicide application and potato variety are randomly divided over the potato fields furthermore at the beginning of each year the infection starts in a randomly chosen fraction of potato grid cells last spores are dispersed by wind and the wind direction is randomly selected see section 2 1 7 2 1 4 5 collectives potato grid cells are clustered in agricultural fields with each field having the same fungicide use and potato variety 2 1 4 6 observation data collected from the agent based model at the end of each growing season includes the fraction of infected potato cells disease incidence and infected resistant fields and potato yield the data is collected separately for the susceptible and the resistant fields with and without fungicide application and for infections with the wild type and virulent strain of late blight at the end of each year aggregate variables are calculated over the whole landscape and stored the modelling interface presents various graphs that show the dynamics of the model outputs over time 2 1 5 initialisation geographical data was used as input for the model including the allocation of potato fields management strategies were randomly divided over the potato fields potato variety and fungicide use the fraction of susceptible fields with fungicide application was set at 0 90 the fraction of resistant potato fields was varied between model runs see section 2 2 model scenarios were run using two different settings with and without carry over effects of the virulent strain between years in this way years were analysed independently but also in a time series to analyse resistance durability over longer time periods the initial values of crop growth and late blight infection are provided in table 2 2 1 6 input data geographical data from the noordoostpolder was used as input for the model fig 1 crop rotation is not taken into account in the model because we don t expect crop rotation to have a strong effect on the model results in this region farm fields are usually clustered around the homestead and the proportion of potato in the rotation is high varying from 1 3 in conventional to 1 6 in organic farming systems as a result crop rotation only slightly changes the distances between potato fields while rotation could affect the number of initial infections this was kept constant between years since it was not relevant to compare different rotations in this case measured meteorological data from the weather station marknesse in the noordoostpolder was used as input for the model knmi 2016 since data from marknesse was incomplete before 1994 weather data from the eelde station 70 km from the study area from 1981 to 1993 was used to obtain a longer time series mean daily temperature and total daily radiation were calculated and used as input in the submodel simulating crop growth we used pearson s correlation to compare the data at the two sites for the years that data from both weather stations was available 1994 2016 data indicating days suitable for blight development see definition of blight day below showed a correlation of r 0 77 suggesting that the weather experienced at both stations is similar hourly weather data from may 1 to september 30 the potato growing season were analysed for the years 1981 until 2016 to determine if a day was suitable for p infestans sporangia to cause an infection i e a blight day we used rules that were based on the hourly temperature and relative humidity during a 24 h period as published by skelsey et al 2009a the first rule states that an infection hour is defined as an hour where the temperature is between 5 and 27 c and the relative humidity is greater than 90 the second rule is related to the number of consecutive infection hours required to allow germination to reach completion in a 24 h period therefore the mean temperature during consecutive infection hours tinf c is used for 5 tinf 10 16 consecutive infection hours are required for 10 tinf 15 10 consecutive infection hours are required for 15 tinf 20 16 consecutive infection hours are required for 20 tinf 27 22 consecutive infection hours are required and for tinf 5 and tinf 27 spore germination does not occur skelsey et al 2009a the 24 h period runs from 16 00 h to 16 00 h to ensure that the cut off between time steps lies within the relative dry period of the day due to lower temperatures during the night the relative humidity is usually higher we made some modifications to these rules in our model infection could also occur with lower temperatures of tinf between 5 and 10 c and consecutive infection hours were slightly reduced because of increased aggressiveness as a result of pathogen adaptation cooke et al 2011 if the conditions of the rules are met new infections can occur as a result of spore germination if the conditions are not met the newly produced spores cannot cause infections and eventually die since we assume spores live only 24 h based on this analysis a list with favourable days for late blight development was given as input to the model 2 1 7 submodels below we present an overview of the model processes an overview of variables and parameters used in this study can be found in tables 1 and 2 2 1 7 1 crop growth to simulate leaf area development we use equations for foliar development according to richards 1959 to calculate leaf area expansion we use the leaf area index lai crop growth starts on the 1st of may t 1 and the initial leaf area index laii is set at 0 05 for both varieties leaf area expansion is simulated using thermal time accumulation growing degree days the change in lai is calculated using two equations one before the onset of senescence which is determined by a fixed number of degree days tl ᵒc day and one after the onset of senescence in both equations lai is proportional to the mean daily temperature tc with a base temperature of 2 ᵒc tc t tb the maximum leaf area laim and a net growth rate rg before the onset of senescence eq 1 or a net death rate rd after the onset of senescence eq 2 1 d l d t r g t c l a i 1 l a i l a i m α 2 d l d t r d t c l a i 1 l a i l a i m tuber growth per day is calculated from tuber initiation until harvesting haverkort and harris 1987 the moment of tuber initiation is based on the number of the growing degree days tt potatoes are harvested at the end of the growing season on september 30 the tuber growth rate is calculated per hectare tonnes of fresh matter and is based on the leaf area index lai the light use efficiency lue kg dm mj 1 mean daily radiation q mj m 2 disease severity ds infected leaf tissue and the constants dry matter content dmc and light extinction coefficient k eq 3 3 d y d t q l u e 1 e k l a i 100 d m c 1 d s 2 100 10 with respect to crop growth processes we assume that the resistant and susceptible potato varieties only differ in terms of their light use efficiency resulting in a lower potential yield for the resistant variety compared to the susceptible variety tuber growth is reduced by the fraction of infected plant tissue multiplied by two since an increase in latent area is assumed to cause an equal loss of non lesion covered leaf area van oijen 1992 2 1 7 2 late blight dynamics 2 1 7 2 1 initial infections at the beginning of each season the infection starts in a fraction of potato grid cells fi which are randomly selected across the landscape random initiation is justified with field data that shows that a large number of initial infections are caused by infected seed tubers which are randomly distributed over farms evenhuis et al 2007 secondly no evidence has been found for late blight hotspots i e reoccurring initial infections in the same area over multiple years raatjes and kessel 2003 the fraction of initially infected potato fields is set at 0 02 infections ha 1 which is based on 1 infection source per 200 ha in a landscape where approximately 25 of the area consists of potato fields susceptible varieties zwankhuizen et al 1998 at the start of the simulation initial infections belong to the wild type strain which can only develop in fields with the susceptible variety the infection is initialised with an area of 0 01 m2 of infected leaf tissue per grid cell lsi to analyse the population dynamics of the wild type and virulent strains over time between year survival of these two strains is included the fraction of initially infected potato fields is kept constant but the ratio between initial infections of the wild type and virulent strains could change over time the ratio between the total disease severity of the wild type and virulent strains at the end of the previous growing season is used to calculate the number of initial infections of the wild type and virulent strains in the following year this process can be turned on and off in the model if it is turned off all initial infections belong to the wild type at the start of each year 2 1 7 2 2 lesion expansion for simulating the spread of the disease we use an aged structured population model including a latent infectious and no longer infectious phase of lesions skelsey et al 2010 when spores germinate the new lesions first enter a latent phase of five days after which they become infectious and produce spores after the infectious phase one day lesions are added to the pool of no longer infectious tissue existing but no longer infectious lesions expand over time and produce new infectious tissue according to a lesion growth rate rl new infections resulting from spore germination can only occur on blight days see section 2 1 6 but the expansion of existing lesions occurs at every time step the area of infected leaf tissue per stage of the disease is simulated for the two strains over time table 1 these variables are used to calculate the disease severity ds described as the percentage of infected leaf tissue per grid cell the disease severity is calculated separately for the wild type and virulent strains a grid cell can get infected with the wild type and the virulent strains at the same time and the infection processes of both strains are modelled identically and simultaneously 2 1 7 2 3 spore production based on the area of infectious plant tissue inf and the sporulation intensity si spores m 2 of infected leaf area a number of spores are produced per grid cell sp eq 4 spore production is calculated separately for the wild type and virulent strains 4 s p t i n f t 1 s i as explained above virulent spores can emerge as a result of mutation during spore production of the wild type strain in fields with the susceptible variety of potatoes eq 5 5 s p t v s p t w f m the plasticity of pathogenicity in the genome of p infestans results in rapid adaptation goodwin et al 1995 however the exact mutation rate is unknown in other species the mutation rate the natural mutation frequency per nucleotide was estimated between 10 9 and 10 7 kondrashov and kondrashov 2010 therefore the mutation frequency fm in the model was set at 10 7 in light of the rapid adaptation of p infestans this corresponds to a single nucleotide mutation which can overcome a single gene resistant variety after spore dispersal and survival the remaining viable spores can germinate and cause infection in susceptible or resistant fields 2 1 7 2 4 spore dispersal a small fraction of the produced spores the escape fraction fe is dispersed to other grid cells where they can cause new infections the remaining spores contribute to the disease severity in the same grid cell the escape fraction is used to calculate the number of produced spores that escapes the canopy and are available for long distance dispersal skelsey et al 2009b this variable is negatively correlated to the leaf area index and is affected by the wind speed eq 6 6 f e e l a i v d k v u where vd deposition velocity and kv von kármán constant the mean wind speed u is set at 3 m s 1 which was the mean wind speed on blight days according to the weather data depending on the wind direction selected randomly each day spores are dispersed from one of the four sides of the infected grid cell up to a distance of 1000 m in a sensitivity analysis we explored the effect of wind direction on the model results data on wind direction was analysed northeast 21 southeast 14 southwest 39 and northwest 26 on blight days and implemented in the model using probabilities but this did not affect the model results dispersal coefficients represent the fraction of spores arriving in grid cells according to their distance from the source dispersal coefficients are calculated using the gaussian plume model skelsey et al 2008 spijkerboer et al 2002 and are determined for distances between 100 and 900 m with 200 m intervals length of one grid cell it was assumed that spores have to disperse from the centre of the infected grid cell to the edge of a neighbouring cell to cause infection since late blight spores are dispersed by wind they can travel over larger distances than those included in our study zwankhuizen et al 1998 however a model study by hossard et al 2015 showed that a characterisation of the landscape within 500 m around a resistant field was sufficient to analyse resistance durability for a wind dispersing pathogen therefore we believe that a dispersal distance of 1000 m is sufficient for the purpose of our study after spore dispersal the number of spores in each potato grid cell is calculated this is the sum of spores that arrived via dispersal and spores that were produced in the cell only a fraction of the spores survives and is able to germinate the number of germinating spores is affected by the infection efficiency ie the deposition efficiency de and the spore survival fraction fs when one or more spores germinate these spores enter the latent phase l 1 and the corresponding area of infected leaf tissue is calculated using the average lesion size lsa the processes related to spore dispersal only occur on blight days since favourable weather is required for the germination of newly produced spores 2 1 7 2 5 fungicide application protective fungicides are used on a fraction of fields with the susceptible variety for disease control which reduces the infection efficiency ie of the spores skelsey et al 2009b fungicides are applied at weekly intervals starting on the day of crop emergence the infection efficiency is described as the fraction of spores present that are able to infect the host when fungicides are applied the infection efficiency is reduced to 1 of the original value meaning that 99 of the spores are eliminated during the days following application the fungicides gradually degrade and the infection efficiency increases again the infection efficiency is calculated with eq 7 7 i e i e m i n i e m a x i e m i n 1 t 50 t t a β where iemin minimum infection efficiency directly after fungicide application iemax maximum infection efficiency without fungicide application t50 the time at which 50 of the fungicides are ineffective set at 9 days t time day of the year ta day of last application β shape factor which is negatively correlated with the time needed to reach iemax when the disease severity in a grid cell exceeds 1 it is assumed that curative fungicides are applied which have a similar effect on infection efficiency as protective fungicides and in addition reduce the expansion of existing lesions by a factor of 0 1 cf 2 1 7 2 6 haulm destruction when the total disease severity in potato grid cells reaches 5 the potato haulm is destroyed according to dutch governmental regulations nvwa 2008 in these grid cells leaf and tuber growth stops directly and the disease can no longer disperse to other fields since disease severity per grid cell is limited to 5 competition for space was not included in the model 2 2 model simulation scenarios the model was used to analyse several scenarios we used a baseline scenario with a fraction of 0 9 susceptible fields 0 1 resistant fields and 0 9 of the susceptible fields receiving fungicide applications this roughly represents the current situation in the case study region which has a small number of organic farmers who do not apply fungicides and a small number of farmers growing a resistant potato variety the baseline scenario was used for detailed analysis of host pathogen interactions within and between years with a particular focus on the influence of weather conditions secondly we explored the effect of the deployment of the resistant variety on disease control by adjusting the fraction of resistant fields composing the landscape referred to as landscape composition the fraction of resistant fields was varied between 0 00 0 95 with intervals of 0 10 using a value of 0 95 instead of 1 00 for all landscape compositions model runs were executed twice years were analysed independently without carry over effects between years but also in a time series to analyse resistance durability over longer time periods in this way short and long term effects of the deployment of potato varieties were compared for each scenario simulation runs were repeated 10 times we analysed potato yield and variables related to late blight infection the following output variables were calculated from individual grid cell data 1 potato yield 2 disease incidence the percentage of infected potato grid cells with a disease severity 1 skelsey et al 2010 3 infected resistant fields the percentage of resistant potato grid cells in the landscape infected with the virulent strain 4 establishment risk the mean risk of establishment of the virulent strain due to between year survival therefore we analysed the percentage of years that the virulent strain emerged and survived the winter resulting in initial infections in the following year and 5 take over time the number of years it takes after establishment until 90 of the total disease severity is caused by the virulent strain 2 3 sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters which have a strong effect on the model output a local sensitivity analysis was carried out hamby 1994 ten broeke et al 2016 most of the parameter values were derived from literature and those with large uncertainties were included in a sensitivity analysis using the baseline scenario table 3 these parameters included initial parameter values and some of the parameters related to crop growth and late blight dynamics parameter values were varied individually by 20 above or below their reference values table 3 and simulation runs were repeated 10 times 3 results 3 1 short term dynamics weather variability late blight severity and impact the percentage of blight days between may and september for the period between 1981 and 2016 is presented in fig 2 blight days as well as the relative humidity seemed to decrease over time a multiple regression analysis with daily mean relative humidity and temperature as independent variables showed that these variables could explain 75 6 p 0 001 and 2 8 p 0 05 of the variation in blight days respectively the 36 years of data simulated with the baseline scenario showed that disease incidence and potato yield varied between years and were affected by the number of blight days fig 3 each year was analysed independently showing the host pathogen dynamics within a season the mean disease incidence per year ranged between 15 and 55 and increased with more blight days there was only small variation between model runs showing that the disease incidence is mainly affected by the number of blight days due to the fixed number of initial infection sources a minimum late blight incidence was observed although most fields are protected by fungicides the large fraction of susceptible potato fields in the landscape resulted in high levels of disease incidence in some of the years in the baseline scenario resistance breakdown occurred and the percentage of infected resistant fields grid cells was variable overall we observed an increase in the number of infected resistant fields in the years with a larger number of blight days fig 3b the mean percentage of infected resistant fields in a year reached a maximum of 8 4 7 2 sd indicating that only parts of the resistant fields were infected with the virulent strain the model showed that resistance breakdown occurred late in the season the mean day of the year that the first case of resistance breakdown was reported was day 95 22 sd august 3 and the earliest reporting of resistance breakdown was on day 50 june 19 in many years resistance breakdown did not occur or was very low even in years with a high percentage of blight days on the other hand resistance breakdown was observed in years with a low percentage of blight days moreover large variation in resistance breakdown was observed between model runs the variability between years and model runs showed the random nature of this event resistance breakdown can occur in years with high and low late blight incidence and it is affected by random processes such as the allocation of potato varieties across the landscape and initial infection sources potato yields are shown in fig 3c in general susceptible fields with fungicide application had higher potato yields than resistant fields and susceptible fields without fungicides potato yields in fungicide treated susceptible fields were relatively stable between years indicating that fungicides effectively suppress the disease within a field in years with low infection pressure the susceptible fields both with and without fungicides performed better than the resistant fields this was as expected given the assumption in the model that the resistant variety has a potentially lower yield than the susceptible variety with the increasing number of blight days resistant fields reached higher yield levels compared to the susceptible fields without fungicides showing a strong effect of late blight infection on yield loss in untreated susceptible fields a small decrease in mean potato yield was observed in both resistant fields and susceptible fields treated with fungicides with an increasing percentage of blight days this was largely the result of a negative correlation between blight days and temperature and radiation influencing crop growth pearson correlation blight days and temperature b 0 387 and p 0 020 blight days and radiation b 0 791 and p 0 001 we also observed small yield losses due to late blight infection in these fields when we only consider the short term dynamics the effect of resistance breakdown on yield was low because of the low level of infected resistant fields and its late moment of occurrence in the season the model showed that an increasing proportion of resistant fields resulted in a strong decrease in disease incidence across the landscape fig 4 years were analysed independently and mean values were calculated over 36 years given that infections mainly occur in susceptible fields the variation in disease incidence between years decreased with larger fractions of resistant fields fig 4a this result also shows that random processes including the spatial allocation of initial infection sources and potato varieties have a strong effect on disease dispersal in susceptible fields and differ between years and model runs the disease incidence in susceptible fields without fungicides strongly decreased when the fraction of resistant fields in the landscape was larger than 0 50 fig 4b a larger fraction of resistant fields in the landscape reduced the number of sites where initial infections could develop at the start of the growing season mean values of 183 and 9 initial infection sources with a fraction of 0 00 and 0 95 resistant fields respectively secondly during the season the potato fields with the resistant variety acted as a barrier for disease dispersal preventing infection in susceptible potato fields the decrease in disease incidence also resulted in reduced yield losses in susceptible fields without fungicide application fig 4c while no effect was observed on potato yields of resistant fields or susceptible fields with fungicide application 3 2 long term dynamics pathogen evolution and durability of resistance fig 5 shows an example of the model results for long term dynamics simulated with the baseline scenario the simulation results of disease dynamics over longer periods show that in the baseline scenario after some years 2 8 resistance breakdown occurred and the virulent strain gradually took over the late blight population fig 5a the virulent strain has an advantage since it can infect both the resistant and susceptible fields while the wild type can only infect the susceptible fields establishment of the virulent strain over time also resulted in increased levels of infected resistant fields and in turn yield losses fig 5b the yield of the resistant fields eventually dropped below that of the susceptible fields without fungicides when all resistant fields got infected with the virulent strain establishment of the virulent strain occurred in all landscape compositions where the resistant variety was grown but deployment strategies of potato varieties does influence resistance durability increasing the fraction of resistant fields from 0 1 to 0 5 increased the risk of establishment of the virulent strain fig 6 a with more resistant potato fields in the landscape there is an increased risk that virulent spores emerging from susceptible fields can spread to fields of the resistant variety resulting in more rapid spread of the virulent strain when the fraction of resistant fields increased beyond 0 5 the risk of establishment decreased again probably as a result of the reduced infection pressure once the virulent strain survives the winter it gradually takes over the pathogen population the take over time is relatively short and decreases rapidly with increasing fractions of resistant fields fig 6b the virulent strain has two major advantages compared to the wild type firstly it can infect both the resistant and susceptible varieties and secondly it can spread quickly through the resistant fields since we assume that these fields are not protected by fungicides when considering establishment risk and take over time together we found that with a small fraction of resistant fields there was a small risk of establishment of the virulent strain and it took more time to take over the pathogen population on the other hand with a large fraction of resistant fields the establishment risk of the virulent strain is even smaller but once establishment occurs it takes a short time to take over the population therefore low as well as high cropping ratios of resistant fields can increase resistance durability 3 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis show the effects of varying individual parameters on the model output in the baseline scenario table 3 the effect on model output is presented as the percentage of change related to the reference value varying the parameters had small effects on simulated potato yields with the exception of those directly related to crop growth such as light use efficiency the parameters related to late blight only influenced mean yield of susceptible fields without fungicides to a maximum value of 5 simulated disease incidence was affected by potato late blight parameters where changing the lesion growth rate of late blight rl showed the strongest effect varying the leaf area growth and death rates also had a strong effect on the disease incidence since leaf area development influences disease severity at the field level percentage of infected leaf tissue the percentage of infected resistant fields after resistance breakdown and establishment risk were affected by up to 45 when varying parameters related to spore dispersal and survival in contrast no strong effects were observed on the take over time it was found that increased aggressiveness of the pathogen related to sporulation intensity infection efficiency spore survival and mutation reduced the take over time of the virulent strain however the effects were rather small max 15 and inconsistent probably due to the variation in this output variable 4 discussion the model showed the short and long term effects of the deployment of a late blight resistant potato variety with respect to short term effects increasing the fraction of resistant fields strongly decreased the disease incidence in a landscape this was the result of the decreasing number of initial infection sources that can only develop in susceptible fields after a certain threshold was reached resistant fields acted as barriers preventing spread to neighbouring fields resistance breakdown was observed late in the season in a small fraction of resistant fields per year and therefore did not have a strong effect on the mean potato yield of resistant fields or disease incidence in the short term in the model we assumed that the resistant potato variety had a lower potential yield compared to the susceptible variety with respect to potato yields in many years resistant fields performed better than susceptible fields not protected by fungicides due to yield losses by late blight infection this demonstrated that resistant varieties can be very effective in the control of potato late blight and growing these varieties would help organic farmers to achieve acceptable yield levels conventional farmers could also benefit from the use of resistant varieties when economic and environmental costs related to fungicide application are considered furthermore it is expected that the yield potential will increase with the introduction of new resistant varieties which will make them more attractive to farmers organic farmers growing susceptible varieties could also benefit from resistant varieties since this reduces the infection pressure in the landscape leading to higher yield on fields that are not treated with fungicides however susceptible fields can also act as sources of infection leading to the emergence of virulent strains and resistance breakdown over the longer term these results show the potential benefits of growing a resistant variety but also the risk of resistance breakdown when analysing the long term effects of deploying a resistant variety across a landscape the model showed resistance breakdown by the emergence and spread of a virulent strain mean potato yields of resistant fields decreased over time when no countermeasures were taken this occurred in all landscape compositions but durability of resistance could be increased by maintaining either low 0 2 or high 0 8 fractions of resistant fields in the netherlands new single gene resistant varieties were introduced to the market in 2007 nuijten et al 2017 these were mainly developed for the organic sector which is currently responsible for 1 of the total dutch potato production cbs 2016 the proportion of organic production is slightly higher in this case study area with approximately 9 of the arable land in the province being used for organic farming after a severe late blight epidemic in 2016 stakeholders in the organic potato supply chain including breeding companies farmers organisations and retail agreed to upscale the development of late blight resistant varieties bionext 2017 which could also lead to an increase in organic potato production according to the model results the risk of establishment of a virulent strain increases when larger proportions of fields are cultivated with a resistant variety with the same resistance gene an implication of these results is that in the scaling up phase of using a resistant variety breeding companies and farmers must be aware of the risk of resistance breakdown the model showed that resistance breakdown can occur in years with low as well high disease incidence meaning that the risk is ever present additional management strategies are needed to prevent resistance breakdown and spread of the new virulent strain several resistance management strategies have been proposed in the literature to increase resistance durability such as spatial and temporal allocation of resistant varieties with different sources of resistance genes combining resistance genes in one variety gene stacking and combining resistant varieties with reduced application of fungicides mundt 2014 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 furthermore the results from our study suggest that the use of early potato varieties that can be harvested early in the season could decrease the risk of resistance breakdown since this was mainly observed at the end of the growing season secondly destroying the haulm immediately after an infection in the resistant variety could prevent spread and establishment of the virulent strain model studies can be used to analyse the effectiveness of these additional resistance management strategies at the landscape level lof et al 2017 van den bosch and gilligan 2003 for the implementation of such resistance management strategies concerted effort among stakeholders is required in a previous analysis on potato late blight it was concluded that control of potato late blight is influenced by both social and ecological factors as well as their interactions pacilly et al 2016 farmers play a key role since they make decisions on crop management but they are strongly influenced by other stakeholders such as traders breeders and policy makers each pushing their own objectives and interests our model framework also allows the implementation of decision making processes to analyse social ecological interactions and this will be carried out as a next step in this research unfortunately no data was available on late blight dynamics at the landscape level over time to validate the model results the model can be described as a so called mid range model the aim is neither to exactly model the situation in a certain region nor to make a purely theoretical point gilbert 2008 therefore it was used to identify trends rather than making predictions for the future although no time or space specific data for this or other case studies are available to validate the model the trends observed in the model output can be supported by previous findings on late blight dynamics and other modelling studies since yield limiting factors other than late blight infection were not included in the model simulated yields are higher than the actual potato yields of farmers cbs 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 on average potato yields in organic potato production are 30 50 lower than yields in conventional production tamm et al 2004 the model showed similar trends when comparing simulated yields of susceptible fields with and without fungicide application secondly previous model estimations by skelsey et al 2010 showed that increasing the fraction of fields with a resistant variety strongly reduced disease incidence following similar trends found in our study with respect to resistance durability the model showed the emergence of the virulent strain that resulted in resistance breakdown after some years this process whereby the virulent strain is able to establish in the population and make resistance less effective each year has also been observed several times after the introduction of single gene resistant varieties fry 2008 the model showed that high 0 8 as well as low 0 2 fractions of resistant fields could increase the resistance durability of a resistant variety in practice the conventional approach is to introduce low fractions of resistant varieties to the potato cultivation area since this can reduce the selection pressure on the pathogen population pink and puddephat 1999 however these studies assume that the virulent strain is already present in the pathogen population and after the introduction of the resistant variety this population can rapidly increase van den bosch and gilligan 2003 showed that resistance breakdown can be delayed by low and high cropping proportions of the resistant variety they used similar assumptions as in our study no fitness costs are involved related to resistance and the virulent strain must emerge by mutations in the asexual life cycle they used several measures for resistance durability and showed that the time after which the virulent strain appears in the population comparable to the establishment risk in our study can be extended by small as well as large fractions of resistant fields in the landscape secondly as in our study they reported that the time until the virulent genotype takes over the population would decrease with larger fractions of the resistant variety van den bosch and gilligan 2003 in agreement with previous literature our results also show that it is important to look at different measures to analyse resistance durability theories that describe interactions between spatial diversity and dispersal can be used to explain the observed patterns related to disease severity resistance breakdown and the fraction of resistant hosts the janzen connell hypothesis shows that interactions between hosts and pathogens shape the composition and density of species in the landscape gilbert 2002 in addition the dispersal scaling hypothesis states that dispersal is affected by habitat size and dispersal distance where an increase in habitat size is described as a positive dispersal force and an increase in dispersal distance as a negative dispersal force skelsey et al 2013 these two competing forces result in a pattern where dispersal is maximised at intermediate scales our modelling results show that increasing the fraction of resistant fields until a certain point leads to a higher risk of infection with the virulent strain with higher fractions of resistant fields virulent spores have an increased chance of arriving in these fields however when the fraction of resistant fields increases the fraction of susceptible fields goes down since these fields host the wild type strain this reduces disease severity fig 4a given that the virulent spores are the result of mutations in the wild type population the risk of emergence of virulent spores decreases with a lower fraction of susceptible fields these trade offs result in the pattern observed in fig 6b which shows the highest risk of establishment of the virulent strain occurs with about equal proportions of susceptible and resistant fields in the landscape once the virulent strain has established it will take over the pathogen population and this process goes faster with larger fractions of resistant fields fig 6b to analyse the effect of weather variability on late blight dynamics the number of blight days was calculated and used as input for the model this parameter represents the potentially suitable conditions for late blight development during the season overall a decreasing trend in the percentage of blight days was observed over the modelled years as a result of decreasing humidity which is possibly the result of climate change despite the relatively low numbers of blight days in the last decade early and severe late blight epidemics were still observed in the netherlands in 2007 2012 and 2016 infections with late blight resulted in major losses to yield in organic potato production knuivers 2016 lammerts van bueren et al 2008 this can partly be explained by the fact that potato late blight strains became more aggressive as a result of sexual reproduction cooke et al 2011 increased aggressiveness of the pathogen was observed by shorter life cycles a greater temperature range a shorter infection period more leaf spots per life cycle and the occurrence of stem lesions cooke et al 2011 in the netherlands for a long time only one mating type was present but after the introduction of the second type around 1980 the pathogen is also able to reproduce sexually drenth 1994 this led to a diverse pathogen population with an increased adaptability to its host and environment it is therefore likely that p infestans will be able to adapt to new conditions as a result of climate change in the future van den hurk et al 2014 although changes in pathogen aggressiveness were not included in the model the sensitivity analysis shows that parameter values on late blight development can have a strong effect on disease incidence at the landscape level overall the model framework has proven very suitable to analyse host pathogen interactions within a landscape as influenced by management strategies and scenarios of environmental change including climate change 5 conclusions in this paper we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to analyse the effect of the deployment of a resistant potato variety on late blight severity resistance durability and potato yield the model showed that in the short term growing a resistant variety can be beneficial in many years potato yields of the resistant variety was higher than that of the susceptible variety not protected by fungicides increasing the fraction of potato fields with the resistant variety strongly reduced late blight infection within a landscape but additional management strategies are required to prevent resistance breakdown and establishment of a new virulent late blight population the model showed that low 0 2 as well as high 0 8 fractions of fields across the landscape with a resistant potato variety could increase resistance durability these findings provide greater insight into the opportunities and risks related to the use of resistance in disease control the model can be used to evaluate newly proposed sustainable disease management strategies the results are comparable to findings from existing model studies on resistance durability of other host pathogen systems we developed a model that explores host pathogen processes for the case of potato late blight in a landscape in the netherlands however the model can be easily adapted to simulate other case studies despite the risk of resistance breakdown plant breeders and researchers continue to search for new resistance genes to tackle crop disease new molecular techniques make it easier to introgress and combine resistance genes in new or existing varieties by classical breeding or genetic engineering which makes modelling studies such as this very relevant to allow ex ante assessment of these changes

25293,a high quality data collection has been carried out between 2004 and 2014 to develop the first trophic ecopath model for the functioning of the sub and intertidal zones of ria de aveiro this schematic representation allows the characterization of the most important compartments of biomass and flows of energy representing the functioning of the ecosystem and can be used in the fields of decision making and management the model considered 26 functional groups from primary producers to top predators and two different fisheries artisanal and leisure and showed that ria de aveiro is a dynamic ecosystem dominated by a high biomass of primary producers where the transference of energy among compartments is to a large extent accomplished through the detritus path the model also provides several ecological indicators on the state of maturity of the ecosystem showing that ria de aveiro is in an intermediate state of maturity with a relatively complex food web and resilience to environmental changes as discussed this state of maturity is probably determined by human action pervading the system to advance in the expectable ecological succession of a coastal lagoon these aspects together with indicators of elevated fishing pressure and predation within the system underline the necessity of controlling illegal extraction activities and monitoring the biomass of the main functional groups of the system especially top predators in order to keep the functioning of the ecosystem of ria de aveiro in its current condition keywords coastal lagoon ecopath food web model ecosystem functioning environmental management tool 1 introduction coastal lagoons are among the most productive aquatic ecosystems supporting a large reservoir of organic matter and a large diversity of habitats that offer optimal niches for numerous aquatic species villanueva et al 2006 ria de aveiro is a shallow multi branch lagunar system situated in the north west coast of portugal 40 38 n 08

is a new direction in fisheries management essentially reversing the order of priorities to start with the ecosystem rather than single species assessments link 2005 gascuel et al 2014 bourdaud et al 2016 in this regard the inter specific interactions within the ecosystem the effects of environmental changes or the impacts of fisheries are among the critical factors that should be integrated in the formulation of management strategies cheung et al 2010 pereira et al 2010 pinsky and fogarty 2012 the mass balanced model ecopath christensen et al 2008 is presently the most used approach to analyze and describe food webs identify key groups of species and compare the functioning of ecosystems with similar characteristics heymans et al 2014 the main goal of this work is to model the trophic web structure of the subtidal and intertidal areas of ria de aveiro considering different functional groups of organisms i e groups of species with similar ecological role and the impact of the different kind of fisheries occurring at the zone using data collected between 2004 and 2014 this study constitutes the first attempt to describe the balanced functioning of ria de aveiro allowing to identify the most important biological groups in terms of abundance and trophic relationships and establish a reference point for comparisons with future states of ria de aveiro or other similar coastal lagoons 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling approach the food web model of ria de aveiro was constructed using the software ecopath 6 4 4 christensen et al 2008 ecopath builds a static balanced ecosystem model considering functional groups as fundamental units these functional groups comprise one or more species sharing similar population dynamics and ecological function the dynamics of each functional group of the model are described by two basic equations the first one describing the production of each group as a function of different components christensen and pauly 1992 p b i b i y i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i e i b a i p b i b i 1 e e i where bi and bj are the biomass eg kg km 2 of prey and predator respectively p b i is the production biomass ratio y 1 or total mortality in steady state conditions allen 1971 eei is the ecotrophic efficiency defined as the ratio between flow of energy out and into each group or the proportion of the production that is used in the ecosystem by predation q b j is the food consumption per biomass unit of j y 1 dc i j is the proportion of every prey i in the stomach content of predator j yi are the exports from fishing catches eg kg km 2 y 1 ei are other exports eg kg km 2 y 1 and bai is the biomass accumulation rate for i eg kg km 2 y 1 for the construction of any ecopath model at least three of these four basic input variables are required for each functional group i b p b q b and ee once all the parameters are known the model balances the inputs and outputs of each functional group using its second fundamental equation q i p i r i u i where qi is the consumption eg kg of i on preys from the system or from outside in the form of imports pi is the production of i eg kg that must be consumed by its predators or exported out of the system or converted into detritus ri is the respiration of i eg kg and ui is the non assimilated food by i eg kg 2 2 pedigree index the pedigree index is used in ecopath to rank the level of uncertainty of the values incorporated into the models we assigned different levels to the data considering whether they were obtained from samples or experiments at ria de aveiro based on empirical equations or taken from ecopath models of similar ecosystems the pedigree assigned to each input value of the model was considered during the balancing of the model see below with re adjustments being more likely to the values with low pedigree than the values with high pedigree 2 3 balancing the model once the input data for the model were collected appendix a section 1 the pre balance prebal diagnostics described in link 2010 were tested these diagnostics based on general ecological principles include some rules of thumb such as the range of biomass considered the slopes of the biomass ratios of the functional groups ordered by trophic level or the expected ranges of vital rates and can be used to identify groups with disparate values once the prebal diagnostics were verified predation mortality rates and fleet fishing mortality rates under the output mortality rates tab in the ecopath software were checked to assess the quality of the data on fishing rates and on dietary composition hence after adjusting the causes of these mortalities fishing pressure or predation the model was balanced following the guidelines presented in the work of heymans et al 2016 in a top down strategy and considering their pedigree see section 2 5 to hierarchically adjust them finally the net food conversion efficiencies p q respiration assimilation r a and the production respiration p r ratios were checked to be within the expected theoretical ranges while the unused consumption u q of the groups of detritivore and suspensivore invertebrates was considered to be 0 4 instead of 0 2 as suggested by christensen et al 2008 2 4 functional groups and input parameters twenty six functional groups were considered to build the food web model of ria de aveiro the ecological role taxonomic e g decapods annelids etc trophic e g piscivorous and omnivorous fish and economic or cultural aspects seabass sardine etc were used in descending priority to classify species into the different functional groups see appendix a section 1 for species composition of each functional group data sources for this model include published and unpublished data obtained in the period between 2004 and 2014 appendix a section 1 where published data were used the bibliographic sources of information were preferentially based on works performed at ria de aveiro portugal or the iberian peninsula appendix a section 1 shows the raw data gathered to construct the model while table 1 summarizes the information after model balancing the description of the functional groups is shown below but see appendix b for specific methodological aspects necessary to understand the acquisition of field data fig 1 shows the sampling stations where data were collected at ria de aveiro 2 4 1 birds three functional groups of birds were considered in this study filter feeding waders and piscivorous birds the biomass of each group was estimated by visual census while consumption was estimated using empirical equations see appendix b both productivity values and the diet of each group were obtained from a literature search based on 28 papers of which 20 concern studies carried out in the iberian peninsula appendix a section 1 2 4 2 fish eight functional groups of fish were created based on the feeding guilds classification of elliott et al 2007 the information available in fishbase froese and pauly 2015 was used to classify the species according to the guilds after exploring the literature about the diet of these species the seabass dicentrarchus labrax and the sardine sardina pilchardus were considered independently in the model because of their ecological and cultural importance in the area together with the good quality of the data available in terms of abundance and sampling resolution hence the functional groups considered were sardine smelts seabass detritivorous zooplanktivorous omnivore piscivorous and zoobenthivorous fish see appendices a and b and garcía seoane et al 2016 for details on sampling methods 2 4 3 crustaceans three groups of crustaceans were considered in the model the first one comprising non mysidacean peracarids namely amphipods isopods cumaceans and tanaidaceans hereafter called aict group the second one accounting for 20 species of mysidaceans occuring at ria de aveiro and the third one including the decapods carcinus maenas and crangon crangon data on the biomass and productivity of the three groups of crustaceans were obtained from literature based on samples from ria de aveiro see appendix a section 1 for references while the consumption q was calculated using empirical equations appendix b 2 4 4 bivalves annelids and gastropods there are ten relevant species of bivalves described for ria de aveiro appendix a section 1 the biomass and productivity of these groups were obtained from literature based on samplings and experiments performed in ria de aveiro see appendix a section 1 and appendix b 2 4 5 cephalopods two cephalopod species were considered in our model the common octopus octopus vulgaris and the cuttlefish sepia officinalis since no data on the biomass of these species is available for ria de aveiro it was automatically adjusted by the software assuming a value of 0 95 for ee as recommended by christensen et al 2008 2 4 6 seagrass the dwarf eelgrass zostera noltei is an important macrophyte species occurring in temperate lagoons such as ria de aveiro azevedo et al 2013 biomass and productivity of z noltei in ria de aveiro were obtained by means of sampling performed at the area of study sousa a i unpublished data see appendix b for further details 2 4 7 halophytes the main salt marsh plants or halophytes occurring in ria de aveiro are spartina maritima a low marsh halophyte and juncus maritimus colonizing mid marshes their biomass and productivity were quantified as described in sousa et al 2017a see appendix b for details 2 4 8 zooplankton the zooplanktonic community at ria de aveiro is composed both by organisms whose life cycle is carried out entirely in the water column holoplankton and by the planktonic larvae of some invertebrates such as decapods bivalves or gastropods meroplankton data for the model on zooplankton was obtained from the literature using works carried out in ria de aveiro or other portuguese estuaries see appendices a section 1 and b 2 4 9 phytoplankton and microphytobenthos the model used average daily values of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos biomass obtained at ria de aveiro see appendix b for more details phytoplankton production was calculated from mean annual values obtained at ria de aveiro and published in the work of almeida et al 2002 while microphytobenthos production values were taken from the work of serôdio and catarino 2000 based on samples from the tagus estuary portugal 2 4 10 suspended particulate matter spm suspended particulate matter spm represents the materials in suspension of different origins found in the water of ria de aveiro appendix b shows the specific sampling methods to quantify spm used in this work 2 4 11 organic matter in the sediment sediment om sediments of estuaries and lagoons such as ria de aveiro are composed by organic and inorganic materials the organic matter in the sediment is used by different groups of detritivorous or sedimentivorous organisms which represent the basis of the diet of other higher trophic level consumers such as birds organic matter in the sediment was sampled and quantified as described in appendix b 2 4 12 halophytes litter the litter from the decomposition of halophytes senescent aboveground biomass is an important organic matter source constituting the food basis of many benthic invertebrates and contributing to the creation of new spm the mean annual production of j maritimus and s maritima were obtained from the work sousa et al 2017a and calculated as described in sousa et al 2010 2 4 13 fisheries ecopath models incorporate the effect of fisheries on ecosystems in the same manner that they consider top predators fisheries consume the biomass of their preys the target species while they are not predated by any other group two types of fisheries were considered in ria de aveiro the artisanal fleet and leisure fishery see appendix b for further details 2 5 detritus fate the term detritus corresponds to the organic matter om in decomposition deposited and accumulated in the sediments ecopath conceptual models should have at least one ecological compartment named as detritus when there is more than one sub compartment considered as detritus the contribution of each functional group to them needs to be assigned in the model of ria de aveiro three groups were classified as detritus suspended particulate matter spm the organic matter contained in the sediments sediments om and the halophytes litter the contribution of the different functional groups to each of these sub compartments of detritus is described in table 2 together with the export estimations out of the limits of ria de aveiro the values shown have been obtained from literature on ria de aveiro sousa et al 2017a b lopes et al 2008 2017 marques et al 2011 sousa a i unpublished data in general the non assimilated biomass of all functional groups was considered to be deposited and allocated to the sediments om group with exception of the zooplankton halophytes phytoplankton and microphytobenthos which were distributed into the detritus sub compartments as described in table 2 the dynamics of the detritus sub compartments and the exchanges of organic matter among them were also described based on the above cited literature in this regard we estimated that spm is transferred as sediments om by 40 remaining 10 in the form of spm martins et al 2009 and 50 being exported out of the system abrantes et al 2006 lopes et al 2008 in the case of sediments om we considered that 10 of this organic matter is resuspended to spm and that 90 remains as sediments om with no direct exports out of the system abrantes et al 2006 finally in the case of halophytes litter we assumed that 70 of this biomass is reverted annually to the sediments om remaining 30 as litter that decomposes very slowly lillebø unpublished data table 2 2 6 diet composition the diet composition of a given functional group is introduced in ecopath as the proportion of consumed biomass that each of the other groups represent in the diet of the group of reference in ecopath the diet composition of the functional groups is introduced as a diet matrix table 3 for ria de aveiro the diet matrix was constructed upon a literature search with approximately 40 of the papers based on data from portuguese estuarine systems see appendix a section 1 when the available diet information corresponded to only some of the species of a functional group the percentages of diet were weighted with the relative abundance of these species in the context of the functional group 2 7 analysis of mixed trophic impacts the analysis of mixed trophic impacts is a routine of ecopath based on the theoretical fundamentals of the leontief matrix in economy leontief 1951 this theory was applied to ecology by ulanowicz and puccia 1990 in a manner that the relationships between functional groups are seen as positive negative interactions causing positive negative variations on the biomass of the impacted group this method is useful to identify direct interactions between groups such as competition or predation but also indirect interactions such as those caused by trophic cascades or beneficial predation pace et al 1999 2 8 analysis of trophic levels and representation of a lindeman spine the structure of the trophic network of the model of ria de aveiro can be aggregated into trophic levels tls taking discrete values lindeman 1942 the trophic level of a given functional group is a dimensionless index and is calculated as a function of the trophic level and proportion of its preys t l j 1 i 1 n d c i j t l i being tlj the trophic level of prey j tli the trophic level of predator i and dcij the proportion of prey j on the diet of predator i this concept allows ranking the functional groups of the trophic food web according to their position in a theoretical trophic chain being that apex predators have the highest values and producers the lowest 1 the representation of the food web into discrete trophic levels and their energy fluxes known as the lindeman spine is carried out by aggregating the trophic fluxes of the different functional groups and considering their partial contribution in terms of biomass to the entire trophic level ecopath software incorporates a routine for the representation of lindeman spines reporting all the imports consumptions respirations net exports and exports to detritus for each functional group this routine also calculates the transport efficiency of energy between trophic levels through consumption 2 9 keystone index analysis the keystone index is a function of a functional group s biomass and its direct trophic impact the ecopath routine that analyzes the keystone index utilizes two methods power et al 1996 and libralato et al 2006 the first method considers a keystone species as having relatively low biomass but an important structuring role in food web function given the difficulty in assessing keystoneness though experimentation libralato et al 2006 developed a modeling approach combining mixed trophic impacts see above and the relative biomass of each group as a result the keystone index of a functional group is the ratio of the sum of its direct and indirect impacts on all other groups in the system over its biomass 2 10 other indices provided by ecopath ecological indices derived in ecopath allow the ria de aveiro model to be compared to other systems the total system throughput tst refers to the raw flow of energy through the different compartments of the ecosystem it is the sum of all the trophic flows generated by consumption respiration flows to detritus exports and imports this index is a measure of the size of the ecosystem in trophic terms ulanowicz 1986 the total primary production total biomass tpp tb represents the relationship between biomass production and its accumulation higher values of the ratio represent a low accumulation of biomass the total primary production total respiration tpp tr shows the importance of the production of biomass in terms of maintenance costs the omnivory index oi represents the average omnivory of the groups of the system and is a proxy for the complexity of the food web in a similar manner to the connectance index ci which is defined as the ratio between the number of trophic relationships and the total number of possible trophic relationships in the system the finn s cycling index fci is the proportion of the flows being recycled within the trophic network this index is used as a measure of the development and stress of a given ecosystem being that ecosystems high fci are more stable having higher resilience to disturbances on the other hand the finn s mean path length mpl is defined as the number of trophic levels that energy passes trough in the system before leaving it and is hence associated to the recycling of matter and energy the ascendancy a is an index related to the degree of development and maturity of an ecosystem and is intended to capture the ability of a given ecosystem to prevail against disturbances in a similar manner than the system overhead o odum 1969 christensen and pauly 1992 3 results 3 1 pedigree and balancing of the model the functioning of ria de aveiro was represented by means of an ecopath model with 26 functional groups 1 filter feeding birds 2 waders 3 piscivorous birds 4 sardine 5 smelts 6 seabass 7 detritiorous fish 8 zooplanktivorous fish 9 omnivorous fish 10 piscivorous fish 11 zoobenthivorous fish 12 aict 13 mysidaceans 14 decapods 15 bivalves 16 cephalopods 17 annelids 18 gastropods 19 zooplankton 20 seagrass 21 halophytes 22 phytoplankton 23 microphytobenthos 24 spm 25 sediments om 26 halophytes litter and three different fisheries using data referring to the period between 2004 and 2014 given the specificity of the data used the estimated pedigree for the model was high 0 663 before balancing the model the prebal diagnostics methods section 2 3 were checked appendix a section 2 determining the steps to be given during balancing of the model after data input in the software the groups showing ee higher than 1 were omnivorous piscivorous zooplanktivorous and zoobenthivorous fish aict annelids zooplankton microphytobenthos and the spm q b values of groups with p q higher than 1 seabass and detritivorous fish were firstly re calculated assuming that p q 0 3 then p b was increased for zooplanktivorous omnivorous and zoobenthivorous fish and annelids while q b was increased for sardine and zooplanktivorous omnivorous piscivorous and zoobenthivorous fish the predation over the groups suffering a high predatory pressure mainly zoobenthivorous fish annelids and the aict group was lowered by modifying the diet matrix on the other hand landings of zoobenthivorous fish by the artisanal fleet and landings of omnivorous fish by the leisure fishery were lowered by 50 as they were identified as high pressures by the software finally biomass values the data with the highest pedigree in the model were slightly augmented for zooplanktivorous and zoobenthivorous fish zooplankton and microphytobenthos after model balancing the prebal diagnostics were checked again fig 2 the biomass span of the ecosystem ranged about 5 orders of magnitude fig 2a while a possible underestimation of the biomass of piscivorous fish aict mysidaceans zooplankton and microphytobenthos was detected the p b of piscivorous birds and the aict group were also found to be probably underestimated fig 2b d while the q b of mysidacenas could have been overestimated fig 2c and d 3 2 analysis of the functional groups table 1 summarizes the basic output of ecopath the software adjusted automatically the biomass of cephalopods estimating a value of 3 62 t km 2 ecotrophic efficiencies were low for fish with exception of zooplanktivorous 0 87 omnivorous 0 90 and zoobenthivorous fish 0 98 table 1 birds on the other hand had 0 00 ee since no predation on them was considered in the model for the phytoplankton the estimated ee was 0 5 and for the zooplankton 0 95 these estimates mean that only half of the production of phytoplankton is predated within the system which could be caused by natural mortalities driven by tidal flows see discussion on the other hand the high ee indicates that the production of zooplankton is important to sustain the food web of ria de aveiro being consumed almost entirely by secondary consumers the accumulation of biomass of the sub compartments of detritus resulted to be high table 1 especially for the sediments om and halophytes litter while exploitation rates were specially high for omnivorous and zoobenthivorous fish and cephalopods furthermore the main flows to detritus were originated by primary producers such as halophytes and microphytobentos being also high for primary consumers such as gastropods or annelids finally the respiration assimilation index calculated by the software was found to be higher for the functional groups with higher trophic level see table 1 fig 3 shows the balanced food web model of ria de aveiro in terms of biomass the system is clearly dominated by primary producers halophytes and seagrass followed by detritus the different groups of invertebrates are an important linkage between organic sediments and higher predators representing the most important flow of biomass through the ecosystem the high biomass of halophytes and seagrass in comparison to the detritus sub compartments seems to be weakly connected to the rest of the system in trophic terms table 3 additionally in order to assess the importance of the detritus and producers compartments on the functioning of the system their contribution to the tst was evaluated obtaining that 47 82 of the tst is attributed to the different compartments of producers and 33 94 to the sub compartments of sediments 3 3 analysis of mixed trophic impacts according to the analysis of mixed trophic impacts fig 4 the artisanal fleet is the fishery exerting the most important influence in the ecosystem especially on detritivorous fish zoobenthivorous fish and cephalopods negative impacts and on zooplanktivorous fish and decapods positive impacts the leisure fishery on the other hand only exerts negative impacts especially on omnivorous fish and the seabass considering the different functional groups bivalves aict gastropods decapods and phytoplankton seem to have strong trophic influence on the whole system while the most negative impact is exerted by piscivorous birds specially on piscivirous fish sardines and smelts finally results also show that increments on the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton would have strong positive influence on the rest of the food web 3 4 analysis of trophic levels and representation of a lindeman spine ecopath ranked the different functional groups into four trophic levels tls table 1 where 1 was assigned to primary producers and detritus the higher values of tl obtained in the model were for piscivorous fish 3 70 piscivorous birds 3 63 and the seabass 3 17 within the fish the functional group with the lowest tl were detritivorous fish 2 46 followed by the sardine 2 70 on the other hand the trophic aggregation routine of ecopath assembled the 26 functional groups into four effective trophic levels fig 5 as commented above the largest biomass compartment of biomass of the ecosystem corresponds to the primary producers while the highest flow occurs from the different trophic levels to the detritus this flow however seems to be subsequently balanced by the huge transference of biomass from the sediments to primary consumers and through exports out of the system fig 5 the respiration of consumers 8 60 of the tst seems to be important for regulating the functioning of the system fig 5 being specially intense for the compartment of primary consumers 3 5 keystone analysis the keystone indices of libralato et al 2006 and power et al 1996 coincided showing the relevance of piscivorous birds detritivorous fish and zooplankton on the functioning of the system of ria de aveiro fig 6 the method of libralato et al 2006 also identified the groups of phytoplankton and bivalves as important for the ecosystem while the method of power gave more importance to the groups of piscivorous and omnivorous fish 3 6 ecosystem indicators the system functioning with the size of its main flows system throughput and production is summarized in table 4 together with a comparison with other similar systems see methods the total system throughput tst of the ecosystem of ria de aveiro was 24 544 t km 2 year 1 corresponding 19 15 to the sum of all consumption 2 74 to the sum of all exports 8 60 to the sum of all respiratory flows and 69 50 to the sum of all flows into detritus the value of tpp tr and tpp tb ratios were 5 49 and 0 88 respectively table 4 the net primary production calculated for ria de aveiro on the other hand was relatively low 11 605 t km 2 year 1 table 4 while the value of the ratio between total biomass and tst tb tst was high probably driven by the high total biomass excluding detritus of the system 13 201 t km 2 year 1 which is the highest of the compared values in table 4 the connectance index and the system omnivory index for ria de aveiro resulted to be relatively low table 4 while the finn s cycling index estimated for the system was 5 31 of the total throughput lowest in the comparison and the mean path length 8 81 highest in the comparison the ascendancy value for the system was estimated in 40 72 and the overhead 59 28 table 4 finally the mean trophic level of the catch by fisheries was 2 20 4 discussion this work represents the first trophic model for the functioning of the sub and intertidal parts of ria de aveiro one of the most important wetlands of portugal integrating data from previous works on the biology and ecology of organisms from this system with specific samplings made for this purpose the specificity of the data explains the few adjustments needed to balance the model and its high pedigree 0 663 which is at the upper part of the range of published ecopath models between 0 164 and 0 676 morissette 2007 the reliability of the data allows to obtain solid conclusions on the functioning of the system and establish comparisons with similar ecosystems such as ria formosa south portugal gamito and erzini 2005 the celestún coastal lagoon méxico vega cendejas and arreguín sánchez 2001 and the chiku lagoon taixan lin et al 1999 table 4 hence ria de aveiro is portrayed as a highly productive system supporting a massive biomass of primary producers and detritus and a high tst 24 544 t km 2 year 1 precisely the high biomass contained within the system drives some of the ecological indicators analysed such as the relationship between primary productivity and biomass tpp tb making it the lowest of the systems compared in table 4 interestingly the flow of organic matter through the system originated in the compartment of detritus the detritus path is high 44 23 of the tst in comparison to the producers path 55 77 nevertheless the percentage of tst captured by to the detritus path is lower in the systems of comparison meaning that the storage of organic matter in the sub compartments of the detritus is more rapidly mobilized through the food web in ria de aveiro than in the other systems the combination of both ecosystem features high total biomass and the relevance of the detritus path is probably explained by the high rate at which the extensive marsh areas of ria de aveiro contribute to the detritus in the form of halophytes litter which is consequently decomposed into sediments om and spm and finally consumed by the groups of sedimentivores and depositivores or exported out of the system to understand the state of maturity of the ria de aveiro ecosystem other ecological indicators need to be considered the gross production community respiration tpp tr ratio was high 5 49 in comparison to the other systems table 4 which is driven by the high total primary production of the system and the costs of maintenance in terms of respiration pointing to a higher autotrophy than heterotrophy of the system of ria de aveiro on the other hand however the total primary production total biomass tpp tb ratio was the lowest of the reference values 0 879 table 4 which is explained by the high total biomass of the system according to odum 1969 immature ecosystems are expected to show tpp tr values greater or less than 1 as is the case for ria de aveiro and high tpp tb values in opposition to the value found for ria de aveiro the massive biomass captured in the primary producers compartment of ria de aveiro seems to explain the puzzling relationship between these ratios masking the real meaning of these indicators as measures of maturity hence to elucidate if ria de aveiro is in an advanced state of succession or not other indicators need to be taken into account the connectance index ci indicates the number of actual trophic links with the number of possible links among functional groups gardner and ashby 1970 and it is a measure of the complexity of the food web considered to reach higher values as ecosystems mature odum 1969 for ria de aveiro the ci estimated was 0 23 which is quite low compared to other similar ecosystems table 4 the specialization of the diets of organisms of ria de aveiro either as detritus or as plankton consumers could be the cause of this low value similarly the omnivory index oi indicates the degree of specialization of the functional groups of the ecosystem for ria de aveiro the estimated oi was 0 098 similar to that of the ria formosa and lower than for ría celestún table 4 indicating that the different groups are trophically specialized as mentioned before given that these indices are related to the complexity of the trophic relationships within ecosystems they use to be also considered as a measure of the resilience of ecosystems to changes in the environment with intricate food web ecosystems more resistant to variations in this regard the low values obtained for ria de aveiro suggest a low performance and hence that its resilience to environmental changes could not be as high as expected the system overhead is also viewed as a measure of ecosystem stability and resilience the value obtained 59 28 is elevated suggesting an ecosystem with redundant pathways and weakly specialized resilient to environmental changes through the flexibility of the food web to confirm this however the internal overhead or internal redundancy should be also considered kaufman and borrett 2010 in this case for ria de aveiro it was lower 48 74 indicating that the redundancy of the food web could not be as high as suggested by the total overhead and hence that ria de aveiro is moderately specialized in trophic terms other parameters provided by ecopath to understand the complexity of the system are the connectivity and omnivory indices albeit the evidence for a relationship between system developmental stage and connectivity seems inconclusive christensen 1995 there is an optimum of connectivity related to the size of the system given that both values are relatively low for ria de aveiro it seems that the system is in an intermediate or low state of maturity ria de aveiro is a coastal lagoon with four main channels and many secondary channels communicated with the sea by a single inlet this inlet was created in the 16th century by the construction of littoral barriers aiming at controlling tidal force and facilitating the desiccation of the area in order to avoid the spread of illness the cessation of human activities would probably result in the collapse of the system of channels and ria de aveiro would become isolated from the sea which means that it depends on human activity to keep its former shape and functioning on the other hand human control impedes the ecosystem to evolve towards a more mature state of ecological succession which explains the low values obtained for the indices related to the maturity and complexity of the system ria de aveiro is known to act as a nursery ground for some marine fish populations such as sardine seabass or smelts gordo 1989 vasconcelos et al 2010 2011 meaning that the bulk of their productivity is not consumed within the system and explaining the low ee calculated by ecopath for different fish groups table 1 on the other hand the high rate at which the non consumed biomass of the groups of primary producers see above and primary consumers such as mysidaceans or gastropods is transferred to the detritus fig 5 explains their low ee table 1 the ee value estimated for phytoplankton indicates that only half of its production is consumed within the system which is on the other hand in agreement with the results from other similar ecosystems e g gamito and erzini 2005 lin et al 1999 as it has been verified in ria de aveiro for species of the diatom pseudo nitzschia churro et al 2009 the viability of phytoplankton cells can be reduced as it is transported along the channels by tidal forcing and face the decrease in salinity many of these non viable cells are likely to get trapped in the sediment of the very shallow lateral areas of the inner reaches of the channels over which the water spreads in a relatively thin layer during flood tide and from which it recedes during ebb tide in consequence phytoplankton is subjected to an elevated natural mortality in these systems causing many cells to be lost to the sediment and in consequence not available for grazing by zooplankton explaining their low ee on the other hand the trophic level calculated by ecopath for the different functional groups were in general low table 1 but in agreement with other previous works from ria de aveiro e g coelho et al 2013 two types of fishery were incorporated into the model artisanal whose captures have to be sold at the auction fishing market of aveiro and leisure fishing whose captures are not controlled directly but by limiting the number of licenses and establishing fishing quotas per fishermen per day fishing induced mortalities of commercially exploited species were high for omnivorous mainly diplodus spp and zoobenthivorous fish comprising eels a traditional dish in aveiro and some appreciated flatfish and cephalopods octopus and cuttlefish although in this case the high fishing mortality observed is largely influenced by the high ee assumed to construct the model as shown in the mixed trophic impact analysis fig 4 fisheries exerted negative impacts on the different functional groups albeit zooplanktivorous fish and decapods could be slightly favoured by the capture of their predators in addition given that the productivity of some exploited groups needed to be increased to balance the model see methods there are enough evidences to believe that human exploitation rate is relevant in shaping the food web structure of ria de aveiro requiring hence a determined control of illegal extraction activities in the area together with a monitoring of the populations of top predators exerting negative impacts on the rest of groups specially piscivorous birds fig 4 the trophic aggregation routine of ecopath aggregated the functional groups of the system into four trophic levels represented in the lindeman spine fig 5 most of the biomass of the ecosystem is concentrated in the producers and detritus compartments 95 9 and 2 1 respectively while transfer efficiencies are low especially in the lower trophic levels the transference of biomass to the detritus sum of all flows to the detritus in table 4 was high representing 69 47 of tst regarding the mixed trophic impact analysis fig 4 fisheries pressure is overall negative for the system albeit some indirect benefits in some groups could happen by capturing their direct predators e g zooplanktivorous fish and decapods the detritus group is having a positive trophic effect in almost all the other groups since it is the base for the feeding of most of the invertebrates sustaining the rest of the trophic web the same can be observed for phyto and zooplankton an increase in the biomass of these groups would be beneficial for most of the functional groups but especially for zooplanktivorous fish and sardine probably a variation in the proportions of biomass of the different functional groups of fish would change the trophic preferences of their consumers the diets of the different groups in ecopath however are fixed and independent on the abundance of their preys which restricts further conclusions on this regard the corollary of this work is that ria de aveiro presents a detritus dominated food web with most of the biomass allocated in the compartment of primary producers the system seems to be in an intermediate state of maturity and the complexity of the food web is not at its highest degree perhaps because of a relative specialization of the functional groups in trophic terms this specialization however could reduce the resilience of the ecosystem making it vulnerable to structural or environmental changes the two types of fishery occurring at the ria de aveiro artisanal and leisure exert a considerable pressure on specific groups within the ecosystem in conclusion ria de aveiro seems to be a specialized ecosystem in an intermediate level of maturity with reduced resilience a state that could be in subtle equilibrium and would depend on human activities to keep its current idiosyncrasy we have verified that small changes in the biomass of some fundamental functional groups could have consequences in the short term for the functioning of the system so we strongly recommend to monitor the populations of top predators and a more determined control of illegal extraction activities in the area acknowledgements j bueno pardo was funded by a postdoctoral fellowship

25293,a high quality data collection has been carried out between 2004 and 2014 to develop the first trophic ecopath model for the functioning of the sub and intertidal zones of ria de aveiro this schematic representation allows the characterization of the most important compartments of biomass and flows of energy representing the functioning of the ecosystem and can be used in the fields of decision making and management the model considered 26 functional groups from primary producers to top predators and two different fisheries artisanal and leisure and showed that ria de aveiro is a dynamic ecosystem dominated by a high biomass of primary producers where the transference of energy among compartments is to a large extent accomplished through the detritus path the model also provides several ecological indicators on the state of maturity of the ecosystem showing that ria de aveiro is in an intermediate state of maturity with a relatively complex food web and resilience to environmental changes as discussed this state of maturity is probably determined by human action pervading the system to advance in the expectable ecological succession of a coastal lagoon these aspects together with indicators of elevated fishing pressure and predation within the system underline the necessity of controlling illegal extraction activities and monitoring the biomass of the main functional groups of the system especially top predators in order to keep the functioning of the ecosystem of ria de aveiro in its current condition keywords coastal lagoon ecopath food web model ecosystem functioning environmental management tool 1 introduction coastal lagoons are among the most productive aquatic ecosystems supporting a large reservoir of organic matter and a large diversity of habitats that offer optimal niches for numerous aquatic species villanueva et al 2006 ria de aveiro is a shallow multi branch lagunar system situated in the north west coast of portugal 40 38 n 08 45 w fig 1 it comprises an area between 66 and 83 km2 in low and high spring tides respectively and is connected to the ocean by a single inlet valentim et al 2013 the climate of the region is maritime temperate with seasonal strong rains and mild temperatures during the whole year the hydrology of ria de aveiro is essentially dominated by tidal forcing with the vouga and antuã rivers accounting for about 80 of the freshwater discharge into the lagoon average flows between 2 29 m3 s 1 dias et al 1999 tides are semidiurnal with an average range of 2 1 m and varying between 1 3 m in extreme neap and spring conditions dias et al 2000 from the conservationist point of view ria de aveiro is the most important coastal system of portugal hosting very diverse biotopes with biological importance such as salt marshes sousa et al 2017a seagrass meadows of zostera noltei azevedo et al 2013 sousa et al 2017b and dune systems lopes et al 2007 the lagoon constitutes also an important stopover and wintering site for migrating birds and hosts breeding populations of emblematic species such as the little tern sternula albifrons and the kentish plover charadrius alexandrinus castro et

diversity of human modified habitats is high with salt production areas extensive aquaculture ponds and small agriculture properties delimited by hedgerows the industrial activity in the area is also high being the port of aveiro one of the most important ports of portugal with movements of 4 65 million tones of goods in 2015 instituto nacional de estatística de portugal 2016 the existence of a mercury cell chlor alkali plant between 1950 and 1994 caused important mercury pollution problems in the 2 km2 of the laranjo inner basin that persisted for many years pereira et al 2009 lopes et al 2014 nevertheless mercury contamination in this area and subsequent problems are currently minimized ria de aveiro also provides important ecosystem services lillebø et al 2015 and sousa et al 2016

the stocks and flows of energy and materials and the roles played by primary producers consumers and decomposers science for environment policy 2015 of ria de aveiro as a whole the ecosystem approach is a new direction in fisheries management essentially reversing the order of priorities to start with the ecosystem rather than single species assessments link 2005 gascuel et al 2014 bourdaud et al 2016 in this regard the inter specific interactions within the ecosystem the effects of environmental changes or the impacts of fisheries are among the critical factors that should be integrated in the formulation of management strategies cheung et al 2010 pereira et al 2010 pinsky and fogarty 2012 the mass balanced model ecopath christensen et al 2008 is presently the most used approach to analyze and describe food webs identify key groups of species and compare the functioning of ecosystems with similar characteristics heymans et al 2014 the main goal of this work is to model the trophic web structure of the subtidal and intertidal areas of ria de aveiro considering different functional groups of organisms i e groups of species with similar ecological role and the impact of the different kind of fisheries occurring at the zone using data collected between 2004 and 2014 this study constitutes the first attempt to describe the balanced functioning of ria de aveiro allowing to identify the most important biological groups in terms of abundance and trophic relationships and establish a reference point for comparisons with future states of ria de aveiro or other similar coastal lagoons 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling approach the food web model of ria de aveiro was constructed using the software ecopath 6 4 4 christensen et al 2008 ecopath builds a static balanced ecosystem model considering functional groups as fundamental units these functional groups comprise one or more species sharing similar population dynamics and ecological function the dynamics of each functional group of the model are described by two basic equations the first one describing the production of each group as a function of different components christensen and pauly 1992 p b i b i y i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i e i b a i p b i b i 1 e e i where bi and bj are the biomass eg kg km 2 of prey and predator respectively p b i is the production biomass ratio y 1 or total mortality in steady state conditions allen 1971 eei is the ecotrophic efficiency defined as the ratio between flow of energy out and into each group or the proportion of the production that is used in the ecosystem by predation q b j is the food consumption per biomass unit of j y 1 dc i j is the proportion of every prey i in the stomach content of predator j yi are the exports from fishing catches eg kg km 2 y 1 ei are other exports eg kg km 2 y 1 and bai is the biomass accumulation rate for i eg kg km 2 y 1 for the construction of any ecopath model at least three of these four basic input variables are required for each functional group i b p b q b and ee once all the parameters are known the model balances the inputs and outputs of each functional group using its second fundamental equation q i p i r i u i where qi is the consumption eg kg of i on preys from the system or from outside in the form of imports pi is the production of i eg kg that must be consumed by its predators or exported out of the system or converted into detritus ri is the respiration of i eg kg and ui is the non assimilated food by i eg kg 2 2 pedigree index the pedigree index is used in ecopath to rank the level of uncertainty of the values incorporated into the models we assigned different levels to the data considering whether they were obtained from samples or experiments at ria de aveiro based on empirical equations or taken from ecopath models of similar ecosystems the pedigree assigned to each input value of the model was considered during the balancing of the model see below with re adjustments being more likely to the values with low pedigree than the values with high pedigree 2 3 balancing the model once the input data for the model were collected appendix a section 1 the pre balance prebal diagnostics described in link 2010 were tested these diagnostics based on general ecological principles include some rules of thumb such as the range of biomass considered the slopes of the biomass ratios of the functional groups ordered by trophic level or the expected ranges of vital rates and can be used to identify groups with disparate values once the prebal diagnostics were verified predation mortality rates and fleet fishing mortality rates under the output mortality rates tab in the ecopath software were checked to assess the quality of the data on fishing rates and on dietary composition hence after adjusting the causes of these mortalities fishing pressure or predation the model was balanced following the guidelines presented in the work of heymans et al 2016 in a top down strategy and considering their pedigree see section 2 5 to hierarchically adjust them finally the net food conversion efficiencies p q respiration assimilation r a and the production respiration p r ratios were checked to be within the expected theoretical ranges while the unused consumption u q of the groups of detritivore and suspensivore invertebrates was considered to be 0 4 instead of 0 2 as suggested by christensen et al 2008 2 4 functional groups and input parameters twenty six functional groups were considered to build the food web model of ria de aveiro the ecological role taxonomic e g decapods annelids etc trophic e g piscivorous and omnivorous fish and economic or cultural aspects seabass sardine etc were used in descending priority to classify species into the different functional groups see appendix a section 1 for species composition of each functional group data sources for this model include published and unpublished data obtained in the period between 2004 and 2014 appendix a section 1 where published data were used the bibliographic sources of information were preferentially based on works performed at ria de aveiro portugal or the iberian peninsula appendix a section 1 shows the raw data gathered to construct the model while table 1 summarizes the information after model balancing the description of the functional groups is shown below but see appendix b for specific methodological aspects necessary to understand the acquisition of field data fig 1 shows the sampling stations where data were collected at ria de aveiro 2 4 1 birds three functional groups of birds were considered in this study filter feeding waders and piscivorous birds the biomass of each group was estimated by visual census while consumption was estimated using empirical equations see appendix b both productivity values and the diet of each group were obtained from a literature search based on 28 papers of which 20 concern studies carried out in the iberian peninsula appendix a section 1 2 4 2 fish eight functional groups of fish were created based on the feeding guilds classification of elliott et al 2007 the information available in fishbase froese and pauly 2015 was used to classify the species according to the guilds after exploring the literature about the diet of these species the seabass dicentrarchus labrax and the sardine sardina pilchardus were considered independently in the model because of their ecological and cultural importance in the area together with the good quality of the data available in terms of abundance and sampling resolution hence the functional groups considered were sardine smelts seabass detritivorous zooplanktivorous omnivore piscivorous and zoobenthivorous fish see appendices a and b and garcía seoane et al 2016 for details on sampling methods 2 4 3 crustaceans three groups of crustaceans were considered in the model the first one comprising non mysidacean peracarids namely amphipods isopods cumaceans and tanaidaceans hereafter called aict group the second one accounting for 20 species of mysidaceans occuring at ria de aveiro and the third one including the decapods carcinus maenas and crangon crangon data on the biomass and productivity of the three groups of crustaceans were obtained from literature based on samples from ria de aveiro see appendix a section 1 for references while the consumption q was calculated using empirical equations appendix b 2 4 4 bivalves annelids and gastropods there are ten relevant species of bivalves described for ria de aveiro appendix a section 1 the biomass and productivity of these groups were obtained from literature based on samplings and experiments performed in ria de aveiro see appendix a section 1 and appendix b 2 4 5 cephalopods two cephalopod species were considered in our model the common octopus octopus vulgaris and the cuttlefish sepia officinalis since no data on the biomass of these species is available for ria de aveiro it was automatically adjusted by the software assuming a value of 0 95 for ee as recommended by christensen et al 2008 2 4 6 seagrass the dwarf eelgrass zostera noltei is an important macrophyte species occurring in temperate lagoons such as ria de aveiro azevedo et al 2013 biomass and productivity of z noltei in ria de aveiro were obtained by means of sampling performed at the area of study sousa a i unpublished data see appendix b for further details 2 4 7 halophytes the main salt marsh plants or halophytes occurring in ria de aveiro are spartina maritima a low marsh halophyte and juncus maritimus colonizing mid marshes their biomass and productivity were quantified as described in sousa et al 2017a see appendix b for details 2 4 8 zooplankton the zooplanktonic community at ria de aveiro is composed both by organisms whose life cycle is carried out entirely in the water column holoplankton and by the planktonic larvae of some invertebrates such as decapods bivalves or gastropods meroplankton data for the model on zooplankton was obtained from the literature using works carried out in ria de aveiro or other portuguese estuaries see appendices a section 1 and b 2 4 9 phytoplankton and microphytobenthos the model used average daily values of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos biomass obtained at ria de aveiro see appendix b for more details phytoplankton production was calculated from mean annual values obtained at ria de aveiro and published in the work of almeida et al 2002 while microphytobenthos production values were taken from the work of serôdio and catarino 2000 based on samples from the tagus estuary portugal 2 4 10 suspended particulate matter spm suspended particulate matter spm represents the materials in suspension of different origins found in the water of ria de aveiro appendix b shows the specific sampling methods to quantify spm used in this work 2 4 11 organic matter in the sediment sediment om sediments of estuaries and lagoons such as ria de aveiro are composed by organic and inorganic materials the organic matter in the sediment is used by different groups of detritivorous or sedimentivorous organisms which represent the basis of the diet of other higher trophic level consumers such as birds organic matter in the sediment was sampled and quantified as described in appendix b 2 4 12 halophytes litter the litter from the decomposition of halophytes senescent aboveground biomass is an important organic matter source constituting the food basis of many benthic invertebrates and contributing to the creation of new spm the mean annual production of j maritimus and s maritima were obtained from the work sousa et al 2017a and calculated as described in sousa et al 2010 2 4 13 fisheries ecopath models incorporate the effect of fisheries on ecosystems in the same manner that they consider top predators fisheries consume the biomass of their preys the target species while they are not predated by any other group two types of fisheries were considered in ria de aveiro the artisanal fleet and leisure fishery see appendix b for further details 2 5 detritus fate the term detritus corresponds to the organic matter om in decomposition deposited and accumulated in the sediments ecopath conceptual models should have at least one ecological compartment named as detritus when there is more than one sub compartment considered as detritus the contribution of each functional group to them needs to be assigned in the model of ria de aveiro three groups were classified as detritus suspended particulate matter spm the organic matter contained in the sediments sediments om and the halophytes litter the contribution of the different functional groups to each of these sub compartments of detritus is described in table 2 together with the export estimations out of the limits of ria de aveiro the values shown have been obtained from literature on ria de aveiro sousa et al 2017a b lopes et al 2008 2017 marques et al 2011 sousa a i unpublished data in general the non assimilated biomass of all functional groups was considered to be deposited and allocated to the sediments om group with exception of the zooplankton halophytes phytoplankton and microphytobenthos which were distributed into the detritus sub compartments as described in table 2 the dynamics of the detritus sub compartments and the exchanges of organic matter among them were also described based on the above cited literature in this regard we estimated that spm is transferred as sediments om by 40 remaining 10 in the form of spm martins et al 2009 and 50 being exported out of the system abrantes et al 2006 lopes et al 2008 in the case of sediments om we considered that 10 of this organic matter is resuspended to spm and that 90 remains as sediments om with no direct exports out of the system abrantes et al 2006 finally in the case of halophytes litter we assumed that 70 of this biomass is reverted annually to the sediments om remaining 30 as litter that decomposes very slowly lillebø unpublished data table 2 2 6 diet composition the diet composition of a given functional group is introduced in ecopath as the proportion of consumed biomass that each of the other groups represent in the diet of the group of reference in ecopath the diet composition of the functional groups is introduced as a diet matrix table 3 for ria de aveiro the diet matrix was constructed upon a literature search with approximately 40 of the papers based on data from portuguese estuarine systems see appendix a section 1 when the available diet information corresponded to only some of the species of a functional group the percentages of diet were weighted with the relative abundance of these species in the context of the functional group 2 7 analysis of mixed trophic impacts the analysis of mixed trophic impacts is a routine of ecopath based on the theoretical fundamentals of the leontief matrix in economy leontief 1951 this theory was applied to ecology by ulanowicz and puccia 1990 in a manner that the relationships between functional groups are seen as positive negative interactions causing positive negative variations on the biomass of the impacted group this method is useful to identify direct interactions between groups such as competition or predation but also indirect interactions such as those caused by trophic cascades or beneficial predation pace et al 1999 2 8 analysis of trophic levels and representation of a lindeman spine the structure of the trophic network of the model of ria de aveiro can be aggregated into trophic levels tls taking discrete values lindeman 1942 the trophic level of a given functional group is a dimensionless index and is calculated as a function of the trophic level and proportion of its preys t l j 1 i 1 n d c i j t l i being tlj the trophic level of prey j tli the trophic level of predator i and dcij the proportion of prey j on the diet of predator i this concept allows ranking the functional groups of the trophic food web according to their position in a theoretical trophic chain being that apex predators have the highest values and producers the lowest 1 the representation of the food web into discrete trophic levels and their energy fluxes known as the lindeman spine is carried out by aggregating the trophic fluxes of the different functional groups and considering their partial contribution in terms of biomass to the entire trophic level ecopath software incorporates a routine for the representation of lindeman spines reporting all the imports consumptions respirations net exports and exports to detritus for each functional group this routine also calculates the transport efficiency of energy between trophic levels through consumption 2 9 keystone index analysis the keystone index is a function of a functional group s biomass and its direct trophic impact the ecopath routine that analyzes the keystone index utilizes two methods power et al 1996 and libralato et al 2006 the first method considers a keystone species as having relatively low biomass but an important structuring role in food web function given the difficulty in assessing keystoneness though experimentation libralato et al 2006 developed a modeling approach combining mixed trophic impacts see above and the relative biomass of each group as a result the keystone index of a functional group is the ratio of the sum of its direct and indirect impacts on all other groups in the system over its biomass 2 10 other indices provided by ecopath ecological indices derived in ecopath allow the ria de aveiro model to be compared to other systems the total system throughput tst refers to the raw flow of energy through the different compartments of the ecosystem it is the sum of all the trophic flows generated by consumption respiration flows to detritus exports and imports this index is a measure of the size of the ecosystem in trophic terms ulanowicz 1986 the total primary production total biomass tpp tb represents the relationship between biomass production and its accumulation higher values of the ratio represent a low accumulation of biomass the total primary production total respiration tpp tr shows the importance of the production of biomass in terms of maintenance costs the omnivory index oi represents the average omnivory of the groups of the system and is a proxy for the complexity of the food web in a similar manner to the connectance index ci which is defined as the ratio between the number of trophic relationships and the total number of possible trophic relationships in the system the finn s cycling index fci is the proportion of the flows being recycled within the trophic network this index is used as a measure of the development and stress of a given ecosystem being that ecosystems high fci are more stable having higher resilience to disturbances on the other hand the finn s mean path length mpl is defined as the number of trophic levels that energy passes trough in the system before leaving it and is hence associated to the recycling of matter and energy the ascendancy a is an index related to the degree of development and maturity of an ecosystem and is intended to capture the ability of a given ecosystem to prevail against disturbances in a similar manner than the system overhead o odum 1969 christensen and pauly 1992 3 results 3 1 pedigree and balancing of the model the functioning of ria de aveiro was represented by means of an ecopath model

zoobenthivorous fish 12 aict 13 mysidaceans 14 decapods 15 bivalves 16 cephalopods 17 annelids 18 gastropods 19 zooplankton 20 seagrass 21 halophytes 22 phytoplankton 23 microphytobenthos 24 spm 25 sediments om 26 halophytes litter and three different fisheries using data referring to the period between 2004 and 2014 given the specificity of the data used the estimated pedigree for the model was high 0 663 before balancing the model the prebal diagnostics methods section 2 3 were checked appendix a section 2 determining the steps to be given during balancing of the model after data input in the software the groups showing ee higher than 1 were omnivorous piscivorous zooplanktivorous and zoobenthivorous fish aict annelids zooplankton microphytobenthos and the spm q b values of groups with p q higher than 1 seabass and detritivorous fish were firstly re calculated assuming that p q 0 3 then p b was increased for zooplanktivorous omnivorous and zoobenthivorous fish and annelids while q b was increased for sardine and zooplanktivorous omnivorous piscivorous and zoobenthivorous fish the predation over the groups suffering a high predatory pressure mainly zoobenthivorous fish annelids and the aict group was lowered by modifying the diet matrix on the other hand landings of zoobenthivorous fish by the artisanal fleet and landings of omnivorous fish by the leisure fishery were lowered by 50 as they were identified as high pressures by the software finally biomass values the data with the highest pedigree in the model were slightly augmented for zooplanktivorous and zoobenthivorous fish zooplankton and microphytobenthos after model balancing the prebal diagnostics were checked again fig 2 the biomass span of the ecosystem ranged about 5 orders of magnitude fig 2a while a possible underestimation of the biomass of piscivorous fish aict mysidaceans zooplankton and microphytobenthos was detected the p b of piscivorous birds and the aict group were also found to be probably underestimated fig 2b d while the q b of mysidacenas could have been overestimated fig 2c and d 3 2 analysis of the functional groups table 1 summarizes the basic output of ecopath the software adjusted automatically the biomass of cephalopods estimating a value of 3 62 t km 2 ecotrophic efficiencies were low for fish with exception of zooplanktivorous 0 87 omnivorous 0 90 and zoobenthivorous fish 0 98 table 1 birds on the other hand had 0 00 ee since no predation on them was considered in the model for the phytoplankton the estimated ee was 0 5 and for the zooplankton 0 95 these estimates mean that only half of the production of phytoplankton is predated within the system which could be caused by natural mortalities driven by tidal flows see discussion on the other hand the high ee indicates that the production of zooplankton is important to sustain the food web of ria de aveiro being consumed almost entirely by secondary consumers the accumulation of biomass of the sub compartments of detritus resulted to be high table 1 especially for the sediments om and halophytes litter while exploitation rates were specially high for omnivorous and zoobenthivorous fish and cephalopods furthermore the main flows to detritus were originated by primary producers such as halophytes and microphytobentos being also high for primary consumers such as gastropods or annelids finally the respiration assimilation index calculated by the software was found to be higher for the functional groups with higher trophic level see table 1 fig 3 shows the balanced food web model of ria de aveiro in terms of biomass the system is clearly dominated by primary producers halophytes and seagrass followed by detritus the different groups of invertebrates are an important linkage between organic sediments and higher predators representing the most important flow of biomass through the ecosystem the high biomass of halophytes and seagrass in comparison to the detritus sub compartments seems to be weakly connected to the rest of the system in trophic terms table 3 additionally in order to assess the importance of the detritus and producers compartments on the functioning of the system their contribution to the tst was evaluated obtaining that 47 82 of the tst is attributed to the different compartments of producers and 33 94 to the sub compartments of sediments 3 3 analysis of mixed trophic impacts according to the analysis of mixed trophic impacts fig 4 the artisanal fleet is the fishery exerting the most important influence in the ecosystem especially on detritivorous fish zoobenthivorous fish and cephalopods negative impacts and on zooplanktivorous fish and decapods positive impacts the leisure fishery on the other hand only exerts negative impacts especially on omnivorous fish and the seabass considering the different functional groups bivalves aict gastropods decapods and phytoplankton seem to have strong trophic influence on the whole system while the most negative impact is exerted by piscivorous birds specially on piscivirous fish sardines and smelts finally results also show that increments on the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton would have strong positive influence on the rest of the food web 3 4 analysis of trophic levels and representation of a lindeman spine ecopath ranked the different functional groups into four trophic levels tls table 1 where 1 was assigned to primary producers and detritus the higher values of tl obtained in the model were for piscivorous fish 3 70 piscivorous birds 3 63 and the seabass 3 17 within the fish the functional group with the lowest tl were detritivorous fish 2 46 followed by the sardine 2 70 on the other hand the trophic aggregation routine of ecopath assembled the 26 functional groups into four effective trophic levels fig 5 as commented above the largest biomass compartment of biomass of the ecosystem corresponds to the primary producers while the highest flow occurs from the different trophic levels to the detritus this flow however seems to be subsequently balanced by the huge transference of biomass from the sediments to primary consumers and through exports out of the system fig 5 the respiration of consumers 8 60 of the tst seems to be important for regulating the functioning of the system fig 5 being specially intense for the compartment of primary consumers 3 5 keystone analysis the keystone indices of libralato et al 2006 and power et al 1996 coincided showing the relevance of piscivorous birds detritivorous fish and zooplankton on the functioning of the system of ria de aveiro fig 6 the method of libralato et al 2006 also identified the groups of phytoplankton and bivalves as important for the ecosystem while the method of power gave more importance to the groups of piscivorous and omnivorous fish 3 6 ecosystem indicators the system functioning with the size of its main flows system throughput and production is summarized in table 4 together with a comparison with other similar systems see methods the total system throughput tst of the ecosystem of ria de aveiro was 24 544 t km 2 year 1 corresponding 19 15 to the sum of all consumption 2 74 to the sum of all exports 8 60 to the sum of all respiratory flows and 69 50 to the sum of all flows into detritus the value of tpp tr and tpp tb ratios were 5 49 and 0 88 respectively table 4 the net primary production calculated for ria de aveiro on the other hand was relatively low 11 605 t km 2 year 1 table 4 while the value of the ratio between total biomass and tst tb tst was high probably driven by the high total biomass excluding detritus of the system 13 201 t km 2 year 1 which is the highest of the compared values in table 4 the connectance index and the system omnivory index for ria de aveiro resulted to be relatively low table 4 while the finn s cycling index estimated for the system was 5 31 of the total throughput lowest in the comparison and the mean path length 8 81 highest in the comparison the ascendancy value for the system was estimated in 40 72 and the overhead 59 28 table 4 finally the mean trophic level of the catch by fisheries was 2 20 4 discussion this work represents the first trophic model for the functioning of the sub and intertidal parts of ria de aveiro one of the most important wetlands of portugal integrating data from previous works on the biology and ecology of organisms from this system with specific samplings made for this purpose the specificity of the data explains the few adjustments needed to balance the model and its high pedigree 0 663 which is at the upper part of the range of published ecopath models between 0 164 and 0 676 morissette 2007 the reliability of the data allows to obtain solid conclusions on the functioning of the system and establish comparisons with similar ecosystems such as ria formosa south portugal gamito and erzini 2005 the celestún coastal lagoon méxico vega cendejas and arreguín sánchez 2001 and the chiku lagoon taixan lin et al 1999 table 4 hence ria de aveiro is portrayed as a highly productive system supporting a massive biomass of primary producers and detritus and a high tst 24 544 t km 2 year 1 precisely the high biomass contained within the system drives some of the ecological indicators analysed such as the relationship between primary productivity and biomass tpp tb making it the lowest of the systems compared in table 4 interestingly the flow of organic matter through the system originated in the compartment of detritus the detritus path is high 44 23 of the tst in comparison to the producers path 55 77 nevertheless the percentage of tst captured by to the detritus path is lower in the systems of comparison meaning that the storage of organic matter in the sub compartments of the detritus is more rapidly mobilized through the food web in ria de aveiro than in the other systems the combination of both ecosystem features high total biomass and the relevance of the detritus path is probably explained by the high rate at which the extensive marsh areas of ria de aveiro contribute to the detritus in the form of halophytes litter which is consequently decomposed into sediments om and spm and finally consumed by the groups of sedimentivores and depositivores or exported out of the system to understand the state of maturity of the ria de aveiro ecosystem other ecological indicators need to be considered the gross production community respiration tpp tr ratio was high 5 49 in comparison to the other systems table 4 which is driven by the high total primary production of the system and the costs of maintenance in terms of respiration pointing to a higher autotrophy than heterotrophy of the system of ria de aveiro on the other hand however the total primary production total biomass tpp tb ratio was the lowest of the reference values 0 879 table 4 which is explained by the high total biomass of the system according to odum 1969 immature ecosystems are expected to show tpp tr values greater or less than 1 as is the case for ria de aveiro and high tpp tb values in opposition to the value found for ria de aveiro the massive biomass captured in the primary producers compartment of ria de aveiro seems to explain the puzzling relationship between these ratios masking the real meaning of these indicators as measures of maturity hence to elucidate if ria de aveiro is in an advanced state of succession or not other indicators need to be taken into account the connectance index ci indicates the number of actual trophic links with the number of possible links among functional groups gardner and ashby 1970 and it is a measure of the complexity of the food web considered to reach higher values as ecosystems mature odum 1969 for ria de aveiro the ci estimated was 0 23 which is quite low compared to other similar ecosystems table 4 the specialization of the diets of organisms of ria de aveiro either as detritus or as plankton consumers could be the cause of this low value similarly the omnivory index oi indicates the degree of specialization of the functional groups of the ecosystem for ria de aveiro the estimated oi was 0 098 similar to that of the ria formosa and lower than for ría celestún table 4 indicating that the different groups are trophically specialized as mentioned before given that these indices are related to the complexity of the trophic relationships within ecosystems they use to be also considered as a measure of the resilience of ecosystems to changes in the environment with intricate food web ecosystems more resistant to variations in this regard the low values obtained for ria de aveiro suggest a low performance and hence that its resilience to environmental changes could not be as high as expected the system overhead is also viewed as a measure of ecosystem stability and resilience the value obtained 59 28 is elevated suggesting an ecosystem with redundant pathways and weakly specialized resilient to environmental changes through the flexibility of the food web to confirm this however the internal overhead or internal redundancy should be also considered kaufman and borrett 2010 in this case for ria de aveiro it was lower 48 74 indicating that the redundancy of the food web could not be as high as suggested by the total overhead and hence that ria de aveiro is moderately specialized in trophic terms other parameters provided by ecopath to understand the complexity of the system are the connectivity and omnivory indices albeit the evidence for a relationship between system developmental stage and connectivity seems inconclusive christensen 1995 there is an optimum of connectivity related to the size of the system given that both values are relatively low for ria de aveiro it seems that the system is in an intermediate or low state of maturity ria de aveiro is a coastal lagoon with four main channels and many secondary channels communicated with the sea by a single inlet this inlet was created in the 16th century by the construction of littoral barriers aiming at controlling tidal force and facilitating the desiccation of the area in order to avoid the spread of illness the cessation of human activities would probably result in the collapse of the system of channels and ria de aveiro would become isolated from the sea which means that it depends on human activity to keep its former shape and functioning on the other hand human control impedes the ecosystem to evolve towards a more mature state of ecological succession which explains the low values obtained for the indices related to the maturity and complexity of the system ria de aveiro is known to act as a nursery ground for some marine fish populations such as sardine seabass or smelts gordo 1989 vasconcelos et al 2010 2011 meaning that the bulk of their productivity is not consumed within the system and explaining the low ee calculated by ecopath for different fish groups table 1 on the other hand the high rate at which the non consumed biomass of the groups of primary producers see above and primary consumers such as mysidaceans or gastropods is transferred to the detritus fig 5 explains their low ee table 1 the ee value estimated for phytoplankton indicates that only half of its production is consumed within the system which is on the other hand in agreement with the results from other similar ecosystems e g gamito and erzini 2005 lin et al 1999 as it has been verified in ria de aveiro for species of the diatom pseudo nitzschia churro et al 2009 the viability of phytoplankton cells can be reduced as it is transported along the channels by tidal forcing and face the decrease in salinity many of these non viable cells are likely to get trapped in the sediment of the very shallow lateral areas of the inner reaches of the channels over which the water spreads in a relatively thin layer during flood tide and from which it recedes during ebb tide in consequence phytoplankton is subjected to an elevated natural mortality in these systems causing many cells to be lost to the sediment and in consequence not available for grazing by zooplankton explaining their low ee on the other hand the trophic level calculated by ecopath for the different functional groups were in general low table 1 but in agreement with other previous works from ria de aveiro e g coelho et al 2013 two types of fishery were incorporated into the model artisanal whose captures have to be sold at the auction fishing market of aveiro and leisure fishing whose captures are not controlled directly but by limiting the number of licenses and establishing fishing quotas per fishermen per day fishing induced mortalities of commercially exploited species were high for omnivorous mainly diplodus spp and zoobenthivorous fish comprising eels a traditional dish in aveiro and some appreciated flatfish and cephalopods octopus and cuttlefish although in this case the high fishing mortality observed is largely influenced by the high ee assumed to construct the model as shown in the mixed trophic impact analysis fig 4 fisheries exerted negative impacts on the different functional groups albeit zooplanktivorous fish and decapods could be slightly favoured by the capture of their predators in addition given that the productivity of some exploited groups needed to be increased to balance the model see methods there are enough evidences to believe that human exploitation rate is relevant in shaping the food web structure of ria de aveiro requiring hence a determined control of illegal extraction activities in the area together with a monitoring of the populations of top predators exerting negative impacts on the rest of groups specially piscivorous birds fig 4 the trophic aggregation routine of ecopath aggregated the functional groups of the system into four trophic levels represented in the lindeman spine fig 5 most of the biomass of the ecosystem is concentrated in the producers and detritus compartments 95 9 and 2 1 respectively while transfer efficiencies are low especially in the lower trophic levels the transference of biomass to the detritus sum of all flows to the detritus in table 4 was high representing 69 47 of tst regarding the mixed trophic impact analysis fig 4 fisheries pressure is overall negative for the system albeit some indirect benefits in some groups could happen by capturing their direct predators e g zooplanktivorous fish and decapods the detritus group is having a positive trophic effect in almost all the other groups since it is the base for the feeding of most of the invertebrates sustaining the rest of the trophic web the same can be observed for phyto and zooplankton an increase in the biomass of these groups would be beneficial for most of the functional groups but especially for zooplanktivorous fish and sardine probably a variation in the proportions of biomass of the different functional groups of fish would change the trophic preferences of their consumers the diets of the different groups in ecopath however are fixed and independent on the abundance of their preys which restricts further conclusions on this regard the corollary of this work is that ria de aveiro presents a detritus dominated food web with most of the biomass allocated in the compartment of primary producers the system seems to be in an intermediate state of maturity and the complexity of the food web is not at its highest degree perhaps because of a relative specialization of the functional groups in trophic terms this specialization however could reduce the resilience of the ecosystem making it vulnerable to structural or environmental changes the two types of fishery occurring at the ria de aveiro artisanal and leisure exert a considerable pressure on specific groups within the ecosystem in conclusion ria de aveiro seems to be a specialized ecosystem in an intermediate level of maturity with reduced resilience a state that could be in subtle equilibrium and would depend on human activities to keep its current idiosyncrasy we have verified that small changes in the biomass of some fundamental functional groups could have consequences in the short term for the functioning of the system so we strongly

25294,the study aims to describe the energy flow and trophic structure to assess the ecological stage of maturity the ecosystem impact of the introduced exotic carp species and the current fishery on the lake koka ecosystem using a mass balance trophic model the ecopath approach and software were used to represent the lake ecosystem and input parameters were obtained from in situ surveys and from published lake specific sources the model was balanced as per the recommended ecological and thermodynamic constraints the low ecotrophic efficiency found for adult catfish primary producers and detritus suggest that these resources are not fully utilized while other groups have moderate to high values the annual fishery catch represents only about one sixth of the total fish biomass and the exploitation rates of target species are well below 0 5 suggesting under exploitation the dietary intake of fish eating birds is 5 8 t km 2 year 1 almost twice the catch showing the lake s important role for sustaining the bird populations and hence caution needs to be taken before implementing any further fisheries development intervention the mean trophic level of the catch 2 55 is intermediate when compared to other tropical lake systems and reflects the mixed fishery of the lake mixed trophic impact and niche overlap analysis reveals that contrary to what may be expected the impact of the introduced exotic carp species on the lake system is less significant than that of the native species besides its socio economic significance the detritivorous carp seems to fill an unutilized niche and helps the system in recycling organic matter the p r value 3 2 and other system maturity indices indicate that lake koka is as yet an immature developing system the model can be used as a reference for exploring ecosystem based fisheries management scenarios aimed at sustaining fish stocks ecosystem services as well as ecological integrity keywords ecopath food web exotic species mixed trophic impact trophic model 1 introduction the food web concept has been widely used to elucidate the interactions of the different components of an ecosystem in a predator prey context and provides a means to understand the role of species in structuring of ecological processes knowledge on the various components of an ecosystem and their interrelatedness is therefore essential to optimize resource use and other ecosystem services sustainably and to conserve and maintain biodiversity fisheries management on the other hand has been conventionally based on single species surplus production and or yield per recruit y r modeling approaches focusing only on a few target species of the fishery the regular use of these conventional methods is not only due to their relative simplicity and logic and limited data requirement for assessment but also because of the applicability of model outputs for management by regulatory bodies however many scientists have criticized these methods for lacking to scrutinize and account for recruitment failure and multispecies interactions e g larkin 1977 hilborn and walters 1992 trites et al 1999 which has led to a wide recognition of the need to move towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries garcia et al 2003 plagányi 2007 christensen and walters 2011 grüss et al 2017 cury and christensen 2005 also suggested that exploited fish populations must be considered as integral components of ecosystem function rather than units that operate independently of their environment as management interventions directed to one target species may have consequences for many other species as a result a new approach that includes the different components of the ecosystem called ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf termed after garcia et al 2003 has emerged based on the pioneer works of ecosystem modelers e g polovina 1984 gislason and helgason 1985 christensen and pauly 1992 nonetheless one has to note that this new approach is an extension of the conventional management approach garcia and cochrane 2005 and still needs many of its input parameters from individual and population based studies and hence it rather complements the eaf food web analysis and multispecies models are gradually leading to a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecosystems mace 2001 colléter et al 2015 among the models that consider intra and interspecies interactions e g atlantis multispecies trophodynamic model using bioenergetics and allometric approach ecopath with ecosim ewe globally applicable area disaggregated general ecosystem toolbox gadget general equilibrium ecosystem model geem etc the trophic modeling approach using ewe developed by polovina 1984 christensen and pauly 1992 and walters et al 1997 has gained much popularity and momentum in ecology and fishery science due to its user friendly interface and continuous further development plagányi 2007 christensen and walters 2011 a detailed review on the advantages disadvantages and limitations of these and other ecosystem models can be found in plagányi 2007 ewe has also becoming the most widely used and preferred approach for ecosystem based management of fisheries christensen and walters 2011 colléter et al 2015 for both freshwater and marine ecosystems however in ethiopia food web studies using ewe have only recently emerged fetahi and mengistou 2007 fetahi et al 2011 wondie et al 2012 in lake koka an important lake for ethiopian fisheries such an attempt has not yet been tried population based fisheries assessment tesfaye and wolff 2015 and feed and feeding habit studies on fishery target species are available dadebo et al 2013 engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 2015 and plankton and other limnological features have also been studied e g mesfin et al 1988 kebede and willén 1998 tesfay 2007 degefu et al 2011 however as yet no attempt has been made to integrate all this available information and describe the structure and function of the different components in an ecosystem context food web analysis is also a useful ecological concept that represents the feeding relationship of the different functional groups within a system it thus helps to understand investigate ecological interactions that define the flow of food energy and predator prey relationships chain et al 2013 this interaction could be simple or complex depending on the developmental stage of the ecosystem christensen 1995 thapanand et al 2009 lake koka named after the construction of the dam on river awash in 1959 and subsequent inundation of the small lake formerly known as galilea has been used for different purposes including fishery irrigation hydropower generation and water supply evidences show that ecosystems change their ecological maturity with time and in response to various uses thapanand et al 2009 the ecopath with ecosim approach further allow assessing the maturity stage of the ecosystem using ecological indicators generated from a network analyses whether the different interactions and human uses of the lake resulted in some degree of maturity or not has not been investigated yet moreover ewe has been used to explore the ecological impacts of introduced species in different freshwater systems transfers of fish species between lakes as well as introduction of exotic fishes have been going on for decades all over the world tesfaye and wolff 2014 however introduction of exotic species becomes unpopular due to unanticipated ecological and socio economic impacts that this intervention posed the most frequently cited example is the case of nile perch latus niloticus introduction in lake victoria that has believed to cause the loss of many cichlid species kaufman 1992 witte et al 1992 food web structures are also known to be susceptible to species introductions and invasions vander zanden and olden et al 2008 using ewe fetahi et al 2011 studied the ecological impact of introduced tilapia oreochromis niloticus l in lake hayq ethiopia villanueva et al 2008 looked the impact of fish introduction in lake kivu a deep african equatorial lake and khan and panikkar 2009 studied the impact of introduced tilapiine species and african catfish they considered them as invasive fishes in kelavarapalli reservoir in india using ecopath one of the fishery target species of lake koka the common carp cyprinus carpio l was introduced with the intention of boosting the fishery tudorancea et al 1999 however the ecological impact of c carpio in this lake has not yet been investigated the present study therefore aims to provide a a holistic description of the trophic interactions and energy flows b to assess the state of ecological maturity of the system and c to assess the impact of the introduced carp species and d the current fishery on the other target and non target species of the lake koka ecosystem using the ecopath approach so as to pave the way to an ecosystem based fisheries management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and model description the tropical lake koka is located in the ethiopian rift valley 08 23 22 n 39 05 15 e at an altitude of 1 590 m above sea level which is about 90 km southeast of addis ababa fig 1 water in and outflow is mainly provided by the awash river in addition the mojo river may also generate inflow during the rainy season the lake has a large floodplain area in its western side and has a total surface area of about 255 km2 with a maximum and mean depth of 14 m and 9 m respectively vanden bossche and bernacsek 1991 its total surface area widely fluctuates between wet and dry season for the purpose of this study we considered an area of 200 km2 as estimated from the recent map from google earth and as kebede and belay 1994 also reported a similar figure the lake provides multiple services to the local communities and the country at large including fishing drinking water supply sanitation ecotourism irrigation hydropower generation and industrial purposes its fishery plays a key role in protein supply and livelihoods for many households and the mean annual landings for the past 11 years 2002 2012 was about 600 metric tons per year which is about 7 of the total annual landings in ethiopia tesfaye and wolff 2014 the target species of the artisanal fishery include the native tilapia o niloticus catfish clarias gariepinus b barbs labeobarbus intermedius r and the introduced common carp c carpio the common fishing gears used in lake koka include beach seines gillnets and longlines lfdp 1997 tesfaye and wolff 2015 the lake ecosystem also supports other non exploited species including small fishes garra denbecha and garra makiensis aquatic birds e g great white pelicans african fish eagles pied kingfishers great cormorants herons caspian gull larus cachinnans etc macroinvertebrates plankton and macrophytes typha arunda echinochola potamogeton cyprus and nymphea sp for this first trophic model 14 functional groups including detritus were identified table 1 these functional groups consist either of a single species genus different life stages of the species or multiple species groups with similar ecological niches diets body size and metabolic requirements of the fish groups the adult and juvenile tilapia and catfish were assigned to different functional groups due to their known ontogenetic diet shift engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 the three cyprinids carp labeobarbus and garra spp g denbecha and g makiensis were also assigned to different compartments as they differ in size habitat and diet all the macro invertebrates including insects heteroptera and ceratopogonidea benthic organisms chironomidea nematoda ostracoda and oligochaeta and gastropods freshwater snails were grouped in one functional group as zoobenthos due to lack of independent data for each taxa herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton was grouped separately the phytoplankton group includes blue green algae cyanophyta diatoms bacillariophyta green algae chlorophyta euglenoids and cryptomonads kebede and willén 1998 tesfay 2007 2 2 the modeling approach using ecopath with ecosim ewe software version 6 4 4 a mass balance trophic model of lake koka was constructed to quantify trophic interactions and energy flows among the compartments of the ecosystem this approach is based on two master equations one to describe the production term and the other one describes the consumption term the production term in ecopath is described as production is equal to the sum of fisheries catches predation mortality biomass accumulation net migration and other mortalities christensen et al 2005 put this in a more formal way as 1 b i p b i e e i b j q b j d c j i y i e i b a i where bi and bj are the biomass of prey group i and predator group j respectively p bi is the production biomass ratio of the prey group eei ecotrophic efficiency is the fraction of production that is consumed within the system by predation or caught from the system fishing exploitation yi is yield fisheries catch q bj is the food consumption per unit of biomass j and dcji the fraction of prey i in the diet of predator j ei the net migration rate emigration immigration bai is the biomass accumulation rate for prey i similarly the energy input and output of all living groups must be balanced and for this christensen and pauly 1992 christensen et al 2005 described the second master equation of ecopath as 2 q i p i r i u i where q is consumption p production r respiration and u unassimilated food of the ith group the two master equations together ensure the energy balance of each group 2 3 input parameters each functional group in the model requires as basic input parameters biomass b production to biomass ratio p b and consumption rate q b in addition the diet composition of each group needs to be known in order to construct the diet matrix for the model which connects all model compartments for the fishery targets of the system catch y is a further input to the model if one of the basic input parameters is unknown the model may estimate this unknown if the ecotrophic efficiency ee the fraction of the groups production used in the system is known or can be assumed christensen and pauly 1993 christensen et al 2005 the unit of time used in the model for the different rates is year 1 and for the biomass is t km 2 2 3 1 biomass b the biomass of fishery target fish groups was calculated using length based virtual population analysis vpa by tesfaye 2016 whereas b for non target species garra spp was estimated as follows a beach seine 100 m long and 2 m wide was used to sweep a semicircular area radius 20 m along the shoreline in five sampling occasions with a total of 15 hauls from november 2012 march 2013 this resulted in a mean catch of 1402 9 g per swept area 1256 m2 and hence a mean biomass of 1 117 t km2 was estimated since for catfish our b estimate from length based vpa was rather high 10 01 t km 2 and did not allow for a solid balancing of the model b was again estimated from the annual catch y and fishing mortality f obtained from tesfaye and wolff 2015 as b y f the resulting estimate of 3 2 t km 2 was then used together with that of the vpa to calculate the average of both 6 61 t km 2 the adult tilapia and catfish and their juveniles were represented separately using the multi stanza option in the ewe software the multi stanza representation allow to calculate the biomass of the juvenile groups using input parameters including the k value the von bertalanffy growth coefficient the q b ratio and the starting age in months for the adult groups and the p b ratio for both juvenile and adult groups using those input parameters table 2 and table 3 the b of juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia was calculated as 0 332 t km 2 and 1 049 t km 2 respectively the biomass of labeobarbus was calculated by the model assuming that ee equals 0 80 as the species is believed to be underexploited tesfaye 2016 here we also did some sensitivity analysis by changing the value of ee for labeobarbus group ee 0 70 0 90 to check if the model would be balanced without changing the value of other input parameters substituting the value of ee for labeobarbus group by the above range of values ee 0 8 12 5 didn t show significant effect on the model the model was balanced without changing any of the other parameters for other groups moreover it has no effect on the overall conclusion of the study either although decreasing ee by 12 5 for labeobarbus ee 0 7 has increased its biomass estimate by 14 which in turn increased the ee of its prey groups while increasing ee by 12 5 ee 0 9 would have reduced its biomass by only 11 which causes the ee of its prey groups to slightly decreased however in all cases the ee of all functional groups were less than 1 suggesting no effect on model balancing within the range and hence confirming the reliability of our assumed ee value for labeobarbus according to the birdlife international report about 20 000 aquatic birds are known to use lake koka as a feeding and resting ground http www birdlife org datazone sitefactsheet php id 6273 accessed on 11 04 2016 as their size varies widely e g average size kingfishers weigh up ca 350 g and great white pelicans ca 11 kg but they are usually fewer in abundance we assumed a mean weight of 1 kg for all species and sizes combined and hence the bird biomass in lake koka was roughly approximated as 0 10 t km 2 the mean phytoplankton biomass determined from chlorophyll a chl a concentrations from 24 samples conducted from october 2012 to january 2013 was estimated at 42 95 mg m 3 which exceeds earlier estimates of 13 5 mg m 3 kebede et al 1994 16 mg m 3 kebede and willén 1998 and 22 4 mg m 3 mesfin et al 1988 however since those reports were based on a survey of only one time sampling we used our estimate as input this estimate was then converted to a depth integrated value by multiplying with the euphotic depth 0 61 m and hence the model input of phytoplankton chl a was 26 2 mg m 2 this value was then converted to carbon with a conversion factor of 40 1 carbon to chl a ratio jones 1979 in order to convert to wet weight we used a conversion factor of 10 as suggested by jones 1979 which gave a biomass value of 10 48 g ww m 2 the most abundant zooplankton groups in lake koka include rotifers brachionus caudatus keratella quadrata keratella tropica and filinia sp cladocerans daphnia barbata and moina micrura and copepoda mesocyclops thermocyclops nauplii tropodiaptomus processifer and metadiaptomus colonialis mesfin et al 1988 degefu et al 2011 the biomasses of herbivores and carnivores zooplankton were taken from mavuti et al 1996 and fetahi and mengistou 2007 the mean biomass of macro invertebrates was estimated from 24 ekman grab bottom samples and 12 weed bed samples collected from november 2012 march 2013 and a mean of 28 9 g m 2 was obtained moreover biomass of macrophytes were measured following the procedure of fetahi and mengistou 2007 and was estimated at 183 4 t km 2 the detritus biomass d was calculated as a function of primary production and euphotic depth using christensen and pauly 1993 empirical model 3 log d 0 954 log p p 0 863 log e 2 41 where d is the detritus biomass g c m 2 pp the primary production g c m 2 year 1 e euphotic depth m euphotic depth was estimated from the secchi depth transparency measurement the secchi depth of lake koka is low due to suspended silt coming in by the river awash and we have measured a mean value of only 17 5 cm for 6 months but earlier reports estimated a higher value of 28 cm mesfin et al 1988 kebede et al 1994 we took our measured value 17 5 cm and converted to euphotic depth 0 61 m using holmes 1970 equation for turbid waters gross primary production was estimated at 0 056 0 154 g c m 2 hr 1 tesfay 2007 taking the mean of this values and assuming 10 h production period per day gave as 1 05 g c m 2 day 1 and 383 25 g c m 2 year 1 when this value is converted to wet weight the annual primary production is 3832 5 g ww m 2 year 1 substituting these values into the above equation gave the detritus biomass as 7 40 g c m 2 2 3 2 production biomass p b the production biomass ratio for birds 0 25 per year was adopted from moreau et al 1993a the total mortality rate z for the fish groups assumed to be equivalent to the p b ratio allen 1971 were estimated using length converted catch curves tesfaye and wolff 2015 while for non exploited fish groups juveniles and garra p b was assumed equal to m as f 0 and computed using pauly 1980 empirical equation using the production and biomass estimates given above allowed estimating the production rate p b for the phytoplankton as 365 8 per year whereas the p b for macrophytes 1 0 per year was taken from palomares et al 1993 a mean individual weight of 5 1 μg for mesocylops carnivore zooplankton and 0 8 μg dry weight for thermocyclops rotifers and cladoceras herbivores zooplankton were taken from dagne 2010 and then the p b ratio for herbivores and carnivores zooplankton were calculated using kuns and sprules 2000 equation as 4 log p b 0 73 0 23 log w c f 1 12 where p b is per day w is dry weight in mg and cf is a correction factor for the back transformation from logarithmic units and the computed value was then converted to annual rates furthermore the p b ratio for benthic organisms were estimated using brey 1999 empirical equation as 5 log p b 1 672 0 993 log 1 t max 0 0035 log w max 300 447 1 t 273 where tmax is the maximum age year wmax maximum body weight g dw and t temperature c maximum individual body weight 0 2 g and maximum age for zoobenthos 1 5 year was obtained from fetahi and mengistou 2007 and dry weight was assumed to be 20 of wet weight and hence p b equal 3 21 per year 2 3 3 diet composition and consumption rates q b the consumption per unit biomass for fish groups were estimated using the empirical model proposed by palomares and pauly 1998 6 log q b 7 964 0 204 log w 1 965 t 0 083 a r 0 532 h 0 398 d where q b is the consumption biomass rate year 1 w is the asymptotic weight g of the population t corresponds to 1000 t c 273 15 where t c is the water temperature ar is the aspect ratio of the caudal fin which is defined as ar h2 s where h is the height of the caudal fin mm and s is the surface area mm2 extending to the narrowest part of the caudal peduncle h and d are binary variables that define whether the predator is herbivorous h 1 d 0 detritivore h 0 d 1 or carnivore h 0 d 0 table 2 presents the input parameters used to compute q b with a similar procedure and input parameters for the multi stanza option in ewe the q b ratio of juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia was calculated as 16 41 per year and 58 56 per year consumption biomass ratio for zoobenthos was estimated based on assumed gross efficiency p q of 0 2 christensen and pauly 1993 which gave a value of 16 05 per year whereas q b for predatory birds was obtained from moreau et al 1993a and for herbivore and carnivore zooplankton was estimated by assuming the gross efficiency of 0 25 and 0 3 respectively the diet composition of the fish groups were compiled from diet analysis and from various literature sources dadebo et al 2013 engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 2015 the diet matrix which shows the fraction of preys in the diet of predators for all consumer group is presented in table 1 2 3 4 fisheries yield y catch statistics for the fishery target fish groups tilapia catfish common carp and barbs for the period from 2002 to 2012 was obtained from the fisheries records at the national fisheries and aquatic life research center nfalrc then as ecopath requires input parameter to be in the form of rates t km 2 yr 1 the total annual yield for each fishery target functional group was converted to annual catch per unit area table 3 2 4 balancing the model ecotrophic efficiency ee and gross efficiency ge were used as a guide for balancing the model whereby ee values should not be larger than 1 and ge values should not exceed 0 3 christensen and pauly 1992 christensen et al 2005 whenever the ee values were greater than 1 initial values of uncertain parameters were slightly modified until the model was balanced as described in ecopath user s manual and other models e g kavanagh et al 2004 we have further considered other ecological and thermodynamic rules such as production to respiration p r and respiration to assimilation ratio r a whereby both parameters should not exceed 1 for balancing ecopath models darwall et al 2010 heymans et al 2016 2 5 trophic interaction and network analysis once the model was balanced a flow diagram was constructed a flow diagram shows the trophic interactions and the flow of food energy from one functional group to the other graphically different boxes representing each functional group of the ecosystem were arranged in hierarchy based on their computed trophic levels y axis along the x axis in such a way that they don t overlap the different groups then connected with networks showing their trophic interaction and energy flows christensen et al 2005 the concept of trophic level tl was introduced long ago by lindeman 1942 who assign integers or discrete values to the different producers and consumers of a system in ewe the tls are not necessarily integers 1 2 3 as proposed by lindeman but can be fractional e g 1 2 2 5 etc a routine in ewe assigns definitional trophic levels tl of 1 to producers and detritus and a trophic level of 1 the weighted average of the preys tl to consumers christensen et al 2005 in addition to the routine for calculation of fractional trophic levels a routine in ecopath aggregates the entire system into discrete trophic levels sensu lindeman christensen et al 2005 this analysis then allowed for calculation of trophic transfer efficiencies expressing how efficiently transfers are from one trophic level to the next to assess the state of the fishery mortality estimates were computed with the ewe routine and the exploitation rate were then calculated from computed fishing and total mortality rates moreover several network indices used as a measure of ecosystem development and maturity odum 1969 were computed 2 6 mixed trophic impact and niche overlap analysis the direct and indirect trophic impacts of a change in the biomass of a group that will have on the biomass of other groups in a system were graphically presented using the mixed tropic impact mti routine of ewe ulanowicz and puccia 1990 christensen et al 2005 an increase on the biomass of a predator group would result in a negative impact on its prey groups while positively impacting the prey of its preys through a reduction in predation pressure similarly groups that have similar trophic niches would have an impact on each other through competition for feed resources the ewe routine also allowed to quantify predator and prey niche overlaps christensen et al 2005 the impact of the introduced carp was assessed using these two measures the mti and niche overlap where it is assumed that larger mti and larger niche overlap values indicate greater impacts the impact of increasing the fishing pressure e g by 10 on fishery target and non target species was also assessed using the mti analysis as has been done for several systems fetahi and mengistou 2007 fetahi et al 2011 ruiz and wolff 2011 3 results 3 1 basic estimates of the balanced model the relative diet composition and summarized values of the basic inputs and the parameters computed for each functional group by the model are presented in table 1 and table 3 respectively while fig 2 presents the flow diagram showing the trophic relationships among groups the size of the circle in the flow diagram is proportional to the logarithm of the group s biomass the ecotrophic efficiency for fish eating birds was estimated as zero since they are a top predator the ee for detritus primary producers and adult catfish was low indicating that these resources are not fully utilized while other consumers showed moderate to high ee value suggesting that predation plays a significant role in regulating ecosystem structure and function the low ee value for primary producers also indicates that much of their production goes to the detritus box and might indicate high rate of organic waste production at the lower tls the estimated production consumption ratio also called gross efficiency falls within the acceptable range as does the production respiration ratio for all groups table 3 the total biomass of fishes and their catch was estimated at 19 24 t km 2 and 3 01 t km 2 respectively as expected the highest annual production and consumption rates were observed in zooplankton and zoobenthos groups where the herbivore zooplankton presented the highest rate of p 301 t km 2 year 1 and q 1203 t km 2 year 1 the food consumption of fish eating birds was also high 5 8 t km 2 year 1 almost doubling the catch of the fishermen the model also gave us estimates of fishing mortality predation and non predation mortality rates for fishery target groups from those estimates the exploitation rates e were then estimated as 0 308 0 316 0 221 and 0 012 for catfish tilapia carp and labeobarbus groups respectively as seen in fig 2 and table 3 the highest trophic level was estimated for fish eating birds tl 3 5 and for fishery target species the estimated tls ranges from 2 15 to 3 0 it was also apparent that juvenile tilapia presented higher tl than their own adult stages 2 66 and 2 15 respectively fig 2 indicating omnivores and herbivores feeding habits reflecting a clear ontogenetic dietary shift in this species however the tl difference between juvenile and adult catfish was not significant tl for both 3 0 although their diet composition differs table 1 much of the energy produced from primary producers flows to higher tls through herbivores zooplankton and herbivores fish while the energy from detritus goes to higher tls mainly through zoobenthos carp and moderately through adult catfish and labeobarbus fig 2 and table 1 the omnivory index oi was highest for catfish groups followed by juvenile tilapia and carp oi 0 5 suggesting their dietary plasticity while fish eating birds and herbivore zooplankton showed the lowest value oi 0 1 as the former feeds mainly on fish groups i e on similar tls and the later on phytoplankton the mean system omnivory index soi was estimated at 0 289 table 4 the adult tilapia and others who feed mainly on primary producers and detritus generally showed lower gross efficiency table 3 which might have resulted from the lower quality of their main diets phytoplankton macrophytes and detritus 3 2 flows transfer efficiency and system indices while the lindeman spine gave seven discrete tls for the lake koka ecosystem we only presented the first five tls here fig 3 since the last two receive very little energy the total flow to the detritus box was estimated at about 3176 t km 2 year 1 of which 85 comes from the primary producers which is due to the low ee value for phytoplankton and macrophytes table 3 however the proportion of trophic flows from detritus to consumers was only about a quarter 23 2 of all consumptions this is also evidenced with the low ee value and the finn s cycling index fci estimated for the system 2 23 of the total throughput and mean path length was 2 33 the transfer efficiency calculated as geometric mean from tl ii iv originated from producers was 12 8 while from detritus was 8 3 which gave a mean value of 12 0 from all flows the mean tl of the catch was estimated at 2 55 indicating that the fishery targets lower tls and the system fisheries gross efficiency catch net pp was estimated to be 0 08 the estimated value of p r and p b ratio of the system which are considered as measures of ecosystem development and maturity odum 1969 christensen 1995 and other summary statistics of the system are given in table 4 3 3 niche overlap and mixed trophic impact mti fig 4 presents the direct and indirect impact of an increase in the biomass of a group that would have on others and fig 5 shows the relative total impact of the impacting groups and the niche overlap of the groups an increase in the biomass of the top predators fish eating birds and adult catfish showed strong negative impact on most groups suggesting their important role as top down controllers of the system on the other hand an increase in phytoplankton and macrophytes production would positively impact most of the functional groups including the fishery target species as well as the fishery suggesting bottom up control the detritus group has also a direct positive impact to zoobenthos carp labeobarbus and others but have indirect negative impact on zooplankton and macrophytes resulting from the favorable condition for their predators furthermore all functional groups except detritus showed a negative impact to their own group indicating the existence of intraspecific competition for limited resources obviously increasing the fishing pressure would have negative impact on target species but favors non target species such as garra species of the primary consumers zoobenthos and herbivore zooplankton showed a stronger total relative negative impact than most fish groups figs 4 and 5a which is comparable to the impact of top predators fish eating birds and adult catfish in contrast although the carnivore zooplankton negatively impacted herbivore zooplankton and zoobenthos groups their overall relative impact in the system would be positive moreover it is interesting to note that the impact of the introduced carp species was not as significant as that of the native species such as tilapia catfish and labeobarbus species figs 4 and 5a this result of the mixed trophic impact was also supported by the results of predator prey niche overlap analysis fig 5b carp showed only moderate prey and predator overlap with juvenile tilapia juvenile catfish and adult catfish groups the highest predator prey overlap index is shown in compartment iii and the lowest in compartment ii whereas compartment i and iv show high prey overlap but with a low predator overlap index and low prey overlap but with a high predator overlap index respectively fig 5b accordingly the highest predator prey overlap index is shown between juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia tilapia and catfish juveniles and their adult groups adult catfish and juvenile tilapia and between adult catfish and labeobarbus on the other hand the lowest niche overlap was observed between labeobarbus and carnivore zooplanktons and between adult catfish and carnivore zooplanktons while the highest prey overlap and predator overlap is observed between adult tilapia and garra and between labeobarbus and garra spp respectively 4 discussion of the trophic indices developed to characterize ecosystem maturity christensen 1995 selected nine out of 24 odum 1969 attributes and ranked 41 systems accordingly in immature ecosystems the total system p r ratio is either greater or smaller than one while the ratio of total system primary production to total biomass p b is high as primary production is notably high in immature systems however the p r approaches one and the p b value becomes smaller as ecosystems mature due to high biomass accumulation in the process christensen 1995 according to christensen and pauly 1993 the p r ratio ranges from 0 8 to 3 2 based on 41 ecopath models analysis and our estimated value p r 3 198 falls at the upper limit of this range suggesting that lake koka is a rather immature system table 4 which is further substantiated by the low value of the total biomass total throughput ratio b t the low value of respiration compared with the primary production and the estimated low value of ascendency 36 5 is also a confirmation thereof all the indices are consistent in showing that the lake koka ecosystem is in a developing state and confirming the robustness of the model the calculated pedigree index 0 67 further confirmed our model quality table 4 as suggested by christensen et al 2005 ecosystem maturity considered as the last state of succession odum 1969 is an important concept in ecology to understand ecosystem performance measured as productivity or stability bai et al 2004 as the system matures the diversity and food web complexity increases christensen 1995 lake koka being an immature system shows the characteristic features of developing ecosystems described by christensen 1995 pérez españa and arreguı n sánchez 1999 the estimated value of the total throughput t 9355 t km 2 year 1 table 4 which shows the size of the system in terms of total flows seems relatively low when compared to other tropical lakes of the region lake awassa a closed rift valley lake without any obvious outlet has almost double the size t 18 217 t km 2 year 1 fetahi and mengistou 2007 theoretically t tends to increase as the system develops christensen 1995 and this may therefore suggest that lake koka is younger in the development continuum or ecological succession process than lake awassa actually the geological time of lake koka is only about half a century tudorancea et al 1999 however its t value is comparable to other tropical immature inland water ecosystems such as lake kivu 6686 villanueva et al 2008 and ubolratana reservoir 9610 thapanand et al 2009 the low ee value for primary producers and detritus imply high rate of organic carbon loss at the lower tls in the system this might also explain the low overall ecological efficiency shown by the low fisheries gross efficiency catch net p p ratio table 4 however low gross efficiency is a common feature for young ecosystems christensen 1995 and similar low values were reported for lake awassa 0 0014 fetahi and mengistou 2007 ubolratana reservoir 0 0011 villanueva et al 2005 lake naivasha 0 0009 and lake ihema 0 0007 mavuti et al 1996 and other tropical lakes christensen and pauly 1993 slightly higher value of gross efficiency were reported for lake victoria 0 0082 after the introduction of nile perch that has believed to improve the productivity and ecological efficiency of the lake moreau et al 1993b and lake george 0 0057 moreau et al 1993a probably these later two lakes are approaching maturity however in terms of trophic flows into discrete tls sensu lindeman 1942 te of lake koka 12 0 falls within the reported range of highly efficient african inland water bodies te 10 15 christensen and pauly 1993 fetahi et al 2011 the low mean trophic level of the catch 2 55 is due to the fact that the fishery targets fish groups mostly belonging to tl ii and iii which is also the case for the mean trophic level of the catch of lake hayq 2 46 fetahi et al 2011 lake awassa 2 57 fetahi and mengistou 2007 lake pasak jolasid manmade lake in thailand 2 6 thapanand et al 2009 but higher values were also reported for lakes that have more diverse target fish species such as lake kivu 2 9 villanueva et al 2008 lake malawi 2 94 darwall et al 2010 lake kariba 2 97 machena et al 1993 and lake victoria 2 99 moreau et al 1993b these variations among the different lakes may also suggest that only in large developed lakes we would find a substantial biomass of high trophic level predatory species which may explain the higher mean trophic level of the catch in the later lakes the mixed trophic impact mti analysis figs 4 and 5a shows the importance of fish eating birds and catfish as top down controller with negative impacts on their prey species and the primary producers as bottom up controller favoring the herbivores and their consumers zooplankton and zoobenthos also show their role as a link in energy transfer between the primary producers and detritus to higher tropic levels respectively the results of mti analysis therefore clearly show how predation inter and intraspecific competition plays a role in regulating ecosystem structure and function mixed trophic impact has also been used to monitor the effect of fisheries across an ecosystem christensen et al 2005 cury et al 2005 which also unveils the negative impact of increasing the fishing pressure on the target species catfish tilapia carp and labeobarbus and its cascading effect on their prey species furthermore the mti contrary to what may be expected shows that the introduced carp species has only little impact on other fish groups figs 4 and 5a which could be attributed to its feeding habits and its low biomass compared to other target species such as catfish and labeobarbus table 3 although the finn s cycling index of the entire system is low 2 23 carp has a key role in recycling of materials through detritus consumption for its energy demand detritus constitutes some 40 of its dietary consumption table 1 dadebo et al 2015 carp thus fills the niche that has not yet been fully occupied by other functional groups moreover carp s ecological role is exemplified by its dietary contribution for fish eating birds and to some extent for catfish another target species with a higher economic value tesfaye 2016 it is also one of the most important species for local communities for food and cash income lfdp 1997 tesfaye and wolff 2015 the carp introduction to the lake could thus be considered as a success in this particular case unlike many other systems where fish introduction have caused series ecological and economic losses a frequently cited example is the introduction of nile perch lates niloticus in lake victoria where it has greatly affected the native fish species community kaufman 1992 witte et al 1992 the introduction of tilapia in some countries e g in lake nicaragua and lake apoyo in nicaragua mccrary et al 2001 and in madagascar reinthal and stiassny 1991 led to a reduction or replacement of native fish species and was considered in many instances as invasive canonico et al 2005 eby et al 2006 reviewed the impact of top predator fish introduction in freshwater wood webs and found out that introduction of top predators have either replaced native top predators or increased species richness of top predators as a result it is advised to restrict fish introductions only to controlled systems however on top of socioeconomic benefits there are also cases where fish introduction in open systems natural and manmade water bodies contribute to system maturity and stability e g tilapia introduction in lake hayq fetahi et al 2011 and tilapia and sardine species introduction in lake kivu villanueva et al 2008 a similar situation was found for the introduced tilapia species in the caribbean estuary cienaga grande of marta colombia where the species greatly benefited the fishermen but never outcompeted the native species leal flórez et al 2008 the total catch of all target species combined 3 t km 2 seems very small compared to other tropical lakes including lake hayq 4 8 t km 2 fetahi et al 2011 lake kariba 6 6 t km 2 machena et al 1993 lake awassa 12 1 t km 2 fetahi and mengistou 2007 and lake george 14 3 t km 2 moreau et al 1993a but its catch rate is higher than lake turkana 0 6 t km 2 kolding 1993 lake naivasha 2 15 t km 2 and lake ihema 2 66 t km 2 mavuti et al 1996 moreover as the estimated exploitation rates e for all fishery target groups are well below 0 5 a value considered as optimum level gulland 1965 and even lower than the recently used precautionary e value e 0 4 there is no indication of overfishing for any of the target species this suggests scope for some further fishery expansion as was also concluded from recent assessments by tesfaye and wolff 2015 and tesfaye 2016 the total standing fish stock b 19 24 t km 2 is about six times higher than the current catch rate and might also further suggest an overall state of under exploitation however caution needs to be taken here before implementing any development intervention for example the consumption of fish eating birds is high and almost twice the catch taken by the fishermen if these bird populations were to be sustained there is only limited possibility to expand fisheries exploitation possibly from carp and labeobarbus for both species ee 0 8 and e 0 2 a similar situation of high fish biomass consumption by fish eating birds like cormorants a species which also exist in lake koka was reported for other lake ecosystems buijse et al 1993 mavuti et al 1996 therefore this should be taken into consideration when one would seek further development of the fishery in lake koka to sum up in this first attempt of trophic modeling for lake koka we are able to describe the lake ecosystem and assess the stage of ecological maturity and the impacts of two common anthropogenic activities fishing and exotic species introduction in an ecosystem context however it is imperative to conduct further detailed studies to minimize all sources of bias to quantify the major taxa included in the zoobenthos group independently to consider insects and benthic fauna in different functional groups and to include the bacterial loop which is missing in the present study due to lack of data it should also be noted that some of the input parameters were adopted from other systems which could have introduced further bias to the model for instance for aquatic birds parameters such as p b q b and diet information were taken from similar systems which even ignored the diet fractions of insects and other items of possible importance for the diet these limitations and information gaps should be addressed first if one would consider further fish introductions or other management interventions nevertheless the present model can be used as a baseline reference for future models that would consider spatial and temporal dynamics of the lake ecosystem in this continuously changing climate and environment so as to pave the way to ecosystem based fisheries management and sustain fish stocks ecosystem services as well as ecological integrity acknowledgements the study was financed by the

25294,the study aims to describe the energy flow and trophic structure to assess the ecological stage of maturity the ecosystem impact of the introduced exotic carp species and the current fishery on the lake koka ecosystem using a mass balance trophic model the ecopath approach and software were used to represent the lake ecosystem and input parameters were obtained from in situ surveys and from published lake specific sources the model was balanced as per the recommended ecological and thermodynamic constraints the low ecotrophic efficiency found for adult catfish primary producers and detritus suggest that these resources are not fully utilized while other groups have moderate to high values the annual fishery catch represents only about one sixth of the total fish biomass and the exploitation rates of target species are well below 0 5 suggesting under exploitation the dietary intake of fish eating birds is 5 8 t km 2 year 1 almost twice the catch showing the lake s important role for sustaining the bird populations and hence caution needs to be taken before implementing any further fisheries development intervention the mean trophic level of the catch 2 55 is intermediate when compared to other tropical lake systems and reflects the mixed fishery of the lake mixed trophic impact and niche overlap analysis reveals that contrary to what may be expected the impact of the introduced exotic carp species on the lake system is less significant than that of the native species besides its socio economic significance the detritivorous carp seems to fill an unutilized niche and helps the system in recycling organic matter the p r value 3 2 and other system maturity indices indicate that lake koka is as yet an immature developing system the model can be used as a reference for exploring ecosystem based fisheries management scenarios aimed at sustaining fish stocks ecosystem services as well as ecological integrity keywords ecopath food web exotic species mixed trophic impact trophic model 1 introduction the food web concept has been widely used to elucidate the interactions of the different components of an ecosystem in a predator prey context and provides a means to understand the role of species in structuring of ecological processes knowledge on the various components of an ecosystem and their interrelatedness is therefore essential to optimize resource use and other ecosystem services sustainably and to conserve and maintain biodiversity fisheries management on the other hand has been conventionally based on single species surplus production and or yield per recruit y r modeling approaches focusing only on a few target species of the fishery the regular use of these conventional methods is not only due to their relative simplicity and logic and limited data requirement for assessment but also because of the applicability of model outputs for management by regulatory bodies however many scientists have criticized these methods for lacking to scrutinize and account for recruitment failure and multispecies interactions e g larkin 1977 hilborn and walters 1992 trites et al 1999 which has led to a wide recognition of the need to move towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries garcia et al 2003 plagányi 2007 christensen and walters 2011 grüss et al 2017 cury and christensen 2005 also suggested that exploited fish populations must be considered as integral components of ecosystem function rather than units that operate independently of their environment as management interventions directed to one target species may have consequences for many other species as a result a new approach that includes the different components of the ecosystem called ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf termed after garcia et al 2003 has emerged based on the pioneer works of ecosystem modelers e g polovina 1984 gislason and helgason 1985 christensen and pauly 1992 nonetheless one has to note that this new approach is an extension of the conventional management approach garcia and cochrane 2005 and still needs many of its input parameters from individual and population based studies and hence it rather complements the eaf food web analysis and multispecies models are gradually leading to a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecosystems mace 2001 colléter et al 2015 among the models that consider intra and interspecies interactions e g atlantis multispecies trophodynamic model using bioenergetics and allometric approach ecopath with ecosim ewe globally applicable area disaggregated general ecosystem toolbox gadget general equilibrium ecosystem model geem etc the trophic modeling approach using ewe developed by polovina 1984 christensen and pauly 1992 and walters et al 1997 has gained much popularity and momentum in ecology and fishery science due to its user friendly interface and continuous further development plagányi 2007 christensen and walters 2011 a detailed review on the advantages disadvantages and limitations of these and other ecosystem models can be found in plagányi 2007 ewe has also becoming the most widely used and preferred approach for ecosystem based management of fisheries christensen and walters 2011 colléter et al 2015 for both freshwater and marine ecosystems however in ethiopia food web studies using ewe have only recently emerged fetahi and mengistou 2007 fetahi et al 2011 wondie et al 2012 in lake koka an important lake for ethiopian fisheries such an attempt has not yet been tried population based fisheries assessment tesfaye and wolff 2015 and feed and feeding habit studies on fishery target species are available dadebo et al 2013 engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 2015 and plankton and other limnological features have also been studied e g mesfin et al 1988 kebede and willén 1998 tesfay 2007 degefu et al 2011 however as yet no attempt has been made to integrate all this available information and describe the structure and function of the different components in an ecosystem context food web analysis is also a useful ecological concept that represents the feeding relationship of the different functional groups within a system it thus helps to understand investigate ecological interactions that define the flow of food energy and predator prey relationships chain et al 2013 this interaction could be simple or complex depending on the developmental stage of the ecosystem christensen 1995 thapanand et al 2009 lake koka named after the construction of the dam on river awash in 1959 and subsequent inundation of the small lake formerly known as galilea has been used for different purposes including fishery irrigation hydropower generation and water supply evidences show that ecosystems change their ecological maturity with time and in response to various uses thapanand et al 2009 the ecopath with ecosim approach further allow assessing the maturity stage of the ecosystem using ecological indicators generated from a network analyses whether the different interactions and human uses of the lake resulted in some degree of maturity or not has not been investigated yet moreover ewe has been used to explore the ecological impacts of introduced species in different freshwater systems transfers of fish species between lakes as well as introduction of exotic fishes have been going on for decades all over the world tesfaye and wolff 2014 however introduction of exotic species becomes unpopular due to unanticipated ecological and socio economic impacts that this intervention posed the most frequently cited example is the case of nile perch latus niloticus introduction in lake victoria that has believed to cause the loss of many cichlid species kaufman 1992 witte et al 1992 food web structures are also known to be susceptible to species introductions and invasions vander zanden and olden et al 2008 using ewe fetahi et al 2011 studied the ecological impact of introduced tilapia oreochromis niloticus l in lake hayq ethiopia villanueva et al 2008 looked the impact of fish introduction in lake kivu a deep african equatorial lake and khan and panikkar 2009 studied the impact of introduced tilapiine species and african catfish they considered them as invasive fishes in kelavarapalli reservoir in india using ecopath one of the fishery target species of lake koka the common carp cyprinus carpio l was introduced with the intention of boosting the fishery tudorancea et al 1999 however the ecological impact of c carpio in this lake has not yet been investigated the present study therefore aims to provide a a holistic description of the trophic interactions and energy flows b to assess the state of ecological maturity of the system and c to assess the impact of the introduced carp species and d the current fishery on the other target and non target species of the lake koka ecosystem using the ecopath approach so as to pave the way to an ecosystem based fisheries management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and model description the tropical lake koka is located in the ethiopian rift valley 08 23 22 n 39 05 15 e at an altitude of 1 590 m above sea level which is about 90 km southeast of addis ababa fig 1 water in and outflow is mainly provided by the awash river in addition the mojo river may also generate inflow during the rainy season the lake has a large floodplain area in its western side and has a total surface area of about 255 km2 with a maximum and mean depth of 14 m and 9 m respectively vanden bossche and bernacsek 1991 its total surface area widely fluctuates between wet and dry season for the purpose of this study we considered an area of 200 km2 as estimated from the recent map from google earth and as kebede and belay 1994 also reported a similar figure the lake provides multiple services to the local communities and the country at large including fishing drinking water supply sanitation ecotourism irrigation hydropower generation and industrial purposes its fishery plays a key role in protein supply and livelihoods for many households and the mean annual landings for the past 11 years 2002 2012 was about 600 metric tons per year which is about 7 of the total annual landings in ethiopia tesfaye and wolff 2014 the target species of the artisanal fishery include the native tilapia o niloticus catfish clarias gariepinus b barbs labeobarbus intermedius r and the introduced common carp c carpio the common fishing gears used in lake koka include beach seines gillnets and longlines lfdp 1997 tesfaye and wolff 2015 the lake ecosystem also supports other non exploited species including small fishes garra denbecha and garra makiensis aquatic birds e g great white pelicans african fish eagles pied kingfishers great cormorants herons caspian gull larus cachinnans etc macroinvertebrates plankton and macrophytes typha arunda echinochola potamogeton cyprus and nymphea sp for this first trophic model 14 functional groups including detritus were identified table 1 these functional groups consist either of a single species genus different life stages of the species or multiple species groups with similar ecological niches diets body size and metabolic requirements of the fish groups the adult and juvenile tilapia and catfish were assigned to different functional groups due to their known ontogenetic diet shift engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 the three cyprinids carp labeobarbus and garra spp g denbecha and g makiensis were also assigned to different compartments as they differ in size habitat and diet all the macro invertebrates including insects heteroptera and ceratopogonidea benthic organisms chironomidea nematoda ostracoda and oligochaeta and gastropods freshwater snails were grouped in one functional group as zoobenthos due to lack of independent data for each taxa herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton was grouped separately the phytoplankton group includes blue green algae cyanophyta diatoms bacillariophyta green algae chlorophyta euglenoids and cryptomonads kebede and willén 1998 tesfay 2007 2 2 the modeling approach using ecopath with ecosim ewe software version 6 4 4 a mass balance trophic model of lake koka was constructed to quantify trophic interactions and energy flows among the compartments of the ecosystem this approach is based on two master equations one to describe the production term and the other one describes the consumption term the production term in ecopath is described as production is equal to the sum of fisheries catches predation mortality biomass accumulation net migration and other mortalities christensen et al 2005 put this in a more formal way as 1 b i p b i e e i b j q b j d c j i y i e i b a i where bi and bj are the biomass of prey group i and predator group j respectively p bi is the production biomass ratio of the prey group eei ecotrophic efficiency is the fraction of production that is consumed within the system by predation or caught from the system fishing exploitation yi is yield fisheries catch q bj is the food consumption per unit of biomass j and dcji the fraction of prey i in the diet of predator j ei the net migration rate emigration immigration bai is the biomass accumulation rate for prey i similarly the energy input and output of all living groups must be balanced and for this christensen and pauly 1992 christensen et al 2005 described the second master equation of ecopath as 2 q i p i r i u i where q is consumption p production r respiration and u unassimilated food of the ith group the two master equations together ensure the energy balance of each group 2 3 input parameters each functional group in the model requires as basic input parameters biomass b production to biomass ratio p b and consumption rate q b in addition the diet composition of each group needs to be known in order to construct the diet matrix for the model which connects all model compartments for the fishery targets of the system catch y is a further input to the model if one of the basic input parameters is unknown the model may estimate this unknown if the ecotrophic efficiency ee the fraction of the groups production used in the system is known or can be assumed christensen and pauly 1993 christensen et al 2005 the unit of time used in the model for the different rates is year 1 and for the biomass is t km 2 2 3 1 biomass b the biomass of fishery target fish groups was calculated using length based virtual population analysis vpa by tesfaye 2016 whereas b for non target species garra spp was estimated as follows a beach seine 100 m long and 2 m wide was used to sweep a semicircular area radius 20 m along the shoreline in five sampling occasions with a total of 15 hauls from november 2012 march 2013 this resulted in a mean catch of 1402 9 g per swept area 1256 m2 and hence a mean biomass of 1 117 t km2 was estimated since for catfish our b estimate from length based vpa was rather high 10 01 t km 2 and did not allow for a solid balancing of the model b was again estimated from the annual catch y and fishing mortality f obtained from tesfaye and wolff 2015 as b y f the resulting estimate of 3 2 t km 2 was then used together with that of the vpa to calculate the average of both 6 61 t km 2 the adult tilapia and catfish and their juveniles were represented separately using the multi stanza option in the ewe software the multi stanza representation allow to calculate the biomass of the juvenile groups using input parameters including the k value the von bertalanffy growth coefficient the q b ratio and the starting age in months for the adult groups and the p b ratio for both juvenile and adult groups using those input parameters table 2 and table 3 the b of juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia was calculated as 0 332 t km 2 and 1 049 t km 2 respectively the biomass of labeobarbus was calculated by the model assuming that ee equals 0 80 as the species is believed to be underexploited tesfaye 2016 here we also did some sensitivity analysis by changing the value of ee for labeobarbus group ee 0 70 0 90 to check if the model would be balanced without changing the value of other input parameters substituting the value of ee for labeobarbus group by the above range of values ee 0 8 12 5 didn t show significant effect on the model the model was balanced without changing any of the other parameters for other groups moreover it has no effect on the overall conclusion of the study either although decreasing ee by 12 5 for labeobarbus ee 0 7 has increased its biomass estimate by 14 which in turn increased the ee of its prey groups while increasing ee by 12 5 ee 0 9 would have reduced its biomass by only 11 which causes the ee of its prey groups to slightly decreased however in all cases the ee of all functional groups were less than 1 suggesting no effect on model balancing within the range and hence confirming the reliability of our assumed ee value for labeobarbus according to the birdlife international report about 20 000 aquatic birds are known to use lake koka as a feeding and resting ground http www birdlife org datazone sitefactsheet php id 6273 accessed on 11 04 2016 as their size varies widely e g average size kingfishers weigh up ca 350 g and great white pelicans ca 11 kg but they are usually fewer in abundance we assumed a mean weight of 1 kg for all species and sizes combined and hence the bird biomass in lake koka was roughly approximated as 0 10 t km 2 the mean phytoplankton biomass determined from chlorophyll a chl a concentrations from 24 samples conducted from october 2012 to january 2013 was estimated at 42 95 mg m 3 which exceeds earlier estimates of 13 5 mg m 3 kebede et al 1994 16 mg m 3 kebede and willén 1998 and 22 4 mg m 3 mesfin et al 1988 however since those reports were based on a survey of only one time sampling we used our estimate as input this estimate was then converted to a depth integrated value by multiplying with the euphotic depth 0 61 m and hence the model input of phytoplankton chl a was 26 2 mg m 2 this value was then converted to carbon with a conversion factor of 40 1 carbon to chl a ratio jones 1979 in order to convert to wet weight we used a conversion factor of 10 as suggested by jones 1979 which gave a biomass value of 10 48 g ww m 2 the most abundant zooplankton groups in lake koka include rotifers brachionus caudatus keratella quadrata keratella tropica and filinia sp cladocerans daphnia barbata and moina micrura and copepoda mesocyclops thermocyclops nauplii tropodiaptomus processifer and metadiaptomus colonialis mesfin et al 1988 degefu et al 2011 the biomasses of herbivores and carnivores zooplankton were taken from mavuti et al 1996 and fetahi and mengistou 2007 the mean biomass of macro invertebrates was estimated from 24 ekman grab bottom samples and 12 weed bed samples collected from november 2012 march 2013 and a mean of 28 9 g m 2 was obtained moreover biomass of macrophytes were measured following the procedure of fetahi and mengistou 2007 and was estimated at 183 4 t km 2 the detritus biomass d was calculated as a function of primary production and euphotic depth using christensen and pauly 1993 empirical model 3 log d 0 954 log p p 0 863 log e 2 41 where d is the detritus biomass g c m 2 pp the primary production g c m 2 year 1 e euphotic depth m euphotic depth was estimated from the secchi depth transparency measurement the secchi depth of lake koka is low due to suspended silt coming in by the river awash and we have measured a mean value of only 17 5 cm for 6 months but earlier reports estimated a higher value of 28 cm mesfin et al 1988 kebede et al 1994 we took our measured value 17 5 cm and converted to euphotic depth 0 61 m using holmes 1970 equation for turbid waters gross primary production was estimated at 0 056 0 154 g c m 2 hr 1 tesfay 2007 taking the mean of this values and assuming 10 h production period per day gave as 1 05 g c m 2 day 1 and 383 25 g c m 2 year 1 when this value is converted to wet weight the annual primary production is 3832 5 g ww m 2 year 1 substituting these values into the above equation gave the detritus biomass as 7 40 g c m 2 2 3 2 production biomass p b the production biomass ratio for birds 0 25 per year was adopted from moreau et al 1993a the total mortality rate z for the fish groups assumed to be equivalent to the p b ratio allen 1971 were estimated using length converted catch curves tesfaye and wolff 2015 while for non exploited fish groups juveniles and garra p b was assumed equal to m as f 0 and computed using pauly 1980 empirical equation using the production and biomass estimates given above allowed estimating the production rate p b for the phytoplankton as 365 8 per year whereas the p b for macrophytes 1 0 per year was taken from palomares et al 1993 a mean individual weight of 5 1 μg for mesocylops carnivore zooplankton and 0 8 μg dry weight for thermocyclops rotifers and cladoceras herbivores zooplankton were taken from dagne 2010 and then the p b ratio for herbivores and carnivores zooplankton were calculated using kuns and sprules 2000 equation as 4 log p b 0 73 0 23 log w c f 1 12 where p b is per day w is dry weight in mg and cf is a correction factor for the back transformation from logarithmic units and the computed value was then converted to annual rates furthermore the p b ratio for benthic organisms were estimated using brey 1999 empirical equation as 5 log p b 1 672 0 993 log 1 t max 0 0035 log w max 300 447 1 t 273 where tmax is the maximum age year wmax maximum body weight g dw and t temperature c maximum individual body weight 0 2 g and maximum age for zoobenthos 1 5 year was obtained from fetahi and mengistou 2007 and dry weight was assumed to be 20 of wet weight and hence p b equal 3 21 per year 2 3 3 diet composition and consumption rates q b the consumption per unit biomass for fish groups were estimated using the empirical model proposed by palomares and pauly 1998 6 log q b 7 964 0 204 log w 1 965 t 0 083 a r 0 532 h 0 398 d where q b is the consumption biomass rate year 1 w is the asymptotic weight g of the population t corresponds to 1000 t c 273 15 where t c is the water temperature ar is the aspect ratio of the caudal fin which is defined as ar h2 s where h is the height of the caudal fin mm and s is the surface area mm2 extending to the narrowest part of the caudal peduncle h and d are binary variables that define whether the predator is herbivorous h 1 d 0 detritivore h 0 d 1 or carnivore h 0 d 0 table 2 presents the input parameters used to compute q b with a similar procedure and input parameters for the multi stanza option in ewe the q b ratio of juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia was calculated as 16 41 per year and 58 56 per year consumption biomass ratio for zoobenthos was estimated based on assumed gross efficiency p q of 0 2 christensen and pauly 1993 which gave a value of 16 05 per year whereas q b for predatory birds was obtained from moreau et al 1993a and for herbivore and carnivore zooplankton was estimated by assuming the gross efficiency of 0 25 and 0 3 respectively the diet composition of the fish groups were compiled from diet analysis and from various literature sources dadebo et al 2013 engdaw et al 2013 dadebo et al 2014 2015 the diet matrix which shows the fraction of preys in the diet of predators for all consumer group is presented in table 1 2 3 4 fisheries yield y catch statistics for the fishery target fish groups tilapia catfish common carp and barbs for the period from 2002 to 2012 was obtained from the fisheries records at the national fisheries and aquatic life research center nfalrc then as ecopath requires input parameter to be in the form of rates t km 2 yr 1 the total annual yield for each fishery target functional group was converted to annual catch per unit area table 3 2 4 balancing the model ecotrophic efficiency ee and gross efficiency ge were used as a guide for balancing the model whereby ee values should not be larger than 1 and ge values should not exceed 0 3 christensen and pauly 1992 christensen et al 2005 whenever the ee values were greater than 1 initial values of uncertain parameters were slightly modified until the model was balanced as described in ecopath user s manual and other models e g kavanagh et al 2004 we have further considered other ecological and thermodynamic rules such as production to respiration p r and respiration to assimilation ratio r a whereby both parameters should not exceed 1 for balancing ecopath models darwall et al 2010 heymans et al 2016 2 5 trophic interaction and network analysis once the model was balanced a flow diagram was constructed a flow diagram shows the trophic interactions and the flow of food energy from one functional group to the other graphically different boxes representing each functional group of the ecosystem were arranged in hierarchy based on their computed trophic levels y axis along the x axis in such a way that they don t overlap the different groups then connected with networks showing their trophic interaction and energy flows christensen et al 2005 the concept of trophic level tl was introduced long ago by lindeman 1942 who assign integers or discrete values to the different producers and consumers of a system in ewe the tls are not necessarily integers 1 2 3 as proposed by lindeman but can be fractional e g 1 2 2 5 etc a routine in ewe assigns definitional trophic levels tl of 1 to producers and detritus and a trophic level of 1 the weighted average of the preys tl to consumers christensen et al 2005 in addition to the routine for calculation of fractional trophic levels a routine in ecopath aggregates the entire system into discrete trophic levels sensu lindeman christensen et al 2005 this analysis then allowed for calculation of trophic transfer efficiencies expressing how efficiently transfers are from one trophic level to the next to assess the state of the fishery mortality estimates were computed with the ewe routine and the exploitation rate were then calculated from computed fishing and total mortality rates moreover several network indices used as a measure of ecosystem development and maturity odum 1969 were computed 2 6 mixed trophic impact and niche overlap analysis the direct and indirect trophic impacts of a change in the biomass of a group that will have on the biomass of other groups in a system were graphically presented using the mixed tropic impact mti routine of ewe ulanowicz and puccia 1990 christensen et al 2005 an increase on the biomass of a predator group would result in a negative impact on its prey groups while positively impacting the prey of its preys through a reduction in predation pressure similarly groups that have similar trophic niches would have an impact on each other through competition for feed resources the ewe routine also allowed to quantify predator and prey niche overlaps christensen et al 2005 the impact of the introduced carp was assessed using these two measures the mti and niche overlap where it is assumed that larger mti and larger niche overlap values indicate greater impacts the impact of increasing the fishing pressure e g by 10 on fishery target and non target species was also assessed using the mti analysis as has been done for several systems fetahi and mengistou 2007 fetahi et al 2011 ruiz and wolff 2011 3 results 3 1 basic estimates of the balanced model the relative diet composition and summarized values of the basic inputs and the parameters computed for each functional group by the model are presented in table 1 and table 3 respectively while fig 2 presents the flow diagram showing the trophic relationships among groups the size of the circle in the flow diagram is proportional to the logarithm of the group s biomass the ecotrophic efficiency for fish eating birds was estimated as zero since they are a top predator the ee for detritus primary producers and adult catfish was low indicating that these resources are not fully utilized while other consumers showed moderate to high ee value suggesting that predation plays a significant role in regulating ecosystem structure and function the low ee value for primary producers also indicates that much of their production goes to the detritus box and might indicate high rate of organic waste production at the lower tls the estimated production consumption ratio also called gross efficiency falls within the acceptable range as does the production respiration ratio for all groups table 3 the total biomass of fishes and their catch was estimated at 19 24 t km 2 and 3 01 t km 2 respectively as expected the highest annual production and consumption rates were observed in zooplankton and zoobenthos groups where the herbivore zooplankton presented the highest rate of p 301 t km 2 year 1 and q 1203 t km 2 year 1 the food consumption of fish eating birds was also high 5 8 t km 2 year 1 almost doubling the catch of the fishermen the model also gave us estimates of fishing mortality predation and non predation mortality rates for fishery target groups from those estimates the exploitation rates e were then estimated as 0 308 0 316 0 221 and 0 012 for catfish tilapia carp and labeobarbus groups respectively as seen in fig 2 and table 3 the highest trophic level was estimated for fish eating birds tl 3 5 and for fishery target species the estimated tls ranges from 2 15 to 3 0 it was also apparent that juvenile tilapia presented higher tl than their own adult stages 2 66 and 2 15 respectively fig 2 indicating omnivores and herbivores feeding habits reflecting a clear ontogenetic dietary shift in this species however the tl difference between juvenile and adult catfish was not significant tl for both 3 0 although their diet composition differs table 1 much of the energy produced from primary producers flows to higher tls through herbivores zooplankton and herbivores fish while the energy from detritus goes to higher tls mainly through zoobenthos carp and moderately through adult catfish and labeobarbus fig 2 and table 1 the omnivory index oi was highest for catfish groups followed by juvenile tilapia and carp oi 0 5 suggesting their dietary plasticity while fish eating birds and herbivore zooplankton showed the lowest value oi 0 1 as the former feeds mainly on fish groups i e on similar tls and the later on phytoplankton the mean system omnivory index soi was estimated at 0 289 table 4 the adult tilapia and others who feed mainly on primary producers and detritus generally showed lower gross efficiency table 3 which might have resulted from the lower quality of their main diets phytoplankton macrophytes and detritus 3 2 flows transfer efficiency and system indices while the lindeman spine gave seven discrete tls for the lake koka ecosystem we only presented the first five tls here fig 3 since the last two receive very little energy the total flow to the detritus box was estimated at about 3176 t km 2 year 1 of which 85 comes from the primary producers which is due to the low ee value for phytoplankton and macrophytes table 3 however the proportion of trophic flows from detritus to consumers was only about a quarter 23 2 of all consumptions this is also evidenced with the low ee value and the finn s cycling index fci estimated for the system 2 23 of the total throughput and mean path length was 2 33 the transfer efficiency calculated as geometric mean from tl ii iv originated from producers was 12 8 while from detritus was 8 3 which gave a mean value of 12 0 from all flows the mean tl of the catch was estimated at 2 55 indicating that the fishery targets lower tls and the system fisheries gross efficiency catch net pp was estimated to be 0 08 the estimated value of p r and p b ratio of the system which are considered as measures of ecosystem development and maturity odum 1969 christensen 1995 and other summary statistics of the system are given in table 4 3 3 niche overlap and mixed trophic impact mti fig 4 presents the direct and indirect impact of an increase in the biomass of a group that would have on others and fig 5 shows the relative total impact of the impacting groups and the niche overlap of the groups an increase in the biomass of the top predators fish eating birds and adult catfish showed strong negative impact on most groups suggesting their important role as top down controllers of the system on the other hand an increase in phytoplankton and macrophytes production would positively impact most of the functional groups including the fishery target species as well as the fishery suggesting bottom up control the detritus group has also a direct positive impact to zoobenthos carp labeobarbus and others but have indirect negative impact on zooplankton and macrophytes resulting from the favorable condition for their predators furthermore all functional groups except detritus showed a negative impact to their own group indicating the existence of intraspecific competition for limited resources obviously increasing the fishing pressure would have negative impact on target species but favors non target species such as garra species of the primary consumers zoobenthos and herbivore zooplankton showed a stronger total relative negative impact than most fish groups figs 4 and 5a which is comparable to the impact of top predators fish eating birds and adult catfish in contrast although the carnivore zooplankton negatively impacted herbivore zooplankton and zoobenthos groups their overall relative impact in the system would be positive moreover it is interesting to note that the impact of the introduced carp species was not as significant as that of the native species such as tilapia catfish and labeobarbus species figs 4 and 5a this result of the mixed trophic impact was also supported by the results of predator prey niche overlap analysis fig 5b carp showed only moderate prey and predator overlap with juvenile tilapia juvenile catfish and adult catfish groups the highest predator prey overlap index is shown in compartment iii and the lowest in compartment ii whereas compartment i and iv show high prey overlap but with a low predator overlap index and low prey overlap but with a high predator overlap index respectively fig 5b accordingly the highest predator prey overlap index is shown between juvenile catfish and juvenile tilapia tilapia and catfish juveniles and their adult groups adult catfish and juvenile tilapia and between adult catfish and labeobarbus on the other hand the lowest niche overlap was observed between labeobarbus and carnivore zooplanktons and between adult catfish and carnivore zooplanktons while the highest prey overlap and predator overlap is observed between adult tilapia and garra and between labeobarbus and garra spp respectively 4 discussion of the trophic indices developed to characterize ecosystem maturity christensen 1995 selected nine out of 24 odum 1969 attributes and ranked 41 systems accordingly in immature ecosystems the total system p r ratio is either greater or smaller than one while the ratio of total system primary production to total biomass p b is high as primary production is notably high in immature systems however the p r approaches one and the p b value becomes smaller as ecosystems mature due to high biomass accumulation in the process christensen 1995 according to christensen and pauly 1993 the p r ratio ranges from 0 8 to 3 2 based on 41 ecopath models analysis and our estimated value p r 3 198 falls at the upper limit of this range suggesting that lake koka is a rather immature system table 4 which is further substantiated by the low value of the total biomass total throughput ratio b t the low value of respiration compared with the primary production and the estimated low value of ascendency 36 5 is also a confirmation thereof all the indices are consistent in showing that the lake koka ecosystem is in a developing state and confirming the robustness of the model the calculated pedigree index 0 67 further confirmed our model quality table 4 as suggested by christensen et al 2005 ecosystem maturity considered as the last state of succession odum 1969 is an important concept in ecology to understand ecosystem performance measured as productivity or stability bai et al 2004 as the system matures the diversity and food web complexity increases christensen 1995 lake koka being an immature system shows the characteristic features of developing ecosystems described by christensen 1995 pérez españa and arreguı n sánchez 1999 the estimated value of the total throughput t 9355 t km 2 year 1 table 4 which shows the size of the system in terms of total flows seems relatively low when compared to other tropical lakes of the region lake awassa a closed rift valley lake without any obvious outlet has almost double the size t 18 217 t km 2 year 1 fetahi and mengistou 2007 theoretically t tends to increase as the system develops christensen 1995 and this may therefore suggest that lake koka is younger in the development continuum or ecological succession process than lake awassa actually the geological time of lake koka is only about half a century tudorancea et al 1999 however its t value is comparable to other tropical immature inland water ecosystems such as lake kivu 6686 villanueva et al 2008 and ubolratana reservoir 9610 thapanand et al 2009 the low ee value for primary producers and detritus imply high rate of organic carbon loss at the lower tls in the system this might also explain the low overall ecological efficiency shown by the low fisheries gross efficiency catch net p p ratio table 4 however low gross efficiency is a common feature for young ecosystems christensen 1995 and similar low values were reported for lake awassa 0 0014 fetahi and mengistou 2007 ubolratana reservoir 0 0011 villanueva et al 2005 lake naivasha 0 0009 and lake ihema 0 0007 mavuti et al 1996 and other tropical lakes christensen and pauly 1993 slightly higher value of gross efficiency were reported for lake victoria 0 0082 after the introduction of nile perch that has believed to improve the productivity and ecological efficiency of the lake moreau et al 1993b and lake george 0 0057 moreau et al 1993a probably these later two lakes are approaching maturity however in terms of trophic flows into discrete tls sensu lindeman 1942 te of lake koka 12 0 falls within the reported range of highly efficient african inland water bodies te 10 15 christensen and pauly 1993 fetahi et al 2011 the low mean trophic level of the catch 2 55 is due to the fact that the fishery targets fish groups mostly belonging to tl ii and iii which is also the case for the mean trophic level of the catch of lake hayq 2 46 fetahi et al 2011 lake awassa 2 57 fetahi and mengistou 2007 lake pasak jolasid manmade lake in thailand 2 6 thapanand et al 2009 but higher values were also reported for lakes that have more diverse target fish species such as lake kivu 2 9 villanueva et al 2008 lake malawi 2 94 darwall et al 2010 lake kariba 2 97 machena et al 1993 and lake victoria 2 99 moreau et al 1993b these variations among the different lakes may also suggest that only in large developed lakes we would find a substantial biomass of high trophic level predatory species which may explain the higher mean trophic level of the catch in the later lakes the mixed trophic impact mti analysis figs 4 and 5a shows the importance of fish eating birds and catfish as top down controller with negative impacts on their prey species and the primary producers as bottom up controller favoring the herbivores and their consumers zooplankton and zoobenthos also show their role as a link in energy transfer between the primary producers and detritus to higher tropic levels respectively the results of mti analysis therefore clearly show how predation inter and intraspecific competition plays a role in regulating ecosystem structure and function mixed trophic impact has also been used to monitor the effect of fisheries across an ecosystem christensen et al 2005 cury et al 2005 which also unveils the negative impact of increasing the fishing pressure on the target species catfish tilapia carp and labeobarbus and its cascading effect on their prey species furthermore the mti contrary to what may be expected shows that the introduced carp species has only little impact on other fish groups figs 4 and 5a which could be attributed to its feeding habits and its low biomass compared to other target species such as catfish and labeobarbus table 3 although the finn s cycling index of the entire system is low 2 23 carp has a key role in recycling of materials through detritus consumption for its energy demand detritus constitutes some 40 of its dietary consumption table 1 dadebo et al 2015 carp thus fills the niche that has not yet been fully occupied by other functional groups moreover carp s ecological role is exemplified by its dietary contribution for fish eating birds and to some extent for catfish another target species with a higher economic value tesfaye 2016 it is also one of the most important species for local communities for food and cash income lfdp 1997 tesfaye and wolff 2015 the carp introduction to the lake could thus be considered as a success in this particular case unlike many other systems where fish introduction have caused series ecological and economic losses a frequently cited example is the introduction of nile perch lates niloticus in lake victoria where it has greatly affected the native fish species community kaufman 1992 witte et al 1992 the introduction of tilapia in some countries e g in lake nicaragua and lake apoyo in nicaragua mccrary et al 2001 and in madagascar reinthal and stiassny 1991 led to a reduction or replacement of native fish species and was considered in many instances as invasive canonico et al 2005 eby et al 2006 reviewed the impact of top predator fish introduction in freshwater wood webs and found out that introduction of top predators have either replaced native top predators or increased species richness of top predators as a result it is advised to restrict fish introductions only to controlled systems however on top of socioeconomic benefits there are also cases where fish introduction in open systems natural and manmade water bodies contribute to system maturity and stability e g tilapia introduction in lake hayq fetahi et al 2011 and tilapia and sardine species introduction in lake kivu villanueva et al 2008 a similar situation was found for the introduced tilapia species in the caribbean estuary cienaga grande of marta colombia where the species greatly benefited the fishermen but never outcompeted the native species leal flórez et al 2008 the total catch of all target species combined 3 t km 2 seems very small compared to other tropical lakes including lake hayq 4 8 t km 2 fetahi et al 2011 lake kariba 6 6 t km 2 machena et al 1993 lake awassa 12 1 t km 2 fetahi and mengistou 2007 and lake george 14 3 t km 2 moreau et al 1993a but its catch rate is higher than lake turkana 0 6 t km 2 kolding 1993 lake naivasha 2 15 t km 2 and lake ihema 2 66 t km 2 mavuti et al 1996 moreover as the estimated exploitation rates e for all fishery target groups are well below 0 5 a value considered as optimum level gulland 1965 and even lower than the recently used precautionary e value e 0 4 there is no indication of overfishing for any of the target species this suggests scope for some further fishery expansion as was also concluded from recent assessments by tesfaye and wolff 2015 and tesfaye 2016 the total standing fish stock b 19 24 t km 2 is about six times higher than the current catch rate and might also further suggest an overall state of under exploitation however caution needs to be taken here before implementing any development intervention for example the consumption of fish eating birds is high and almost twice the catch taken by the fishermen if these bird populations were to be sustained there is only limited possibility to expand fisheries exploitation possibly from carp and labeobarbus for both species ee 0 8 and e 0 2 a similar situation of high fish biomass consumption by fish eating birds like cormorants a species which also exist in lake koka was reported for other lake ecosystems buijse et al 1993 mavuti et al 1996 therefore this should be taken into consideration when one would seek further development of the fishery in lake koka to sum up in this first attempt of trophic modeling for lake koka we are able to describe the lake ecosystem and assess the stage of ecological maturity and the impacts of two common anthropogenic activities fishing and exotic species introduction in an ecosystem context however it is imperative to conduct further detailed studies to minimize all sources of bias to quantify the major taxa included in the zoobenthos group independently to consider insects and benthic fauna in different functional groups and to include the bacterial loop which is missing in the present study due to lack of data it should also be noted that some of the input parameters were adopted from other systems which could have introduced further bias to the model for instance for aquatic birds parameters such as p b q b and diet information were taken from similar systems which even ignored the diet fractions of insects and other items of possible importance for the diet these limitations and information gaps should be addressed first if one would consider further fish introductions or other management interventions nevertheless the present model can be used as a baseline reference for future models that would consider spatial and temporal dynamics of the lake ecosystem in this continuously changing climate and environment so as to pave the way to ecosystem based fisheries management and sustain fish stocks ecosystem services as well as ecological integrity acknowledgements the study was financed by the
