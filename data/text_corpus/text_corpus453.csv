2265,the magnitude and variability of floods have increased for many nontidal streams on long island li ny since the mid 20th century one of the most densely populated regions of the united states li has experienced amplified floods in step with increases in impervious land cover storm and sanitary sewers that have accompanied urban development to better understand the drivers of observed flood trends and effects of urbanization a nonstationary flood frequency analysis is conducted using historical annual peak flow records from 17 gaged watersheds on li using conditional moments based on physical covariates from a two stage sequential robust linear regression procedure regression results indicate that urban development and precipitation are significant co predictors of peak flows for li watersheds that have undergone rapid development during the available peak flow record in watersheds with less intense urbanization or that were fully developed before the peak flow record began precipitation alone was a significant explanatory variable long term baseflow patterns identified using a nonparametric smoother explained some patterns of decreasing peak flows and heteroskedasticity

framework compared with stationary under current watershed conditions and differ significantly 95 confidence from stationary estimates for 6 out of 17 watersheds larger floods corresponding to 1 aeps do not differ significantly between nonstationary and stationary estimates at a 95 confidence level nonmonotonic trends observed in two watersheds indicate that recent stormwater management practices such as rerouting stormwater outfalls away from the channel substantially reduce flood frequency reduced nonstationary flood quantile estimates at these two watersheds are 20 to 40 lower than stationary estimates when accounting for changing watershed conditions over time across li stormwater management and water table fluctuations have increased peak flow variability characteristic of a late phase urban adjustment period on li results of this study demonstrate that a nonstationary framework is a necessary step forward toward a regional flood frequency analysis for li this nonstationary framework will allow flood managers to update flood discharge estimates to current conditions that reflect altered relationships between urban cover and climate for more targeted

mediero et al 2014 and anthropogenic drivers such as urbanization and reservoir construction lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 urbanization has led to some of the most pronounced changes in flood magnitude over time revealing stronger evidence for trends and nonstationarities when compared with the impacts of climate vogel et al 2011 yang et al 2021 in the northeastern us ne cities are densely populated and require adaptations to drainage infrastructure that may be more than a century old alexandre 2018 kessler 2011 zimmerman and faris 2010 annual instantaneous peak flow records henceforth referred to as annual peak flows in cities across the ne have generally shown positive trends during periods of rapid development that exceed ones in non urban areas driven primarily by precipitation hodgkins et al 2019 vogel et al 2011 to counteract this urban flood management has expanded over recent decades to include considerations of environmental impact sustainability and climate resilience bierbaum et al 2013 sörensen et al 2016 and consequently has curtailed the flood magnification impacts of new urban development bertrand krajewski 2021 modern stormwater management along with more traditional flood control measures and structures such as retention detention and bypass channels have all had a measurable dampening effect on runoff produced by smaller rain events however their flood attenuation impacts on larger events are limited by their capacity for infiltration and storage giese et al 2019 gilroy and mccuen 2009 jarden et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 extreme precipitation has increased more rapidly in the ne than any other region of the us since the 1970s hoerling et al 2016 the increased number of intense rain events in this region has been largely associated with tropical storms and tropical moisture although there has also been an increase in the number of convective and extratropical storms howarth et al 2019 the current record for 24 hour rainfall totals in new york state was set in august of 2014 when a slow moving frontal system produced more than 13 in of rain across central long island grumm et al 2018 this storm also generated record rainfall totals across the baltimore dc area new jersey and new england curtis 2017 all cmip5 climate scenarios project the frequency of such intense precipitation events will continue to increase in the ne over the next century ning et al 2015 and the urbanized areas of long island will be particularly vulnerable to flooding shepard et al 2012 in this study the historical impacts of urbanization on flood frequency were examined across gaged watersheds on long island ny li which is the largest and most populous island in the us and is located just east of new york city historical urbanization patterns across li combined with its unique groundwater driven hydrology have produced dramatic changes in annual peak flows over more than a half century of available data simmons and reynolds 1982 seaburn 1969 to characterize these changes in peak flow physical covariates were considered as drivers of change in distributional moments to produce new adjusted estimates of flood frequency that reflect current conditions of climate and urban development due to the complexity of trends and patterns in peak flows there are currently no flood frequency studies that have included li in a regional analysis e g lumia et al 2006 despite a great need to characterize flood risk for nearly eight million people island wide official guidelines for flood frequency analysis in the us depend on the assumption of stationarity where the parameters of the underlying distribution of floods do not vary with time england et al 2019 recently much attention has gone to detecting and modelling nonstationarity in flood series as well as discussion about whether these methods are necessary or appropriate salas et al 2018 and references therein it has been argued that stationarity should be the default premise held when assessing hydrologic change because inherent stochastic components of natural processes do not justify the increased uncertainty introduced by more complex models montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 long term internal persistence in the hydrologic record can often be mistaken for a temporal trend due to climate change lins and cohn 2011 and relying on time as an explanatory factor does not allow for predictions of future conditions rather than solely relying on time as a covariate techniques that incorporate physical covariates as explanatory variables are particularly useful when they indicate underlying physical processes driving the nonstationary behavior such as population growth and urban extent prosdocimi et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 the choice of covariates in nonstationary flood frequency analysis nsffa should be physically associated with flood generation as they impact the predictability of future design floods yan et al 2019 covariates that predict changes in distributional moments have included population associated variables villarini 2009 as well as indices representing reservoir construction and storage lopez and frances 2013 and precipitation hesarkazzazi et al 2021 impervious fraction has been shown to be an important component of nsffa for urbanizing watersheds blum et al 2020 hecht and vogel 2020 prosdocimi et al 2015 serago and vogel 2018 historical changes in impervious cover can be estimated from population or housing density oudin et al 2018 aerial imagery and topographic mapping miller and grebby 2014 or satellite based observations e g kaspersen et al 2015 although the connectivity and nature of impervious cover in a watershed can dramatically impact flood behavior shuster et al 2005 these properties are difficult to estimate without simulating rainfall runoff relationships or including site specific sewer network data ebrahimian et al 2016 yang et al 2011 although not representative of the connectivity of impervious surfaces using estimates of total impervious cover as a rough approximation for urbanization can yield useful predictions of peak flow sohn et al 2020 this study includes the urban to natural land cover gradient of li to examine the drivers of observed changes in annual peak flows and how those changes may affect flood frequency through a nonstationary analysis two stages of robust regression adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 were used to sequentially estimate the mean stage one and variance stage two of log transformed annual peak flows for 17 gaged watersheds that have undergone different phases of urban development since 1940 multiple covariates including impervious cover precipitation totals and long term water table fluctuations were considered in describing changes in flood magnitude location and variability scale across li selected regression models were used to detrend the peak flow series for each watershed according to each year of record and use the updated moments to fit a log pearson iii distribution as used by england et al 2019 to estimate and compare flood quantiles value of discharge for a given annual exceedance probability with a stationary analysis stationary flood quantiles were compared with nonstationary quantile estimates by using 95 confidence intervals to evaluate the uncertainties associated with record length and sampling variability and the flood frequency framework defers to stationary where there is confidence interval overlap 2 study area li spans 120 miles from the new york city metropolitan area to its easternmost point in semi rural suffolk county it is surrounded by long island sound to the north the peconic estuary to the east the atlantic ocean to the south and the new york new jersey harbor estuary to the west li s topography is dominated by two glacial moraines that rise to approximately 400 feet above sea level and comprise the north and south forks to the east and a gently sloping outwash plain that extends southward to the atlantic ocean li s topographic divide is shown by the north vs south draining watershed delineations in fig 1 unconsolidated cretaceous and pleistocene age deposits underlie the island and form the lloyd magothy and upper glacial aquifers interbedded with raritan and gardiners clay confining units mcclymonds and franke 1972 the upper glacial aquifer generally consists of glacial moraine deposits and a broad outwash plain that contains the majority of li s southward draining streams buxton and modica 1992 and forms the unit that provides most freshwater streams across the island with perennial flow cohen et al 1968 under pre development conditions prior to 1960 li s south shore streamflows were predominantly groundwater discharge with base flow comprising 90 to 95 of total annual streamflow reynolds 1982 compared with more than 9 000 gaged basins across the continental us in the gages ii database falcone 2011 the base flow indices bfi of most li streams are higher than the 99th percentile of average bfi values for the rest of the country except for a few watersheds in western li counties that are in the north shore headlands or have undergone sanitary sewering and groundwater extraction simmons and reynolds 1982 this study focuses on historical peak flows from li s two largest counties suffolk county to the east and the more heavily urbanized nassau county to the west fig 1 due to limited peak flow data availability this study excludes the two more densely populated kings and queens counties that make up the new york city boroughs of brooklyn and queens the total population for nassau and suffolk counties is approximately 2 83 million 2019 https www census gov which has increased by more than 250 since 1940 since the 1940 s the introduction of sanitary sewers and impervious surfaces have contributed to base flow depletion of more than 60 for portions of nassau county reynolds 1982 groundwater levels have been further reduced through pumping to provide nassau and suffolk counties sole water supply for residents agriculture and industry the introduction of sanitary sewers beginning in the early part of the 20th century has exacerbated base flow losses across the island particularly in urbanized areas where the hydrologic response to precipitation has become increasingly flashy simmons and reynolds 1982 these base flow losses become less pronounced eastward into suffolk county where most of the land cover is forested suburban or agricultural prince 1981 li experiences a coastal humid continental climate with warm humid summers and cool winters that bring rain and some snow cold season precipitation consists of northeast tracking systems that originate in the southern portions of the continental us and generally have long durations with high amounts of rain ice and snow busciolano 2005 average winter temperatures remain at or above freezing and snow accumulation is short lived and does not contribute to major rain on snow flooding events wachowicz et al 2020 during the warm season flash flooding can arise from convective summer thunderstorms that form over the mainland and track northeastward with cold fronts or in local regions of instability li is also vulnerable to high amounts of rainfall produced by tropical cyclones which may be accompanied by damaging winds and storm surge miller and frederick 1969 some orographically produced precipitation is concentrated over the morainal highlands where precipitation intensities are increased by up to 40 as compared to lower lying areas colle and yuter 2007 flood management across nassau and suffolk counties consists of a combination of open channel and pipe drainage systems and thousands of recharge and leaching basins that were constructed as early as the 1930 s to intercept flood waters and reroute them to the subsurface in areas where the water table is sufficiently deep below the surface seaburn and aronson 1974 recharge and leaching basins drain most commercial developments and highways on li and are generally designed to contain the runoff from a two to five inch rainfall event these design criteria vary by regulating agency and location and require periodic maintenance to sustain their function nassau county department of public works ncdpw 2019 new york state 2019 flood waters that are captured and conveyed by storm sewers can berouted to these basins or discharged directly to streams depending on their location with respect to the water table ku and simmons 1986 recharge basins have significantly altered the timing and distribution of groundwater recharge across li but their effect on flood peak and base flow hydrology is difficult to isolate from other effects of urbanization ku and aaronson 1992 3 data annual maximum instantaneous streamflow and daily average streamflow were accessed using the r package dataretrieval de cicco et al 2018 from the u s geological survey s usgs national water information system database https waterdata usgs gov nwis for all available gaged streams in nassau and suffolk counties peak streamflows for continuous and discontinued gages were included for this analysis if the gaged record length was more than 30 years selected watersheds are listed in table 1 and shown in fig 1 streamflow data were included from water years 1940 through 2020 with an average record length of 68 years annual peak flows that had a usgs qualification code of 3 discharge affected by dam failure and 6 discharge affected by regulation or diversion were excluded from this analysis however peak flows that were code 5 discharges of unknown regulated conditions were included in the analysis because the effects of regulation on these peaks was assumed to be small https help waterdata usgs gov codes and parameters four of the gaged watersheds on li usgs streamgages 01304000 01304500 01305000 and 01308500 contain dams constructed before 1950 with storage equivalent to less than 2 of total annual flow table 2 and they were interpreted as having only slightly regulated conditions likely to minimally impact high flow events however peaks with code 6 were assumed to have been affected by larger more significant modifications to natural hydrologic regimes and only occur for select peaks at station 6 carmas river at yaphank usgs station 01305000 all peaks included in this analysis were instantaneous annual flows except for two watersheds that contain annual maximum daily average discharge code 1 for each available water year usgs streamgages 01306500 and 01310000 flood frequency estimates for these watersheds are likely underestimated due to the smoothing effect of daily values bartens and haberlandt 2021 watershed characteristics of the 17 watersheds included in the analysis are shown in table 2 including the hydrologic disturbance index hdi falcone et al 2011 which is an indicator of human influence on basin hydrology the hdi for each watershed summarizes major anthropogenic stressors including dam density and storage 1950 2006 landscape fragmentation and freshwater withdrawal estimates the hdi for watersheds across the us ranges from 0 to 56 with values below 12 considered to be relatively pristine watersheds falcone et al 2011 the hdi for 17 li watersheds range from 14 to 22 indicating that despite the wide gradient of impervious cover all the watersheds are impacted by human activity as a potential explanatory variable in this study we used precipitation in mm corresponding to the month of peak flow summed with the total precipitation for the month prior to the flood ppt this two month precipitation total is representative of both event precipitation and recent one month antecedent rainfall time series of ppt were compiled using the gridded monthly precipitation model outputs from the prism climate group https prism oregonstate edu prism rasters were resampled from 4 km to 800 m resolution and clipped to each watershed boundary using r packages raster and rgdal bivand et al 2015 hijmans et al 2015 values within each boundary were spatially averaged and summed as two month totals in mm annual cumulative stream baseflow runoff was used as a representation of groundwater levels in the uppermost unconfined units underlying each stream although fluctuations of baseflow on daily or monthly timescales are also representative of other processes such as stream discharge augmentation from holding ponds the total annual baseflow mm closely resembled water table fluctuations observed in wells with long term data available particularly during periods of pumping sanitary sewer construction and recovery figure s1 baseflow separation of mean daily streamflow was done using the r package hydrostats bond 2020 which utilizes a lynne hollick filter to separate daily streamflow data into baseflow and quick flow components an alpha filtering parameter value of 0 975 ladson et al 2013 was used which allows for variation across multiple passes of the filter on the daily streamflow data to represent the long term drawdowns and recovery in baseflow due to human activity annual baseflow totals for each watershed were filtered using a nonparametric friedman super smoother friedman 1984 in base r software the friedman smoothing method is a locally regressive smoother that automates the smoothing span selection using cross validation a maximized low frequency emphasis term of 10 was used to fit the smooth segments to multi decadal patterns in shallow groundwater across li such as the long term pumping and recovery observed in nassau county and the introduction of sanitary sewers across the island this smoother removes the higher frequency signals in the data that may be attributed to changes in precipitation reduces or eliminates collinearity between base flow and precipitation and reveals longer term patterns more indicative of anthropogenic groundwater activity on li smoothed or long term indices representing both climatic oscillations i e li et al 2015 machado et al 2015 and proxies for anthropogenic impacts i e li and tan 2015 lopez and frances 2013 neri et al 2019 have been used as covariates in previous studies of nonstationary flood frequency however smoothed indices representative of modifications to the water table have not yet been used to describe changes in flood distribution parameters historical changes in total impervious area ia were computed according to methods described in oudin et al 2018 using housing density data from the 2000 us census theobald 2005 which is available starting in 1940 and includes predicted values for 2010 and 2020 the housing density data were reclassified into impervious percentages for each pixel resampled clipped and averaged for each watershed decadal ia values were then linearly interpolated to yearly timesteps for each watershed under the assumption of constant inter decadal population growth time in the form of water year corresponding to peak flows was included as a covariate with ia and used to represent the effect of unknown watershed changes such as changes in stormwater management and construction of recharge and leaching basins although including time as a covariate prevents extrapolation to future flood conditions and does not attribute flood changes to a specific driver serinaldi and kilsby 2015 time as a significant predictor can account for the complexities of urban flood response and locate areas where stormwater management may have a significant impact on local hydrology an interaction term was included to represent the interaction between urban development ia and time we hypothesize that depending on the stage of urban development early vs late the effects of urbanization on peak flows may change due to more modern flood management practices that consider changes in climate and emphasize sustainability pour et al 2020 4 methods 4 1 flood frequency estimation the logarithms of the annual instantaneous peak flow series y were fit to a log pearson iii lp3 distribution characterized by its mean µ standard deviation σ and skewness γ griffis and stedinger 2007 the distribution was parameterized with both unconditional stationary and conditional nonstationary moments of mean and standard deviation while the skewness was calculated from the peak flow data after the conditional adjustment of the first two moments potentially influential low outliers were not evaluated in this study and all potential outliers were kept in the analysis with the exception of one low peak flow at station 17 watershed 17 valley stream usgs 01311500 this outlier in log space is more than four standard deviations below the stationary mean of the series and was dropped from this analysis this particular flood occurred in 1965 during a drought that rendered the channel dry and may not be characteristic of the full flow regime of valley stream results for valley stream including this outlier are located in supplemental figures s2 s4 when assumed stationary flood quantile estimates for each of the 17 watersheds in this study take the form 1 q p e x p μ k p σ where the frequency factor kp is a function of skewness and standard normal quantiles england et al 2019 to estimate flood quantiles based on assumptions of a nonstationary mean and or standard deviation conditional moments are substituted into equation 1 2 q p ω e x p μ y ω k p σ y ω where qp ω represents the flood quantile in cfs conditioned on a combination of covariate s ω the conditional mean µy ω and standard deviation σy ω of the log transformed peak series are estimated by a two stage regression procedure hecht and vogel 2020 outlined in section 2 3 the adjusted skewness was calculated based on a standardized version of the flood series following debele et al 2017 and serago and vogel 2018 first the log transformed flood series is standardized as follows 3 z i y i μ y ω σ y ω where zi represents the standardized observations that have been detrended according to the conditional mean and standard deviation of the log transformed peak series using the standardized peak series zi a skewness estimate γ is calculated according to tasker and stedinger 1986 with a bias correction factor according to equation 4 4 g 1 6 n γ 1 6 n n i 1 n z i z 3 n 1 n 2 s 3 where n is the number of observations z and s are the sample mean and standard deviation of of the standardized observations zi the frequency factor kp was estimated based on a single at site skewness g computed in 4 using the wilson hilferty transformation 1931 as follows 5 k p g 2 γ 1 g z p 6 g 2 36 3 2 g where zp is the pth percentile of a standard normal distribution this transformation is appropriate for skew coefficients that have an absolute value less than three kirby 1972 which is well within the range of estimated skew coefficients in this investigation see fig 6 4 2 conditional moments multivariate robust regression was used to associate changes in flood frequency distribution parameters with covariates indicative of changes in precipitation two month precipitation ppt water table levels smoothed baseflow bf used as a surrogate land cover impervious area ia and time robust regression is a form of iteratively weighted least squares where points furthest from the model prediction are down weighted making it less sensitive to outliers and skewed data than ordinary least squares a huber penalty function and at least five iterations were used that converges on regression estimates through m estimation see rousseeuw and leroy 2005 for a comprehensive description of robust regression methods all analyses were carried out using r statistical software v4 1 2 r core team 2021 and robust regression models were fit via the rlm function in the mass r package ripley et al 2013 a two stage sequential regression approach was adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 and employed to update estimates of the mean stage one and variance stage two of the log transformed annual instantaneous peak streamflow for all 17 watersheds included in this study the conditional moments from the regression models were fit to a log pearson iii distribution with a skewness calculation limited to at site sample skewness because a regional estimate of skew does not yet exist estimates of flood quantiles using conditional moments were compared to flood frequency estimates under a stationary assumption for all watersheds using bootstrapped 95 confidence intervals described below in section 4 3 the following assumptions were considered for each watershed adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 st stationary assumption ns hom assumption of nonstationarity with homoscedastic variance ns het assumption of nonstationarity with heteroscedastic variance in the first stage regression the estimate of conditional mean μ y ω for models 2 and 3 takes the form 6 y ω β 0 β 1 x 1 β n x n ε ω 7 μ y ω e y ω where y ω are the log transformed annual instantaneous peak flows conditioned on covariates ω ε ω are the residuals associated with the selected regression model and covariates ω are represented by x1 xn and regression coefficients β1 βn candidate models included all combinations of the three covariates representative of physical watershed processes up to a maximum of two explanatory variables per model 1 two month precipitation totals ppt mm 2 annual smoothed baseflow runoff bf mm 3 total impervious area ia combinations of these variables were limited to a maximum of two terms across regression models in favor of parsimony and to accommodate smaller sample sizes watersheds 8 and 10 n 42 and 31 respectively two additional models were added that include ia and a time trend both with model 9 and without model 8 an interaction term to account for the hypothesized conditional association between early vs late urbanization and peak streamflows the nine models that were considered for both the stage one and stage two regression procedures are shown in table 3 the homoscedastic variance ns hom σ ε 2 of each series was computed as an estimate of variance with a bias correction factor around the stage one regression fit in 6 using the following equation 8 σ ε 2 1 n p 1 i 1 n ε ω 2 where n is the sample size p is the number of parameters in the selected stage one regression model and εω are the regression residuals from equation 6 the heteroskedastic model variance ns het was calculated with stage one regression residuals which largely follow a normal distribution not shown the square of normally distributed residuals results in an approximate chi square distribution which can be transformed back to approximately normal by subsequently raising the squared residuals to the 1 3 power which is referred to as an anscombe transformation anscombe 1961 this transformation has been used in hydrometeorological studies to transform residuals of generalized linear models to follow a nonnegative normal distribution e g chandler and wheater 2002 hecht and vogel 2020 kigobe et al 2011 in this study anscombe transformed squared residuals a total power transformation of 2 3 become the dependent variable in the second stage robust regression equation 9 9 ε ω 2 3 α 0 α 1 x 1 α n x n φ ω where ε ω 2 3 are the anscombe transformed squared residuals from equation 6 and is a function of ω the combination of covariates x1 to xn the error term for equation 9 is shown as φ ω coefficients of the second stage regression model are shown as α0 αn and x1 xn represent the covariate or combination of covariates evaluated for each watershed the expected value of the stage one anscombe transformed residuals was then used to estimate σ y ω 2 as the conditional variance of log transformed peak flows according to equation 10 which accounts for the error term in equation 9 see equation 15 in hecht and vogel 2020 for derivations 10 σ y ω 2 ε ω 2 3 3 3 σ φ 2 ε ω 2 3 whereas regression equations 6 and 9 were fit using the annual ppt values predictions were obtained using the long term precipitation trend for other predictors the same data were used for both fitting and prediction the ppt trend model was calculated by robust regression ppt t x0 x1 t e to represent average ppt conditions for any given year shown in fig 3 this approach was taken to adjust the 1 to 20 percent aep flood flows to long term conditions instead of year to year fluctuations this approach also prevents frequency estimates from being too low for short duration droughts or a single dry year it should be noted that further investigation may be needed to assess whether these are secular trends and not a component of multi decadal oscillations for flood frequency estimates that are being used to design new infrastructure current conditions may or may not reflect the anticipated conditions over the future planning horizon 4 3 model selection and diagnostics graphical inspection and exploratory analysis show that li s base flow dominated streams do exhibit some autocorrelation in the peak flow series as well as some heteroskedasticity that is investigated in this study to address the autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity the significance of each coefficient was determined using heteroscedastic autocorrelation consistent hac robust standard errors using the vcovhac function in the r package sandwich zeileis et al 2021 which uses andrews weighted variance estimators andrews 1991 a global wald test r package aod lesnoff et al 2010 was applied using the hac covariance matrix estimator to assess the overall significance of each regression model wald test p values below the chosen significance level of α 0 05 indicate that the candidate model offers an improvement in fit over the null model h0 the coefficients of the model are equal to zero the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 is a function of the model likelihood given the input data and favors parsimonious models more than a similar measure the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 both the bic and small sample adjusted aicc criteria hurvich and tsai 1989 are included in the supporting information tables s1 s34 for each candidate model across all 17 watersheds in this study given the same number of observations across all candidate models the minimum aicc or bic indicates the model that best explains the variance in the data a difference of less than 2 between a candidate model and the model with the lowest information criterion indicates that both the candidate model and the model with the lowest bic have strong support of being the best approximating model and should be investigated further burnham and anderson 2004 for this study selection criteria for stage one and stage two regressions were 1 the hac adjusted 95 confidence intervals for each coefficient excluding the intercept do not include zero 2 the difference bic value for that model was less than 2 and 3 the wald test p value was less than the chosen significance level of α 0 05 if more than one model met these selection criteria the model with fewer terms was chosen in favor of parsimony the best fitting lp3 frequency models under both the stationary and nonstationary frameworks and selection criteria were evaluated for goodness of fit by the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc test adjusted for application to nonstationary data as described by serago and vogel 2018 the ppcc test statistic is the product moment correlation coefficient between the sorted standardized observations and the corresponding sorted lp3 variate each log transformed peak flow series of the 17 watersheds was standardized by subtracting the conditional mean then dividing by the conditional standard deviation for each nonstationary case ns hom or ns het and using the unconditional moments in the stationary case st for models that contained ppt as an explanatory variable conditional moments were calculated using the linear fit of the long term ppt time trend as explained in section 4 2 skewness for each nonstationary case was calculated after standardization using equation 4 a ppcc hypothesis test was then conducted where the null hypothesis h0 is that the series does not follow an lp3 distribution and the alternate hypothesis ha is that the data do follow a lp3 distribution significance was evaluated at α 0 05 and p values were calculated in r using the ppcc package pohlert et al 2020 nonstationary flood quantiles were calculated using regression model predictions from each year of the peak flow record resulting in a time series of changing flood frequency from 1940 to the most recent year of record then to examine flood frequency for the most current conditions an updated stationary estimate is discussed rather than extrapolating trends into the future using the most recent year of record following recommendations by luke et al 2017 the comparison of non stationary estimates with stationary estimates was made using confidence intervals confidence intervals were calculated by a parametric bootstrapping procedure where 2000 random samples were generated from the fitted lp3 distribution with the same size as the historical dataset nonstationary frequency estimates were considered to be significantly different from stationary estimates for segments of the frequency curve that had nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals although this decision rule can be modified to include elements of risk tolerance from each random sample location and scale parameters were re estimated by method of moments resulting in 95 confidence intervals for each flood quantile estimate kyselý 2008 the use of the parametric bootstrap or monte carlo procedure to develop confidence intervals around frequency estimates is recommended in the most recent federal hydraulic engineering circular hec 17 kilgore et al 2016 as an effective practical technique that does not involve complicating assumptions e g

period of rapid development rd of more than 8 per decade indicated by red shading in fig 2 fig 2 also shows that the rd period is earlier toward the western portion of the island between 1940 and 1960 watershed numbers 15 17 while rapid development occurred later in the central watersheds 11 14 during 1950 to 1965 and eastern watersheds 4 6 7 and 9 10 during 1960 to 1980 peak flow records at most of the 17 gages generally overlap with rd periods except for watershed 17 usgs station 01311500 and watershed 8 usgs station 01306460 where rapid development was slightly less than 8 growth per decade according to the ia time series used in this study these two gages were established after rapid watershed development and peak flows are representative of more fully developed conditions precipitation

the wald test p value was less than 0 05 in the case where ia was considered along with time an interaction term was added to account for the early vs late stage effects of urban development on flooding model 9 table 3 for watershed 1 glen cove usgs 01302500 convergence was not achieved for the interaction term through the robust regression procedure and so for this watershed model 9 was dropped from consideration selected models for stage one and stage two regressions for the 17 watersheds are shown in tables 4 and 5 with all candidate model diagnostics included in tables s1 s34 all 17 watersheds had stage one nonstationary models with significant predictors impervious area ia was a significant predictor of the conditional mean of log transformed flows for 8 out of 17 watersheds all with positive coefficient two month precipitation ppt was found to be a significant predictor of conditional mean in 14 out of 17 watersheds with positive coefficients and smoothed baseflow bf was a significant predictor with positive coefficients for two watersheds for stage one and one watershed for stage two with a negative coefficient the interaction term between time and ia was found to be significant for watersheds 7 negative coefficient and 13 positive coefficient in the stage two regression three watersheds that exhibited heteroskedasticity had ia as a predictor in watersheds 6 and 7 ia was the sole predictor of heteroskedasticity with a positive coefficient whereas for watershed 14 the ia coefficient was negative for watershed 12 the selected stage two regression model had ppt and bf as significant predictors both with negative coefficients for the selected models for watersheds 7 and 13 usgs stations 01305500 and 01309500 time was a co predictor with ia along with a significant interaction term between the two variables the significant interaction term in these models indicates that the effect of urbanization on peak flows depends on the time or phase of urbanization 1940 1960 versus 1960 1980 the negative time coefficient in the stage one regression models results in predictions that have a negative trend during later periods of basin development resulting in a nonmonotonic pattern of increasing then subsequently decreasing annual peak flows fig 2 the collinearity between ia and time in these models not shown causes the individual coefficients to be misleading with respect to individual effect sizes the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable however previous investigations using monte carlo simulations have shown that ordinary least squares regression with multicollinear predictors still provides reliable model predictions in the presence of multicollinearity particularly for sample sizes larger than 20 kroll and song 2013 5 3 frequency model comparison for all watersheds regardless of their percentage of impervious area nonstationary candidate models were selected for comparison alongside their stationary counterparts if the selected stage two regression model was intercept only no significant predictors then the nonstationary candidate model was selected as homoscedastic ns hom if the stage two regression selection revealed significant predictors the candidate nonstationary model was selected as heteroskedastic ns het fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of flood frequency of the 20 and 1 aep floods for watersheds 2 7 and 11 these three watersheds represent both ns hom and ns het model fits that have both overlapping and nonoverlapping confidence intervals with stationary models for the 20

figure s2 annual instantaneous peak flows at watershed 2 usgs station 01303000 mill neck creek fig 5a and d were explained by the 2 month precipitation totals ppt but flood quantile estimates under a nonstationary framework did not significantly differ from stationary for recent years overlapping 95 confidence intervals despite the increasing trend in ppt at watershed 7 usgs station 01305500 swan river fig 5b and e annual instantaneous peak flow was best described by the interaction of ia and time for this watershed nonstationary flood quantile estimates have decreased since they had reached their maximum in the 1990 s after the period of rapid development flood variability in this watershed was modeled as nonstationary heteroskedastic ns het increasing also as a function of ia following the model selection criteria outlined in section 4 3 fig 5c and f displays the stationary and nonstationary models for watershed 11 usgs station 01308000 sawampams creek which was modeled to have a constant variance as well as ia and ppt to predict the mean of log transformed peak flows both the swan river and sawampam s creek contain at least one segment of the flood frequency curve with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals between stationary and nonstationary models under 2020 conditions fig 5 fig 6 compares the mean standard deviation and skewness estimates under a stationary x axis and nonstationary y axis framework for the most recent year of record for most of the li watersheds under current conditions the mean of log transformed peak flows was higher under a nonstationary framework fig 6a whereas most watersheds saw a decrease in the standard deviation fig 6b after adjusting for nonstationarity a phenomenon to be expected in cases of ns hom where the mean of the data is accounted for in the trend term of the nonstationary model skew estimates generally increased for the most recent year of record fig 6c after nonstationary adjustment associated with a lower variance in the denominator of equation 4 the percent difference between the stationary and nonstationary flood quantile estimates for the most recent year of record are shown in fig 7 for select aeps blue orange shading indicates that the nonstationary estimate is higher lower than the stationary estimate with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals cis all nonoverlapping cis between stationary and nonstationary estimates occurred for waterhsheds where ia was found to be explanatory in the stage one regression with the exception of one watershed where the nonstationary estimate ns was lower than the stationary estimate st for all aeps shown cis tended to overlap in most cases particularly at lower exceedance probabilities 2 and 1 percent aep larger floods indicating that with these record lengths nonstationary estimates of larger floods are not significantly different than stationary estimates the overlapping 95 cis for larger floods indicate that at this level of confidence and data availability the parsimonious approach would be to assume stationarity depending on the needs of the water manager and their level of risk for over or under design smaller floods with aeps greater than 5 are well positioned for nonstationary adjustment because they are associated with less uncertainty and in many cases are significantly different from stationary estimates flood quantile estimates for the most recent year of record and associated 95 cis for all watersheds are shown in figure s3 and in tabular form in table s35 s38 to evaluate the fit of both stationary and nonstationary models to lp3 distributions ppcc plots are shown for watersheds 2 7 and 11 in fig 8 and in figure s4 for all watersheds associated p values for each ppcc test correspond to a null hypothesis that the log space data do not differ from a pearson 3 distribution in all cases except for watershed 17 that included a very low outlier figure s4 panel 17 all p values were 0 05 ppcc values are shown as pst for stationary and pns for nonstationary distributions differences between pst and pns were relatively small and associated p values revealed adequate fit to lp3 for both cases although visual inspection of the ppcc plots indicate some deviations from lp3 in the upper and lower tails 6 discussion 6 1 drivers of change considering the most recent hydrologic conditions up to 2020 the increasing trends in annual 2 month ppt across li in isolation do not cause nonstationary estimates to be significantly different from stationary estimates at the 95 confidence level as shown in fig 7 watersheds where first stage regression models contained only ppt as a covariate did not have nonoverlapping confidence intervals between stationary and nonstationary estimates no blue or orange shading ia is not explanatory however in conjunction with rapid development or when considering urban development ia as a sole driver of nonstationarity the most recent flood quantile estimates are generally higher than stationary estimates with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals fig 7 blue shaded triangles this is consistent with vogel et al 2011 and hodgkins et al 2019 who concluded that the magnification of floods occurs much more dramatically in watersheds undergoing urbanization than in pristine watersheds even in the presence of climate trends furthermore the observed precipitation trends on li may not necessarily continue into the future and may reverse themselves in step with long term natural climate oscillations further study is needed to investigate the presence of climate trends across li and their potential impact on both surface and groundwater hydrology reductions in baseflow due to sanitary sewering and groundwater pumping have lowered the water table elevations busciolano 2005 and contributed to a partial reduction in peak flows over time the relationship between peak flows and groundwater is particularly evident for watersheds 6 and 14 usgs stations 01305000 and 01310000 table 4 although hac robust confidence intervals indicate that bf could also potentially be a significant predictor of annual instantaneous peak flows for watersheds 1 10 12 13 and 16 supplemental tables s1 s34 these watersheds show a distinct negative trend in baseflow associated with the dramatic reduction in bf since the early 1960 s due to pumping and sewering across nassau county fig 4 buxton and reilly 1985 likewise confidence intervals for the bf term are significant at 95 confidence for watersheds 3 6 7 8 10 13 14 and 15 in the stage two regressions supplemental tables s1 s34 potentially as explanatory factors of heteroskedasticity however due to the strict bic selection criterion used in this study these models were not selected for reasons of parsimony these results indicate that further modification to the water table elevations across li will likely have an effect on peak flows and flood frequency currently 2022 suffolk county is largely unsewered however proposed work by the county to expand sanitary sewers will likely reduce smaller floods and contribute to an increase in flood variability in the absence of increased recharge boughton 2021 rapid development occurred on li during the pre 1940 s for western li and from the 1950 s up to 1980 moving eastward across li during these periods of early urbanization peak flows increased with little or no change in variability in both suffolk and nassau counties floods have either become more variable or have begun an overall decrease across many watersheds beginning in the 1980s this pattern characterizes modern urbanized conditions that show evidence of base flow declines and the use of recharge and leaching basins as storm sewer outfalls the pattern is consistent with spinello and simmons 1992 who subdivided the peak flow record for li s south shore streams into pre urban urbanizing and a more recent period of subsequent urban adjustment they found that for li s south shore streams high and low flows became more variable from 1976 to 1985 due to the expansion of impervious surfaces which resulted in higher high flows and the lowering of the water table which resulted in lower low flows the changes observed by spinello and simmons appeared to be partially explained by the use of recharge basins which continue to be constructed and used as municipal storm sewer discharge locations across li it should be noted that along with the development of sewer drainage networks that have shifted contributing drainage areas to urban streamgages pluhowski and spinello 1978 it has been found that contributing groundwatersheds to surface water bodies on li may differ from surface water topographical drainage areas misut 2021 time trends interacting with impervious area were included in this study to represent changes in watershed management in more recent years of urban development these models were selected for watersheds 7 and 13 which exhibit nonmonotonic trends in peak flows over the past half century and have resulted in overall decreases in flood frequency figure s2 and s3 the redirection of stormwater in the swan river watershed watershed 7 usgs streamgage 01305500 and the preserve wetland area in the massapequa creek watershed watershed 13 usgs streamgage 01309500 may partially explain nonmonotonic trends in flood quantiles observed over the period of 1940 to 2020 massapequa creek is also located near the liberty industrial finishing superfund site designated in 1986 and has undergone shallow remedial pumping near the creek as well as stream augmentation www darrp noaa gov in the absence of time series data representative of each of these processes a time trend was used to represent the overall observed changes in peak flows further study could leverage historical information on pumping rates and date ranges of restoration projects to create an index more representative of physical processes leading to changes in flood frequency over time for watershed 7 swan river usgs station 01305500 nonmonotonic trends were also modeled by the interaction of time and ia peak flows on the swan river have been dramatically reduced since the 1990 s figs 2 and 5b despite having increasing trends in 2 month ppt and little to no overall change in long term baseflow patterns figs 3 and 4 large portions of the swan river no longer receive drainage from overland flow or stormwater outfalls because it has been intercepted by structures that route water to stormwater catch basins near a 30 acre lake swan river watershed management plan 2007 furthermore previous work in nassau and suffolk counties that showed recharge basins effectively convey stormwater to the groundwater returning the contained area to recharge conditions similar to a natural state seaburn and aronson 1974 however to quantitatively link these stormwater practices to flood frequency spatial and temporal data are needed to locate stormwater management structures and the timing of their construction choat et al 2022 additionally updates on the state of repair or disrepair of stormwater structures would allow for better prediction of flood variability particularly in the presence of more intense and frequent storms the results of this study indicate that stormwater management on li has effectively mitigated smaller floods but may remain vulnerable to larger storms this phenomenon is consistent with recent studies that underscore the flood reduction potential of stormwater control measures worldwide see bell et al 2020 and references therein 6 2 lp3 frequency models results from this study show that the effects of urbanization on flood frequency are more distinct for smaller magnitude floods larger aeps for the 20 aep flood 5 year recurrence interval nonstationary flood quantile estimates tend to be more distinct nonoverlapping confidence intervals from stationary estimates than for the 1 aep flood 100 year recurrence interval fig 7 figs s2 and s3 this is due in part to sampling uncertainty which is larger for estimates of floods with either the 2 or 1 percent aeps where the recurrence intervals are greater than the streamgage period of record additionally the higher percent differences in smaller nonstationary flood quantiles with smaller nonsignificant increases in larger floods fig 7 agree with numerous studies that have shown greater increases in smaller floods due to the expansion of impervious areas bian et al 2020 du et al 2012 hollis 1975 konrad 2016 over et al 2016 sauer et al 1983 the august 2014 storm that resulted in flooding across the central portions of li totaled more than 13 in of rainfall in 24 h for the town of islip setting a new record for new york state this storm resulted in the flood of record on the connetquot brook watershed 8 usgs station 01306460 as well as the carll s river watershed 12 usgs station 01308500 and sawampams creek watershed 11 usgs station 01308000 fig 2 results show that under the stationarity assumption for the sawampams creek the 2014 peak flow of 400 cfs corresponds to less than 0 2 percent aep flood greater than a 500 year recurrence interval under the assumption of stationarity fig 2 and fig s3 however this magnitude flood is approximately a 200 year recurrence interval under a nonstationary framework at the carlls river streamgage however the 2014 flood of 429 cfs corresponds to the 72 year flood discharge quantile under both stationary and nonstationary frameworks under climate change scenarios with increased frequency of intense rain events this type of storm will likely be more common and even with effective flood management these storms may overwhelm any systems in place for flood mitigation considering all aeps between 1 and 20 under current conditions fig 7 shows that all nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals occurred in watersheds where ia was a significant predictor except for watershed 14 bellmore creek usgs streamgage 01310000 for which the selected stage one model has baseflow and precipitation as co predictors in watershed 14 peak flows have decreased in large part due to baseflow reductions associated with the construction of storm and sanitary sewers through the 1960 s and 1970 s simmons and reynolds 1982 this indicates that anthropogenic watershed changes exert a stronger control over peak flows than only precipitation for urbanized watersheds on li despite increasing trends in the ppt variable serinaldi and kilsby 2015 argued that deterministic hydrologic knowledge is required for nonstationary models to be considered over stationary models where observed trends and shifts in the flood series can be attributed to specific physical processes they assert that a direct historical analysis of changes to infiltration runoff production and drainage networks should be considered when modelling nonstationarity in urbanizing watersheds to expand on the covariates in this analysis that include a time trend representative of modern urban development connected versus disconnected impervious development could be considered hwang et al 2017 as well as changes to water management and groundwater use that effectively change runoff dynamics the most recent atmosphere ocean general circulation models cmip6 project more annual and extreme rainfall concentrated in warmer winters with hotter summers for the us northeast coast ipcc regional climate projections 2022 particularly in the case of more frequent intense storms that surpass soil infiltration capacities these conditions are expected to stress li s groundwater system although more work needs to be done to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the li aquifer system boughton 2021 without substantial increases to recharge future population growth and intensification of groundwater use will lower base flows and more intense extreme rainfall events will likely increase peak flow variability for li s groundwater fed streams streams in nassau county and neighboring queens and kings counties are especially susceptible to floods associated with projected precipitation increases which can become further enhanced by the urban heat island effect mcgrane 2016 new stormwater management plans across all counties on li aim to buffer these changes through infrastructure improvements and nature based mitigation features nassau county hazard mitigation plan 2021 suffolk county climate action plan 2015 wolfe et al 2021 7 study limitations the results of this study are limited to an analysis of peak flow trends on li and their potential effect on flood frequency more work is needed to quantify relative contributions of individual watershed characteristics such as land cover and watershed specific stormwater management practices because of li streams high bfi and urban cover groundwater contributing areas and storm sewersheds should be explored as an alternative to topographic surface water drainage areas future studies could address this by evaluating other covariates representative of historical changes in development watershed management practices and sewer coverage regional models of flood quantile estimates for ungaged watersheds could be associated with static watershed characteristics such as the year of transition between rapid and modern development average depth and variation of water table levels and proximity to superfund and other remediation sites spatial distribution and infiltration capacity of recharge basins storm sewer outfalls and low impact urban design should also be explored as potentially significant variables in a regional analysis further the housing density dataset theobald 2005 used in this study as the basis for the ia input variable is limited because it is based on projections made in the year 2000 and contains commercial industrial transportation cit coverage fixed at the year 2000 state future work could improve on this input variable by making further adjustments and using updated census data to adjust this variable to changes in urban fraction reflected in recent decades in this study both stationary and nonstationary flood quantile estimates were calculated without the detection and treatment of potentially influential low peak flows which can lead to underestimation of the upper end of the frequency distribution the expected moments algorithm ema could be used to explore the prevalence of these low outliers before and after nonstationary peak flow adjustment leading to an improved distributional fit for many li streams see supplemental figure s4 cohn et al 2013 griffis et al 2004 despite the proliferation of research on nonstationarity there remains a lack of consensus about trend thresholds warranting the selection of a nonstationarity model the benefits of adding parameters to a nonstationary model in terms of bias reduction must outweigh the increase in uncertainty that arises from adding more parameters although our model selection criteria were relatively strict bic and 95 confidence interval overlaps the ultimate decision to use a nonstationary model over a stationary one depends on a stakeholder tolerance for over design and under design of infrastructure rosner et al 2014 in this study flood quantiles were estimated with a given annual chance that reflect current watershed conditions rather than projecting forward in time or trying to evaluate risk to an investment over a specific project time horizon this study examines flood nonstationarity using historical datasets and evaluates flood frequency under current urbanization and climate conditions because of the additional uncertainty associated with diverse climate projection models and scenarios montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and apparently changing urban flood management practices that increasingly integrate nature based solutions chiu et al 2021 we do not attempt to encompass future projections into our models encompassing future projection could be a possible extension of the methods presented in this paper and would require a holistic approach to nonstationary design that includes stakeholder decisions regarding uncertainty and risk of failure over a project planning horizon salas et al 2018 yan et al 2017 precipitation trends that were determined by robust regression of two month precipitation totals and time were likely influenced by the 1960 s drought further analysis of precipitation trends in this region should take this into consideration and re analyze trends after the post 1970 transition to a wetter climate mccabe and wolock 2021 we used robust regression to estimate the current average flood generating precipitation conditions and not as a full trend analysis per se more work is needed to assess the cause and nature of any precipitation trends across li it should be assessed whether increases in flood generating precipitation are associated with observed abrupt shifts in total annual and extreme precipitation 1996 and 2002 huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 or long term increasing trends in extreme precipitation associated with tropical cyclones that have been observed across li reed et al 2022 the two stage sequential estimation of distribution parameters used in this study differs from hecht and vogel 2020 in a few key ways first this study uses robust multiple regression instead of ordinary least squares on a single covariate and second the resulting conditional moments were fit to an lp3 distribution rather than a two parameter log normal a more rigorous assessment may be necessary to determine whether sequential or other simultaneous estimation methods such as maximum likelihood may be more favorable considering these differences 8 summary and conclusions this work was motivated by a need for accurate flood quantile estimates for a densely populated coastal region of the us that has undergone changes in land cover climate and stormwater management there is a great need for flood frequency estimates for long island new york which is the largest and most populous island in the conterminous united states and has undergone intense urbanization over the past century the purpose of the current study is twofold 1 to define the principal drivers of the observed trends and changes in peak flow magnitude and variability and 2 to explore the impacts of these changes on flood frequency analysis across gaged watersheds on long island our results show that urbanization can have a mixed effect on annual instantaneous peak flow series manifesting as early and late development phases annual instantaneous peak flow data were fit to a log pearson iii lp3 distribution using both unconditional and conditional means and standard deviations of the log transformed peak flows these conditional moments were estimated using a two stage robust regression procedure adjusted for conditions in the most recent year 2020 of peak flow record the two stage sequential regression approach was adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 and employed to update estimates of the mean stage one and variance stage two of the log transformed annual instantaneous peak streamflows analysis indicates that when considering nonstationarity the most pronounced and widespread adjustments occur for smaller floods with greater than a 5 percent aep for these smaller floods most adjustments to flood quantiles from a stationary to nonstationary framework were positive significant increases for example at sawampams creek at babylon watershed 11 streamgage 01308000 the 1 aep flood under 2020 average conditions may be 50 higher than traditional stationary flood quantile estimates and what is currently considered the 1 percent aep flood could actually be closer to the 5 percent aep flood when the urban development to date is taken into account nonmonotonic trends were modeled for two watersheds and likely reflect stormwater management and remediation practices implemented in more recent decades that include redirecting stormwater discharge away from the channel the results show that stormwater management on long island can have a dramatic effect on flood frequency and more data are needed to identify the timing and location of these practices to reliably generalize regional flood patterns urban development in the form of impervious area is a significant predictor of conditional distribution parameters in 8 of the 17 watersheds included in this study the effect of impervious area on peak flows is modulated by the two month precipitation total precipitation of the month of the peakflow and the preceding month in most watersheds which itself exhibits positive trends over time it is uncertain whether the general observed upward precipitation trends will continue into the future although future modeled climate scenarios indicate a wetter northeastern us region hoerling et al 2016 warmer temperatures and associated changes in groundwater use across long island including higher groundwater demand coupled with more intense winter storms would likely further shift peak flow patterns and lead to increased variability continued alterations to the groundwater table will likely affect smaller floods on long island whereas floods from larger storms will remain unchanged by these alterations because the streams of long island have uniquely high baseflow indices bfi the consideration of groundwater contributing areas in the delineation of watershed boundaries may be necessary to improve future models of flood annual exceedance probabilities 9 data availability all data used in this study are published and publicly available annual

2265,the magnitude and variability of floods have increased for many nontidal streams on long island li ny since the mid 20th century one of the most densely populated regions of the united states li has experienced amplified floods in step with increases in impervious land cover storm and sanitary sewers that have accompanied urban development to better understand the drivers of observed flood trends and effects of urbanization a nonstationary flood frequency analysis is conducted using historical annual peak flow records from 17 gaged watersheds on li using conditional moments based on physical covariates from a two stage sequential robust linear regression procedure regression results indicate that urban development and precipitation are significant co predictors of peak flows for li watersheds that have undergone rapid development during the available peak flow record in watersheds with less intense urbanization or that were fully developed before the peak flow record began precipitation alone was a significant explanatory variable long term baseflow patterns identified using a nonparametric smoother explained some patterns of decreasing peak flows and heteroskedasticity in the peak flow records fitting a log pearson iii distribution with these conditional moments floods corresponding to a 20 annual exceedance probability aep are up to 80 higher under a nonstationary framework compared with stationary under current watershed conditions and differ significantly 95 confidence from stationary estimates for 6 out of 17 watersheds larger floods corresponding to 1 aeps do not differ significantly between nonstationary and stationary estimates at a 95 confidence level nonmonotonic trends observed in two watersheds indicate that recent stormwater management practices such as rerouting stormwater outfalls away from the channel substantially reduce flood frequency reduced nonstationary flood quantile estimates at these two watersheds are 20 to 40 lower than stationary estimates when accounting for changing watershed conditions over time across li stormwater management and water table fluctuations have increased peak flow variability characteristic of a late phase urban adjustment period on li results of this study demonstrate that a nonstationary framework is a necessary step forward toward a regional flood frequency analysis for li this nonstationary framework will allow flood managers to update flood discharge estimates to current conditions that reflect altered relationships between urban cover and climate for more targeted

mediero et al 2014 and anthropogenic drivers such as urbanization and reservoir construction lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 urbanization has led to some of the most pronounced changes in flood magnitude over time revealing stronger evidence for trends and nonstationarities when compared with the impacts of climate vogel et al 2011 yang et al 2021 in the

modern stormwater management along with more traditional flood control measures and structures such as retention detention and bypass channels have all had a measurable dampening effect on runoff

2016 zhou et al 2017 extreme precipitation has increased more rapidly in the ne than any other region of the us since the 1970s hoerling et al 2016 the increased number of intense rain events in this

current record for 24 hour rainfall totals in new york state was set in august of 2014 when a slow moving frontal system produced more than 13 in of rain across central long island grumm et al 2018

events will continue to increase in the ne over the next century ning et al 2015 and the urbanized areas of long island will be particularly vulnerable to flooding shepard et al 2012 in this study the historical impacts of urbanization on flood frequency were examined across gaged watersheds on long island ny li which is the largest and most populous island in the us and is located just east of new york city historical urbanization patterns across li combined with its unique groundwater driven hydrology have produced dramatic changes in annual peak flows over more than a half century of available data simmons and reynolds 1982 seaburn 1969 to characterize these changes in peak flow physical covariates were considered as drivers of change in distributional moments to produce new adjusted estimates of flood frequency that reflect current conditions of climate and urban development due to the complexity of trends and patterns in peak flows there are currently no flood frequency studies that have included li in a regional analysis e g lumia et al 2006 despite a great need to characterize flood risk for nearly eight million people island wide official guidelines for flood frequency analysis in the us depend on the assumption of stationarity where the parameters of the underlying distribution of floods do not vary with time england et al 2019 recently much attention has gone to detecting and modelling nonstationarity in flood series as well as discussion about whether these methods are necessary or appropriate salas et al 2018 and references therein it has been argued that stationarity should be the default premise held when assessing hydrologic change because inherent stochastic components of natural processes do not justify the increased uncertainty introduced by more complex models montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 long term internal persistence in the hydrologic record can often be mistaken for a temporal trend due to climate change lins and cohn 2011 and relying on time as an explanatory factor does not allow for predictions of future conditions rather than solely relying on time as a covariate techniques that incorporate physical covariates as explanatory variables are particularly useful when they indicate underlying physical processes driving the nonstationary behavior such as population growth and urban extent prosdocimi et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 the choice of covariates in nonstationary flood frequency analysis nsffa should be physically associated with flood generation as they impact the predictability of future design floods yan et al 2019 covariates that predict changes in distributional moments have included population associated variables villarini 2009 as well as indices

ebrahimian et al 2016 yang et al 2011 although not representative of the connectivity of impervious surfaces using estimates of total impervious cover as a rough approximation for urbanization can yield useful predictions of peak flow sohn et al 2020 this study includes the urban to natural land cover gradient of li to examine the drivers of observed changes in annual peak flows and how those changes may affect flood frequency through a nonstationary analysis two stages of robust regression adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 were used to sequentially estimate the mean stage one and variance stage two of log transformed annual peak flows for 17 gaged watersheds that have undergone different phases of urban development since 1940 multiple covariates including impervious cover precipitation totals and long term water table fluctuations were considered in describing changes in flood magnitude location and variability scale across li selected regression models were used to detrend the peak flow series for each watershed according to each year of record and use the updated moments to fit a log pearson iii distribution as used by england et al 2019 to estimate and compare flood quantiles value of discharge for a given annual exceedance probability with a stationary analysis stationary flood quantiles were compared with nonstationary quantile estimates by using 95 confidence intervals to evaluate the uncertainties associated with record length and sampling variability and the flood frequency framework defers to stationary where there is confidence interval overlap 2 study area li spans 120 miles from the new york city metropolitan area to its easternmost point in semi rural suffolk county it is surrounded by long island sound to the north the peconic estuary to the east the atlantic ocean to the south and the new york new jersey harbor estuary to the west li s topography is dominated by two glacial moraines that rise to approximately 400 feet above sea level and comprise the north and south forks to the east and a gently sloping outwash plain that extends southward to the atlantic ocean li s topographic divide is shown by the north vs south draining watershed delineations in fig 1 unconsolidated cretaceous and pleistocene age deposits underlie the island and form the lloyd magothy and upper glacial aquifers interbedded with raritan and gardiners clay confining units mcclymonds and franke 1972 the upper glacial aquifer generally consists of glacial moraine deposits and a broad outwash plain that contains the majority of li s southward draining streams buxton and modica 1992 and forms the unit that provides most freshwater streams across the island with perennial flow cohen et al 1968 under pre development conditions prior to 1960 li s south shore streamflows were predominantly groundwater discharge with base flow comprising 90 to 95 of total annual streamflow reynolds 1982 compared with more than 9 000 gaged basins across the continental

in western li counties that are in the north shore headlands or have undergone sanitary sewering and groundwater extraction simmons and reynolds 1982 this study focuses on historical peak flows from li s two largest counties suffolk county to the east and the more heavily urbanized nassau county to the west fig 1 due to limited peak flow data availability this study excludes the two more densely populated kings and queens counties that make up the new york city boroughs of brooklyn and queens the total population for nassau and suffolk counties is approximately 2 83 million 2019 https www census gov which has increased by more than 250 since 1940 since the 1940 s the introduction of sanitary sewers and impervious surfaces have contributed to base flow depletion of more than 60 for portions of nassau county reynolds 1982 groundwater levels have been further reduced through pumping to provide nassau and suffolk counties sole water supply for residents agriculture and industry the introduction of sanitary sewers beginning in the early part of the 20th century has exacerbated base flow losses across the island particularly in urbanized areas where the hydrologic response to precipitation has become increasingly flashy simmons and reynolds 1982 these base flow losses become less pronounced eastward into suffolk county where most of the land cover is forested suburban or agricultural prince 1981 li experiences a coastal humid continental climate with warm humid summers and cool winters that bring rain and some snow cold season precipitation consists of northeast tracking systems that originate in the southern portions of the continental us and generally have long durations with high amounts of rain ice and snow busciolano 2005 average winter temperatures remain at or above freezing and snow accumulation is short lived and does not contribute to major rain on snow flooding events wachowicz et al 2020 during the warm season flash flooding can arise from convective summer thunderstorms that form over the mainland and track northeastward with cold fronts or in local regions of instability li is also vulnerable to high amounts of rainfall produced by tropical cyclones which may be accompanied by damaging winds and storm surge miller and frederick 1969 some orographically produced precipitation is concentrated over the morainal highlands where precipitation intensities are increased by up to 40 as compared to lower lying areas colle and yuter 2007 flood management across nassau and suffolk counties consists of a combination of open channel and pipe drainage systems and thousands of recharge and leaching basins that were constructed as early as the 1930 s to intercept flood waters and reroute them to the subsurface in areas where the water table is sufficiently deep below the surface seaburn and aronson 1974 recharge and leaching basins drain most commercial developments and highways on li and are generally designed to contain the runoff from a two to five inch rainfall event these design criteria vary by regulating agency and location and require periodic maintenance to sustain their function nassau county department of public works ncdpw 2019 new york state 2019 flood waters that are captured and conveyed by storm sewers can berouted to these basins or discharged directly to streams depending on their location with respect to the water table ku and simmons 1986 recharge basins have significantly altered the timing and distribution of groundwater recharge across li but their effect on flood peak and base flow hydrology is difficult to isolate from other effects of urbanization ku and aaronson 1992 3 data annual maximum instantaneous streamflow and daily average streamflow were accessed using the r package dataretrieval de cicco et al 2018 from the u s geological survey s usgs national water information system database https waterdata usgs gov nwis for all available gaged streams in nassau and suffolk counties peak streamflows for continuous and discontinued gages were included for this analysis if the gaged record length was more than 30 years selected watersheds are listed in table 1 and shown in fig 1 streamflow data were included from water years 1940 through 2020 with an average record length of 68 years annual peak flows that had a usgs qualification code of 3 discharge affected by dam failure and 6 discharge affected by regulation or diversion were excluded from this analysis however peak flows that were code 5 discharges of unknown regulated conditions were included in the analysis because the effects of regulation on these peaks was assumed to be small https help waterdata usgs gov codes and parameters four of the gaged watersheds on li usgs streamgages 01304000 01304500 01305000 and 01308500 contain dams constructed before 1950 with storage equivalent to less than 2 of total annual flow table 2 and they were interpreted as having only slightly regulated conditions likely to minimally impact high flow events however peaks with code 6 were assumed to have been affected by larger more significant modifications to natural hydrologic regimes and only occur for select peaks at station 6 carmas river at yaphank usgs station 01305000 all peaks included in this analysis were instantaneous annual flows except for two watersheds that contain annual maximum daily average discharge code 1 for each available water year usgs streamgages 01306500 and 01310000 flood frequency estimates for these watersheds are likely underestimated due to the smoothing effect of daily values bartens and haberlandt 2021 watershed characteristics of the 17 watersheds included in the analysis are shown in table 2 including the hydrologic disturbance index hdi falcone et al 2011 which is an indicator of human influence on basin hydrology the hdi for each watershed summarizes major anthropogenic stressors including dam density and storage 1950 2006 landscape fragmentation and freshwater withdrawal estimates the hdi for watersheds across the us ranges from 0 to 56 with values below 12 considered to be relatively pristine watersheds falcone et al 2011 the hdi for 17 li watersheds range from 14 to 22 indicating that despite the wide gradient of impervious cover all the watersheds are impacted by human activity as a potential explanatory variable in this study we used precipitation in mm corresponding to the month of peak flow summed with the total precipitation for the month prior to the flood ppt this two month precipitation total is representative of both event precipitation and recent one month antecedent rainfall time series of ppt were compiled using the gridded monthly precipitation model outputs from the prism climate group https prism oregonstate edu prism rasters were resampled from 4 km to 800 m resolution and clipped to each watershed boundary using r packages raster and rgdal bivand et al 2015 hijmans et al 2015 values within each boundary were spatially averaged and summed as two month totals in mm annual cumulative stream baseflow runoff was used as a representation of groundwater levels in the uppermost unconfined units underlying each stream although fluctuations of baseflow on daily or monthly timescales are also representative of other processes such as stream discharge augmentation from holding ponds the total annual baseflow mm closely resembled water table fluctuations observed in wells with long term data available particularly during periods of pumping sanitary sewer construction and recovery figure s1 baseflow separation of mean daily streamflow was done using the r package hydrostats bond 2020 which utilizes a lynne hollick filter to separate daily streamflow data into baseflow and quick flow components an alpha filtering parameter value of 0 975 ladson et al 2013 was used which allows for variation across multiple passes of the filter on the daily streamflow data to represent the long term drawdowns and recovery in baseflow due to human activity annual baseflow totals for each watershed were filtered using a nonparametric friedman super smoother friedman 1984 in base r software the friedman smoothing method is a locally regressive smoother that automates the smoothing span selection using cross validation a maximized low frequency emphasis term of 10 was used to fit the smooth segments to multi decadal patterns in shallow groundwater across li such as the long term pumping and recovery observed in nassau county and the introduction of sanitary sewers across the island this smoother removes the higher frequency signals in the data that may be attributed to changes in precipitation reduces or eliminates collinearity between base flow and precipitation and reveals longer term patterns more indicative of anthropogenic groundwater activity on li smoothed or long term indices representing both climatic oscillations i e li et al 2015 machado et al 2015 and proxies for anthropogenic impacts i e li and tan 2015 lopez and frances 2013 neri et al 2019 have been used as covariates in previous studies of nonstationary flood frequency however smoothed indices representative of modifications to the water table have not yet been used to describe changes in flood distribution parameters historical changes in total impervious area ia were computed according to methods described in oudin et al 2018 using housing density data from the 2000 us census theobald 2005 which is available starting in 1940 and includes predicted values for 2010 and 2020 the housing density data were reclassified into impervious percentages for each pixel resampled clipped and averaged for each watershed decadal ia values were then linearly interpolated to yearly timesteps for each watershed under the assumption of constant inter decadal population growth time in the form of water year corresponding to peak flows was included as a covariate with ia and used to represent the effect of unknown watershed changes such as changes in stormwater management and construction of recharge and leaching basins although including time as a covariate prevents extrapolation to future flood conditions and does not attribute flood changes to a specific driver serinaldi and kilsby 2015 time as a significant predictor can account for the complexities of urban flood response and locate areas where stormwater management may have a significant impact on local hydrology an interaction term was included to represent the interaction between urban development ia and time we hypothesize that depending on the stage of urban development early vs late the effects of urbanization on peak flows may change due to more modern flood management practices that consider changes in climate and emphasize sustainability pour et al 2020 4 methods 4 1 flood frequency estimation the logarithms of the annual instantaneous peak flow series y were fit to a log pearson iii lp3 distribution characterized by its mean µ standard deviation σ and skewness γ griffis and stedinger 2007 the distribution was parameterized with both unconditional stationary and conditional nonstationary moments of mean and standard deviation while the skewness was calculated from the peak flow data after the conditional adjustment of the first two moments potentially influential low outliers were not evaluated in this study and all potential outliers were kept in the analysis with the exception of one low peak flow at station 17 watershed 17 valley stream usgs 01311500 this outlier in log space is more than four standard deviations below the stationary mean of the series and was dropped from this analysis this particular flood occurred in 1965 during a drought that rendered the channel dry and may not be characteristic of the full flow regime of valley stream results for valley stream including this outlier are located in supplemental figures s2 s4 when assumed stationary flood quantile estimates for each of the 17 watersheds in this study take the form 1 q p e x p μ k p σ where the frequency factor kp is a function of skewness and standard normal quantiles england et al 2019 to estimate flood quantiles based on assumptions of a nonstationary mean and or standard deviation conditional moments are substituted into equation 1 2 q p ω e x p μ y ω k p σ y ω where qp ω represents the flood quantile in cfs conditioned on a combination of covariate s ω the conditional mean µy ω and standard deviation σy ω of the log transformed peak series are estimated by a two stage regression procedure hecht and vogel 2020 outlined in section 2 3 the adjusted skewness was calculated based on a standardized version of the flood series following debele et al 2017 and serago and vogel 2018 first the log transformed flood series is standardized as follows 3 z i y i μ y ω σ y ω where zi represents the standardized observations that have been detrended according to the conditional mean and standard deviation of the log transformed peak series using the standardized peak series zi a skewness estimate γ is calculated according to tasker and stedinger 1986 with a bias correction factor according to equation 4 4 g 1 6 n γ 1 6 n n i 1 n z i z 3 n 1 n 2 s 3 where n is the number of observations z and s are the sample mean and standard deviation of of the standardized observations zi the frequency factor kp was estimated based on a single at site skewness g computed in 4 using the wilson hilferty transformation 1931 as follows 5 k p g 2 γ 1 g z p 6 g 2 36 3 2 g where zp is the pth percentile of a standard normal distribution this transformation is appropriate for skew coefficients that have an absolute value less than three kirby 1972 which is well within the range of estimated skew coefficients in this investigation see fig 6 4 2 conditional moments multivariate robust regression was used to associate changes in flood frequency distribution parameters with covariates indicative of changes in precipitation two month precipitation ppt water table levels smoothed baseflow bf used as a surrogate land cover impervious area ia and time robust regression is a form of iteratively weighted least squares where points furthest from the model prediction are down weighted making it less sensitive to outliers and skewed data than ordinary least squares a huber penalty function and at least five iterations were used that converges on regression estimates through m estimation see rousseeuw and leroy 2005 for a comprehensive description of robust regression methods all analyses were carried out using r statistical software v4 1 2 r core team 2021 and robust regression models were fit via the rlm function in the mass r package ripley et al 2013 a two stage sequential regression approach was adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 and employed to update estimates of the mean stage one and variance stage two of the log transformed annual instantaneous peak streamflow for all 17 watersheds included in this study the conditional moments from the regression models were fit to a log pearson iii distribution with a skewness calculation limited to at site sample skewness because a regional estimate of skew does not yet exist estimates of flood quantiles using conditional moments were compared to flood frequency estimates under a stationary assumption for all watersheds using bootstrapped 95 confidence intervals described below in section 4 3 the following assumptions were considered for each watershed adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 st stationary assumption ns hom assumption of nonstationarity with homoscedastic variance ns het assumption of nonstationarity with heteroscedastic variance in the first stage regression the estimate of conditional mean μ y ω for models 2 and 3 takes the form 6 y ω β 0 β 1 x 1 β n x n ε ω 7 μ y ω e y ω where y ω are the log transformed annual instantaneous peak flows conditioned on covariates ω ε ω are the residuals associated with the selected regression model and covariates ω are represented by x1 xn and regression coefficients β1 βn candidate models included all combinations of the three covariates representative of physical watershed processes up to a maximum of two explanatory variables per model 1 two month precipitation totals ppt mm 2 annual smoothed baseflow runoff bf mm 3 total impervious area ia combinations of these variables were limited to a maximum of two terms across regression models in favor of parsimony and to accommodate smaller sample sizes watersheds 8 and 10 n 42 and 31 respectively two additional models were added that include ia and a time trend both with model 9 and without model 8 an interaction term to account for the hypothesized conditional association between early vs late urbanization and peak streamflows the nine models that were considered for both the stage one and stage two regression procedures are shown in table 3 the homoscedastic variance ns hom σ ε 2 of each series was computed as an estimate of variance with a bias correction factor around the stage one regression fit in 6 using the following equation 8 σ ε 2 1 n p 1 i 1 n ε ω 2 where n is the sample size p is the number of parameters in the selected stage one regression model and εω are the regression residuals from equation 6 the heteroskedastic model variance ns het was calculated with stage one regression residuals which largely follow a normal distribution not shown the square of normally distributed residuals results in an approximate chi square distribution which can be transformed back to approximately normal by subsequently raising the squared residuals to the 1 3 power which is referred to as an anscombe transformation anscombe 1961 this transformation has been used in hydrometeorological studies to transform residuals of generalized linear models to follow a nonnegative normal distribution e g chandler and wheater 2002 hecht and vogel 2020 kigobe et al 2011 in this study anscombe transformed squared residuals a total power transformation of 2 3 become the dependent variable in the second stage robust regression equation 9 9 ε ω 2 3 α 0 α 1 x 1 α n x n φ ω where ε ω 2 3 are the anscombe transformed squared residuals from equation 6 and is a function of ω the combination of covariates x1 to xn the error term for equation 9 is shown as φ ω coefficients of the second stage regression model are shown as α0 αn and x1 xn represent the covariate or combination of covariates evaluated for each watershed the expected value of the stage one anscombe transformed residuals was then used to estimate σ y ω 2 as the conditional variance of log transformed peak flows according to equation 10 which accounts for the error term in equation 9 see equation 15 in hecht and vogel 2020 for derivations 10 σ y ω 2 ε ω 2 3 3 3 σ φ 2 ε ω 2 3 whereas regression equations 6 and 9 were fit using the annual ppt values predictions were obtained using the long term precipitation trend for other predictors the same data were used for both fitting and prediction the ppt trend model was calculated by robust regression ppt t x0 x1 t e to represent average ppt conditions for any given year shown in fig 3 this approach was taken to adjust the 1 to 20 percent aep flood flows to long term conditions instead of year to year fluctuations this approach also prevents frequency estimates from being too low for short duration droughts or a single dry year it should be noted that further investigation may be needed to assess whether these are secular trends and not a component of multi decadal oscillations for flood frequency estimates that are being used to design new infrastructure current conditions may or may not reflect the anticipated conditions over the future planning horizon 4 3 model selection and diagnostics graphical inspection and exploratory analysis show that li s base flow dominated streams do exhibit some autocorrelation in the peak flow series as well as some heteroskedasticity that is investigated in this study to address the autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity the significance of each coefficient was determined using heteroscedastic autocorrelation consistent hac robust standard errors using the vcovhac function in the r package sandwich zeileis et al 2021 which uses andrews weighted variance estimators andrews 1991 a global wald test r package aod lesnoff et al 2010 was applied using the hac covariance matrix estimator to assess the overall significance of each regression model wald test p values below the chosen significance level of α 0 05 indicate that the candidate model offers an improvement in fit over the null model h0 the coefficients of the model are equal to zero the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 is a function of the model likelihood given the input data and favors parsimonious models more than a similar measure the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 both the bic and small sample adjusted aicc criteria hurvich and tsai 1989 are included in the supporting information tables s1 s34 for each candidate model across all 17 watersheds in this study given the same number of observations across all candidate models the minimum aicc or bic indicates the model that best explains the variance in the data a difference of less than 2 between a candidate model and the model with the lowest information criterion indicates that both the candidate model and the model with the lowest bic have strong support of being the best approximating model and should be investigated further burnham and anderson 2004 for this study selection criteria for stage one and stage two regressions were 1 the hac adjusted 95 confidence intervals for each coefficient excluding the intercept do not include zero 2 the difference bic value for that model was less than 2 and 3 the wald test p value was less than the chosen significance level of α 0 05 if more than one model met these selection criteria the model with fewer terms was chosen in favor of parsimony the best fitting lp3 frequency models under both the stationary and nonstationary frameworks and selection criteria were evaluated for goodness of fit by the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc test adjusted for application to nonstationary data as described by serago and vogel 2018 the ppcc test statistic is the product moment correlation coefficient between the sorted standardized observations and the corresponding sorted lp3 variate each log transformed peak flow series of the 17 watersheds was standardized by subtracting the conditional mean then dividing by the conditional standard deviation for each nonstationary case ns hom or ns het and using the unconditional moments in the stationary case st for models that contained ppt as an explanatory variable conditional moments were calculated using the linear fit of the long term ppt time trend as explained in section 4 2 skewness for each nonstationary case was calculated after standardization using equation 4 a ppcc hypothesis test was then conducted where the null hypothesis h0 is that the series does not follow an lp3 distribution and the alternate hypothesis ha is that the data do follow a lp3 distribution significance was evaluated at α 0 05 and p values were calculated in r using the ppcc package pohlert et al 2020 nonstationary flood quantiles were calculated using regression model predictions from each year of the peak flow record resulting in a time series of changing flood frequency from 1940 to the most recent year of record then to examine flood frequency for the most current conditions an updated stationary estimate is discussed rather than extrapolating trends into the future using the most recent year of record following recommendations by luke et al 2017 the comparison of non stationary estimates with stationary estimates was made using confidence intervals confidence intervals were calculated by a parametric bootstrapping procedure where 2000 random samples were generated from the fitted lp3 distribution with the same size as the historical dataset nonstationary frequency estimates were considered to be significantly different from stationary estimates for segments of the frequency curve that had nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals although this decision rule can be modified to include elements of risk tolerance from each random sample location and scale parameters were re estimated by method of moments resulting in 95 confidence intervals for each flood quantile estimate kyselý 2008 the use of the parametric bootstrap or monte carlo procedure to develop confidence intervals around frequency estimates is recommended in the most recent federal hydraulic engineering circular hec 17 kilgore et al 2016 as an effective practical technique that does not involve complicating assumptions e g salas and obeysekera 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 5 results 5 1 trends and spatial patterns impervious cover has increased across all 17 watersheds since 1940 with 12 of 17 watersheds undergoing a period of rapid development rd of more than 8 per decade indicated by red shading in fig 2 fig 2 also shows that the rd period is earlier toward the western portion of the island between 1940 and 1960 watershed numbers 15 17 while rapid development occurred later in the central watersheds 11 14 during 1950 to 1965 and eastern watersheds 4 6 7 and 9 10 during 1960 to 1980 peak flow records at most of the 17 gages generally overlap with rd periods except for watershed 17 usgs station 01311500 and watershed 8 usgs station 01306460 where rapid development was slightly less than 8 growth per decade according to the ia time series used in this study these two gages were established after rapid watershed development and peak flows are representative of more fully developed conditions precipitation in the form of monthly totals corresponding to each flood plus one month antecedent ppt is presented in fig 3 with the trend lines derived from robust linear regression of ppt and time for most watersheds annual precipitation decreased during the 1960 s when the northeast region experienced a centennial drought followed by a wetter pluvial period that extends to present day mccabe and wolock 2021 seager et al 2012 base flow bf has dropped significantly for portions of central and western li watershed numbers 11 17 mostly before 1980 as is shown by the bf data in fig 4 in contrast a few watersheds numbers 1 3 7 9 and 17 show an increasing pattern in base flow since the late 1990 s causes of increases in baseflow are likely the result of return flows from public supply pumpage schubert 1998 cessation of groundwater pumping busciolano 2005 or the expansion of managed recharge across the island ku and aaronson 1992 portions of more rural suffolk county to the east including agricultural regions and watersheds with more significant dam regulation watersheds 4 7 and 9 fig 4 show stable or increasing base flow since the 1940 s that may be associated with regional precipitation increases li et al 2019 5 2 regression model selection models were selected if 1 the hac robust confidence intervals for each term do not include zero 2 the δbic was less than two and 3 the wald test p value was less than 0 05 in the case where ia was considered along with time an interaction term was added to account for the early vs late stage effects of urban development on flooding model 9 table 3 for watershed 1 glen cove usgs 01302500 convergence was not achieved for the interaction term through the robust regression procedure and so for this watershed model 9 was dropped from consideration selected models for stage one and stage two regressions for the 17 watersheds are shown in tables 4 and 5 with all candidate model diagnostics included in tables s1 s34 all 17 watersheds had stage one nonstationary models with significant predictors impervious area ia was a significant predictor of the conditional mean of log transformed flows for 8 out of 17 watersheds all with positive coefficient two month precipitation ppt was found to be a significant predictor of conditional mean in 14 out of 17 watersheds with positive coefficients and smoothed baseflow bf was a significant predictor with positive coefficients for two watersheds for stage one and one watershed for stage two with a negative coefficient the interaction term between time and ia was found to be significant for watersheds 7 negative coefficient and 13 positive coefficient in the stage two regression three watersheds that exhibited heteroskedasticity had ia as a predictor in watersheds 6 and 7 ia was the sole predictor of heteroskedasticity with a positive coefficient whereas for watershed 14 the ia coefficient was negative for watershed 12 the selected stage two regression model had ppt and bf as significant predictors both with negative coefficients for the selected models for watersheds 7 and 13 usgs stations 01305500 and 01309500 time was a co predictor with ia along with a significant interaction term between the two variables the significant interaction term in these models indicates that the effect of urbanization on peak flows depends on the time or phase of urbanization 1940 1960 versus 1960 1980 the negative time coefficient in the stage one regression models results in predictions that have a negative trend during later periods of basin development resulting in a nonmonotonic pattern of increasing then subsequently decreasing annual peak flows fig 2 the collinearity between ia and time in these models not shown causes the individual coefficients to be misleading with respect to individual effect sizes the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable however previous investigations using monte carlo simulations have shown that ordinary least squares regression with multicollinear predictors still provides reliable model predictions in the presence of multicollinearity particularly for sample sizes larger than 20 kroll and song 2013 5 3 frequency model comparison for all watersheds regardless of their percentage of impervious area nonstationary candidate models were selected for comparison alongside their stationary counterparts if the selected stage two regression model was intercept only no significant predictors then the nonstationary candidate model was selected as homoscedastic ns hom if the stage two regression selection revealed significant predictors the candidate nonstationary model was selected as heteroskedastic ns het fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of flood frequency of the 20 and 1 aep floods for watersheds 2 7 and 11 these three watersheds represent both ns hom and ns het model fits that have both overlapping and nonoverlapping confidence intervals with stationary models for the 20

figure s2 annual instantaneous peak flows at watershed 2 usgs station 01303000 mill neck creek fig 5a and d were explained by the 2 month precipitation totals ppt but flood quantile estimates under a nonstationary framework did not significantly differ from stationary for recent years overlapping 95 confidence intervals despite the increasing trend in ppt at watershed 7 usgs station 01305500 swan river fig 5b and e annual instantaneous peak flow was best described by the interaction of ia and time for this watershed nonstationary flood quantile estimates have decreased since they had reached their maximum in the 1990 s after the period of rapid development flood variability in this watershed was modeled as nonstationary heteroskedastic ns het increasing also as a function of ia following the model selection criteria outlined in section 4 3 fig 5c and f displays the stationary and nonstationary models for watershed 11 usgs station 01308000 sawampams creek which was modeled to have a constant variance as well as ia and ppt to predict the mean of log transformed peak flows both the swan river and sawampam s creek contain at least one segment of the flood frequency curve with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals between stationary and nonstationary models under 2020 conditions fig 5 fig 6 compares the mean standard deviation and skewness estimates under a stationary x axis and nonstationary y axis framework for the most recent year of record for most of the li watersheds under current conditions the mean of log transformed peak flows was higher under a nonstationary framework fig 6a whereas most watersheds saw a decrease in the standard deviation fig 6b after adjusting for nonstationarity a phenomenon to be expected in cases of ns hom where the mean of the data is accounted for in the trend term of the nonstationary model skew estimates generally increased for the most recent year of record fig 6c after nonstationary adjustment associated with a lower variance in the denominator of equation 4 the percent difference between the stationary and nonstationary flood quantile estimates for the most recent year of record are shown in fig 7 for select aeps blue orange shading indicates that the nonstationary estimate is higher lower than the stationary estimate with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals cis all nonoverlapping cis between stationary and nonstationary estimates occurred for waterhsheds where ia was found to be explanatory in the stage one regression with the exception of one watershed where the nonstationary estimate ns was lower than the stationary estimate st for all aeps shown cis tended to overlap in most cases particularly at lower exceedance probabilities 2 and 1 percent aep larger floods indicating that with these record lengths nonstationary estimates of larger floods are not significantly different than stationary estimates the overlapping 95 cis for larger floods indicate that at this level of confidence and data availability the parsimonious approach would be to assume stationarity depending on the needs of the water manager and their level of risk for over or under design smaller floods with aeps greater than 5 are well positioned for nonstationary adjustment because they are associated with less uncertainty and in many cases are significantly different from stationary estimates flood quantile estimates for the most recent year of record and associated 95 cis for all watersheds are shown in figure s3 and in tabular form in table s35 s38 to evaluate the fit of both stationary and nonstationary models to lp3 distributions ppcc plots are shown for watersheds 2 7 and 11 in fig 8 and in figure s4 for all watersheds associated p values for each ppcc test correspond to a null hypothesis that the log space data do not differ from a pearson 3 distribution in all cases except for watershed 17 that included a very low outlier figure s4 panel 17 all p values were 0 05 ppcc values are shown as pst for stationary and pns for nonstationary distributions differences between pst and pns were relatively small and associated p values revealed adequate fit to lp3 for both cases although visual inspection of the ppcc plots indicate some deviations from lp3 in the upper and lower tails 6 discussion 6 1 drivers of change considering the most recent hydrologic conditions up to 2020 the increasing trends in annual 2 month ppt across li in isolation do not cause nonstationary estimates to be significantly different from stationary estimates at the 95 confidence level as shown in fig 7 watersheds where first stage regression models contained only ppt as a covariate did not have nonoverlapping confidence intervals between stationary and nonstationary estimates no blue or orange shading ia is not explanatory however in conjunction with rapid development or when considering urban development ia as a sole driver of nonstationarity the most recent flood quantile estimates are generally higher than stationary estimates with nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals fig 7 blue shaded triangles this is consistent with vogel et al 2011 and hodgkins et al 2019 who concluded that the magnification of floods occurs much more dramatically in watersheds undergoing urbanization than in pristine watersheds even in the presence of climate trends furthermore the observed precipitation trends on li may not necessarily continue into the future and may reverse themselves in step with long term natural climate oscillations further study is needed to investigate the presence of climate trends across li and their potential impact on both surface and groundwater hydrology reductions in baseflow due to sanitary sewering and groundwater pumping have lowered the water table elevations busciolano 2005 and contributed to a partial reduction in peak flows over time the relationship between peak flows and groundwater is particularly evident for watersheds 6 and 14 usgs stations 01305000 and 01310000 table 4 although hac robust confidence intervals indicate that bf could also potentially be a significant predictor of annual instantaneous peak flows for watersheds 1 10 12 13 and 16 supplemental tables s1 s34 these watersheds show a distinct negative trend in baseflow associated with the dramatic reduction in bf since the early 1960 s due to pumping and sewering across nassau county fig 4 buxton and reilly 1985 likewise confidence intervals for the bf term are significant at 95 confidence for watersheds 3 6 7 8 10 13 14 and 15 in the stage two regressions supplemental tables s1 s34 potentially as explanatory factors of heteroskedasticity however due to the strict bic selection criterion used in this study these models were not selected for reasons of parsimony these results indicate that further modification to the water table elevations across li will likely have an effect on peak flows and flood frequency currently 2022 suffolk county is largely unsewered however proposed work by the county to expand sanitary sewers will likely reduce smaller floods and contribute to an increase in flood variability in the absence of increased recharge boughton 2021 rapid development occurred on li during the pre 1940 s for western li and from the 1950 s up to 1980 moving eastward across li during these periods of early urbanization peak flows increased with little or no change in variability in both suffolk and nassau counties floods have either become more variable or have begun an overall decrease across many watersheds beginning in the 1980s this pattern characterizes modern urbanized conditions that show evidence of base flow declines and the use of recharge and leaching basins as storm sewer outfalls the pattern is consistent with spinello and simmons 1992 who subdivided the peak flow record for li s south shore streams into pre urban urbanizing and a more recent period of subsequent urban adjustment they found that for li s south shore streams high and low flows became more variable from 1976 to 1985 due to the expansion of impervious surfaces which resulted in higher high flows and the lowering of the water table which resulted in lower low flows the changes observed by spinello and simmons appeared to be partially explained by the use of recharge basins which continue to be constructed and used as municipal storm sewer discharge locations across li it should be noted that along with the development of sewer drainage networks that have shifted contributing drainage areas to urban streamgages pluhowski and spinello 1978 it has been found that contributing groundwatersheds to surface water bodies on li may differ from surface water topographical drainage areas misut 2021 time trends interacting with impervious area were included in this study to represent changes in watershed management in more recent years of urban development these models were selected for watersheds 7 and 13 which exhibit nonmonotonic trends in peak flows over the past half century and have resulted in overall decreases in flood frequency figure s2 and s3 the redirection of stormwater in the swan river watershed watershed 7 usgs streamgage 01305500 and the preserve wetland area in the massapequa creek watershed watershed 13 usgs streamgage 01309500 may partially explain nonmonotonic trends in flood quantiles observed over the period of 1940 to 2020 massapequa creek is also located near the liberty industrial finishing superfund site designated in 1986 and has undergone shallow remedial pumping near the creek as well as stream augmentation www darrp noaa gov in the absence of time series data representative of each of these processes a time trend was used to represent the overall observed changes in peak flows further study could leverage historical information on pumping rates and date ranges of restoration projects to create an index more representative of physical processes leading to changes in flood frequency over time for watershed 7 swan river usgs station 01305500 nonmonotonic trends were also modeled by the interaction of time and ia peak flows on the swan river have been dramatically reduced since the 1990 s figs 2 and 5b despite having increasing trends in 2 month ppt and little to no overall change in long term baseflow patterns figs 3 and 4 large portions of the swan river no longer receive drainage from overland flow or stormwater outfalls because it has been intercepted by structures that route water to stormwater catch basins near a 30 acre lake swan river watershed management plan 2007 furthermore previous work in nassau and suffolk counties that showed recharge basins effectively convey stormwater to the groundwater returning the contained area to recharge conditions similar to a natural state seaburn and aronson 1974 however to quantitatively link these stormwater practices to flood frequency spatial and temporal data are needed to locate stormwater management structures and the timing of their construction choat et al 2022 additionally updates on the state of repair or disrepair of stormwater structures would allow for better prediction of flood variability particularly in the presence of more intense and frequent storms the results of this study indicate that stormwater management on li has effectively mitigated smaller floods but may remain vulnerable to larger storms this phenomenon is consistent with recent studies that underscore the flood reduction potential of stormwater control measures worldwide see bell et al 2020 and references therein 6 2 lp3 frequency models results from this study show that the effects of urbanization on flood frequency are more distinct for smaller magnitude floods larger aeps for the 20 aep flood 5 year recurrence interval nonstationary flood quantile estimates tend to be more distinct nonoverlapping confidence intervals from stationary estimates than for the 1 aep flood 100 year recurrence interval fig 7 figs s2 and s3 this is due in part to sampling uncertainty which is larger for estimates of floods with either the 2 or 1 percent aeps where the recurrence intervals are greater than the streamgage period of record additionally the higher percent differences in smaller nonstationary flood quantiles with smaller nonsignificant increases in larger floods fig 7 agree with numerous studies that have shown greater increases in smaller floods due to the expansion of impervious areas bian et al 2020 du et al 2012 hollis 1975 konrad 2016 over et al 2016 sauer et al 1983 the august 2014 storm that resulted in flooding across the central portions of li totaled more than 13 in of rainfall in 24 h for the town of islip setting a new record for new york state this storm resulted in the flood of record on the connetquot brook watershed 8 usgs station 01306460 as well as the carll s river watershed 12 usgs station 01308500 and sawampams creek watershed 11 usgs station 01308000 fig 2 results show that under the stationarity assumption for the sawampams creek the 2014 peak flow of 400 cfs corresponds to less than 0 2 percent aep flood greater than a 500 year recurrence interval under the assumption of stationarity fig 2 and fig s3 however this magnitude flood is approximately a 200 year recurrence interval under a nonstationary framework at the carlls river streamgage however the 2014 flood of 429 cfs corresponds to the 72 year flood discharge quantile under both stationary and nonstationary frameworks under climate change scenarios with increased frequency of intense rain events this type of storm will likely be more common and even with effective flood management these storms may overwhelm any systems in place for flood mitigation considering all aeps between 1 and 20 under current conditions fig 7 shows that all nonoverlapping 95 confidence intervals occurred in watersheds where ia was a significant predictor except for watershed 14 bellmore creek usgs streamgage 01310000 for which the selected stage one model has baseflow and precipitation as co predictors in watershed 14 peak flows have decreased in large part due to baseflow reductions associated with the construction of storm and sanitary sewers through the 1960 s and 1970 s simmons and reynolds 1982 this indicates that anthropogenic watershed changes exert a stronger control over peak flows than only precipitation for urbanized watersheds on li despite increasing trends in the ppt variable serinaldi and kilsby 2015 argued that deterministic hydrologic knowledge is required for nonstationary models to be considered over stationary models where observed trends and shifts in the flood series can be attributed to specific physical processes they assert that a direct historical analysis of changes to infiltration runoff production and drainage networks should be considered when modelling nonstationarity in urbanizing watersheds to expand on the covariates in this analysis that include a time trend representative of modern urban development connected versus disconnected impervious development could be considered hwang et al 2017 as well as changes to water management and groundwater use that effectively change runoff dynamics the most recent atmosphere ocean general circulation models cmip6 project more annual and extreme rainfall concentrated in warmer winters with hotter summers for the us northeast coast ipcc regional climate projections 2022 particularly in the case of more frequent intense storms that surpass soil infiltration capacities these conditions are expected to stress li s groundwater system although more work needs to be done to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the li aquifer system boughton 2021 without substantial increases to recharge future population growth and intensification of groundwater use will lower base flows and more intense extreme rainfall events will likely increase peak flow variability for li s groundwater fed streams streams in nassau county and neighboring queens and kings counties are especially susceptible to floods associated with projected precipitation increases which can become further enhanced by the urban heat island effect mcgrane 2016 new stormwater management plans across all counties on li aim to buffer these changes through infrastructure improvements and nature based mitigation features nassau county hazard mitigation plan 2021 suffolk county climate action plan 2015 wolfe et al 2021 7 study limitations the results of this study are limited to an analysis of peak flow trends on li and their potential effect on flood frequency more work is needed to quantify relative contributions of individual watershed characteristics such as land cover and watershed specific stormwater management practices because of li streams high bfi and urban cover groundwater contributing areas and storm sewersheds should be explored as an alternative to topographic surface water drainage areas future studies could address this by evaluating other covariates representative of historical changes in development watershed management practices and sewer coverage regional models of flood quantile estimates for ungaged watersheds could be associated with static watershed characteristics such as the year of transition between rapid and modern development average depth and variation of water table levels and proximity to superfund and other remediation sites spatial distribution and infiltration capacity of recharge basins storm sewer outfalls and low impact urban design should also be explored as potentially significant variables in a regional analysis further the housing density dataset theobald 2005 used in this study as the basis for the ia input variable is limited because it is based on projections made in the year 2000 and contains commercial industrial transportation cit coverage fixed at the year 2000 state future work could improve on this input variable by making further adjustments and using updated census data to adjust this variable to changes in urban fraction reflected in recent decades in this study both stationary and nonstationary flood quantile estimates were calculated without the detection and treatment of potentially influential low peak flows which can lead to underestimation of the upper end of the frequency distribution the expected moments algorithm ema could be used to explore the prevalence of these low outliers before and after nonstationary peak flow adjustment leading to an improved distributional fit for many li streams see supplemental figure s4 cohn et al 2013 griffis et al 2004 despite the proliferation of research on nonstationarity there remains a lack of consensus about trend thresholds warranting the selection of a nonstationarity model the benefits of adding parameters to a nonstationary model in terms of bias reduction must outweigh the increase in uncertainty that arises from adding more parameters although our model selection criteria were relatively strict bic and 95 confidence interval overlaps the ultimate decision to use a nonstationary model over a stationary one depends on a stakeholder tolerance for over design and under design of infrastructure rosner et al 2014 in this study flood quantiles were estimated with a given annual chance that reflect current watershed conditions rather than projecting forward in time or trying to evaluate risk to an investment over a specific project time horizon this study examines flood nonstationarity using historical datasets and evaluates flood frequency under current urbanization and climate conditions because of the additional uncertainty associated with diverse climate projection models and scenarios montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and apparently changing urban flood management practices that increasingly integrate nature based solutions chiu et al 2021 we do not attempt to encompass future projections into our models encompassing future projection could be a possible extension of the methods presented in this paper and would require a holistic approach to nonstationary design that includes stakeholder decisions regarding uncertainty and risk of failure over a project planning horizon salas et al 2018 yan et al 2017 precipitation trends that were determined by robust regression of two month precipitation totals and time were likely influenced by the 1960 s drought further analysis of precipitation trends in this region should take this into consideration and re analyze trends after the post 1970 transition to a wetter climate mccabe and wolock 2021 we used robust regression to estimate the current average flood generating precipitation conditions and not as a full trend analysis per se more work is needed to assess the cause and nature of any precipitation trends across li it should be assessed whether increases in flood generating precipitation are associated with observed abrupt shifts in total annual and extreme precipitation 1996 and 2002 huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 or long term increasing trends in extreme precipitation associated with tropical cyclones that have been observed across li reed et al 2022 the two stage sequential estimation of distribution parameters used in this study differs from hecht and vogel 2020 in a few key ways first this study uses robust multiple regression instead of ordinary least squares on a single covariate and second the resulting conditional moments were fit to an lp3 distribution rather than a two parameter log normal a more rigorous assessment may be necessary to determine whether sequential or other simultaneous estimation methods such as maximum likelihood may be more favorable considering these differences 8 summary and conclusions this work was motivated by a need for accurate flood quantile estimates for a densely populated coastal region of the us that has undergone changes in land cover climate and stormwater management there is a great need for flood frequency estimates for long island new york which is the largest and most populous island in the conterminous united states and has undergone intense urbanization over the past century the purpose of the current study is twofold 1 to define the principal drivers of the observed trends and changes in peak flow magnitude and variability and 2 to explore the impacts of these changes on flood frequency analysis across gaged watersheds on long island our results show that urbanization can have a mixed effect on annual instantaneous peak flow series manifesting as early and late development phases annual instantaneous peak flow data were fit to a log pearson iii lp3 distribution using both unconditional and conditional means and standard deviations of the log transformed peak flows these conditional moments were estimated using a two stage robust regression procedure adjusted for conditions in the most recent year 2020 of peak flow record the two stage sequential regression approach was adapted from hecht and vogel 2020 and employed to update estimates of the mean stage one and variance stage two of the log transformed annual instantaneous peak streamflows analysis indicates that when considering nonstationarity the most pronounced and widespread adjustments occur for smaller floods with greater than a 5 percent aep for these smaller floods most adjustments to flood quantiles from a stationary to nonstationary framework were positive significant increases for example at sawampams creek at babylon watershed 11 streamgage 01308000 the 1 aep flood under 2020 average conditions may be 50 higher than traditional stationary flood quantile estimates and what is currently considered the 1 percent aep flood could actually be closer to the 5 percent aep flood when the urban development to date is taken into account nonmonotonic trends were modeled for two watersheds and likely reflect stormwater management and remediation practices implemented in more recent decades that include redirecting stormwater discharge away from the channel the results show that stormwater management on long island can have a dramatic effect on flood frequency and more data are needed to identify the timing and location of these practices to reliably generalize regional flood patterns urban development in the form of impervious area is a significant predictor of conditional distribution parameters in 8 of the 17 watersheds included in this study the effect of impervious area on peak flows is modulated by the two month precipitation total precipitation of the month of the peakflow and the preceding month in most watersheds which itself exhibits positive trends over time it is uncertain whether the general observed upward precipitation trends will continue into the future although future modeled climate scenarios indicate a wetter northeastern us region hoerling et al 2016 warmer temperatures and associated changes in groundwater use across long island including higher groundwater demand coupled with more intense winter storms would likely further shift peak flow patterns and lead to increased variability continued alterations to the groundwater table will likely affect smaller floods on long island whereas floods from larger storms will remain unchanged by these alterations because the streams of long island have uniquely high baseflow indices bfi the consideration of groundwater contributing areas in the delineation of watershed boundaries may be necessary to improve future models of flood annual exceedance probabilities 9 data availability all data used in this study are published and publicly available annual

2266,combining long term measurements of nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations in the yellow river yr 1981 2018 and river discharge 1981 2018 to the bohai sea bs with model based estimates of nutrient delivery shows a disconnect between nutrient delivery and export fluxes to the bs basin wide nutrient delivery to surface water primarily from agriculture and sewage exhibited an increasing trend over the whole period however the nutrient export fluxes to bs declined from 1981 to 2002 followed by a period of large inter annual variability nutrient export is strongly controlled by water discharge the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs and the large volume of water containing nutrients that is extracted for primarily irrigation dissolved organic n average 15 in the period 2001 2018 and dissolved organic p 68 accounted for an important share of total dissolved n and p which is due to agricultural inputs and preferential retention of inorganic forms in the yr basin river nutrient export fluxes alone cannot explain the changes in the frequency and area of red tides in the bs due to impacts of the wsrs the long water residence time in the bs and climate change this calls for the application of mechanistic models for describing the impact of combined long term changes in the bs ecosystem keywords anthropogenic perturbations bohai sea yellow river sources forms

in estuaries dai et al 2011 gao and wang 2007 pan et al 2013 tong et al 2015 anthropogenic activities through wastewater from households and industries and leaching and runoff from agricultural fields have caused a rapid increase in river export of the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p to coastal waters in large parts of the world leading to severe eutrophication beusen et al 2022 and changes in nutrient forms and proportions billen et al 1991 one of the symptoms of eutrophication and nutrient distortions is the increase in the frequency and area of harmful algal blooms habs beusen et al 2022 glibert 2017 gobler 2020 habs are a major environmental problem in china as they increasingly occur in the bohai sea bs yellow sea east china sea and south china sea since the 1980 s wang et al 2021a the bs is a special case as it is a semi confined sea in which the yellow river yr the second largest river in china drains water with large loads of sediments and nutrients from extensive agricultural landscapes the discharge of the yr is strongly regulated by dams and reservoirs which control the seasonal patterns of the hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a water consumption in the yr has a strong impact on the hydrology and nutrient cycling tong et al 2016 in order to prevent floods provide irrigation water and generate hydropower more than 148 large and medium reservoirs with a total average volume of 31 km3 were constructed in the yellow river basin yrb during the period 1997 2018 yellow river conservancy commission yrcc approximately 19 gt of sediment was trapped by yr reservoirs until 2010 ran et al 2013 which has strongly reduced the water storage capacity of many reservoirs the yrcc has implemented the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs at the beginning of every flood season since 2002 to improve the imbalance between water discharge and sediment loading and remove accumulated sediments from reservoirs and the yr channel the wsrs changed the water discharge seasonal patterns with an average of 28 of the annual water discharge and 41 of the annual nutrient flux into the bs occurring in less than one month liu et al 2012 this dramatic alteration of the hydrological regime has profound physicochemical ecological and geomorphological effects on the lower reaches of the river and the estuary li et al 2017 liu et al 2012 wu et al 2019 regarding the impacts of the yr on the bs ecosystem most studies focused on nutrient changes since the wsrs and did not consider changes in the proportions and forms of nutrients due to damming tong et al 2015 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 yu et al 2010 however distortion of nutrient proportions and a shift in the nutrient composition particularly towards more organic n and p forms may lead to the proliferation of specific hab species ou et al 2018 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2020b to improve our understanding of the long term changes in the bs ecosystem we need to compare the situation before and after the wsrs and consider the changes in the n and p forms in the yrb due to damming therefore the aims of this paper are to 1 quantify long term 1970 2010 nutrient loading in the yrb and analyze the impact of changes of different sources agriculture wastewater nature and water extraction 2 explore the changes of nutrients by river export in terms of total loading and inorganic and organic nutrient species to the bs under the influence of the wsrs reservoirs and water usage and 3 assess the impact of nutrient inputs proportions and chemical species of the yr on the ecology of the bs particularly the occurrences of red tides 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and methods the nutrient hydrological and supporting data used in this paper are listed in table 1 nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n and phosphate po4 p were measured in samples collected monthly from 2001 to 2018 at the lijin lj station lj is the nearest hydrological station to the river mouth about 100 km upstream which can represent the riverine materials flowing into the bs fig 1 after filtering water samples through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane no3 n

measured by wet oxidation in acid persulfate with an analytical precision of 0 68 µmol l for tn and tdn and 0 02 µmol l for tp and tdp grasshoff et al 1999 the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop concentrations were calculated as the difference between tdn and din and between tdp and po4 p respectively monthly din and po4 p data from 1981 to 1989 at luokou station were taken from the institute of environmental health monitoring 1990 annual din data during 1991 1998 at the lijin station were obtained from lü and zhang 2000 po4 p concentrations are lacking the monthly nutrient fluxes were calculated as the product of monthly nutrient concentrations and water discharge the annual nutrient concentrations and fluxes were calculated by the mean monthly nutrient concentrations and the sum of monthly nutrient fluxes respectively 2 2 image gnm model based

2015 beusen et al 2022 nutrient sources include diffuse sources in natural and agricultural land point sources sewage water aquaculture allochthonous organic material from vegetation in floodplains

uses the soil budget approach n inputs for the soil budget are synthetic n fertilizer animal manure biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition and outputs are crop and grass withdrawal and ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification are calculated on the basis of soil properties and climate input terms in the soil p budget are fertilizer use and animal manure and outputs include crop and grass withdrawal nutrients are delivered to inland surface water by different sources and transport pathways within a grid cell and via streams and rivers flowing from upstream to downstream grid cells 3 results 3 1 changes in water discharge and nutrient fluxes the water discharge of the yr at lijin showed strong inter annual variability with a distinct decreasing trend in the period 1981 2002 and a sharp increase to a higher average level of 19 km3 yr after 2002 fig 2 a annual din and po4 p fluxes and water discharge exhibited similar inter annual variability fig 2b c both din and po4 p fluxes showed a decline in the years 1981 2002 followed by a period of strong inter annual variability lacking a clear trend the patterns of annual tn and tp fluxes were similar to those of din and po4 p respectively fig s1 annual don and dop fluxes during 2001 2018 vary strongly and lack a clear trend fig 2b c the molar din po4 p ratios are much higher than the redfield ratio 16 and showed small changes before 2002 and continuously increased between 2002 and 2007 followed by large year to year variability fig 2d molar tdn tdp ratios are lower than din po4 p ratios and exhibited large inter annual variability with values ranging between 300 and 900 fig 2d e monthly din r 0 840 n 326 p 0 0001 and po4 p r 0 813 n 290 p 0 0001 fluxes both show strong positive relationships with water discharge fig s2 monthly patterns of water discharge prior to 2002 showed a clear peak during the flood season from july to october fig 3 a wsrs changed the seasonal variations of the water discharge with lower peaks compared to the period before 2002 but earlier in the year july fig 3a similar to the monthly water discharge monthly din and po4 p fluxes were consistently high from july to october before 2002 and this peak advanced to july after the implementation of wsrs fig 3b c 3 2 organic nutrient composition calculated average annual don tdn don tn dop tdp and dop tp ratios in the yr from 2001 to 2018 were 0 15 0 13 0 68 and 0 16 respectively similar to other studies table 2 with the strong variability in some years the share of the dissolved organic nutrients may be even higher fig 2b c 3 3 temporal variation of nutrient sources the image gnm soil tn budget in the yrb increased 5 fold from 642 gg n yr in 1970 to 3307 gg n yr in 2010 fig 4 a the soil tp budget rose over 50 times from 11 gg p yr to 603 gg p yr during the period 1970 2010 fig 4b parallel to the soil nutrient budgets the n and p delivery to surface water of the yr simulated by image gnm continuously increased from 303 to 1204 gg n yr and 56 to 167 gg p yr especially after 1980 delivery of n through agricultural surface runoff and groundwater discharge and from sewage increased almost 3 fold 134 to 367 gg n yr 9 fold 42 to 362 gg n yr and 4 fold 102 to 387 gg n yr between 1970 and 2010 respectively fig 4c p loading through surface runoff from agriculture and sewage increased more than 2 fold from 42 to 104 gg p yr and 5 fold from 10 to 52 gg p yr fig 4d the n and p delivery from natural sources remained stable at about 20 gg n yr and 3 gg p yr with a declining percentage of total delivery fig 4c d p runoff from natural ecosystems in china declined from 0 35 tg p yr in 1600 to 0 25 tg p yr in 2012 liu et al 2016 nutrients from aquaculture increased from 1 to 63 gg n yr and 0 08 to 7 gg p yr with a contribution to total delivery growing from 0 4 to 5 for n and from 0 1 to 4 for p fig 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 agriculture and sewage sources dominate the nutrient sources the average proportion of agricultural sources and sewage in tn delivery was 63 55 70 and 32 24 38 which is consistent with independent estimates of 59 and 23 respectively yu et al 2019 agriculture was the main source for both n and p delivery fig 4c d similar to the situation in the yangtze river liu et al 2018 the changes in the agricultural crop sown area during the years 2000 2018 were not large but fertilizer application in the yrb increased rapidly during 1985 2018 fig s3a b the share of tp delivery from agricultural surface runoff decreased from 75 to 63 with an average of 72 and that of sewage increased from 18 to 31 which is comparable with agricultural contribution of 64 of the tp load in the yrb wang et al 2021c the total population and domestic wastewater in the yrb demonstrated an increasing trend fig s3c d both the urban population and proportion of urban residents in the yrb gradually increased fig s3e f increasing urban populations with connection to sewage systems resulted in large amounts of untreated human waste due to absence of any treatment in the initial years or the dominance of secondary treatment systems in more recent years the contribution of nutrients from aquaculture to total delivery increased from negligible amounts to 4 5 for n and p fig 4c d which is similar to findings for the yangtze river basin cui et al 2021 liu et al 2018 4 2 long term disconnect of terrestrial inputs and river nutrient export in contrast to the increasing delivery to surface waters in the yrb during the period 1970 2010 the n and p export fluxes do not show such a gradual increase as they are strongly controlled by water discharge these changes in export by the yr to the bs are the net result of changes in the soil nutrient budgets in agriculture section 4 2 1 retention through temporary storage of nutrients in soils groundwater and sediments section 4 2 2 and water consumption section 4 2 3 4 2 1 soil nutrient budgets in most years the soil tn and tp budget surpluses were much larger than the output fluxes from surface runoff and groundwater fig 4 budget p deficits prior to 1975 may be due to neglecting human manure which was playing an important role in that period fao 1977 the difference between soil budgets and delivery to surface water is due to soil and groundwater denitrification and accumulation of n and p in soils and groundwater as was also reported in other river basins like the mississippi river van meter et al 2016 high inorganic nitrogen mainly no3 n accumulation in soil profiles was observed in many regions of china especially in dryland soils of north china cui et al 2008 ju et al 2004 soil no3 n accumulated in winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the north china plain was above 172 kg ha in 90 cm soil depth cui et al 2008 4 2 2 temporary storage of nutrients the surplus n and p applications in soils bouwman et al 2017 accumulate in soils and another part of the n and p is lost by surface runoff and erosion or leaching and subsequent groundwater transport and may be trapped in river and reservoir sediments groundwater wetlands riparian floodplains and lakes sharpley et al 2013 with the increasing water storage in large and medium sized reservoirs in the yrb the nutrient retention in the reservoirs is an important filter for nutrients fig 5 a the water storage of large and medium sized reservoirs in the yrb increased 3 fold from 14 km3 yr in 1997 to 42 km3 yr in 2018 fig 5a the long water residence times in the reservoirs are prone to nutrient retention through uptake sedimentation absorption and denitrification liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2020 xu et al 2018 for example the xld reservoir is generally thermally stratified during warmer summers with hypoxic bottom water conditions known to favour denitrification cheng et al 2019 the cascade dam in the upper yr decreased the flux of tn 38 fold and that of tp 6 fold ouyang et al 2011 din retention flux was 0 9 gg in the xiaolangdi reservoir in june 2017 xu et al 2018 which was approximately 3 of the annual din flux at lijin the retention effect of large reservoirs has led to significant reductions of nutrient concentrations at lijin station since 2014 wu et al 2021 the n retention in reservoirs is partly lost by denitrification finlay et al 2013 or burial in sediments vilmin et al 2020 p retention in reservoirs is due to p burial in sediments these temporary stores for n and p can be released to the water column when concentrations of n vilmin et al 2020 and p decline reddy et al 1999 and thus form a legacy of past nutrient management 4 2 3 water consumption another factor influencing river nutrient export is water consumption which removes nutrients from the yr during transport to the bs average water consumption through surface water extraction from 1998 to 2018 was 30 km3 yr which exceeds the water discharge at the river mouth during the same period by a factor of 2 fig 5a agricultural water consumption excluding the return flow from field drainage declined from 91 to 66 of total water consumption in the period 1998 to 2018 fig 5b the average annual total water consumption during 2000 2010 made up approximately 60 of net precipitation precipitation minus evapotranspiration in yrb based on the n and p delivery loads fig 4 and river export to the bs from 2000 to 2010 and accounting for total water consumption fig 5a the calculated average annual biogeochemical retention in the yr was approximately 33 9 56 for n and 39 19 64 for p fig s4 this would be higher if we account for water extraction however it is difficult to estimate the net effect because we do not know the composition of the drainage return flow hence the n retention in the yr was similar to that in the yangtze river average 34 during 2001 2010 liu et al 2018 but lower than mississippi river average 43 during 2001 2010 the p retention fraction in the yr was lower than that in the yangtze river 47 liu et al 2018 and mississippi river 66 this may be attributed to the relatively small reservoir volume and the large volume of consumption in the yr compared to that in the yangtze river table s1 4 3 nutrient composition agriculture as the primary nutrient source in the river basin may have a strong impact on the nutrient composition in the yr excessive fertilizer application resulted in the extremely high din in the yr fig 4c and s3b which was similar to previous studies wu et al 2021 yu et al 2010 although the average proportion of don in dtn is around 15 the average don concentration is approximately 53 μmol l and the highest concentration can be up to more than 100 μmol l dop concentrations in the yr increased after 2009 making up 0 95 of the tdp and annual minimum don concentrations also showed an upward trend wu et al 2021 the don tdn and dop tdp ratios were approximately 0 13 and 0 41 in the yellow river estuary respectively liu et al 2009 the don tdn don tn and dop tp ratios in the yr were comparable to those in the yangtze river while the dop tdp ratios in the yr exceed those in the yangtze river table 2 it is known that urea fertilizers contribute to river don glibert et al 2006 the use of urea in china was close to 60 of total n fertilizer use in the early 2000 s and at present it is still around 35 ifa 2022 urea made up 19 of don at datong in the yangtze river during the period 2011 2014 zhang 2015 similarly increasing use of p fertilizers and management of animal manure inevitably leads to increasing p losses through surface runoff bouwman et al 2017 human excreta in sewage water and animal manure also contribute to don and dop loading the yr has the highest suspended sediment concentration of any major river in the world pan et al 2013 the high suspended particulate matter are accompanied by high don which can lead to rapid transformation including ammonification and subsequent nitrification rates xia et al 2013 due to high suspended particulate matter concentrations in the yr po4 p is easily absorbed into particulates thus lowering the po4 p concentrations in the water column liu et al 2012 pan et al 2013 therefore dop concentrations exceed the po4 p concentrations in most years fig 2c in addition the reservoirs change the nutrient composition don and dop retention in some reservoirs are lower than those of din and po4 p for example don tdn dop tdp and dop tp ratios in the outflow of the three gorges reservoir at yichang were higher than the same ratios in the inflow at fuling ding et al 2019 finally wsrs promoted the release of several dissolved free amino acids asp glu and gly from particulate amino acids and sediment amino acids to the dissolved phase by 4 17 zhang et al 2020a 4 4 impact of nutrients on the environment of the bohai sea yr contributed 60 of the freshwater discharge 90 of the sediment and the largest proportion of nutrient loads including organic n and p in the freshwater flow to bs wang et al 2009 with this important share in the supply of water materials and nutrients bs may thus be impacted by nutrient ratios nutrient flushing in early summer during wsrs and the high fluxes of organic nutrients in the yr discharge the yr discharge into bs is characterized by high din po4 p and tdn tdp ratios fig 2 nutrient export by the yr could therefore lead to p limitation for phytoplankton growth in the yr estuary and bs zhang et al 2004 due to the combined effect of riverine inputs atmospheric deposition anthropogenic activities and the relatively long residence time of water in the bs liu et al 2017 din concentrations and din po4 p ratios have been increasing in the bs ning et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 along with high don and dop fluxes the frequency and area covered by red tides the major hab in bs has rapidly increased since 1995 fig s5 approximately 70 of the annual occurrences of red tides occurred in the months june july and august song et al 2016 wsrs promoted the diffusion of nutrients to the central bs wang et al 2017b which may be related to the gradual extension of habs from the coastal waters to the central part of the bs after 2000 song et al 2016 the dominant hab species in observed red tides was noctiluca scintillans before the year 2000 while since then the species became more diverse major species are noctiluca scintillans skeletonema costatum karenia mikimotoi mesodinium rubrum and phaeocystis globosa song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 although our data show no clear correlations between din don po4 p and dop fluxes and din po4 p ratio with the frequency and area of red tides in the bs during different periods figs s5 s7 the high don and dop fluxes may impact the proliferation of certain hab species various studies showed that the red tide species skeletonema costatum can utilize various forms of don and dop to maintain high abundance in din and po4 p deficient systems zhang et al 2020b flagellates alexandrium tamarense chattonela marina and h akashiwo in the bs grew well in the presence of dop wang et al 2011 don is known to drive the shift from diatom to dinoflagellate in the bohai sea chen et al 2022 the major brown tide species aureococcus anophagefferens began to appear after the year 2009 wang et al 2021b ou et al 2018 demonstrated that aureococcus anophagefferens grows faster in the presence of urea and glutamic acid than with inorganic substrates brown tides are normally limited to a small area in the northwestern part of the bs with a strong impact on mariculture production primarily shellfish 5 conclusions our results show that the human interference in the yr hydrology is so strong that the nutrient sources on the one hand and the export and impacts in bs became disconnected the human interferences agricultural intensification wastewater discharge dam construction water extraction and the wsrs cause changing seasonality of water and nutrient fluxes changing stoichiometry and high levels of organic nutrient forms which are known to strongly impact hab proliferation however the bs biogeochemical system is complex amongst others due to the long residence time of water in the bs and possibly climate change that there is no direct relationship between nutrient sources and fluxes into bs and their impact on hab proliferation the impacts of nutrient loading may be delayed or habs may appear after successions of algal blooms apart from changing seasonal patterns the nutrient composition changed the high n p ratios are due to the high din concentrations and extremely low po4 p concentrations which are easily absorbed to the high suspended sediment the high organic n and p export fluxes to bs are the result of agricultural organic nutrient sources preferential retention of inorganic forms suspended sediments in the water column and reservoir retention processes lacking clear direct relationships between nutrient fluxes nutrient ratios and forms in the yr export to bs on the one hand and the frequency and area of red tides in the bs on the other hand show that there is a need for employing mechanistic models for analyzing the combined long term impact of multiple and simultaneous changes on biogeochemistry in the bs credit authorship contribution statement fuxia yang investigation

2266,combining long term measurements of nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations in the yellow river yr 1981 2018 and river discharge 1981 2018 to the bohai sea bs with model based estimates of nutrient delivery shows a disconnect between nutrient delivery and export fluxes to the bs basin wide nutrient delivery to surface water primarily from agriculture and sewage exhibited an increasing trend over the whole period however the nutrient export fluxes to bs declined from 1981 to 2002 followed by a period of large inter annual variability nutrient export is strongly controlled by water discharge the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs and the large volume of water containing nutrients that is extracted for primarily irrigation dissolved organic n average 15 in the period 2001 2018 and dissolved organic p 68 accounted for an important share of total dissolved n and p which is due to agricultural inputs and preferential retention of inorganic forms in the yr basin river nutrient export fluxes alone cannot explain the changes in the frequency and area of red tides in the bs due to impacts of the wsrs the long water residence time in the bs and climate change this calls for the application of mechanistic models for describing the impact of combined long term changes in the bs ecosystem keywords anthropogenic perturbations bohai sea yellow river sources forms and ratios of nutrients impacts retention data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river export of nutrients has a large impact on the ecology of coastal seas especially in estuaries dai et al 2011 gao and wang 2007 pan et al 2013 tong et al 2015 anthropogenic activities through wastewater from households and industries and leaching and runoff from agricultural fields have caused a rapid increase in river export of the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p to coastal waters in large parts of the world leading to severe eutrophication beusen et al 2022 and changes in nutrient forms and proportions billen et al 1991 one of the symptoms of eutrophication and nutrient distortions is the increase in the frequency and area of harmful algal blooms habs beusen et al 2022 glibert 2017 gobler 2020 habs are a major environmental problem in china as they increasingly occur in the bohai sea bs yellow sea east china sea and south china sea since the 1980 s wang et al 2021a the bs is a special case as it is a semi confined sea in which the yellow river yr the second largest river in china drains water with large loads of sediments and nutrients from extensive agricultural landscapes the discharge of the yr is strongly regulated by dams and reservoirs which control the seasonal patterns of the hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a water consumption in the yr has a strong impact on the hydrology and nutrient cycling tong et al 2016 in order to prevent floods provide irrigation water and generate hydropower more than 148 large and medium reservoirs with a total average volume of 31 km3 were constructed in the yellow river basin yrb during the period 1997 2018 yellow river conservancy commission yrcc approximately 19 gt of sediment was trapped by yr reservoirs until 2010 ran et al 2013 which has strongly reduced the water storage capacity of many reservoirs the yrcc has implemented the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs at the beginning of every flood season since 2002 to improve the imbalance between water discharge and sediment loading and remove accumulated sediments from reservoirs and the yr channel the wsrs changed the water discharge seasonal patterns with an average of 28 of the annual water discharge and 41 of the annual nutrient flux into the bs occurring in less than one month liu et al 2012 this dramatic alteration of the hydrological regime has profound physicochemical ecological and geomorphological effects on the lower reaches of the river and the estuary li et al 2017 liu et al 2012 wu et al 2019 regarding the impacts of the yr on the bs ecosystem most studies focused on nutrient changes since the wsrs and did not consider changes in the proportions and forms of nutrients due to damming tong et al 2015 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 yu et al 2010 however distortion of nutrient proportions and a shift in the nutrient composition particularly towards more organic n and p forms may lead to the proliferation of specific hab species ou et al 2018 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2020b to improve our understanding of the long term changes in the bs ecosystem we need to compare the situation before and after the wsrs and consider the changes in the n and p forms in the yrb due to damming therefore the aims of this paper are to 1 quantify long term 1970 2010 nutrient loading in the yrb and analyze the impact of changes of different sources agriculture wastewater nature and water extraction 2 explore the changes of nutrients by river export in terms of total loading and inorganic and organic nutrient species to the bs under the influence of the wsrs reservoirs and water usage and 3 assess the impact of nutrient inputs proportions and chemical species of the yr on the ecology of the bs particularly the occurrences of red tides 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and methods the nutrient hydrological and supporting data used in this paper are listed in table 1 nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n and phosphate po4 p were measured in samples collected monthly from 2001 to 2018 at the lijin lj station lj is the nearest hydrological station to the river mouth about 100 km upstream which can represent the riverine materials flowing into the bs fig 1 after filtering water samples through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p were measured using respectively the cadmium copper reduction method the standard pink azo dye method the indophenol blue method and phosphate molybdenum method the detection limits for no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p were 0 02 0 02 0 03 and 0 01 µmol l respectively total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp were measured by wet oxidation in acid persulfate with an analytical precision of 0 68 µmol l for tn and tdn and 0 02 µmol l for tp and tdp grasshoff et al 1999 the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop concentrations were calculated as the difference between tdn and din and between tdp and po4 p respectively monthly din and po4 p data from 1981 to 1989 at luokou station were taken from the institute of environmental health monitoring 1990 annual din data during 1991 1998 at the lijin station were obtained from lü and zhang 2000 po4 p concentrations are lacking the monthly nutrient fluxes were calculated as the product of monthly nutrient concentrations and water discharge the annual nutrient concentrations and fluxes were calculated by the mean monthly nutrient concentrations and the sum of monthly nutrient fluxes respectively 2 2 image gnm model based on land cover and climate data from the integrated assessment model image stehfest et al 2014 and hydrological data from the model pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 the grid based image gnm 0 5 0 5 beusen et al 2015 was used to simulate river n and p loading from various sources for the period 1970 2010 a brief description of image gnm is given below details can be found elsewhere beusen et al 2015 beusen et al 2022 nutrient sources include diffuse sources in natural and agricultural land point sources sewage water aquaculture allochthonous organic material from vegetation in floodplains and p from rock weathering diffuse nutrients are delivered to surface water by surface runoff leaching from soils via shallow and deep groundwater and riparian zones for the diffuse sources image gnm uses the soil budget approach n inputs for the soil budget are synthetic n fertilizer animal manure biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition and outputs are crop and grass withdrawal and ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification are calculated on the basis of soil properties and climate input terms in the soil p budget are fertilizer use and animal manure and outputs include crop and grass withdrawal nutrients are delivered to inland surface water by different sources and transport pathways within a grid cell and via streams and rivers flowing from upstream to downstream grid cells 3 results 3 1 changes in water discharge and nutrient fluxes the water discharge of the yr at lijin showed strong inter annual variability with a distinct decreasing trend in the period 1981 2002 and a sharp increase to a higher average level of 19 km3 yr after 2002 fig 2 a annual din and po4 p fluxes and water discharge exhibited similar inter annual variability fig 2b c both din and po4 p fluxes showed a decline in the years 1981 2002 followed by a period of strong inter annual variability lacking a clear trend the patterns of annual tn and tp fluxes were similar to those of din and po4 p respectively fig s1 annual don and dop fluxes during 2001 2018 vary strongly and lack a clear trend fig 2b c the molar din po4 p ratios are much higher than the redfield ratio 16 and showed small changes before 2002 and continuously increased between 2002 and 2007 followed by large year to year variability fig 2d molar tdn tdp ratios are lower than din po4 p ratios and exhibited large inter annual variability with values ranging between 300 and 900 fig 2d e monthly din r 0 840 n 326 p 0 0001 and po4 p r 0 813 n 290 p 0 0001 fluxes both show strong positive relationships with water discharge fig s2 monthly patterns of water discharge prior to 2002 showed a clear peak during the flood season from july to october fig 3 a wsrs changed the seasonal variations of the water discharge with lower peaks compared to the period before 2002 but earlier in the year july fig 3a similar to the monthly water discharge monthly din and po4 p fluxes were consistently high from july to october before 2002 and this peak advanced to july after the implementation of wsrs fig 3b c 3 2 organic nutrient composition calculated average annual don tdn don tn dop tdp and dop tp ratios in the yr from 2001 to 2018 were 0 15 0 13 0 68 and 0 16 respectively similar to other studies table 2 with the strong variability in some years the share of the dissolved organic nutrients may be even higher fig 2b c 3 3 temporal variation of nutrient sources the image gnm soil tn budget in the yrb increased 5 fold from 642 gg n yr in 1970 to 3307 gg n yr in 2010 fig 4 a the soil tp budget rose over 50 times from 11 gg p yr to 603 gg p yr during the period 1970 2010 fig 4b parallel to the soil nutrient budgets the n and p delivery to surface water of the yr simulated by image gnm continuously increased from 303 to 1204 gg n yr and 56 to 167 gg p yr especially after 1980 delivery of n through agricultural surface runoff and groundwater discharge and from sewage increased almost 3 fold 134 to 367 gg n yr 9 fold 42 to 362 gg n yr and 4 fold 102 to 387 gg n yr between 1970 and 2010 respectively fig 4c p loading through surface runoff from agriculture and sewage increased more than 2 fold from 42 to 104 gg p yr and 5 fold from 10 to 52 gg p yr fig 4d the n and p delivery from natural sources remained stable at about 20 gg n yr and 3 gg p yr with a declining percentage of total delivery fig 4c d p runoff from natural ecosystems in china declined from 0 35 tg p yr in 1600 to 0 25 tg p yr in 2012 liu et al 2016 nutrients from aquaculture increased from 1 to 63 gg n yr and 0 08 to 7 gg p yr with a contribution to total delivery growing from 0 4 to 5 for n and from 0 1 to 4 for p fig 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 agriculture and sewage sources dominate the nutrient sources the average proportion of agricultural sources and sewage in tn delivery was 63 55 70 and 32 24 38 which is consistent with independent estimates of 59 and 23 respectively yu et al 2019 agriculture was the main source for both n and p delivery fig 4c d similar to the situation in the yangtze river liu et al 2018 the changes in the agricultural crop sown area during the years 2000 2018 were not large but fertilizer application in the yrb increased rapidly during 1985 2018 fig s3a b the share of tp delivery from agricultural surface runoff decreased from 75 to 63 with an average of 72 and that of sewage increased from 18 to 31 which is comparable with agricultural contribution of 64 of the tp load in the yrb wang et al 2021c the total population and domestic wastewater in the yrb demonstrated an increasing trend fig s3c d both the urban population and proportion of urban residents in the yrb gradually increased fig s3e f increasing urban populations with connection to sewage systems resulted in large amounts of untreated human waste due to absence of any treatment in the initial years or the dominance of secondary treatment systems in more recent years the contribution of nutrients from aquaculture to total delivery increased from negligible amounts to 4 5 for n and p fig 4c d which is similar to findings for the yangtze river basin cui et al 2021 liu et al 2018 4 2 long term disconnect of terrestrial inputs and river nutrient export in contrast to the increasing delivery to surface waters in the yrb during the period 1970 2010 the n and p export fluxes do not show such a gradual increase as they are strongly controlled by water discharge these changes in export by the yr to the bs are the net result of changes in the soil nutrient budgets in agriculture section 4 2 1 retention through temporary storage of nutrients in soils groundwater and sediments section 4 2 2 and water consumption section 4 2 3 4 2 1 soil nutrient budgets in most years the soil tn and tp budget surpluses were much larger than the output fluxes from surface runoff and groundwater fig 4 budget p deficits prior to 1975 may be due to neglecting human manure which was playing an important role in that period fao 1977 the difference between soil budgets and delivery to surface water is due to soil and groundwater denitrification and accumulation of n and p in soils and groundwater as was also reported in other river basins like the mississippi river van meter et al 2016 high inorganic nitrogen mainly no3 n accumulation in soil profiles was observed in many regions

residence time of water in the bs liu et al 2017 din concentrations and din po4 p ratios have been increasing in the bs ning et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 along with high don and dop fluxes the frequency and area covered by red tides the major hab in bs has rapidly increased since 1995 fig s5 approximately 70 of the annual occurrences of red tides occurred in the months june july and august song et al 2016 wsrs promoted the diffusion of nutrients to the central bs wang et al 2017b which may be related to the gradual extension of habs from the coastal waters to the central part of the bs after 2000 song et al 2016 the dominant hab species in observed red tides was noctiluca scintillans before the year 2000 while since then the species became more diverse major species are noctiluca scintillans skeletonema costatum karenia mikimotoi mesodinium rubrum and phaeocystis globosa song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 although our data show no clear correlations between din don po4 p and dop fluxes and din po4 p ratio with the frequency and area of red tides in the bs during different periods figs s5 s7 the high don and dop fluxes may impact the proliferation of certain hab species various studies showed that the red tide species skeletonema costatum can utilize various forms of don and dop to maintain high abundance in din and po4 p deficient systems zhang et al 2020b flagellates alexandrium tamarense chattonela marina and h akashiwo in the bs grew well in the presence of dop wang et al 2011 don is known to drive the shift from diatom to dinoflagellate in the bohai sea chen et al 2022 the major brown tide species aureococcus anophagefferens began to appear after the year 2009 wang et al 2021b ou et al 2018 demonstrated that aureococcus anophagefferens grows faster in the presence of urea and glutamic acid than with inorganic substrates brown tides are normally limited to a small area in the northwestern part of the bs with a strong impact on mariculture production primarily shellfish 5 conclusions our results show that the human interference in the yr hydrology is so strong that the nutrient sources on the one hand and the export and impacts in bs became disconnected the human interferences agricultural intensification wastewater discharge dam construction water extraction and the wsrs cause changing seasonality of water and nutrient fluxes changing stoichiometry and high levels of organic nutrient forms which are known to strongly impact hab proliferation however the bs biogeochemical system is complex amongst others due to the long residence time of water in the bs and possibly climate change that there is no direct relationship between nutrient sources and fluxes into bs and their impact on hab proliferation the impacts of nutrient loading may be delayed or habs may appear after successions of algal blooms apart from changing seasonal patterns the nutrient composition changed the high n p ratios are due to the high din concentrations and extremely low po4 p concentrations which are easily absorbed to the high suspended sediment the high organic n and p export fluxes to bs are the result of agricultural organic nutrient sources preferential retention of inorganic forms suspended sediments in the water column and reservoir retention processes lacking clear direct relationships between nutrient fluxes nutrient ratios and forms in the yr export to bs on the one hand and the frequency and area of red tides in the bs on the other hand show that there is a need for employing mechanistic models for analyzing the combined long term impact of multiple and simultaneous changes on biogeochemistry in the bs credit authorship contribution statement fuxia yang investigation

2267,taiwan has frequently suffered from extreme rainfall in the past decades a rainfall induced flood tends to cause the failure of the in river structure ecological catastrophe and even loss of human life and property this study proposes a risk assessment framework balancing in river structures design strength and ecological impact the daan river of taiwan is examined as a case study to test the proposed framework first the study applied persistent scatterer differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar ps insar techniques to analyze the interferometric images captured from the sentinel 1 satellite to identify large scale terrain deformation zones of the watershed a numerical simulation was then applied to assess the impact of different protective in river structures finally calculations examined the froude numbers to assess the ecological effects of landscape and fish habitat indicators in addition the study applied a wireless monitoring method i e float out device to assess riverbed scouring near piers in high risk regions the results indicated that the majority habitat type of the stream during base flow is a glide with an area of about 32 with run accounting for about 10 riffles with high flow velocity and low water depth occupy only about 1 the primary habitat type during the period of flooding is run with pools near the shore providing an essential refuge habitat for fish during floods during the constant current period exposed sand bars occupy about 55 of the total study area of the river when a flooding event occurs the size of the sand bars can be reduced by 40 flooding hurts the quality of the habitat of the two fish species considered in this study with the adverse ecological effects leading to degraded or scattered habitats the creation of sufficient pool areas on the right bank of the river channel should facilitate the foraging and utilization of fish during regular flow and as a refuge during periods of flooding keywords ps insar hydraulic structure safety monitoring mobile bed simulation ecosystem urban vulnerability analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction during the past 30 years taiwan has frequently suffered from extreme rainfall heavy rainfalls caused by torrential events lead to hillside collapses with excess scouring in riverbeds moea 2019 rainfall induced floods also change sediment transport patterns and increase damage to the watershed these disasters result in in river structure failures ecological catastrophes and even human life and property loss therefore to identify a high risk region in a watershed it is generally necessary to carry out large scale inspections of high risk areas to effectively identify the impact of compound disasters in the river basin for example piras et al 2017 used unmanned aerial vehicles uavs to estimate regional digital elevation model dem changes based upon the variations in slope differences in aspect and the elevation of bank or rock formations in the catchment area görüm 2019 used lidar to identify stratum slippage in the past decades the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar psinsar derived from the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar dinsar has often been used to observe changes in the structures in the earth s crust ferretti et al 2000 hooper et al 2004 2012 the basic concept is to use radar echoes received from the same place to solve the phase difference caused by changes in the ground the average velocity change with time is calculated from more than two interferences for example burrows et al 2019 used the synthetic aperture radar sar to calculate the distribution of collapse activities triggered by significant earthquakes past studies also revealed that integrating satellite data to identify high risk areas in river basins is reliable and pragmatic youssef et al 2011 elkhrachy 2015 trinh and molkenthin 2021 applying remote sensing techniques to capture the large scale terrain change for evaluating the risk over a watershed is commonly used however the approaches are unfeasible to assess underwater transmission due to techniques limitation therefore the morphological changes in a watershed are only detected under certain circumstances on the other hand the total stations tps is a common device to be used for detecting the riverbed elevation at different cross sections in a watershed moea 2018 moea 2019 the measured data can not only help to capture riverbed elevation data at the certain cross sections but also can be fused with dem data as the input for the simulations assessing the safety of in river structures in high risk areas is essential in hydraulic engineering often numerical simulations are used to assess the hydraulic characteristics of the river with the construction of protective structures to relieve erosion near piers and monitoring the erosion of such structures over the past 50 years many river models have been developed for evaluating riverbed scouring they can be classified into several types parametric models wahl 1998 morris 2009 physical models e g hec ras brunner 2002 srh2d lai 2010 and cche2d jia and wang 2001 in recent years large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv measurement technology has also been extensively applied muste et al 2008 fujita and kunita 2011 lewis and rhoads 2018 ko et al 2019 the lspiv technique has the advantages of being a non contact non intrusive large scale method with low installation cost high accuracy and high portability for continuous measurement in real time thielicke and stamhuis 2014 patalano et al 2017 therefore it is wildly used for surface velocity measurement in addition the vulnerability of hydraulic structures can also be assessed by setting up monitoring instruments on bridge piers or embankments this information can help us better understand the scouring mechanisms for relevant applications methods for monitoring riverbed scouring are typically classified as intrusive or non intrusive types and each has its applications depending on the field circumstances su and lu 2016 wang et al 2020 wang and lin 2021 for example sensors installed in the river are often damaged by the movement of boulders in gravel riverbeds so non intrusive wireless tracing becomes a more reliable way to detect scour prendergast and gavin 2014 a float out device is considered the most reliable and has successful cases worldwide however the disadvantage is that measurement only be made once and the power supply does not last long wang et al 2019 protective structures are commonly used in high risk areas to slow down the river flow or divert the flow to reduce the scouring of the riverbed vahdati et al 2020 yang et al 2021 porous cylinders are often used in river protection work because their permeable structure can reduce fluid separation as shape induced resistance and stabilize the flow field lienhard 1966 bhattacharyya et al 2006 however changing the flow field may impact the surrounding ecological environment and biological habitat therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider the balance of the engineering design and its impact on the landscape ecology turner and gardner 2015 yu et al 2019 fluvial geomorphology and flow regime variation for shaping the physical habitats of instreams are of recognized significance newson and newson 2000 the aquatic habitat is affected by hydrological characteristics river hydraulics and the topography of the watershed woodward et al 2010 kiesel et al 2019 yao et al 2017 calculated ecological environmental indicators and proposed relevant countermeasures using the telemac software morid et al 2020 combined the swat and iric models to simulate hydrological parameters and water temperature to understand the impact of climate change on the fitness of fish habitats in addition the fish habitat mapping using remote sensing technique on biotopes e g legleiter et al 2002 milan et al 2010 which refers to instream hydraulically defined habitats wadeson et al 1998 has critically helped aquatic conservation to sustain ecological conservation and evaluate the regional ecosystem impacts from the possible engineering tasks under critical weather two endemic fish species i e acrossocheilus paradoxus and hemimyzon formosanus to taiwan existing in the daan river are selected as the indicator species in this study generally the a paradoxus dominates in the lower water column fang et al 1993 and h formosanus is the more rheophilous fish species that prefer shallow water lee and suen 2012 detailed habitat evaluation procedures are introduced in the indication of ecological index section this study proposes a framework to balance the engineering design and ecological impact after compound disasters the flow chart of this study is illustrated in fig 1 the daan watershed of taiwan is selected as the study site first the active deformation areas ada were identified using satellite data the ps insar technique and gps validation to determine the high risk region then the study set in situ monitoring of float out devices to measure the riverbed erosion for determining the suitable parameters in the cche2d numerical model in addition the study tested the ability of the porous cylinder in a laboratory flume experiment for preparing in situ river structure protections third we integrated engineering and ecology analysis simulations with and without protective works around cross river structures to assess the impact of compound flooding disasters on the daan watershed finally this study examined the simulation results to obtain the ecological index related to the habitat environment more details are presented in the following sections 2 methodology 2 1 land deformation analysis from aerial images some applications on detecting ground changes by using aerial and terrestrial lidar and uav have been proposed cook et al 2014 cook 2017 although lidar and uav feature with high resolution technique both of them need to combine an airborne vehicle for a rapid inspection in a large region remote sensing is one of the methods broadly applied to observe changes in the landscape past studies have mainly used the reflection of electromagnetic wave energy in the visible spectrum for data analysis adam et al 2010 this study used at least two synthetic aperture radar sar images and the two pass differential interferometric sar d insar technique to investigate the displacement between specific dates hu et al 2012 schlögel et al 2015 for long term monitoring the persistent scatterer ps insar technique was employed with a time series of sar images to estimate the occurrence of displacements over time the ps indicates a pixel footprint with high coherence in sar images after the ps is detected in time series sar images its phase value is calculated including orbit atmosphere terrain errors and actual surface deformation values described in eq 1 1 φ x i φ def x i φ α x i φ orb x i φ ε x i n x i where φ x i is the phase of the x th pixel in the i th group of images φ def x i φ α x i φ orb x i and φ ε x i are the phases affected by ground changes with the line of sight los direction atmospheric effects satellite orbit errors and terrain errors respectively n x i is the noise from thermal noise and co registration errors the actual surface deformation can be obtained once the phase influence value caused by various factors is eliminated several studies where psinsar has been applied to estimate surface displacement were reported tamburini et al 2010 janna et al 2012 based on the successful applications listed above this study selected the sarproz sar processing tool to implement ps insar to handle the ground variations in the daan river basin sentinel 1 sar images collected by the copernicus programme conducted by the european space agency have been accessible since 2014 with a constellation of two satellites to date their 6 day re visiting time makes the sentinel 1 imagery an ideal source for long term monitoring therefore the study selected images with the same time interval and composed four image combinations ascending vertical vertical vv polarization from 01 09 2016 10 202019 ascending vertical horizontal vh polarization from 01 09 2016 10 202019 descending vv from 01 11 06 10 22 2019 and descending vh from 01 11 06 10 22 2019 the flow chart of the ps applications is shown in fig 2 the same threshold value is used to extract permanent scattering points during the processing to better discuss morphological changes in the river bed this study selected four sets of images with spatially overlapping river channels to compare with the ps results 2 2 laboratory flume experiments of porous cylinder it is known that floods usually threaten the safety of in river structures protective works such as porous cylinders are possible solutions for this issue therefore this study conducted a series of flume experiments to evaluate the benefits of constructing porous cylinders the experimental results with and without the protective work in the catastrophic region are compared to the results of numerical simulations the performance of the constructed porous cylinder was evaluated by observing differences between the free water surface and the flow velocity as the water flowed through the porous cylinder in the down scaled laboratory flume experiments as shown in fig 3 the test flume has a 4 0 m a width of 0 15 m and a height of 0 4 m there is a tailgate at the end of the flume channel for adjusting the tailwater depth the slope of the flume during testing was 0 004 and the depth of the water controlled by the downstream tailgate was 0 02 m experiments set the porous test cylinder 2 5 m into the channel experiments were conducted with two different flow rates e g 0 0017 m3 s and 0 0031 m3 s a needle ruler and electromagnetic flow meter measured the channel center s water depth and flowing velocity the minimum measurement accuracy of the needle ruler was 0 02 mm the alec acm 250 two dimensional electromagnetic flowmeter is applied to measure the flow speed in the 250 cm s range with an accuracy of 2 the porous cylinder structure had a diameter of 0 08 m a height of 0 09 m and a surface porosity of approximately 0 55 table 1 lists the initial hydraulic conditions for the laboratory flume experiments 2 3 hydraulic assessment in the daan watershed this study applied a multiple downscaling simulation procedure to alleviate the computational burden while preserving the accuracy of a mobile bed simulation firstly a runoff model hec hms usace hec 2008 usace hec 2010 was used to estimate surface runoff over the entire watershed next the wash123d yeh et al 2006 is employed to conduct river routing in which the hec hms estimated runoffs comprise the inflow on river simulations then cche2d jia and wang 2001 is applied to simulate our topic reaches with the channel modeling results adopted as the boundary conditions for the upstream discharge and downstream depth of cche2d the cche2d model was developed by the national center for computational hydroscience and engineering ncche which model can use for 2 d and 3 d calculation of sediment transport this model is favored because many local studies have been implemented lai et al 2011 liao et al 2014 lee et al 2019 which enhanced our understanding of the local parameters setting cche2d is a depth averaged model that assumes the near bottom sediment concentration is directly proportional to the depth averaged sediment concentration the model simulates free surface turbulent flows with finite elements and the process of nonuniform sediment transport can differentiate varied particle sizes to calculate this study calculated the bedload sediment transport based on empirical nonuniform formula wu et al 2000 more modeling setups are listed in table 2 this study conducted in situ monitoring to provide local scours information for model calibrations the automatic float out devices cam used to measure the maximum scouring depth during flooding the float out device is usually used to continuously monitor the scouring in high risk regions in addition it can avoid the impact of boulders during floods that may cause sensor failure yang and su 2015 as shown in fig 4 a the basic principle of the wireless tracker is to put the float out device sensors into pre drilled boreholes which are initially drilled by a jumbo machine soil bricks and float out devices in which the instruments were embedded inside a canister were alternately buried under the riverbed before the event scouring the riverbed by flooding washes out the sensors which periodically emit signals to the receiver installed on the river bank when the sand bearing cans fall off due to scouring the float out device is affected by buoyancy which causes it to float to the water surface in addition as shown in fig 4 b the movement of particles affects the transmission of the signal to the terminal as the float out device sends signals to the receiver station a battery powers the device if the equipment is not washed out and still has electricity it can be reused during the next event this study built a station to receive signals from the dike which observed the real time monitoring of scour depths over the internet each module was 20 cm in height as shown in fig 4 c fig 4 a and 4 b show the system s configuration for monitoring the float out devices the devices were buried every 0 20 m below a sand can 2 4 indication of ecological index the river channel was divided into land and water sections to assess the habitat water sections were further subdivided into different morphological units mu there were four types of habitats including runs pools riffles and glides as wyrick and pasternack 2012 described runs included water with depths greater than 0 7 m and velocities higher than 0 6 m s pools had water depths greater than 1 4 m and velocities of less than 0 6 m s riffles included water with depths of less than 0 7 m and velocities higher than 0 6 m s glides had water depths of less than 1 4 m and velocities of less than 0 6 m s the exception to this habitat type was barred which had no water the habitat suitability index hsi was calculated based on habitat characteristics and the impact of the habitat on indicator species us fish and wildlife service 1981 the suitability index score used for quantifying the habitat quality for aquatic animals ranges from 0 for the least suitable habitat to 1 for the optimum habitat entwistle et al 2019 the hydraulic characteristics were simulated to obtain the critical characteristics used to estimate habitat suitability flow velocity and water depth the habitat suitability curves developed by the water resources agency water resources planning institute et al 2010 were referenced to determine the scores of the suitability indices the fish habitat quality hq was calculated by taking the geometric mean of the equally weighted suitability indices related to flow velocity and water depth as shown in eq 2 as suggested by elkins et al 2007 five classes of habitat quality were set including 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 4 0 7 0 7 1 0 corresponding to non habitat poor low quality medium and high quality habitat respectively kuo et al 2021 the higher the hq score the greater the river management efforts must be invested 2 hq s i v s i d where si v and si d are the suitability indices of flow velocity and water depth of the indicator fish species two endemic fish species to taiwan were chosen as the indicator species i e acrossocheilus paradoxus and hemimyzon formosanus representative of different habitat preferences such as migration limited and habitat limited 3 study configurations 3 1 study site as shown in fig 5 the daan river is located in taiwan s central and western parts the length of the river is 95 76 km and it drains an area of 758 47 square kilometers the primary land uses in the daan river watershed are agricultural forest and water agricultural land accounts for about 53 09 more than 40 000 ha then is 38 05 covered by forest more than 20 000 ha and water is about 5 57 with more than 4000 ha hillside or sloped land accounts for about 80 of the watershed area with most areas of collapse located in the upper middle and upper reaches of the watershed an area of about 624 ha the average slope of the main riverbed from the source area to the mihuo section is 1 50 while that from below mihuo to the outgoing valley section is 1 76 according to the four years of riverbed survey data 1973 2008 2016 2017 as shown in fig 6 the streambed of the main daan river is primarily comprised of pebbles gravel or rocks with relatively low sand content moreover the small particle size of the riverbed tends to decrease with the downstream distance the annual average rainfall in the daan watershed is about 2612 mm yr based on 8 gauge stations i e zhuolan 2 shuangqi 2 liyutan shinkaie elementary school jingshan xueling songan and xiangbi 1 records from 1903 to 2021 the amount is affected by the strength of the rainy season and the typhoons which occur from april to september these months account for about 75 of the annual rainfall october to march is the dry season accounting for 25 there are eight water gauges in the daan watershed as shown in fig 5 with three stations also being observation points for monitoring the flow rate and suspended sediment concentration the data cover 39 years of yili station 24 years for zhuolan station and 24 years for xiangbi station while analyzing return periods this study selected the chi square test to examine the flow data and used the goodness of fit test for the fitness test then the error analysis is applied to determine the best statistical distribution as a result the study calculated the outlet discharges under various return periods based on their control areas moea 2016 the daan river has experienced landslides in the upper reaches structures in or around the river channel being destroyed by nonequilibrium sediment transport in the middle and lower reaches and lack of available water sources during typhoon soulik 2013 landing in taiwan the babuifan shuiwei liyutan and buzies embankments were destroyed by 935 m 900 m 250 m and 400 m respectively in mid june 2017 typhoon merbok induced floods resulting in the partially damaged shuiwei embankment moea 2019 the section of the daan river from no 51 to no 58 forms the junction between canyon and plains in the daan watershed with a rapid reduction in the river cross section as no 56 therefore the baibufan region was chosen as the study site see fig 5 3 2 model configuration this study used a multi downscale simulation to assess the river hydraulics as impacted by typhoon events first the hec hms surface runoff model was used for the boundary conditions to calculate the confluence of rainfall or typhoon events then the wash123d model was utilized to simulate the water levels flow velocity and flow rate to provide the boundary conditions for the two dimensional simulation of the local river section in the cche2d sediment transport model discharge data from the upper shilin weir cross section no 8 to the downstream daan river bridge cross section no 69 40 1 km in total was simulated by the wash123d model and were adopted for the simulation boundary typhoon nesat from 07 29 2017 to 07 30 2017 and a heavy rainfall event from 05 30 2021 to 06 02 2021 were examined for model calibration in addition cross section survey data measured in 2016 were adopted for the riverbed terrain the n values at the position of the main river channel and the channel part other than the main river channel are set by 0 025 and 0 035 respectively moea 2018 the riverbed terrain cche2d was mapped using dem data produced by pix4dmapper from uav and real time kinematic rtk data point elevation correction was performed by comparison with rtk data the dem data used in this study has a spatial resolution of 20 m as shown in fig 5 the areas from cross section no 51 to cross section no 58 4 81 km in total was selected for the cche2d simulation a quadrilateral grid of approximately 5 5 m was built to avoid grid divergence and consider the length of simulation time it consisted of 179 horizontal and 1 046 vertical points approximately 187 234 points the average width of the points was approximately 5 m with a finer grid added around bridge piers to enhance local simulation accuracy the average value of the riverbed particle size at the p4 site was selected as the representative particle size for the particle size distribution curve at the baibufan bridge pier in the numerical model this study used the pebble count method wolman 1954 to identify the riverbed particle size for the numerical simulations the particle distribution curve can then be used to determine the proportions of the representative sample based on the modeling results we set the adaptation length to be 5 m other live bed parameters such as interaction thickness and scour formula are listed in table 2 the remote sensing assessment is used to identify the possible high risk region quickly then the in river hydraulic structures are examined to be protected by the scour countermeasure to enhance safety however impacts from engineering possibly lead to habitat destruction therefore this study used numerical simulation to evaluate the flow conditions at the baibufan bridge under different return periods with and without the scour protection structures as a result habitat suitability is adequately evaluated based on the simulation results as shown in fig 7 the scour protection structures i e porous cylinders were set before the baibufan bridge at the p4 site along with the flow a single row porous cylinder column was set up in front of the pier at 1 5 times the diameter of the pier distance and the spacing between each column was 1 0 m the column diameter was 1 4 m six piers were set in the numerical simulations the purpose of using a porous cylinder is to reduce the flow velocity in front of the bridge pier therefore to simulate the effect of the porous cylinder in the river this study set its roughness values to be larger than the riverbed the simulations were carried out with different return periods of the peak flow in the daan river moea 2016 to evaluate the effectiveness of the scour improvement near the p4 site pier of the baibufan bridge before and after installing protective structures in this study the flow before the confluence of the wushikeng river was used as the inflow boundary therefore the discharge of 5 year 10 year and 50 year return periods are 4 580 6 230 and 10 700 cm respectively the habitat suitability then is adequately assessed based on the simulation results 4 results and discussion 4 1 identification of active deformation areas ada in the daan river table 3 lists the ps results from the satellite data the number of scattering points density average coherence standard coherence deviation and standard rate deviation the results show that whatever the polarization mode of the ascending orbit with vv or vh the number of scattering points is far greater than deduced for the descending orbit in addition regardless of the orbital operation direction the number of scattering points obtained from the vv polarization mode is more significant than with vh as a result the average coherence analysis results of four images fell from 0 6 to 0 7 on the other hand the best analysis results are obtained using a descending orbit with vh with an average coherence of 0 662 however its standard deviation is the worst at 0 155 in short performing ada analysis using ascending orbit and vv polarized images is better this study adopted observation data collected by continuous gps satellite tracking from a station in the study area to check the accuracy and verify the results of surface deformation calculated from the ps points since the ps results indicate line of sight los deformation the study converted the satellite observation data s n e and u components into dependent los deformation data in addition a comparison was made between the ps scattering points near the gps station and in the study area and the average deformation of the two time series results e g ps and gps in the los direction the gps observational data were compared with the ps results in the same time segment and spatial range and the continuity of the gps time series data observations were collected from four gps stations labeled san2 dahu dosh and suc2 see fig 8 which are evenly distributed in the area of the ps points for verification of the accuracy of the results the distribution of the gps monitoring stations is shown in fig 8 also the annual average ground deformation velocity from 2016 01 to 2019 10 was analyzed using the gps stations ps points the calculated results indicate that the ground surface in this area shows a slight upward trend moreover except for the slightly more significant difference at the san2 location the difference between the ps and gps results is less than 0 3 mm in dahu dosh and suc2 stations which means that the trend of changes in deformation over four years is relatively consistent with that shown by the continuous gps station readings it also shows the reliability of the ps results the first step in the framework for the sustainable risk assessment of in river hydraulic structures is identifying the study zone the ada analysis aims to identify areas of active deformation from time series morphological changes the dramatic morphological change reflects the nonequilibrium sediment transportation in the channel and leads to the failure of in river structures the morphological change in the ps results used yearly analyses with the beginning date of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 used as the benchmarks to find the most active deformation areas during one year according to the ps results as shown in fig 8 the annual average ground deformation from 2016 to 2019 is stable in the watershed however ascending and descending deformation can be observed in the river channel near the baibufan region the ada analysis results are shown in fig 8 and indicate that the baibufan region does a hot zone and high risk area in the watershed therefore the scour around the pier of the baibufan bridge and habitat impacts caused by relevant engineering works are discussed in the following 4 2 evaluation of porous cylinder effectiveness in laboratory flume experiments during the experiments the porous cylinder hindered water flow so that water flowing through the porous cylinder generated a standing wave upstream and caused stagnation downstream inside the cylinder the water surface dropped and there were axial ripples so the water flow gathered at the center of a circle after leaving the cylinder the water surface dropped again the experimental results obtained with different water depths under different flow discharge rates are shown in fig 9 in test 1 the flow velocity increased because of the increment of flow discharge leading to an apparent backwater phenomenon in front of the porous cylinder as shown in fig 9 a there was a more significant drop in water level inside the cylinder in test 1 than in test 2 the height of the first backwater produced in test 1 before the cylinder s flow was 3 cm was lower than the second one however in test 1 the water depth decreases after flowing through the cylinder in test 2 the second height of the backwater was similar to the first one as shown in fig 9 a moreover the reduction in water depth after the water flowed through the cylinder tended to be smaller in test 2 than in test 1 the result allows us to deduce that the flow discharge seems reduced in test 2 and the reactions and reduction performance tended to be weak fig 9 b shows the observed flow velocity distribution before and after the water flowed through the porous cylinder here vx is the flow velocity with the porous cylinder vinlet is the flow velocity without a porous cylinder x is the distance along the flow direction and d is the diameter of the porous cylinder results show that the flow velocity begins to slow down about two times the distance from the upstream center of the water permeable cylinder the result is a reduction in the average flow velocity of 0 6 times and the generation of a lower flow velocity area behind the porous cylinder the laboratory flume experiment results show that installing a porous cylinder can effectively slow down the flow velocity reducing the local scouring phenomenon which is often generated by high speed downflow around bridge piers 4 3 evaluation of porous cylinder effectiveness in numerical simulations the study selected typhoon nesat jul 2017 rain event may 2021 typhoon in fa jul 2021 and typhoon lupit aug 2021 as examples to verify the proposed multiple downscaling simulations first the simulation performance is examined by taking the error indexes of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and peak time error pt simulations revealed that the simulated water level trend corresponds well with the observed values over the flood in which the average r2 mainly was higher than 0 8 besides the average rmse and mae were below 0 34 m and the peak time is almost identical in simulated and observed data for example the rain event may 2021 revealed only a 0 15 m difference in water depth between the cche2d simulation result and measurement which measured the flow peak at the mihuo station at 480 92 m furthermore this event s maximum water level simulation error did not exceed 0 65 m that indicated that the boundary conditions and parameters used in the model are feasible then typhoon in fa jul 2021 and typhoon lupit aug 2021 activated the float out devices which means a considerable pier scouring is observed as shown in table 4 from the monitoring results of typhoon in fa jul 2021 a flood washed away three float out devices at 11 26 14 37 and 16 07 on 07 24 2021 in typhoon lupit aug 2021 two float out devices were triggered at 8 52 and 9 58 on 08 07 2021 the result means that the float out device was triggered around the flood peak and down scouring continued during the falling limb based on the above comparison of modeling and in situ monitoring results our simulations successfully captured river flow patterns such as the water depth flow velocity and even erosion this method maintains the accuracy of a more extensive simulation but sharply reduces the computational resource and time the verified model was then used to simulate flow field and sediment transportation under different return periods e g 5 year 10 year and 50 year return periods the model also considered the effectiveness of scour protection work by evaluating changes in the riverbed in the baibufan region and improvement of the local scour phenomenon at the p4 site near the baibufan bridge fig 10 presents the simulation results of a 50 year return period with the protection work the simulations of water stage water depth flow velocity and riverbed changes are shown in fig 10 a 10 b 10 c and 10 d respectively in addition the simulations of the 50 year return period flow rate is 10 700 cms demonstrate the flow path get gathers into a deep trough at the left bank the water flow is divided into two paths after passing the baibufan bridge flow on the left bank is blocked from flowing downstream by the embankments therefore the current tends to rush to the right bank because the baibufan bridge is located at a narrow flow passageway the constriction caused by the terrain produces a high flow velocity and leads to scouring near the bridge piers in short the scouring problem affecting the footing safety of the right bank of baibufan barriers is worth noticing therefore from the above analysis this study paid attention to the baibufan region the simulation results in front of pier p4 are organized in table 5 the flow velocity ranged from 3 27 to 7 29 m s for different combinations of return period and protection work the flow velocity water depth and crucial scour depth in front of pier p4 can be reduced by about 28 3 37 7 20 0 33 3 and 20 0 26 6 respectively with the protection work all indicators in the simulation showed that although the flood velocity and scour depth in front of pier p4 still increased with the increment of the return period the installation of porous cylinders is still helpful to resist the impaction water flow from reducing local scour on the other hand implementing such protective work tends to cause habitat changes and threaten the local ecological system more details are discussed in the following section 4 4 ecological analysis in the baibufan region the analytical results of habitat unit distribution under base flow without flood events are shown in fig 11 the land area in the baibufan bridge region is about 55 which means that most areas in the river channel are floodplain in comparison with the water area only accounts for about 45 the glide in the central part of the water area accounts for about 32 followed by the deep run accounting for about 10 only 1 of the area comprises shallow riffles characterized by a high flow velocity and shallow water depth no deep pools have formed under the current base flow discharge conditions the analysis results indicate that the primary habitat type is a glide under base flow with low flow velocity and water depth as shown in fig 11 the glide is connected and distributed over a large area with only a relatively few scattered glide habitats located near the left bank the deep run is the primary habitat type in the middle of the river channel and is continuously distributed along the main channel the distribution of shallow riffles is relatively scattered and only sporadic formation occurs at the junction of the glide and the deep run the results showing the effect on habitat units of different return periods and protection work are listed in table 6 based on the hsi classifications under the base flow the two species of fish a paradoxus and h formosanus inhabited areas with medium habitat quality above class 4 mainly concentrated near the right bank and extending upstream from the bridge pier as shown in fig 12 these two areas were mainly shallow riffle habitats with low water depth and low flow velocity the deep flow area in the middle of the river channel is mostly unsuitable as a habitat class 1 for these species since the water depth and flow velocity are too large which reduces the hsi the spatiotemporal changes in fish habitat quality are examined on a paradoxus and h formosanus under scenarios with different return periods and with or without protection work during peak periods and after floods tables 7 and 8 in addition the classification of habitat quality for these two species in different situations is mapped in figs 13 and 14 respectively in the topographic change scenarios the results show that after a 5 year return period for flooding the land area has dropped to about 45 with increases in the proportions of deep runs riffle shallows and deep pools the simulation with protection work showed a higher proportion of deep runs and glides than without protection work the deep pool upstream was converted into a deep run and the shallow riffle and deep run areas near the right bank also turned into a glide the glide distribution near the left bank was more concentrated than the case without protection it changed from small and scattered to large and concentrated as shown in fig 13 a and 13 b in the topographic scenarios showing changes after a 10 year return period for flooding the proportion of land area dropped to about 42 in the protection work simulation with increases in the proportions of a deep run shallow riffle and deep pool areas the findings indicate that part of the land area was flooded to form a water habitat however the glide area accounting for about 32 of the total still formed the central part of the water habitat a comparison of fig 13 c and 13 d show that after protection work a band of shallow riffles was formed near the left bank and part of the glide turned into a deep run in the main river channel in the topographic change scenarios after a 50 year return period for flooding with protection work the proportions of a deep run shallow riffle and deep pool have all increased with most showing a continuous distribution the proportion of glide has declined but there is no difference in the proportion of land area however there are some differences in the distribution as shown in fig 13 e and 13 f the area of a shallow riffle on the left side of the main channel have continued to increase with the distribution the results indicate that the glide initially close upstream had become a deep run with a large deep pool area on the left side of the main channel at the flood s peak the flow conditions were mainly high flow velocity and deep water depth therefore the habitat distribution was dominated by a deep run other types of water habitats formed only sporadically and the difference between with and without the protection work was also slight in addition it can be found that even in a flood situation with a return period of 50 years the floodplain near the right bank of the baibufan river channel was still not submerged in the topographic change scenarios after a 5 year return period for flooding the hsi classification of a paradoxus shows them to be distributed and concentrated near the right bank before the addition of protection work mainly high quality habitat class 5 however after adding protection work the hsi classification dropped to class 4 in many places still of better quality more areas of medium quality habitat class 4 were near the left bank most concentrated in small areas as shown in fig 14 the hsi classification for h formosanus was similar to a paradoxus most areas were dominated by low quality class 3 and medium quality habitats class 4 but the habitat areas were fewer for h formosanus than for a paradoxus in the topographic change scenarios after a 10 year return period and protection work there was a change in the hsi classification distribution of a paradoxus from relatively concentrated areas medium quality habitat class 4 to more dispersed areas high quality habitat class 5 although the proportion of areas of high quality habitat had increased the proportion of unsuitable habitats class 1 had also increased and the distribution of high quality areas had become more dispersed the hsi classification distribution of h formosanus was mainly scattered but tended to be more concentrated near the right bank after the protection work there was also a slight increase in the proportion of high quality habitat areas class 5 however the proportion of overall unsuitable habitats class 1 was relatively high in the topographic change scenario after a 50 year return period the hsi classification distribution for a paradoxus had no significant change with the addition of protection work only the habitats near the right bank tended to be cut by problematic areas class 1 while the middle quality habitats near the left bank class 4 tended to be more concentrated the hsi classification distribution of h formosanus was mainly scattered after adding protection works the proportion of high quality habitat areas near the right bank class 5 increased slightly the middle quality habitat areas near the left bank class 4 had become continuous still overall there was not much difference at the peak flood period the flow conditions mainly tended towards high flow velocity and deep water depth therefore the distribution was dominated by unsuitable habitats accounting for more than 95 the proportions of other grades were less than 1 mainly distributed along the floodplain near the right bank the difference before and after installing protective structures was also relatively small peak flooding was very detrimental to a paradoxus and h formosanus 5 conclusion this study implemented a framework to integrate engineering design and ecological analysis to assess the impact of compound disasters in the daan watershed first the satellite data has retrieved the trends of large scale ground deformation and the active deformation areas ada in the study site so the baibufan region was chosen as the research area of interest in addition this study conducted flume experiments using a porous cylinder to reduce local scouring and understand the effectiveness of possible protection work the results indicated that setting protective devices can effectively slow down the flow velocity and improve the hydraulic conditions in addition the simulations from multiple downscale modeling were calibrated with the measured records from our in situ monitoring works along the daan river the well proven models were then used to assess the safety of in river structures simultaneously this study conducted an ecological assessment to explore the effects on species habitats given different engineering methods and further consider the balance between engineering solutions and ecological impact the results indicated that the primary habitat type comprises the glide during the base flow rates comprising an area of about 32 followed by the run accounting for about 10 riffles with high flow velocity and low water depth occupy only about 1 the habitat quality of the acrossocheilus paradoxus is higher than that of hemimyzon formosanus during flood periods the primary habitat type is the run some pools near the shore should be an essential refuge habitat for the fish during flooding moreover exposed sand bars occupy about 55 of the total area of the study area during the base flow however the size of sand bars is reduced by 40 when flooding occurs in summary the flood revealed a negative ecological effect on the quality of the habitat of the two fish species leading to degraded or scattered habitat areas an engineering alternative is to build sufficient pool areas on the right bank of the river for providing foraging and utilization of fish during base flow and be a refuge during flooding given that traditional research only focuses on the engineering or ecological system this study proposes a framework to cover the scopes of large scale river region inspection engineering methods and ecological assessment for management agencies active deformation areas analysis is helpful in quickly identifying possible high risk regions for engineers the effectiveness of porous cylinders is an assertive tool to overcome scour problems finally the ecological assessment enables us to find a balance between humans and other

2267,taiwan has frequently suffered from extreme rainfall in the past decades a rainfall induced flood tends to cause the failure of the in river structure ecological catastrophe and even loss of human life and property this study proposes a risk assessment framework balancing in river structures design strength and ecological impact the daan river of taiwan is examined as a case study to test the proposed framework first the study applied persistent scatterer differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar ps insar techniques to analyze the interferometric images captured from the sentinel 1 satellite to identify large scale terrain deformation zones of the watershed a numerical simulation was then applied to assess the impact of different protective in river structures finally calculations examined the froude numbers to assess the ecological effects of landscape and fish habitat indicators in addition the study applied a wireless monitoring method i e float out device to assess riverbed scouring near piers in high risk regions the results indicated that the majority habitat type of the stream during base flow is a glide with an area of about 32 with run accounting for about 10 riffles with high flow velocity and low water depth occupy only about 1 the primary habitat type during the period of flooding is run with pools near the shore providing an essential refuge habitat for fish during floods during the constant current period exposed sand bars occupy about 55 of the total study area of the river when a flooding event occurs the size of the sand bars can be reduced by 40 flooding hurts the quality of the habitat of the two fish species considered in this study with the adverse ecological effects leading to degraded or scattered habitats the creation of sufficient pool areas on the right bank of the river channel should facilitate the foraging and utilization of fish during regular flow and as a refuge during periods of flooding keywords ps insar hydraulic structure safety monitoring mobile bed simulation ecosystem urban vulnerability analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction during the past 30 years taiwan has frequently suffered from extreme rainfall heavy rainfalls caused by torrential events lead to hillside collapses with excess scouring in riverbeds moea 2019 rainfall induced floods also change sediment transport patterns and increase damage to the watershed these disasters result in in river structure failures ecological catastrophes and even human life and property loss therefore to identify a high risk region in a watershed it is generally necessary to carry out large scale inspections of high risk areas to effectively identify the impact of compound disasters in the river basin for example piras et al 2017 used unmanned aerial vehicles uavs to estimate regional digital elevation model dem changes based upon the variations in slope differences in aspect and the elevation of bank or rock formations in the catchment area görüm 2019 used lidar to identify stratum slippage in the past decades the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar psinsar derived from the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar dinsar has often been used to observe changes in the structures in the earth s crust ferretti et al 2000 hooper et al 2004 2012 the basic concept is to use radar echoes received from the same place to solve the phase difference caused by changes in the ground the average velocity change with time is calculated from more than two interferences for example burrows et al 2019 used the synthetic aperture radar sar to calculate the distribution of collapse activities triggered by significant earthquakes past studies also revealed that integrating satellite data to identify high risk areas in river basins is reliable and pragmatic youssef et al 2011 elkhrachy 2015 trinh and molkenthin 2021 applying remote sensing techniques to capture the large scale terrain change for evaluating the risk over a watershed is commonly used however the approaches are unfeasible to assess underwater transmission due to techniques limitation therefore the morphological changes in a watershed are only detected under certain circumstances on the other hand the total stations tps is a common device to be used for detecting the riverbed elevation at different cross sections in a watershed moea 2018 moea 2019 the measured data can not only help to capture riverbed elevation data at the certain cross sections but also can be fused with dem data as the input for the simulations assessing the safety of in river structures in high risk areas is essential in hydraulic engineering often numerical simulations are used to assess the hydraulic characteristics of the river with the construction of protective structures to relieve erosion near piers and monitoring the erosion of such structures over the past 50 years many river models have been developed for evaluating riverbed scouring they can be classified into several types parametric models wahl 1998 morris 2009 physical models e g hec ras brunner 2002 srh2d lai 2010 and cche2d jia and wang 2001 in recent years large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv measurement technology has also been extensively applied muste et al 2008 fujita and kunita 2011 lewis and rhoads 2018 ko et al 2019 the lspiv technique has the advantages of being a non contact non intrusive large scale method with low installation cost high accuracy and high portability for continuous measurement in real time thielicke and stamhuis 2014 patalano et al 2017 therefore it is wildly used for surface velocity measurement in addition the vulnerability of hydraulic structures can also be assessed by setting up monitoring instruments on bridge piers or embankments this information can help us better understand the scouring mechanisms for relevant applications methods for monitoring riverbed scouring are typically classified as intrusive or non intrusive types and each has its applications depending on the field circumstances su and lu 2016 wang et al 2020 wang and lin 2021 for example sensors installed in the river are often damaged by the movement of boulders in gravel riverbeds so non intrusive wireless tracing becomes a more reliable way to detect scour prendergast and gavin 2014 a float out device is considered the most reliable and has successful cases worldwide however the disadvantage is that measurement only be made once and the power supply does not last long wang et al 2019 protective structures are commonly used in high risk areas to slow down the river flow or divert the flow to reduce the scouring of the riverbed vahdati et al 2020 yang et al 2021 porous cylinders are often used in river protection work because their permeable structure can reduce fluid separation as shape induced resistance and stabilize the flow field lienhard 1966 bhattacharyya et al 2006 however changing the flow field may impact the surrounding ecological environment and biological habitat therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider the balance of the engineering design and its impact on the landscape ecology turner and gardner 2015 yu et al 2019 fluvial geomorphology and flow regime variation for shaping the physical habitats of instreams are of recognized significance newson and newson 2000 the aquatic habitat is affected by hydrological characteristics river hydraulics and the topography of the watershed woodward et al 2010 kiesel et al 2019 yao et al 2017 calculated ecological environmental indicators and proposed relevant countermeasures using the telemac software morid et al 2020 combined the swat and iric models to simulate hydrological parameters and water temperature to understand the impact of climate change on the fitness of fish habitats in addition the fish habitat mapping using remote sensing technique on biotopes e g legleiter et al 2002 milan et al 2010 which refers to instream hydraulically defined habitats wadeson et al 1998 has critically helped aquatic conservation to sustain ecological conservation and evaluate the regional ecosystem impacts from the possible engineering tasks under critical weather two endemic fish species i e acrossocheilus paradoxus and hemimyzon formosanus to taiwan existing in the daan river are selected as the indicator species in this study generally the a paradoxus dominates in the lower water column fang et al 1993 and h formosanus is the more rheophilous fish species that prefer shallow water lee and suen 2012 detailed habitat evaluation procedures are introduced in the indication of ecological index section this study proposes a framework to balance the engineering design and ecological impact after compound disasters the flow chart of this study is illustrated in fig 1 the daan watershed of taiwan is selected as the study site first the active deformation areas ada were identified using satellite data the ps insar technique and gps validation to determine the high risk region then the study set in situ monitoring of float out devices to measure the riverbed erosion for determining the suitable parameters in the cche2d numerical model in addition the study tested the ability of the porous cylinder in a laboratory flume experiment for preparing in situ river structure protections third we integrated engineering and ecology analysis simulations with and without protective works around cross river structures to assess the impact of compound flooding disasters on the daan watershed finally this study examined the simulation results to obtain the ecological index related to the habitat environment more details are presented in the following sections 2 methodology 2 1 land deformation analysis from aerial images some applications on detecting ground changes by using aerial and terrestrial lidar and uav have been proposed cook et al 2014 cook 2017 although lidar and uav feature with high resolution technique both of them need to combine an airborne vehicle for a rapid inspection in a large region remote sensing is one of the methods broadly applied to observe changes in the landscape past studies have mainly used the reflection of electromagnetic wave energy in the visible spectrum for data analysis adam et al 2010 this study used at least two synthetic aperture radar sar images and the two pass differential interferometric sar d insar technique to investigate the displacement between specific dates hu et al 2012 schlögel et al 2015 for long term monitoring the persistent scatterer ps insar technique was employed with a time series of sar images to estimate the occurrence of displacements over time the ps indicates a pixel footprint with high coherence in sar images after the ps is detected in time series sar images its phase value is calculated including orbit atmosphere terrain errors and actual surface deformation values described in eq 1 1 φ x i φ def x i φ α x i φ orb x i φ ε x i n x i where φ x i is the phase of the x th pixel in the i th group of images φ def x i φ α x i φ orb x i and φ ε x i are the phases affected by ground changes with the line of sight los direction atmospheric effects satellite orbit errors and terrain errors respectively n x i is the noise from thermal noise and co registration errors the actual surface deformation can be obtained once the phase influence value caused by various factors is eliminated several studies where psinsar has been applied to estimate surface displacement were reported tamburini et al 2010 janna et al 2012 based on the successful applications listed above this study selected the sarproz sar processing tool to implement ps insar to handle the ground variations in the daan river basin sentinel 1 sar images collected by the copernicus programme conducted by the european space agency have been accessible since 2014 with a constellation of two satellites to date their 6 day re visiting time makes the sentinel 1 imagery an ideal source for long term monitoring therefore the study selected images with the same time interval and composed four image combinations ascending vertical vertical vv polarization from 01 09 2016 10 202019 ascending vertical horizontal vh polarization from 01 09 2016 10 202019 descending vv from 01 11 06 10 22 2019 and descending vh from 01 11 06 10 22 2019 the flow chart of the ps applications is shown in fig 2 the same threshold value is used to extract permanent scattering points during the processing to better discuss morphological changes in the river bed this study selected four sets of images with spatially overlapping river channels to compare with the ps results 2 2 laboratory flume experiments of porous cylinder it is known that floods usually threaten the safety of in river structures protective works such as porous cylinders are possible solutions for this issue therefore this study conducted a series of flume experiments to evaluate the benefits of constructing porous cylinders the experimental results with and without the protective work in the catastrophic region are compared to the results of numerical simulations the performance of the constructed porous cylinder was evaluated by observing differences between the free water surface and the flow velocity as the water flowed through the porous cylinder in the down scaled laboratory flume experiments as shown in fig 3 the test flume has a 4 0 m a width of 0 15 m and a height of 0 4 m there is a tailgate at the end of the flume channel for adjusting the tailwater depth the slope of the flume during testing was 0 004 and the depth of the water controlled by the downstream tailgate was 0 02 m experiments set the porous test cylinder 2 5 m into the channel experiments were conducted with two different flow rates e g 0 0017 m3 s and 0 0031 m3 s a needle ruler and electromagnetic flow meter measured the channel center s water depth and flowing velocity the minimum measurement accuracy of the needle ruler was 0 02 mm the alec acm 250 two dimensional electromagnetic flowmeter is applied to measure the flow speed in the 250 cm s range with an accuracy of 2 the porous cylinder structure had a diameter of 0 08 m a height of 0 09 m and a surface porosity of approximately 0 55 table 1 lists the initial hydraulic conditions for the laboratory flume experiments 2 3 hydraulic assessment in the daan watershed this study applied a multiple downscaling simulation procedure to alleviate the computational burden while preserving the accuracy of a mobile bed simulation firstly a runoff model hec hms usace hec 2008 usace hec 2010 was used to estimate surface runoff over the entire watershed next the wash123d yeh et al 2006 is employed to conduct river routing in which the hec hms estimated runoffs comprise the inflow on river simulations then cche2d jia and wang 2001 is applied to simulate our topic reaches with the channel modeling results adopted as the boundary conditions for the upstream discharge and downstream depth of cche2d the cche2d model was developed by the national center for computational hydroscience and engineering ncche which model can use for 2 d and 3 d calculation of sediment transport this model is favored because many local studies have been implemented lai et al 2011 liao et al 2014 lee et al 2019 which enhanced our understanding of the local parameters setting cche2d is a depth averaged model that assumes the near bottom sediment concentration is directly proportional to the depth averaged sediment concentration the model simulates free surface turbulent flows with finite elements and the process of nonuniform sediment transport can differentiate varied particle sizes to calculate this study calculated the bedload sediment transport based on empirical nonuniform formula wu et al 2000 more modeling setups are listed in table 2 this study conducted in situ monitoring to provide local scours information for model calibrations the automatic float out devices cam used to measure the maximum scouring depth during flooding the float out device is usually used to continuously monitor the scouring in high risk regions in addition it can avoid the impact of boulders during floods that may cause sensor failure yang and su 2015 as shown in fig 4 a the basic principle of the wireless tracker is to put the float out device sensors into pre drilled boreholes which are initially drilled by a jumbo machine soil bricks and float out devices in which the instruments were embedded inside a canister were alternately buried under the riverbed before the event scouring the riverbed by flooding washes out the sensors which periodically emit signals to the receiver installed on the river bank when the sand bearing cans fall off due to scouring the float out device is affected by buoyancy which causes it to float to the water surface in addition as shown in fig 4 b the movement of particles affects the transmission of the signal to the terminal as the float out device sends signals to the receiver station a battery powers the device if the equipment is not washed out and still has electricity it can be reused during the next event this study built a station to receive signals from the dike which observed the real time monitoring of scour depths over the internet each module was 20 cm in height as shown in fig 4 c fig 4 a and 4 b show the system s configuration for monitoring the float out devices the devices were buried every 0 20 m below a sand can 2 4 indication of ecological index the river channel was divided into land and water sections to assess the habitat water sections were further subdivided into different morphological units mu there were four types of habitats including runs pools riffles and glides as wyrick and pasternack 2012 described runs included water with depths greater than 0 7 m and velocities higher than 0 6 m s pools had water depths greater than 1 4 m and velocities of less than 0 6 m s riffles included water with depths of less than 0 7 m and velocities higher than 0 6 m s glides had water depths of less than 1 4 m and velocities of less than 0 6 m s the exception to this habitat type was barred which had no water the habitat suitability index hsi was calculated based on habitat characteristics and the impact of the habitat on indicator species us fish and wildlife service 1981 the suitability index score used for quantifying the habitat quality for aquatic animals ranges from 0 for the least suitable habitat to 1 for the optimum habitat entwistle et al 2019 the hydraulic characteristics were simulated to obtain the critical characteristics used to estimate habitat suitability flow velocity and water depth the habitat suitability curves developed by the water resources agency water resources planning institute et al 2010 were referenced to determine the scores of the suitability indices the fish habitat quality hq was calculated by taking the geometric mean of the equally weighted suitability indices related to flow velocity and water depth as shown in eq 2 as suggested by elkins et al 2007 five classes of habitat quality were set including 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 4 0 7 0 7 1 0 corresponding to non habitat poor low quality medium and high quality habitat respectively kuo et al 2021 the higher the hq score the greater the river management efforts must be invested 2 hq s i v s i d where si v and si d are the suitability indices of flow velocity and water depth of the indicator fish species two endemic fish species to taiwan were chosen as the indicator species i e acrossocheilus paradoxus and hemimyzon formosanus representative of different habitat preferences such as migration limited and habitat limited 3 study configurations 3 1 study site as shown in fig 5 the daan river is located in taiwan s central and western parts the length of the river is 95 76 km and it drains an area of 758 47 square kilometers the primary land uses in the daan river watershed are agricultural forest and water agricultural land accounts for about 53 09 more than 40 000 ha then is 38 05 covered by forest more than 20 000 ha and water is about 5 57 with more than 4000 ha hillside or sloped land accounts for about 80 of the watershed area with most areas of collapse located in the upper middle and upper reaches of the watershed an area of about 624 ha the average slope of the main riverbed from the source area to the mihuo section is 1 50 while that from below mihuo to the outgoing valley section is 1 76 according to the four years of riverbed survey data 1973 2008 2016 2017 as shown in fig 6 the streambed of the main daan river is primarily comprised of pebbles gravel or rocks with relatively low sand content moreover the small particle size of the riverbed tends to decrease with the downstream distance the annual average rainfall in the daan watershed is about 2612 mm yr based on 8 gauge stations i e zhuolan 2 shuangqi 2 liyutan shinkaie elementary school jingshan xueling songan and xiangbi 1 records from 1903 to 2021 the amount is affected by the strength of the rainy season and the typhoons which occur from april to september these months account for about 75 of the annual rainfall october to march is the dry season accounting for 25 there are eight water gauges in the daan watershed as shown in fig 5 with three stations also being observation points for monitoring the flow rate and suspended sediment concentration the data cover 39 years of yili station 24 years for zhuolan station and 24 years for xiangbi station while analyzing return periods this study selected the chi square test to examine the flow data and used the goodness of fit test for the fitness test then the error analysis is applied to determine the best statistical distribution as a result the study calculated the outlet discharges under various return periods based on their control areas moea 2016 the daan river has experienced landslides in the upper reaches structures in or around the river channel being destroyed by nonequilibrium sediment transport in the middle and lower reaches and lack of available water sources during typhoon soulik 2013 landing in taiwan the babuifan shuiwei liyutan and buzies embankments were destroyed by 935 m 900 m 250 m and 400 m respectively in mid june 2017 typhoon merbok induced floods resulting in the partially damaged shuiwei embankment moea 2019 the section of the daan river from no 51 to no 58 forms the junction between canyon and plains in the daan watershed with a rapid reduction in the river cross section as no 56 therefore the baibufan region was chosen as the study site see fig 5 3 2 model configuration this study used a multi downscale simulation to assess the river hydraulics as impacted by typhoon events first the hec hms surface runoff model was used for the boundary conditions to calculate the confluence of rainfall or typhoon events then the wash123d model was utilized to simulate the water levels flow velocity and flow rate to provide the boundary conditions for the two dimensional simulation of the local river section in the cche2d sediment transport model discharge data from the upper shilin weir cross section no 8 to the downstream daan river bridge cross section no 69 40 1 km in total was simulated by the wash123d model and were adopted for the simulation boundary typhoon nesat from 07 29 2017 to 07 30 2017 and a heavy rainfall event from 05 30 2021 to 06 02 2021 were examined for model calibration in addition cross section survey data measured in 2016 were adopted for the riverbed terrain the n values at the position of the main river channel and the channel part other than the main river channel are set by 0 025 and 0 035 respectively moea 2018 the riverbed terrain cche2d was mapped using dem data produced by pix4dmapper from uav and real time kinematic rtk data point elevation correction was performed by comparison with rtk data the dem data used in this study has a spatial resolution of 20 m as shown in fig 5 the areas from cross section no 51 to cross section no 58 4 81 km in total was selected for the cche2d simulation a quadrilateral grid of approximately 5 5 m was built to avoid grid divergence and consider the length of simulation time it consisted of 179 horizontal and 1 046 vertical points approximately 187 234 points the average width of the points was approximately 5 m with a finer grid added around bridge piers to enhance local simulation accuracy the average value of the riverbed particle size at the p4 site was selected as the representative particle size for the particle size distribution curve at the baibufan bridge pier in the numerical model this study used the pebble count method wolman 1954 to identify the riverbed particle size for the numerical simulations the particle distribution curve can then be used to determine the proportions of the representative sample based on the modeling results we set the adaptation length to be 5 m other live bed parameters such as interaction thickness and scour formula are listed in table 2 the remote sensing assessment is used to identify the possible high risk region quickly then the in river hydraulic structures are examined to be protected by the scour countermeasure to enhance safety however impacts from engineering possibly lead to habitat destruction therefore this study used numerical simulation to evaluate the flow conditions at the baibufan bridge under different return periods with and without the scour protection structures as a result habitat suitability is adequately evaluated based on the simulation results as shown in fig 7 the scour protection structures i e porous cylinders were set before the baibufan bridge at the p4 site along with the flow a single row porous cylinder column was set up in front of the pier at 1 5 times the diameter of the pier distance and the spacing between each column was 1 0 m the column diameter was 1 4 m six piers were set in the numerical simulations the purpose of using a porous cylinder is to reduce the flow velocity in front of the bridge pier therefore to simulate the effect of the porous cylinder in the river this study set its roughness values to be larger than the riverbed the simulations were carried out with different return periods of the peak flow in the daan river moea 2016 to evaluate the effectiveness of the scour improvement near the p4 site pier of the baibufan bridge before and after installing protective structures in this study the flow before the confluence of the wushikeng river was used as the inflow boundary therefore the discharge of 5 year 10 year and 50 year return periods are 4 580 6 230 and 10 700 cm respectively the habitat suitability then is adequately assessed based on the simulation results 4 results and discussion 4 1 identification of active deformation areas ada in the daan river table 3 lists the ps results from the satellite data the number of scattering points density average coherence standard coherence deviation and standard rate deviation the results show that whatever the polarization mode of the ascending orbit with vv or vh the number of scattering points is far greater than deduced for the descending orbit in addition regardless of the orbital operation direction the number of scattering points obtained from the vv polarization mode is more significant than with vh as a result the average coherence analysis results of four images fell from 0 6 to 0 7 on the other hand the best analysis results are obtained using a descending orbit with vh with an average coherence of 0 662 however its standard deviation is the worst at 0 155 in short performing ada analysis using ascending orbit and vv polarized images is better this study adopted observation data collected by continuous gps satellite tracking from a station in the study area to check the accuracy and verify the results of surface deformation calculated from the ps points since the ps results indicate line of sight los deformation the study converted the satellite observation data s n e and u components into dependent los deformation data in addition a comparison was made between the ps scattering points near the gps station and in the study area and the average deformation of the two time series results e g ps and gps in the los direction the gps observational data were compared with the ps results in the same time segment and spatial range and the continuity of the gps time series data observations were collected from four gps stations labeled san2 dahu dosh and suc2 see fig 8 which are evenly distributed in the area of the ps points for verification of the accuracy of the results the distribution of the gps monitoring stations is shown in fig 8 also the annual average ground deformation velocity from 2016 01 to 2019 10 was analyzed using the gps stations ps points the calculated results indicate that the ground surface in this area shows a slight upward trend moreover except for the slightly more significant difference at the san2 location the difference between the ps and gps results is less than 0 3 mm in dahu dosh and suc2 stations which means that the trend of changes in deformation over four years is relatively consistent with that shown by the continuous gps station readings it also shows the reliability of the ps results the first step in the framework for the sustainable risk assessment of in river hydraulic structures is identifying the study zone the ada analysis aims to identify areas of active deformation from time series morphological changes the dramatic morphological change reflects the nonequilibrium sediment transportation in the channel and leads to the failure of in river structures the morphological change in the ps results used yearly analyses with the beginning date of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 used as the benchmarks to find the most active deformation areas during one year according to the ps results as shown in fig 8 the annual average ground deformation from 2016 to 2019 is stable in the watershed however ascending and descending deformation can be observed in the river channel near the baibufan region the ada analysis results are shown in fig 8 and indicate that the baibufan region does a hot zone and high risk area in the watershed therefore the scour around the pier of the baibufan bridge and habitat impacts caused by relevant engineering works are discussed in the following 4 2 evaluation of porous cylinder effectiveness in laboratory flume experiments during the experiments the porous cylinder hindered water flow so that water flowing through the porous cylinder generated a standing wave upstream and caused stagnation downstream inside the cylinder the water surface dropped and there were axial ripples so the water flow gathered at the center of a circle after leaving the cylinder the water surface dropped again the experimental results obtained with different water depths under different flow discharge rates are shown in fig 9 in test 1 the flow velocity increased because of the increment of flow discharge leading to an apparent backwater phenomenon in front of the porous cylinder as shown in fig 9 a there was a more significant drop in water level inside the cylinder in test 1 than in test 2 the height of the first backwater produced in test 1 before the cylinder s flow was 3 cm was lower than the second one however in test 1 the water depth decreases after flowing through the cylinder in test 2 the second height of the backwater was similar to the first one as shown in fig 9 a moreover the reduction in water depth after the water flowed through the cylinder tended to be smaller in test 2 than in test 1 the result allows us to deduce that the flow discharge seems reduced in test 2 and the reactions and reduction performance tended to be weak fig 9 b shows the observed flow velocity distribution before and after the water flowed through the porous cylinder here vx is the flow velocity with the porous cylinder vinlet is the flow velocity without a porous cylinder x is the distance along the flow direction and d is the diameter of the porous cylinder results show that the flow velocity begins to slow down about two times the distance from the upstream center of the water permeable cylinder the result is a reduction in the average flow velocity of 0 6 times and the generation of a lower flow velocity area behind the porous cylinder the laboratory flume experiment results show that installing a porous cylinder can effectively slow down the flow velocity reducing the local scouring phenomenon which is often generated by high speed downflow around bridge piers 4 3 evaluation of porous cylinder effectiveness in numerical simulations the study selected typhoon nesat jul 2017 rain event may 2021 typhoon in fa jul 2021 and typhoon lupit aug 2021 as examples to verify the proposed multiple downscaling simulations first the simulation performance is examined by taking the error indexes of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and peak time error pt simulations revealed that the simulated water level trend corresponds well with the observed values over the flood in which the average r2 mainly was higher than 0 8 besides the average rmse and mae were below 0 34 m and the peak time is almost identical in simulated and observed data for example the rain event may 2021 revealed only a 0 15 m difference in water depth between the cche2d simulation result and measurement which measured the flow peak at the mihuo station at 480 92 m furthermore this event s maximum water level simulation error did not exceed 0 65 m that indicated that the boundary conditions and parameters used in the model are feasible then typhoon in fa jul 2021 and typhoon lupit aug 2021 activated the float out devices which means a considerable pier scouring is observed as shown in table 4 from the monitoring results of typhoon in fa jul 2021 a flood washed away three float out devices at 11 26 14 37 and 16 07 on 07 24 2021 in typhoon lupit aug 2021 two float out devices were triggered at 8 52 and 9 58 on 08 07 2021 the result means that the float out device was triggered around the flood peak and down scouring continued during the falling limb based on the above comparison of modeling and in situ monitoring results our simulations successfully captured river flow patterns such as the water depth flow velocity and even erosion this method maintains the accuracy of a more extensive simulation but sharply reduces the computational resource and time the verified model was then used to simulate flow field and sediment transportation under different return periods e g 5 year 10 year and 50 year return periods the model also considered the effectiveness of scour protection work by evaluating changes in the riverbed in the baibufan region and improvement of the local scour phenomenon at the p4 site near the baibufan bridge fig 10 presents the simulation results of a 50 year return period with the protection work the simulations of water stage water depth flow velocity and riverbed changes are shown in fig 10 a 10 b 10 c and 10 d respectively in addition the simulations of the 50 year return period flow rate is 10 700 cms demonstrate the flow path get gathers into a deep trough at the left bank the water flow is divided into two paths after passing the baibufan bridge flow on the left bank is blocked from flowing downstream by the embankments therefore the current tends to rush to the right bank because the baibufan bridge is located at a narrow flow passageway the constriction caused by the terrain produces a high flow velocity and leads to scouring near the bridge piers in short the scouring problem affecting the footing safety of the right bank of baibufan barriers is worth noticing therefore from the above analysis this study paid attention to the baibufan region the simulation results in front of pier p4 are organized in table 5 the flow velocity ranged from 3 27 to 7 29 m s for different combinations of return period and protection work the flow velocity water depth and crucial scour depth in front of pier p4 can be reduced by about 28 3 37 7 20 0 33 3 and 20 0 26 6 respectively with the protection work all indicators in the simulation showed that although the flood velocity and scour depth in front of pier p4 still increased with the increment of the return period the installation of porous cylinders is still helpful to resist the impaction water flow from reducing local scour on the other hand implementing such protective work tends to cause habitat changes and threaten the local ecological system more details are discussed in the following section 4 4 ecological analysis in the baibufan region the analytical results of habitat unit distribution under base flow without flood events are shown in fig 11 the land area in the baibufan bridge region is about 55 which means that most areas in the river channel are floodplain in comparison with the water area only accounts for about 45 the glide in the central part of the water area accounts for about 32 followed by the deep run accounting for about 10 only 1 of the area comprises shallow riffles characterized by a high flow velocity and shallow water depth no deep pools have formed under the current base flow discharge conditions the analysis results indicate that the primary habitat type is a glide under base flow with low flow velocity and water depth as shown in fig 11 the glide is connected and distributed over a large area with only a relatively few scattered glide habitats located near the left bank the deep run is the primary habitat type in the middle of the river channel and is continuously distributed along the main channel the distribution of shallow riffles is relatively scattered and only sporadic formation occurs at the junction of the glide and the deep run the results showing the effect on habitat units of different return periods and protection work are listed in table 6 based on the hsi classifications under the base flow the two species of fish a paradoxus and h formosanus inhabited areas with medium habitat quality above class 4 mainly concentrated near the right bank and extending upstream from the bridge pier as shown in fig 12 these two areas were mainly shallow riffle habitats with low water depth and low flow velocity the deep flow area in the middle of the river channel is mostly unsuitable as a habitat class 1 for these species since the water depth and flow velocity are too large which reduces the hsi the spatiotemporal changes in fish habitat quality are examined on a paradoxus and h formosanus under scenarios with different return periods and with or without protection work during peak periods and after floods tables 7 and 8 in addition the classification of habitat quality for these two species in different situations is mapped in figs 13 and 14 respectively in the topographic change scenarios the results show that after a 5 year return period for flooding the land area has dropped to about 45 with increases in the proportions of deep runs riffle shallows and deep pools the simulation with protection work showed a higher proportion of deep runs and glides than without protection work the deep pool upstream was converted into a deep run and the shallow riffle and deep run areas near the right bank also turned into a glide the glide distribution near the left bank was more concentrated than the case without protection it changed from small and scattered to large and concentrated as shown in fig 13 a and 13 b in the topographic scenarios showing changes after a 10 year return period for flooding the proportion of land area dropped to about 42 in the protection work simulation with increases in the proportions of a deep run shallow riffle and deep pool areas the findings indicate that part of the land area was flooded to form a water habitat however the glide area accounting for about 32 of the total still formed the central part of the water habitat a comparison of fig 13 c and 13 d show that after protection work a band of shallow riffles was formed near the left bank and part of the glide turned into a deep run in the main river channel in the topographic change scenarios after a 50 year return period for flooding with protection work the proportions of a deep run shallow riffle and deep pool have all increased with most showing a continuous distribution the proportion of glide has declined but there is no difference in the proportion of land area however there are some differences in the distribution as shown in fig 13 e and 13 f the area of a shallow riffle on the left side of the main channel have continued to increase with the distribution the results indicate that the glide initially close upstream had become a deep run with a large deep pool area on the left side of the main channel at the flood s peak the flow conditions were mainly high flow velocity and deep water depth therefore the habitat distribution was dominated by a deep run other types of water habitats formed only sporadically and the difference between with and without the protection work was also slight in addition it can be found that even in a flood situation with a return period of 50 years the floodplain near the right bank of the baibufan river channel was still not submerged in the topographic change scenarios after a 5 year return period for flooding the hsi classification of a paradoxus shows them to be distributed and concentrated near the right bank before the addition of protection work mainly high quality habitat class 5 however after adding protection work the hsi classification dropped to class 4 in many places still of better quality more areas of medium quality habitat class 4 were near the left bank most concentrated in small areas as shown in fig 14 the hsi classification for h formosanus was similar to a paradoxus most areas were dominated by low quality class 3 and medium quality habitats class 4 but the habitat areas were fewer for h formosanus than for a paradoxus in the topographic change scenarios after a 10 year return period and protection work there was a change in the hsi classification distribution of a paradoxus from relatively concentrated areas medium quality habitat class 4 to more dispersed areas high quality habitat class 5 although the proportion of areas of high quality habitat had increased the proportion of unsuitable habitats class 1 had also increased and the distribution of high quality areas had become more dispersed the hsi classification distribution of h formosanus was mainly scattered but tended to be more concentrated near the right bank after the protection work there was also a slight increase in the proportion of high quality habitat areas class 5 however the proportion of overall unsuitable habitats class 1 was relatively high in the topographic change scenario after a 50 year return period the hsi classification distribution for a paradoxus had no significant change with the addition of protection work only the habitats near the right bank tended to be cut by problematic areas class 1 while the middle quality habitats near the left bank class 4 tended to be more concentrated the hsi classification distribution of h formosanus was mainly scattered after adding protection works the proportion of high quality habitat areas near the right bank class 5 increased slightly the middle quality habitat areas near the left bank class 4 had become continuous still overall there was not much difference at the peak flood period the flow conditions mainly tended towards high flow velocity and deep water depth therefore the distribution was dominated by unsuitable habitats accounting for more than 95 the proportions of other grades were less than 1 mainly distributed along the floodplain near the right bank the difference before and after installing protective structures was also relatively small peak flooding was very detrimental to a paradoxus and h formosanus 5 conclusion this study implemented a framework to integrate engineering design and ecological analysis to assess the impact of compound disasters in the daan watershed first the satellite data has retrieved the trends of large scale ground deformation and the active deformation areas ada in the study site so the baibufan region was chosen as the research area of interest in addition this study conducted flume experiments using a porous cylinder to reduce local scouring and understand the effectiveness of possible protection work the results indicated that setting protective devices can effectively slow down the flow velocity and improve the hydraulic conditions in addition the simulations from multiple downscale modeling were calibrated with the measured records from our in situ monitoring works along the daan river the well proven models were then used to assess the safety of in river structures simultaneously this study conducted an ecological assessment to explore the effects on species habitats given different engineering methods and further consider the balance between engineering solutions and ecological impact the results indicated that the primary habitat type comprises the glide during the base flow rates comprising an area of about 32 followed by the run accounting for about 10 riffles with high flow velocity and low water depth occupy only about 1 the habitat quality of the acrossocheilus paradoxus is higher than that of hemimyzon formosanus during flood periods the primary habitat type is the run some pools near the shore should be an essential refuge habitat for the fish during flooding moreover exposed sand bars occupy about 55 of the total area of the study area during the base flow however the size of sand bars is reduced by 40 when flooding occurs in summary the flood revealed a negative ecological effect on the quality of the habitat of the two fish species leading to degraded or scattered habitat areas an engineering alternative is to build sufficient pool areas on the right bank of the river for providing foraging and utilization of fish during base flow and be a refuge during flooding given that traditional research only focuses on the engineering or ecological system this study proposes a framework to cover the scopes of large scale river region inspection engineering methods and ecological assessment for management agencies active deformation areas analysis is helpful in quickly identifying possible high risk regions for engineers the effectiveness of porous cylinders is an assertive tool to overcome scour problems finally the ecological assessment enables us to find a balance between humans and other lives for the conservation issue the concepts and practical applications have been implemented in this study credit authorship contribution statement dong sin shih project administration writing

2268,protecting freshwater systems to ensure sustainability requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales from local to global there is growing acceptance that environmental flows must be protected to sustain river channels and floodplain ecosystems downstream of reservoirs meeting environmental water requirements has proven difficult because they reduce water yield available for human use a particular challenge in regions already experiencing declining water availability with climate change a further challenge is the difficulty of assessing the impact of environmental water requirements on water availability for other purposes this paper provides a modification of the gould dincer method to assess the yield of carry over reservoirs subject to environmental water requirements the method characterizes reservoir inflows using readily available flow characteristics annual mean and c v we develop and test the method using ten examples with well understood environmental water requirements and a range of annual flow c v s we then demonstrate this method at continental scale to investigate the impact on yield of providing high reliability supply including environmental water requirements under a changing climate according to our results considering climate change and environmental flow provision simultaneously the decline in water yield is projected to be about 27 and 18 respectively for australia and us based on hypothetical reservoirs capacity of one times mean annual inflow adapting environmental flow demands to future hydrological conditions results in a 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively while further testing is needed the method provides a simple and rapid way to estimate the impact of providing environmental flow on yield applicable at global scale keywords gould dincer method environmental flow yield for human use climate change data availability the specific environmental water

projects esgf llnl 1 introduction freshwater resources are widely regarded as the most essential of natural resources which are suffering from severe water scarcity problems where water demand exceeds water availability for human use schewe et al 2014 liu et al 2021 demonstrated that 28 60 of the global human population is currently suffering from severe water scarcity especially in china and india this challenge could exacerbate further in the future due to increasing water demands meybeck 2003 vörösmarty et al 2010 mehran et al 2017 in addition to human water demands changing climate projects an extra threat to water scarcity because changes in climatic variables e g precipitation and temperature may modify inflow characteristics which further lead to less water availability herman et al 2020 kaur et al 2019 mehran et al 2017 sabzi et al 2019 sivakumar 2011 for example pokhrel et al 2021 argued that climate change reduces water availability in many regions of the world especially those in the southern hemisphere thus identifying current and future water scarcity threats and regions on a range of spatial scales from the local to the global is significant and necessary to ensure water sustainability vörösmarty et al 2010 for relieving water scarcity reservoirs are built to extract water for human use with additional multiple functions such as flood control hydropower generation fishing and tourism these benefits improve human health expand food production and support economic growth lehner et al 2011 for instance in 2018 hydropower generated about 4 200 terawatt hours twh of electricity globally which was the highest contribution from a renewable energy source icold 2019 iha 2019 however reservoirs and associated river regulation also modify downstream flow regimes often reducing streamflow magnitudes variability and seasonality these flow alterations can have serious consequences for riverine ecosystems to alleviate these consequences ecologists and water resource planners are increasingly concerned with implementing environmental flows to sustain a healthy downstream river ecosystem dyson et al 2003 horne et al 2017a stewardson guarino 2018 however the provision of environmental flows means there is less water available for human use the environmental water requirements may cause a large restriction on the water for human use wada et al 2016 to assess the water conflict between human and environmental use methods are needed which can evaluate the impact of the provision of environmental water on yield for other human purposes e g irrigation urban supply particularly for large scale assessments pastor et al 2014 most studies investigating the behavior of regulated river systems e g interaction between water availability for human and environmental use rely on a hydrological simulation model to simulate reservoir inflows under specific scenarios vogel et al 2007 john et al 2021 such models may be paired with river operations simulation to account for the reservoir water balance and the delivery of water to meet both human and in some cases environmental water requirements kirby et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are also many methods to relate flow regime changes to ecological outcomes tharme 2003 such as indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1997 ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 the conditional probability network cpn horne et al 2017a horne et al 2017b horne et al 2018 wang et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and eco engineering decision scaling eeds poff et al 2016 these existing flow assessment methods can be used to assess flow alteration and may contribute toward building the model to estimate environmental water requirements however these models are often used in specific single river systems john et al 2021 wang et al 2018 the analysis of water yields from reservoirs subject to environmental water requirements based on these simulation models is demanding in terms of data and computations one potential challenge is to obtain related high quantity and quality data for simulation and calibration two types of data are necessary for these models including reservoir operation data and environmental water requirements however it is hard to collect the reservoir operation data from the reservoir management and companies if there is no direct collaboration with these entities meanwhile the understanding of environmental water requirements is complicated requiring close collaboration with biologists and ecologists the complexity of these data means that they are only available when sufficient resources are available to finance furthermore this modeling requires the simulation of millions of scenarios of which the runtimes are extremely long their computational requirements can pose other challenges to efficiently exploring sources of uncertainty e g climate uncertainty john et al 2021 while these simulation models are undoubtedly critical for the analysis of individual regulated water systems where resources and data are available they may be not suitable for continental or global scale analysis revealing simple relationships to gain insight into the effects of key drivers on water allocations including climate and water policy settings to provide a simpler and less data demanding approach we modify the relatively simple gould dincer reservoir yield assessment method for carry over reservoir gould 1964 mcmahon 1976 mcmahon adeloye 2005 mcmahon et al 2007a to provide an assessment of the reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements the gould dincer method has been a powerful rapid assessment tool for estimating the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship for a single storage carry over water resource system mcmahon et al 2011 peel et al 2015 petheram et al 2017 ren et al 2022 xie et al 2013 for example xie et al 2013 applied the gould dincer method to estimate hydropower generation benefits and related them to reservoir capacity and reliability petheram et al 2017 developed a method for identifying dam wall locations and water yield over a large area by taking the gould dincer method into account a feature of the gould dincer method is that water yield for human use is assumed to be constant from year to year however we know that some water uses like environmental flows do not have constant annual requirements this is because environmental flows with different magnitudes are required with different annual return intervals to mimic natural variations in flow grafton et al 2011 chu et al 2018 this is a major shortcoming given the growing focus on providing environmental water particularly downstream of large carry over reservoirs if this shortcoming can be overcome the gould dincer method could be used as an alternate tool to examine the interaction between water yield for human and environmental use especially on a larger scale in a situation where more detailed simulation modeling approaches are not feasible or suited therefore this study seeks to modify the gould dincer method to estimate the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship for a mixture of two types of use of the yield a constant water yield for human uses note that our study focuses on water yield which represents the amount of released water from the carryover reservoir for allocation rather than water demand which represents the amount of water required by humans and a variable component i e changes from year to year related to environmental water requirements this modification allows investigation of the impact of supplying environmental flows on the constant yield available for other uses under current and future conditions from a given reservoir for given reliability of supply the novelty of this method is that it provides a rapid way for large scale i e global scale analysis of sustainable water yield considering environmental water perspectives and climate change effects simultaneously which we demonstrate through implementing this method across australia and the united states of america us the simplicity of the modified method and data requirements facilitate the rapid assessment of the impact of providing environmental water on the yield from water resource systems especially at larger scales while this method is not intended to supplant existing detailed methods it may usefully complement them providing an initial assessment for a given system or over a wider region wherever streamflow data are available in the next section we review the original gould dincer method and develop the modified gould dincer method in addition we introduce the method and data for testing the method against environmental flow case studies and an application across australia and us to analyze the impact of providing environmental water on yield for human use under a changing climate 2 methods 2 1 gould dincer method review the gould dincer method models the relation between reservoir storage capacity yield and reliability for a single carry over reservoir carry over reservoirs use part of the water stored in one year over subsequent years for preliminary design purposes gould 1964 mcmahon et al 2007a the original method assumes that annual reservoir inflows are normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ and serially independent i e there is independence between any pair of sequential annual inflows mcmahon 1976 according to the properties of the normal distribution the cumulative inflow in consecutive n years has a mean and standard deviation of nμ and σ n respectively during a critical draw down period n the period for the reservoir to go from full to empty the gould dincer method considers single storage with volume s which is subject to a cumulative n year yield or draft d n and a cumulative n year inflow i n with a probability of non exceedance of p in the original method d n represents yield available for human use following mcmahon et al 2007a the reservoir storage volume s can be calculated as follows 1 s d n i n similar to many reservoir planning studies related to the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship adeloye et al 2003 phien 1993 vogel stedinger 1995 mcmahon et al 2007a represent annual water yield as a constant from year to year thus the cumulative n year yield or draft d n can be estimated 2 d n α n μ where α 0 α 1 denotes the portion of the expected value known as the regulation level phien 1993 the full regulation is obtained with α 1 i e yield equals the mean flow meanwhile annual inflow follows the normal distribution thus 3 i n n μ z p σ n where z p is the standardized normal variate at 1 p reliability in this case reliability means the proportion of years in which the stated demand yield for water is met from equations 1 2 and 3 4 s α n μ n μ z p σ n assuming known values of μ and σ this equation provides the storage s required to supply the stated yield for the desired reliability z p for different run lengths of n as mentioned the final value of n corresponds to the draw down period which means the run length over which the required value of s to meet the desired yield is at a maximum to find the maximum we differentiate equation 4 with respect to n which gives 5 ds dn α μ μ z p σ 2 n 0 then the draw down period n and corresponding maximum required storage capacity s can be calculated as follows 6 n z p 2 4 1 α 2 c v 2 7 s z p 2 4 1 α c v 2 μ where c v is the coefficient of variation of annual inflows c v σ μ put simply the critical draw down period n or storage capacity s of a reservoir can be estimated from the annual inflow c v yield α and desired reliability z p of supply by using equations 6 and 7 note that actual annual flows can be autocorrelated and equation 7 can be corrected to take autocorrelation into account phatarfod 1986 vogel mcmahon 1996 however a parameter sensitivity analysis of the original gould dincer method shows that yield is not sensitive to autocorrelation mcmahon et al 2007a thus we do not consider it in our research analytical solutions are also available in the case where annual inflows are gamma or lognormal distributed gould 1964 extended the method to the case where annual inflow was gamma distributed referred to as the gould gamma method mcmahon adeloye 2005 where z p in equation 3 is substituted by g p where 8 g p 2 γ 1 γ 6 z p γ 6 3 1 γ 2 c v alternatively lognormally distributed flows can be accommodated mcmahon et al 2007a by substituting z p for l p where 9 l p 1 c v e z p ln 1 c v 2 0 5 ln 1 c v 2 1 an important limitation of the gould dincer method is that it does not explicitly consider net evaporation losses and it is only applicable for carry over reservoirs mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007a proposed the use of the criteria m 1 α c v to define carry over reservoir reservoirs with m 1 operate as carry over reservoirs and m 1 operate as within year reservoirs vogel and bolognese 1995 vogel et al 1997 2 2 model to represent multi year cumulative environmental flow requirements in general environmental flows with different magnitudes are required with different annual return intervals to mimic natural variations in flow grafton et al 2011 chu et al 2018 lower magnitude flows are needed to be released more frequently but larger magnitude flows are needed to be released less frequently reflecting the natural relation between frequency and magnitude of streamflows in rivers poff et al 1997 this inter annual variation in environmental flows violates the gould dincer method assumption of uniform yield this paper provides a modification of the gould dincer method to account for annually varying environmental water demands in section 2 3 to develop this modification we first model the volume of annually varying environmental flows for an n year reservoir draw down period c f equation 2 for a constant yield for this model we consider a common situation where environmental flows are released with low intensities to large intensities to inundate different riverine habitats for example a river may have three environmental flow components a minimum flow a high in channel flow event to inundate the riverbank and an overbank flow to fill floodplain wetlands a minimum environmental flow may be required every year augmented with a high in channel flow possibly every second year in addition to an overbank flow that is likely required with a longer return interval after releasing such environmental flow demands cumulative environmental flow releases from a single reservoir are required to meet environmental water requirements e w r n over an n year period are modeled as 10 e w r n β μ n d where β is a parameter to reflect the minimum environmental flow required every year as a proportion of μ which is the mean annual streamflow and d d 1 is a parameter to reflect the non linearity of accumulation of required environmental flows with increasing period duration higher values of d indicate that the cumulative demands increase more steeply as longer periods are considered further we suggest an intrinsic relation between d and the flow variability of a system we propose that a more variable system with greater contrast between high flow years and low flow years will have a greater value of d this is because environmental water demands generally mimic natural flow variability and hence multi year recurrent interval requirements will be greater relative to minimum flows and cumulative volumes will increase more steeply as longer periods are considered thus we model a linear relationship between the d and interannual flow variability c v 11 d u c v p where u and p are two parameters if only a constant minimum annual environmental flow is considered u will be 0 and p will be 1 but if there is any variability in environmental flows between years then higher environmental water requirements are also considered and u will increase u 0 furthermore p is not a free parameter but logically should have a value of 1 according to the following reasoning in the limiting hypothetical case of zero c v the environmental flow releases required to mimic the flow regime would be constant from year to year and to achieve this in equation 10 requires p to have a value of 1 thus the cumulative environmental water requirements can be estimated by the following equation 12 e w r n β μ n u c v 1 in this equation ewr n is a power function of n when β u and c v increase ewr n exhibits exponential growth as n increases which is applied to represent cumulative environmental water requirements during a reservoir multi year draw down period in this study we test the applicability of this power function quation 10 by comparing it with an alternate exponential model and also test our linear model for d equation 11 using observations in a wide range of rivers 2 3 modified gould dincer method this study modifies the gould dincer method to consider a mixture of two types of use of the yield a constant annual yield for non environmental uses and a variable annual yield related to environmental water requirements as discussed in section 2 2 environmental flows are typically not constant annually which introduces interannual variations in the yield required to meet these environmental water requirements the existing gould dincer method considers only a constant annual yield available for human use although the yield may not be supplied with perfect reliability the yield desired volume stays constant from year to year in contrast when extending the method to also include yield associated with environmental water requirements the modified method must allow for environmental flows that are often not constant from year to year if we define the d n term in the gould dincer method to include yield components for human use related to α h and environmental flow related to β and u then we can combine equation 12 with the gould dincer method equation 4 to get the following equation 13 s α h n μ β μ n u c v 1 n μ z p σ n note we have used the notation α h to represent the yield available for human use and not used for providing environmental water requirements in the limiting case of zero environmental flows β will be zero and α h is then the same as α from the original gould dincer method differentiating equation 13 with respect to variable n gives equation 14 14 ds dn α h μ u c v 1 β μ n u c v μ z p σ 2 n 0 meanwhile because σ c v μ 15 α h u c v 1 β n u c v 1 z p c v 2 n 0 for a regulated river with a known or assumed storage capacity and known or assumed environmental flow requirements the reservoir yield α h subject to also providing environmental water can be assessed by equations 13 and 15 if the annual inflow is gamma or lognormal distributed z p in the above equations can be substituted by g p equation 8 or l p equation 9 respectively 3 model evaluation we consider 10 river sites across the world fig 1 to evaluate the modified gould dincer method especially for equation 12 in representing historic environmental water requirements with reference to historic environmental releases these rivers span a broad range of both c v and mean µ annual streamflows table 1 mcmahon et al 2007c summarized streamflow characteristics of 1221 global rivers which exhibited a range of annual c v between 0 1 and 1 annual c v of the 10 river sites vary from 0 14 to 1 36 which demonstrates that they sample the global c v range well meanwhile we introduce the catchment size and storage of each site in table 1 noted that usumacinta river little shasta river des moines river and clear fork brazos river do not contain a carry over reservoir table 1 for other characteristics of evaluation sites e g topography geology hydro meteorological information please refer to the documents which are mentioned in the data availability statement section firstly we need to convert annual environmental water requirements with different return intervals into cumulative environmental water requirements over an n year draw down period fig 1 for our proposes we assume a volume of water is released each year during a critical reservoir draw down period hence if the environmental water requirement includes a volume of water to be delivered every i years i represents the return interval we assume this is provided in the ith year of the reservoir draw down period we add the specific annual environmental water requirements with different return intervals bar graph in fig 1 to the minimum annual environmental flow to estimate the cumulative environmental water requirements scatter plot in fig 1 for example if the annual environmental flow is 100 ml but once every three years there must be an environmental flow of 300 ml then a cumulative environmental flow for an n year series where n 4 would be 100 100 300 100 600 ml in the third year the 300 ml flow includes the annual flow of 100 ml so the 100 ml annual requirement must not be double counted in the third year for each of the rivers we estimate the cumulative environmental water requirements during the draw down period using equation 10 fitted by log log regression power function between the cumulative environmental water requirements and the draw down period n in other words the parameters β and d for each river can be determined by regression using specific annual environmental water requirements then we demonstrate the relationship between c v and d to determine the parameter u by linear regression the constant annual yield for human use without considering environmental flow could be determined firstly by using the original gould dincer equations 6 and 7 with known β and u we can estimate the constant annual yield for human use considering environmental flow using equations 13 for a regulated system with carry over reservoir capacity s because usumacinta river little shasta river des moines river and clear fork brazos river do not contain a carry over reservoir table 1 we evaluate the impact of environmental flow on yield from carry over reservoirs only for the other six rivers to achieve that we assume that constant annual yield for human use and yield for environmental flows are met with a reliability of 95 z p 1 645 annual inflows approximately follow a gamma distribution so z p is substituted by g p using equation 8 the coefficient of determination r2 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the fitted trendline and the specific cumulative environmental water requirements note that sometimes when storage capacity is extremely large e g s 2μ the critical draw down period n may be very large however here we limit the period of the multi year cumulative environmental water requirements to ten years or less which is consistent with the specific environmental water requirements reported as listed in the data availability statement section finally parameter sensitivity is analyzed via a sensitivity analysis by considering the effect of a change 10 in the parameters c v u β and s on equation 13 to explore the importance of our parameters u and β to the overall results 4 application we demonstrate the utility of the modified gould dincer method for wide spatial application by examining australia and us wide yield impacts with the provision of environmental flow under changing climate this is possible because the majority of the inputs to the method can be derived in a continuous manner across space by starting with spatially continuous climate inputs and using prediction equations to estimate the relevant streamflow statistics as shown in fig 2 firstly to facilitate continuous assessment across space we use concepts of climate elasticities of runoff developed by mcmahon et al 2011 to estimate the hydrological statistics required by the method namely mean mar standard deviation sdr and coefficient of variation c v of annual runoff for a given climatic regime as follows 16 m a r m a p e ϕ 17 s d r 1 ϕ e ϕ s d p 18 c v s d r m a r where map is the mean annual precipitation ϕ m a p e t m a p and mapet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration sdr is the standard deviation of annual runoff and sdp is the standard deviation of annual precipitation the above equations are used in both the historic case and also future scenarios under climate change we source the input variables for these equations from global climate model gcm knutti et al 2013 simulations for the historical period 2006 2020 and future period 2036 2055 table 2 mean annual potential evapotranspiration mapet is calculated using the morton method morton 1983 for the purposes of this demonstration we do not consider land use change and any resultant impact on runoff statistics but rather assume the land use is the same as historical conditions when using equations 16 18 also we assume that the catchment response to rainfall is stationary under climate change and we do not apply any bias correction to the gcm projections as we are interested in showing the relative differences between future and current conditions rather than the absolute values that would require bias correction we also assume that the annual inflows are gamma distributed in this analysis and do not change distribution between current and future periods in order to apply this australia and us wide firstly we divided australia and us into 1321 and 1432 grids with 0 8 x 0 8 size to enable the pattern and distribution of variables to be considered for each grid it is necessary to make some assumptions regarding hypothetical reservoir properties and assumed reliability of supply for the purpose of this study we model a hypothetical reservoir storage capacity that is 1 times the mar mean annual inflow which is chosen based on typical storage volumes of global reservoirs mcmahon et al 2007b we acknowledge that some carry over reservoirs can be larger with volumes up to 2 times mar in a few cases in australia and us also we assume z p 1 645 95 reliability ideally the u value of the modified gould dincer method would be informed by local specific environmental water requirements e g 10 rivers in the above section but these are unavailable at a continental scale so an assumed value is applied based on the slope of the linear regression line for the relationship between parameter d and c v fig 4 in the results section we use the same u value of 0 41 for evaluation whilst this is a pragmatic solution for our cases study more local examples would need to be considered to develop a general model for u after determining storage we calculate α h the maximum yield as a ratio of mar by first applying the original gould dincer method assuming the reliability of 95 i e with no environmental water or β 0 we then compare this with the yield if environmental flows are provided and modeled using the modified gould dincer method initially we intended to set the minimum annual environmental flow as a proportion of mar at 0 1 typical of values achieved worldwide acreman et al 2014 king et al 2000 smakhtin et al 2006 see also tennant 1976 for estimating minimum flows in 11 streams of the western us however minimum environmental flow β for some areas cannot reach 0 1 even when all water resource is used for environmental demand because of highly non linear flow regimes particularly in arid areas thus we set β min β 0 1 i e where an initial estimate is determined using equation 19 a variant of equation 15 and then limited to 0 1 if necessary β can be estimated by equation 19 for a given c v u reliability z p α h α h 0 because we try to maximize β and all water resource is used for environmental flow and n 19 β z p c v 2 1 α h n 2 u c v 1 n u c v 0 5 the effect of environmental flow provision and the effect of climate change are each considered separately and also in combination providing three alternate scenarios fig 2 in the case of considering climate change alone we chose not to compare historically observed streamflow directly with future simulated projections because differences may be due to model errors rather than the simulated impact of climate change thus for six gcms we also include climate simulations from the historic period there are two conditions we use when estimating environmental flow for a future scenario which we term historical hydrology and future hydrology historical hydrology means we use the environmental water requirements that are estimated under historical conditions in contrast future hydrology means the environmental water requirement is adjusted to reflect the future hydrological conditions e g future mean and c v poff 2018 using equation 12 if future environmental water requirements remain the same as the historic ones our historical hydrology results would apply however the future environmental water requirements might change in response to change in river channels horne et al 2017c human assisted spread of nonnative species olden et al 2004 and species range changes in response to climate change rahel and olden 2008 the river related species could adapt to future conditions horne et al 2017c thus it is important and necessary to pay attention to dynamic hydrologic processes i e future hydrology scenarios that are related to dynamic ecological representations as a result there are two scenarios when evaluating both environmental water and climate change effects fig 2 5 results 5 1 model evaluation 5 1 1 evaluation of model that represents the multi year cumulative environmental flow in general the fitted trendline of the power function fits well with the specific cumulative environmental water requirements red lines of fig 3 attaining r2 values of 0 97 or greater compared with the exponential function blue lines of fig 3 the power function can attain larger r2 values for all 10 global rivers thus the assumption of equation 10 power function is adopted table 3 shows the values of the key parameters the r2 values indicate a good fit 0 94 in all ten cases results show that d increases with increasing flow variability c v across the 10 sites table 3 fig 4 shows the fitted relationship between d 1 and c v by linear regression for the 10 global river sites the slope of which is the parameter u in equation 11 with a fitted u value of 0 41 the trendline r2 is 0 93 which means that there is a strong relationship between d and the flow variability c v and the assumption of an intrinsic relation between d and the flow variability c v is reasonable at least for these 10 sites furthermore testing the method equation 12 on other case study sites with a range of c v values is important because it may show that this new method can be applied across a broader set of catchments with different flow conditions specifically with a broad range of c v 5 1 2 the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use α h for specific river sites in the six regulated river systems of the ten global river sites storage capacity s and environmental water requirements are known table 3 shows the yield for human use α h for both the case where environmental flows are implemented and the simpler case where only yield for human use is considered the difference between the two cases is as follows implementing environmental flows causes the yield for human use expressed as a proportion of mar to reduce from 0 97 to 0 72 for the goulburn river from 0 75 to 0 42 for the murrumbidgee river from 0 82 to 0 55 for the macquarie river from 0 64 to 0 19 for the big cypress creek from 0 91 to 0 58 for the bill williams river and from 0 77 to 0 29 for the clear fork brazos river 5 1 3 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis results table 4 indicate that yield is most sensitive to c v thus the proposed methodology is suitable for climate change impact assessments of reservoir yield as it is more sensitive to changes in hydroclimatic variability than the assumption in equation 11 in the next section we provide a potential application of this methodology which is to assess reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated carry over systems at the continental scale under changing climate 5 2 application 5 2 1 the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use α h based on different climate projections in australia and us in this section we apply this method for continental scale analysis especially under a changing climate firstly we estimate australia and us wide mean annual precipitation map figure s1 and s2 and mean annual potential evapotranspiration mapet figure s3 and s4 based on both historical and future periods for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios of six gcms then the flow statistics mar figures s5 and s6 and c v figures s7 and s8 are estimated using the empirical method of mcmahon et al 2011 see section 4 above it should be noted that the flow statistics presented in fig 5 are not based on the gcms runoff because prior studies report that biases in gcm precipitation can be amplified through the rainfall runoff process arora 2001 weiland et al 2012 mcmahon et al 2015 peel et al 2015 after estimating mar and c v yield is also estimated for the climate projections this is first done using the original gould dincer method i e equations 6 and 7 next the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use is also estimated using equations 13 the results fig 5 for australia and fig 6 for the us show that when storage capacity is equal to one times the mean annual inflow s 1 mar the provision of environmental flows decreases the yield for human use by between 15 and 50 for most of australia in both historical and future period under rcp4 5 and 8 5 based on six gcms except miroc shows fewer decreases in water yield fig 5 this represents a reduction of between 0 10 and 0 25 times mar for all models figure s9 compared with australia most of the us shows a slight decrease in the yield for human use by between 10 and 20 in both historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 based on six gcms fig 6 this represents a reduction of between 0 and 0 20 times mar for all models figure s10 5 2 2 the impact of climate change on yield for human use in this section we use six gcms for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and compare future runs to the historic run from the same model to explore the climate change effects on yield for human use in fig 7 for australia and 8 for the us where each black point represents the comparison between the median values of six gcms for a grid cell meanwhile we show the comparisons for each individual rcp and gcm combination by using colorful points note that there are five yield scenarios for each grid cell the first is displayed on the x axis of all four plots in figs 7 and 8 whereas the others are displayed one by one via the y axis values in each of the four plots the first value represents the yield estimate based on the gcm based historical scenario without considering environmental water requirements the second value represents the yield estimate based on the historical scenario considering environmental water requirements the third value represents the yield estimate based on the future scenario without considering environmental water requirements the fourth and fifth values represent the yield estimates based on the future scenario considering environmental water requirements based on future and historical hydrology respectively by comparing the first value with the second value the impact of providing environmental flows on yield is estimated fig 7a and 8a similarly by comparing the first value with the third value the impact of climate change on yield is estimated fig 7b and 8b finally both the impacts on water yield of climate change and providing environmental flow are estimated fig 7c fig 7d fig 8c and 8d on average climate change causes about 9 and 14 decrease in yield for human use in australia under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively and about 3 and 5 decrease in yield for human use in the us under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7b and 8b the spatial pattern of change in australia and us wide yield for human use caused by climate change is shown in the second column of fig 9 a and 9b respectively in general under rcp4 5 water yield for human use decreases by about up to 50 over southwest and northeast australia and increases by up to 50 over most parts of northern and southeastern australia however under rcp8 5 water yield for human use decreases by about 70 in most parts of australia fig 9a meanwhile it is clear that water yield for human use decreases by about up to 25 over most parts of the southern us but increases by about up to 15 over most parts of the northern us under rcp4 5 compared with the results of rcp4 5 rcp8 5 show that most parts of the us show a decline in yield of human use between 0 and 50 except for some regions of northern and middle us which show an increase between 10 and 25 fig 9b 5 2 3 combined effect of climate change and environmental water on yield for human use we consider the effect of climate change and environmental water independently and combined on yield for human use across australia and the us as expected there is a strong correlation between yield for human use of different scenarios on average the provision of environmental water leads to about a 15 decrease fig 7a and a 13 fig 8a decrease in yield for human use in australia and us respectively both climate change and environmental flow provision cause about a 24 and 27 decline in australia under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7d similarly both climate change and environmental flow provision cause about a 17 and 18 decline in the us under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8d the spatial pattern of change in yield for human use for these scenarios is shown in fig 9 implementing environmental flow causes a more consistent decline in yield for human use in australia and the us the third column of fig 9a and 9b both environmental flow and climate lead to a much greater reduction in yield for human use in australia than that in the us the fourth and fifth columns of fig 9a and 9b 5 2 4 adjusting environmental flow for future climate in the previous section we assume environmental water requirements are unchanged in the future relative to the historical scenario as a result environmental flow is estimated based on historical hydrology fig 7d and fig 8d the slope of the trend line for australia is about 0 76 and 0 73 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7d the slope of the trend line for the us is about 0 83 and 0 82 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8d if environmental flow demands are adjusted based on future hydrology fig 7c and fig 8c the slope of the trend line for australia is about 0 78 and 0 75 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7c the slope of the trend line for the us is about 0 87 and 0 85 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8c thus adapting environmental flow demands to the future hydrology results in a about 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively compared with environmental flow estimated based on historical hydrology fig 7c and fig 8c relative to fig 7d and fig 8d because the method implicitly assumes environmental flows should be consistent with future in this case drier flow regimes and thus require less water overall 6 discussion 6 1 representing multi year cumulative environmental water requirements our study represents multi year cumulative environmental water requirements using a power function related to the natural flow variability that can represent variability in annual environmental flow demands between years richter et al 2006 try to develop methods to define environmental flow requirements based on ecohydrological relationships but it is difficult to scale these methods for larger scale use e g continental scale global scale our method provides a possible way to extend ecohydrological relationships that are far from being linear pastor et al 2014 which makes it possible to evaluate environmental flow requirements at the global scale by comprehensively considering annual variability in environmental flow requirements this is a significant advance on other methods used for global water assessments related to environmental flow while some previous studies separate the minimum environmental flow and large multi year recurrence interval environmental flow requirements and evaluate their impact on global water resources respectively liu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 pastor et al 2014 vanham et al 2022 for example vanham et al 2022 demonstrated that implementing high environmental flow results in about 41 and 80 decreases in global annual renewable water availability implementing low environmental flow leads to different levels of water scarcity for currently 53 countries 6 2 possibilities for global implementation compared with alternatives our method does not attempt a detailed catchment and system specific analysis but it is useful for 1 preliminary planning assessment purposes for a specific site to estimate environmental flow effects on yield for human use 2 continental and global scale rough water yield estimates especially considering the climate change effects simultaneously 3 hydrological research where the system with carry over reservoirs is being investigated particularly our method could be applied quickly across a continent under both historical and future climate scenarios to estimate larger scale water availability including environmental flow requirements paired with its reliance on flow statistics that can be inferred from spatially continuous climatic data typically the effect of environmental flows on yield for human use for future scenarios uses a combination of river systems modeling ecological modeling and possibly input from global climate models kirby et al 2015 wang et al 2018 such modeling requires considerable site specific data and calibration ren et al 2018 which makes these methods difficult to apply quickly for multiple scenarios or over multiple sites for example when the effect of climate change and environmental flows on sustainable yields were analyzed for rivers across the murray darling basin representing just one seventh of australia four different kinds of simulation models were required climate modeling catchment water yield modeling river modeling and groundwater modeling and it took over 3 years and a very large team of over 200 scientists and technicians to complete csiro 2009 in contrast our simplified method only requires readily available local variables mean annual inflows and the coefficient of variation c v without the need for time consuming and data intensive modeling despite its simplicity the original gould dincer method has been widely applied mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2011 peel et al 2015 petheram et al 2017 xie et al 2013 similarly our modified gould dincer method can be usefully applied for simplified modeling at a site recognizing the limitations of the method moreover as noted already by pairing with regional methods which can estimate these hydrological statistics based on climatic data useful estimates can be made even in the absence of streamflow gauging 6 3 water yield estimation under changing climate this paper focuses on overcoming the barrier to rapid assessment of the impact of supplying environmental flows on the yield available for other uses we demonstrate how the method can be applied to estimate reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated carry over systems at the continental scale under changing climate note that our focus is not on how to translate these results into planning recommendations in any case translating modeling results into planning recommendations is not straightforward and there is a lack of consensus in the literature as to how best to achieve it for example between top down the planning process is directly using gcm scenarios and bottom up scenario neutral looking at ranges of plausible future changes in key variables type approaches to climate risk assessments prudhomme et al 2010 however regardless of which approach is chosen our method may be a useful initial tool for prioritizing reservoirs for further detailed analysis of climate change risks and developing strategies to mitigate those risks the modified gould dincer method can also help support an analysis of the uncertainty in yield changes with uncertain climate futures using a parameter sensitivity analysis in our analysis section 5 1 3 yield was more sensitive to c v of annual streamflow compared with other parameters u β and s this is because c v not only affects the water yield estimates for human use but also impacts the cumulative environmental flow requirements equation 12 similarly storage capacity s is also sensitive to c v mcmahon et al 2007a which further impacts the yield thus as our understanding of how climate change affects rainfall variability and hence streamflow variability such climate change effects and uncertainty on reservoir yield can be explored meanwhile for further exploring the uncertainty in water yield changes with uncertain future climate conditions we demonstrated the results based on six gcms and two rcps for a total of 12 future climate realizations note that we acknowledge that there is bias between observed historical data and gcm historical data however we did not implement a bias correction to make the historical gcm match the observed historical data as this was not necessary to demonstrate the utility of our modified gould dincer method we focus on the relative difference percentage change between a historic model run and future projection from the same model and the same rcp scenario under the assumption that any bias is stationarity for each gcm we acknowledge that the climate elasticity of runoff and the assumption that bias is stationarity on historical and future scenarios for each gcm may be contested future research needs to explore if bias related to gcm variables e g precipitation and pet remain similar during the different periods also future work should take bias correction into account before applying gcm data which makes the precipitation and pet of the gcm more realistic the modified method could be helpful to estimate the level of current and future water stress at a continental or national scale which could contribute toward indicator 6 4 2 of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations un at the continental or global scale to determine the level of water stress due to large reservoirs 6 4 limitations we tested the power function model equation 12 of environmental water requirements using ten river sites further testing was not possible due to a lack of specific detailed environmental flow requirements we acknowledge that this is a first feasibility test and hope that future studies will take advantage of new data or data from other regions to allow the assumptions and fitted parameters to be tested further than was possible in this initial study we also acknowledge that thorough sensitivity analyses should be demonstrated in the future meanwhile for simplicity we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by assuming a hypothetical carry over reservoir based on the continental hydrology in australia and us we acknowledge that this is a limitation and our next step is to apply our method to the global river network with real carry over reservoirs to do a more comprehensive analysis taking the impact of reservoir capacities and non stationary hydrology into account moreover due to the availability of the latest cmip 6 dataset we recommend using cmip6 data for future studies the modified gould dincer method has some other limitations firstly the limitations of the original gould dincer method still apply to the modified gould dincer method the gould dincer method assumes the annual inflow series is independent however the presence of auto correlated annual inflows can impact the performance of the gould dincer method mcmahon et al 2007b equation 8 provide a correction for lag one serial correlation that can be used if required though the impact of long term climate variability has not yet been investigated moreover annual flow distributions rarely follow theoretical distributions perfectly although we have attempted to allow for a variety of flow conditions via multiple variants normal distribution lognormal distribution gamma distribution assuming any one of these distributions will commonly induce error which will be larger or smaller depending on the case study meanwhile the original gould dincer method assumed the reservoir does not spill during the critical draw down period however in reality the reservoir could spill under different operating rules and policies in addition this method can only be used for a system with a single carryover storage however in reality multiple reservoirs are often built to maximize water for human use our further research aims to extend the gould dincer method for application to systems with multiple carryover reservoirs 7 conclusion by representing the multi year cumulative environmental flow and modifying the well known gould dincer method this paper provides a relatively simple method to assess yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated systems especially on a larger scale under a changing climate firstly we evaluate the method using ten global examples with specific environmental water requirements and a range of annual flow c v s in general our assumed function form power function to represent cumulative environmental water requirements performs well these positive results suggest the method might be a promising rapid assessment tool we applied the method to assess reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in australia and us under changing climate on average the provision of environmental water leads to about a 15 and 13 decrease in yield for human use for australia and us respectively both environmental water provision and climate change cause about a 24 and 27 decline in australia under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively which also cause about a 17 and 18 decline in the us under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively if future environmental water demand might change with the change in future hydrology our results suggest that the adjusted environmental water allows about a 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively compared with

2268,protecting freshwater systems to ensure sustainability requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales from local to global there is growing acceptance that environmental flows must be protected to sustain river channels and floodplain ecosystems downstream of reservoirs meeting environmental water requirements has proven difficult because they reduce water yield available for human use a particular challenge in regions already experiencing declining water availability with climate change a further challenge is the difficulty of assessing the impact of environmental water requirements on water availability for other purposes this paper provides a modification of the gould dincer method to assess the yield of carry over reservoirs subject to environmental water requirements the method characterizes reservoir inflows using readily available flow characteristics annual mean and c v we develop and test the method using ten examples with well understood environmental water requirements and a range of annual flow c v s we then demonstrate this method at continental scale to investigate the impact on yield of providing high reliability supply including environmental water requirements under a changing climate according to our results considering climate change and environmental flow provision simultaneously the decline in water yield is projected to be about 27 and 18 respectively for australia and us based on hypothetical reservoirs capacity of one times mean annual inflow adapting environmental flow demands to future hydrological conditions results in a 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively while further testing is needed the method provides a simple and rapid way to estimate the impact of providing environmental flow on yield applicable at global scale keywords gould dincer method environmental flow yield for human use climate change data availability the specific environmental water

projects esgf llnl 1 introduction freshwater resources are widely regarded as the most essential of natural resources which are suffering from severe water scarcity problems where water demand exceeds water availability for human use schewe et al 2014 liu et al 2021 demonstrated that 28 60 of the global human population is currently suffering from severe water scarcity especially in china and india this challenge could exacerbate further in the future due to increasing water demands meybeck 2003 vörösmarty et al 2010 mehran et al 2017 in addition to human water demands changing climate projects an extra threat to water scarcity because changes in climatic variables e g precipitation and temperature may modify inflow characteristics which further lead to less water availability herman et al 2020 kaur et al 2019 mehran et al 2017 sabzi et al 2019 sivakumar 2011 for example pokhrel et al 2021 argued that climate change reduces water availability in many regions of the world especially those in the southern hemisphere thus identifying current and future water scarcity threats and regions on a range of spatial scales from the local to the global is significant and necessary to ensure water sustainability vörösmarty et al 2010 for relieving water scarcity reservoirs are built to extract water for human use with additional multiple functions such as flood control hydropower generation fishing and tourism these benefits improve human health expand food production and support economic growth lehner et al 2011 for instance in 2018 hydropower generated about 4 200 terawatt hours twh of electricity globally which was the highest contribution from a renewable energy source icold 2019 iha 2019 however reservoirs and associated river regulation also modify downstream flow regimes often reducing streamflow magnitudes variability and seasonality these flow alterations can have serious consequences for riverine ecosystems to alleviate these consequences ecologists and water resource planners are increasingly concerned with implementing environmental flows to sustain a healthy downstream river ecosystem dyson et al 2003 horne et al 2017a stewardson guarino 2018 however the provision of environmental flows means there is less water available for human use the environmental water requirements may cause a large restriction on the water for human use wada et al 2016 to assess the water conflict between human and environmental use methods are needed which can evaluate the impact of the provision of environmental water on yield for other human purposes e g irrigation urban supply particularly for large scale assessments pastor et al 2014 most studies investigating the behavior of regulated river systems e g interaction between water availability for human and environmental use rely on a hydrological simulation model to simulate reservoir inflows under specific scenarios vogel et al 2007 john et al 2021 such models may be paired with river operations simulation to account for the reservoir water balance and the delivery of water to meet both human and in some cases environmental water requirements kirby et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are also many methods to relate flow regime changes to ecological outcomes tharme 2003 such as indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1997 ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 the conditional probability network cpn horne et al 2017a horne et al 2017b horne et al 2018 wang et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and eco engineering decision scaling eeds poff et al 2016 these existing flow assessment methods can be used to assess flow alteration and may contribute toward building the model to estimate environmental water requirements however these models are often used in specific single river systems john et al 2021 wang et al 2018 the analysis of water yields from reservoirs subject to environmental water requirements based on these simulation models is demanding in terms of data and computations one potential challenge is to obtain related high quantity and quality data for simulation and calibration two types of data are necessary for these models including reservoir operation data and environmental water requirements however it is hard to collect the reservoir operation data from the reservoir management and companies if there is no direct collaboration with these entities meanwhile the understanding of environmental water requirements is complicated requiring close collaboration with biologists and ecologists the complexity of these data means that they are only available when sufficient resources are available to finance furthermore this modeling requires the simulation of millions of scenarios of which the runtimes are extremely long their computational requirements can pose other challenges to efficiently exploring sources of uncertainty e g climate uncertainty john et al 2021 while these simulation models are undoubtedly critical for the analysis of individual regulated water systems where resources and data are available they may be not suitable for continental or global scale analysis revealing simple relationships to gain insight into the effects of key drivers on water allocations including climate and water policy settings to provide a simpler and less data demanding approach we modify the relatively simple gould dincer reservoir yield assessment method for carry over reservoir gould 1964 mcmahon 1976 mcmahon adeloye 2005 mcmahon et al 2007a to provide an assessment of the reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements the gould dincer method has been a powerful rapid assessment tool for estimating the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship for a single storage carry over water resource system mcmahon et al 2011 peel et al 2015 petheram et al 2017 ren et al 2022 xie et al 2013 for example xie et al 2013 applied the gould dincer method to estimate hydropower generation benefits and related them to reservoir capacity and reliability petheram et al 2017 developed a method for identifying dam wall locations and water yield over a large area by taking the gould dincer method into account a feature of the gould dincer method is that water yield for human use is assumed to be constant from year to year however we know that some water uses like environmental flows do not have constant annual requirements this is because environmental flows with different magnitudes are required with different annual return intervals to mimic natural variations in flow grafton et al 2011 chu et al 2018 this is a major shortcoming given the growing focus on providing environmental water particularly downstream of large carry over reservoirs if this shortcoming can be overcome the gould dincer method could be used as an alternate tool to examine the interaction between water yield for human and environmental use especially on a larger scale in a situation where more detailed simulation modeling approaches are not feasible or suited therefore this study seeks to modify the gould dincer method to estimate the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship for a mixture of two types of use of the yield a constant water yield for human uses note that our study focuses on water yield which represents the amount of released water from the carryover reservoir for allocation rather than water demand which represents the amount of water required by humans and a variable component i e changes from year to year related to environmental water requirements this modification allows investigation of the impact of supplying environmental flows on the constant yield available for other uses under current and future conditions from a given reservoir for given reliability of supply the novelty of this method is that it provides a rapid way for large scale i e global scale analysis of sustainable water yield considering environmental water perspectives and climate change effects simultaneously which we demonstrate through implementing this method across australia and the united states of america us the simplicity of the modified method and data requirements facilitate the rapid assessment of the impact of providing environmental water on the yield from water resource systems especially at larger scales while this method is not intended to supplant existing detailed methods it may usefully complement them providing an initial assessment for a given system or over a wider region wherever streamflow data are available in the next section we review the original gould dincer method and develop the modified gould dincer method in addition we introduce the method and data for testing the method against environmental flow case studies and an application across australia and us to analyze the impact of providing environmental water on yield for human use under a changing climate 2 methods 2 1 gould dincer method review the gould dincer method models the relation between reservoir storage capacity yield and reliability for a single carry over reservoir carry over reservoirs use part of the water stored in one year over subsequent years for preliminary design purposes gould 1964 mcmahon et al 2007a the original method assumes that annual reservoir inflows are normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ and serially independent i e there is independence between any pair of sequential annual inflows mcmahon 1976 according to the properties of the normal distribution the cumulative inflow in consecutive n years has a mean and standard deviation of nμ and σ n respectively during a critical draw down period n the period for the reservoir to go from full to empty the gould dincer method considers single storage with volume s which is subject to a cumulative n year yield or draft d n and a cumulative n year inflow i n with a probability of non exceedance of p in the original method d n represents yield available for human use following mcmahon et al 2007a the reservoir storage volume s can be calculated as follows 1 s d n i n similar to many reservoir planning studies related to the reservoir capacity yield reliability relationship adeloye et al 2003 phien 1993 vogel stedinger 1995 mcmahon et al 2007a represent annual water yield as a constant from year to year thus the cumulative n year yield or draft d n can be estimated 2 d n α n μ where α 0 α 1 denotes the portion of the expected value known as the regulation level phien 1993 the full regulation is obtained with α 1 i e yield equals the mean flow meanwhile annual inflow follows the normal distribution thus 3 i n n μ z p σ n where z p is the standardized normal variate at 1 p reliability in this case reliability means the proportion of years in which the stated demand yield for water is met from equations 1 2 and 3 4 s α n μ n μ z p σ n assuming known values of μ and σ this equation provides the storage s required to supply the stated yield for the desired reliability z p for different run lengths of n as mentioned the final value of n corresponds to the draw down period which means the run length over which the required value of s to meet the desired yield is at a maximum to find the maximum we differentiate equation 4 with respect to n which gives 5 ds dn α μ μ z p σ 2 n 0 then the draw down period n and corresponding maximum required storage capacity s can be calculated as follows 6 n z p 2 4 1 α 2 c v 2 7 s z p 2 4 1 α c v 2 μ where c v is the coefficient of variation of annual inflows c v σ μ put simply the critical draw down period n or storage capacity s of a reservoir can be estimated from the annual inflow c v yield α and desired reliability z p of supply by using equations 6 and 7 note that actual annual flows can be autocorrelated and equation 7 can be corrected to take autocorrelation into account phatarfod 1986 vogel mcmahon 1996 however a parameter sensitivity analysis of the original gould dincer method shows that yield is not sensitive to autocorrelation mcmahon et al 2007a thus we do not consider it in our research analytical solutions are also available in the case where annual inflows are gamma or lognormal distributed gould 1964 extended the method to the case where annual inflow was gamma distributed referred to as the gould gamma method mcmahon adeloye 2005 where z p in equation 3 is substituted by g p where 8 g p 2 γ 1 γ 6 z p γ 6 3 1 γ 2 c v alternatively lognormally distributed flows can be accommodated mcmahon et al 2007a by substituting z p for l p where 9 l p 1 c v e z p ln 1 c v 2 0 5 ln 1 c v 2 1 an important limitation of the gould dincer method is that it does not explicitly consider net evaporation losses and it is only applicable for carry over reservoirs mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2007a proposed the use of the criteria m 1 α c v to define carry over reservoir reservoirs with m 1 operate as carry over reservoirs and m 1 operate as within year reservoirs vogel and bolognese 1995 vogel et al 1997 2 2 model to represent multi year cumulative environmental flow requirements in general environmental flows with different magnitudes are required with different annual return intervals to mimic natural variations in flow grafton et al 2011 chu et al 2018 lower magnitude flows are needed to be released more frequently but larger magnitude flows are needed to be released less frequently reflecting the natural relation between frequency and magnitude of streamflows in rivers poff et al 1997 this inter annual variation in environmental flows violates the gould dincer method assumption of uniform yield this paper provides a modification of the gould dincer method to account for annually varying environmental water demands in section 2 3 to develop this modification we first model the volume of annually varying environmental flows for an n year reservoir draw down period c f equation 2 for a constant yield for this model we consider a common situation where environmental flows are released with low intensities to large intensities to inundate different riverine habitats for example a river may have three environmental flow components a minimum flow a high in channel flow event to inundate the riverbank and an overbank flow to fill floodplain wetlands a minimum environmental flow may be required every year augmented with a high in channel flow possibly every second year in addition to an overbank flow that is likely required with a longer return interval after releasing such environmental flow demands cumulative environmental flow releases from a single reservoir are required to meet environmental water requirements e w r n over an n year period are modeled as 10 e w r n β μ n d where β is a parameter to reflect the minimum environmental flow required every year as a proportion of μ which is the mean annual streamflow and d d 1 is a parameter to reflect the non linearity of accumulation of required environmental flows with increasing period duration higher values of d indicate that the cumulative demands increase more steeply as longer periods are considered further we suggest an intrinsic relation between d and the flow variability of a system we propose that a more variable system with greater contrast between high flow years and low flow years will have a greater value of d this is because environmental water demands generally mimic natural flow variability and hence multi year recurrent interval requirements will be greater relative to minimum flows and cumulative volumes will increase more steeply as longer periods are considered thus we model a linear relationship between the d and interannual flow variability c v 11 d u c v p where u and p are two parameters if only a constant minimum annual environmental flow is considered u will be 0 and p will be 1 but if there is any variability in environmental flows between years then higher environmental water requirements are also considered and u will increase u 0 furthermore p is not a free parameter but logically should have a value of 1 according to the following reasoning in the limiting hypothetical case of zero c v the environmental flow releases required to mimic the flow regime would be constant from year to year and to achieve this in equation 10 requires p to have a value of 1 thus the cumulative environmental water requirements can be estimated by the following equation 12 e w r n β μ n u c v 1 in this equation ewr n is a power function of n when β u and c v increase ewr n exhibits exponential growth as n increases which is applied to represent cumulative environmental water requirements during a reservoir multi year draw down period in this study we test the applicability of this power function quation 10 by comparing it with an alternate exponential model and also test our linear model for d equation 11 using observations in a wide range of rivers 2 3 modified gould dincer method this study modifies the gould dincer method to consider a mixture of two types of use of the yield a constant annual yield for non environmental uses and a variable annual yield related to environmental water requirements as discussed in section 2 2 environmental flows are typically not constant annually which introduces interannual variations in the yield required to meet these environmental water requirements the existing gould dincer method considers only a constant annual yield available for human use although the yield may not be supplied with perfect reliability the yield desired volume stays constant from year to year in contrast when extending the method to also include yield associated with environmental water requirements the modified method must allow for environmental flows that are often not constant from year to year if we define the d n term in the gould dincer method to include yield components for human use related to α h and environmental flow related to β and u then we can combine equation 12 with the gould dincer method equation 4 to get the following equation 13 s α h n μ β μ n u c v 1 n μ z p σ n note we have used the notation α h to represent the yield available for human use and not used for providing environmental water requirements in the limiting case of zero environmental flows β will be zero and α h is then the same as α from the original gould dincer method differentiating equation 13 with respect to variable n gives equation 14 14 ds dn α h μ u c v 1 β μ n u c v μ z p σ 2 n 0 meanwhile because σ c v μ 15 α h u c v 1 β n u c v 1 z p c v 2 n 0 for a regulated river with a known or assumed storage capacity and known or assumed environmental flow requirements the reservoir yield α h subject to also providing environmental water can be assessed by equations 13 and 15 if the annual inflow is gamma or lognormal distributed z p in the above equations can be substituted by g p equation 8 or l p equation 9 respectively 3 model evaluation we consider 10 river sites across the world fig 1 to evaluate the modified gould dincer method especially for equation 12 in representing historic environmental water requirements with reference to historic environmental releases these rivers span a broad range of both c v and mean µ annual streamflows table 1 mcmahon et al 2007c summarized streamflow characteristics of 1221 global rivers which exhibited a range of annual c v between 0 1 and 1 annual c v of the 10 river sites vary from 0 14 to 1 36 which demonstrates that they sample the global c v range well meanwhile we introduce the catchment size and storage of each site in table 1 noted that usumacinta river little shasta river des moines river and clear fork brazos river do not contain a carry over reservoir table 1 for other characteristics of evaluation sites e g topography geology hydro meteorological information please refer to the documents which are mentioned in the data availability statement section firstly we need to convert annual environmental water requirements with different return intervals into cumulative environmental water requirements over an n year draw down period fig 1 for our proposes we assume a volume of water is released each year during a critical reservoir draw down period hence if the environmental water requirement includes a volume of water to be delivered every i years i represents the return interval we assume this is provided in the ith year of the reservoir draw down period we add the specific annual environmental water requirements with different return intervals bar graph in fig 1 to the minimum annual environmental flow to estimate the cumulative environmental water requirements scatter plot in fig 1 for example if the annual environmental flow is 100 ml but once every three years there must be an environmental flow of 300 ml then a cumulative environmental flow for an n year series where n 4 would be 100 100 300 100 600 ml in the third year the 300 ml flow includes the annual flow of 100 ml so the 100 ml annual requirement must not be double counted in the third year for each of the rivers we estimate the cumulative environmental water requirements during the draw down period using equation 10 fitted by log log regression power function between the cumulative environmental water requirements and the draw down period n in other words the parameters β and d for each river can be determined by regression using specific annual environmental water requirements then we demonstrate the relationship between c v and d to determine the parameter u by linear regression the constant annual yield for human use without considering environmental flow could be determined firstly by using the original gould dincer equations 6 and 7 with known β and u we can estimate the constant annual yield for human use considering environmental flow using equations 13 for a regulated system with carry over reservoir capacity s because usumacinta river little shasta river des moines river and clear fork brazos river do not contain a carry over reservoir table 1 we evaluate the impact of environmental flow on yield from carry over reservoirs only for the other six rivers to achieve that we assume that constant annual yield for human use and yield for environmental flows are met with a reliability of 95 z p 1 645 annual inflows approximately follow a gamma distribution so z p is substituted by g p using equation 8 the coefficient of determination r2 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the fitted trendline and the specific cumulative environmental water requirements note that sometimes when storage capacity is extremely large e g s 2μ the critical draw down period n may be very large however here we limit the period of the multi year cumulative environmental water requirements to ten years or less which is consistent with the specific environmental water requirements reported as listed in the data availability statement section finally parameter sensitivity is analyzed via a sensitivity analysis by considering the effect of a change 10 in the parameters c v u β and s on equation 13 to explore the importance of our parameters u and β to the overall results 4 application we demonstrate the utility of the modified gould dincer method for wide spatial application by examining australia and us wide yield impacts with the provision of environmental flow under changing climate this is possible because the majority of the inputs to the method can be derived in a continuous manner across space by starting with spatially continuous climate inputs and using prediction equations to estimate the relevant streamflow statistics as shown in fig 2 firstly to facilitate continuous assessment across space we use concepts of climate elasticities of runoff developed by mcmahon et al 2011 to estimate the hydrological statistics required by the method namely mean mar standard deviation sdr and coefficient of variation c v of annual runoff for a given climatic regime as follows 16 m a r m a p e ϕ 17 s d r 1 ϕ e ϕ s d p 18 c v s d r m a r where map is the mean annual precipitation ϕ m a p e t m a p and mapet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration sdr is the standard deviation of annual runoff and sdp is the standard deviation of annual precipitation the above equations are used in both the historic case and also future scenarios under climate change we source the input variables for these equations from global climate model gcm knutti et al 2013 simulations for the historical period 2006 2020 and future period 2036 2055 table 2 mean annual potential evapotranspiration mapet is calculated using the morton method morton 1983 for the purposes of this demonstration we do not consider land use change and any resultant impact on runoff statistics but rather assume the land use is the same as historical conditions when using equations 16 18 also we assume that the catchment response to rainfall is stationary under climate change and we do not apply any bias correction to the gcm projections as we are interested in showing the relative differences between future and current conditions rather than the absolute values that would require bias correction we also assume that the annual inflows are gamma distributed in this analysis and do not change distribution between current and future periods in order to apply this australia and us wide firstly we divided australia and us into 1321 and 1432 grids with 0 8 x 0 8 size to enable the pattern and distribution of variables to be considered for each grid it is necessary to make some assumptions regarding hypothetical reservoir properties and assumed reliability of supply for the purpose of this study we model a hypothetical reservoir storage capacity that is 1 times the mar mean annual inflow which is chosen based on typical storage volumes of global reservoirs mcmahon et al 2007b we acknowledge that some carry over reservoirs can be larger with volumes up to 2 times mar in a few cases in australia and us also we assume z p 1 645 95 reliability ideally the u value of the modified gould dincer method would be informed by local specific environmental water requirements e g 10 rivers in the above section but these are unavailable at a continental scale so an assumed value is applied based on the slope of the linear regression line for the relationship between parameter d and c v fig 4 in the results section we use the same u value of 0 41 for evaluation whilst this is a pragmatic solution for our cases study more local examples would need to be considered to develop a general model for u after determining storage we calculate α h the maximum yield as a ratio of mar by first applying the original gould dincer method assuming the reliability of 95 i e with no environmental water or β 0 we then compare this with the yield if environmental flows are provided and modeled using the modified gould dincer method initially we intended to set the minimum annual environmental flow as a proportion of mar at 0 1 typical of values achieved worldwide acreman et al 2014 king et al 2000 smakhtin et al 2006 see also tennant 1976 for estimating minimum flows in 11 streams of the western us however minimum environmental flow β for some areas cannot reach 0 1 even when all water resource is used for environmental demand because of highly non linear flow regimes particularly in arid areas thus we set β min β 0 1 i e where an initial estimate is determined using equation 19 a variant of equation 15 and then limited to 0 1 if necessary β can be estimated by equation 19 for a given c v u reliability z p α h α h 0 because we try to maximize β and all water resource is used for environmental flow and n 19 β z p c v 2 1 α h n 2 u c v 1 n u c v 0 5 the effect of environmental flow provision and the effect of climate change are each considered separately and also in combination providing three alternate scenarios fig 2 in the case of considering climate change alone we chose not to compare historically observed streamflow directly with future simulated projections because differences may be due to model errors rather than the simulated impact of climate change thus for six gcms we also include climate simulations from the historic period there are two conditions we use when estimating environmental flow for a future scenario which we term historical hydrology and future hydrology historical hydrology means we use the environmental water requirements that are estimated under historical conditions in contrast future hydrology means the environmental water requirement is adjusted to reflect the future hydrological conditions e g future mean and c v poff 2018 using equation 12 if future environmental water requirements remain the same as the historic ones our historical hydrology results would apply however the future environmental water requirements might change in response to change in river channels horne et al 2017c human assisted spread of nonnative species olden et al 2004 and species range changes in response to climate change rahel and olden 2008 the river related species could adapt to future conditions horne et al 2017c thus it is important and necessary to pay attention to dynamic hydrologic processes i e future hydrology scenarios that are related to dynamic ecological representations as a result there are two scenarios when evaluating both environmental water and climate change effects fig 2 5 results 5 1 model evaluation 5 1 1 evaluation of model that represents the multi year cumulative environmental flow in general the fitted trendline of the power function fits well with the specific cumulative environmental water requirements red lines of fig 3 attaining r2 values of 0 97 or greater compared with the exponential function blue lines of fig 3 the power function can attain larger r2 values for all 10 global rivers thus the assumption of equation 10 power function is adopted table 3 shows the values of the key parameters the r2 values indicate a good fit 0 94 in all ten cases results show that d increases with increasing flow variability c v across the 10 sites table 3 fig 4 shows the fitted relationship between d 1 and c v by linear regression for the 10 global river sites the slope of which is the parameter u in equation 11 with a fitted u value of 0 41 the trendline r2 is 0 93 which means that there is a strong relationship between d and the flow variability c v and the assumption of an intrinsic relation between d and the flow variability c v is reasonable at least for these 10 sites furthermore testing the method equation 12 on other case study sites with a range of c v values is important because it may show that this new method can be applied across a broader set of catchments with different flow conditions specifically with a broad range of c v 5 1 2 the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use α h for specific river sites in the six regulated river systems of the ten global river sites storage capacity s and environmental water requirements are known table 3 shows the yield for human use α h for both the case where environmental flows are implemented and the simpler case where only yield for human use is considered the difference between the two cases is as follows implementing environmental flows causes the yield for human use expressed as a proportion of mar to reduce from 0 97 to 0 72 for the goulburn river from 0 75 to 0 42 for the murrumbidgee river from 0 82 to 0 55 for the macquarie river from 0 64 to 0 19 for the big cypress creek from 0 91 to 0 58 for the bill williams river and from 0 77 to 0 29 for the clear fork brazos river 5 1 3 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis results table 4 indicate that yield is most sensitive to c v thus the proposed methodology is suitable for climate change impact assessments of reservoir yield as it is more sensitive to changes in hydroclimatic variability than the assumption in equation 11 in the next section we provide a potential application of this methodology which is to assess reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated carry over systems at the continental scale under changing climate 5 2 application 5 2 1 the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use α h based on different climate projections in australia and us in this section we apply this method for continental scale analysis especially under a changing climate firstly we estimate australia and us wide mean annual precipitation map figure s1 and s2 and mean annual potential evapotranspiration mapet figure s3 and s4 based on both historical and future periods for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios of six gcms then the flow statistics mar figures s5 and s6 and c v figures s7 and s8 are estimated using the empirical method of mcmahon et al 2011 see section 4 above it should be noted that the flow statistics presented in fig 5 are not based on the gcms runoff because prior studies report that biases in gcm precipitation can be amplified through the rainfall runoff process arora 2001 weiland et al 2012 mcmahon et al 2015 peel et al 2015 after estimating mar and c v yield is also estimated for the climate projections this is first done using the original gould dincer method i e equations 6 and 7 next the impact of environmental flow on yield for human use is also estimated using equations 13 the results fig 5 for australia and fig 6 for the us show that when storage capacity is equal to one times the mean annual inflow s 1 mar the provision of environmental flows decreases the yield for human use by between 15 and 50 for most of australia in both historical and future period under rcp4 5 and 8 5 based on six gcms except miroc shows fewer decreases in water yield fig 5 this represents a reduction of between 0 10 and 0 25 times mar for all models figure s9 compared with australia most of the us shows a slight decrease in the yield for human use by between 10 and 20 in both historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 based on six gcms fig 6 this represents a reduction of between 0 and 0 20 times mar for all models figure s10 5 2 2 the impact of climate change on yield for human use in this section we use six gcms for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and compare future runs to the historic run from the same model to explore the climate change effects on yield for human use in fig 7 for australia and 8 for the us where each black point represents the comparison between the median values of six gcms for a grid cell meanwhile we show the comparisons for each individual rcp and gcm combination by using colorful points note that there are five yield scenarios for each grid cell the first is displayed on the x axis of all four plots in figs 7 and 8 whereas the others are displayed one by one via the y axis values in each of the four plots the first value represents the yield estimate based on the gcm based historical scenario without considering environmental water requirements the second value represents the yield estimate based on the historical scenario considering environmental water requirements the third value represents the yield estimate based on the future scenario without considering environmental water requirements the fourth and fifth values represent the yield estimates based on the future scenario considering environmental water requirements based on future and historical hydrology respectively by comparing the first value with the second value the impact of providing environmental flows on yield is estimated fig 7a and 8a similarly by comparing the first value with the third value the impact of climate change on yield is estimated fig 7b and 8b finally both the impacts on water yield of climate change and providing environmental flow are estimated fig 7c fig 7d fig 8c and 8d on average climate change causes about 9 and 14 decrease in yield for human use in australia under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively and about 3 and 5 decrease in yield for human use in the us under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7b and 8b the spatial pattern of change in australia and us wide yield for human use caused by climate change is shown in the second column of fig 9 a and 9b respectively in general under rcp4 5 water yield for human use decreases by about up to 50 over southwest and northeast australia and increases by up to 50 over most parts of northern and southeastern australia however under rcp8 5 water yield for human use decreases by about 70 in most parts of australia fig 9a meanwhile it is clear that water yield for human use decreases by about up to 25 over most parts of the southern us but increases by about up to 15 over most parts of the northern us under rcp4 5 compared with the results of rcp4 5 rcp8 5 show that most parts of the us show a decline in yield of human use between 0 and 50 except for some regions of northern and middle us which show an increase between 10 and 25 fig 9b 5 2 3 combined effect of climate change and environmental water on yield for human use we consider the effect of climate change and environmental water independently and combined on yield for human use across australia and the us as expected there is a strong correlation between yield for human use of different scenarios on average the provision of environmental water leads to about a 15 decrease fig 7a and a 13 fig 8a decrease in yield for human use in australia and us respectively both climate change and environmental flow provision cause about a 24 and 27 decline in australia under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7d similarly both climate change and environmental flow provision cause about a 17 and 18 decline in the us under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8d the spatial pattern of change in yield for human use for these scenarios is shown in fig 9 implementing environmental flow causes a more consistent decline in yield for human use in australia and the us the third column of fig 9a and 9b both environmental flow and climate lead to a much greater reduction in yield for human use in australia than that in the us the fourth and fifth columns of fig 9a and 9b 5 2 4 adjusting environmental flow for future climate in the previous section we assume environmental water requirements are unchanged in the future relative to the historical scenario as a result environmental flow is estimated based on historical hydrology fig 7d and fig 8d the slope of the trend line for australia is about 0 76 and 0 73 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7d the slope of the trend line for the us is about 0 83 and 0 82 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8d if environmental flow demands are adjusted based on future hydrology fig 7c and fig 8c the slope of the trend line for australia is about 0 78 and 0 75 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7c the slope of the trend line for the us is about 0 87 and 0 85 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8c thus adapting environmental flow demands to the future hydrology results in a about 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively compared with environmental flow estimated based on historical hydrology fig 7c and fig 8c relative to fig 7d and fig 8d because the method implicitly assumes environmental flows should be consistent with future in this case drier flow regimes and thus require less water overall 6 discussion 6 1 representing multi year cumulative environmental water requirements our study represents multi year cumulative environmental water requirements using a power function related to the natural flow variability that can represent variability in annual environmental flow demands between years richter et al 2006 try to develop methods to define environmental flow requirements based on ecohydrological relationships but it is difficult to scale these methods for larger scale use e g continental scale global scale our method provides a possible way to extend ecohydrological relationships that are far from being linear pastor et al 2014 which makes it possible to evaluate environmental flow requirements at the global scale by comprehensively considering annual variability in environmental flow requirements this is a significant advance on other methods used for global water assessments related to environmental flow while some previous studies separate the minimum environmental flow and large multi year recurrence interval environmental flow requirements and evaluate their impact on global water resources respectively liu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 pastor et al 2014 vanham et al 2022 for example vanham et al 2022 demonstrated that implementing high environmental flow results in about 41 and 80 decreases in global annual renewable water availability implementing low environmental flow leads to different levels of water scarcity for currently 53 countries 6 2 possibilities for global implementation compared with alternatives our method does not attempt a detailed catchment and system specific analysis but it is useful for 1 preliminary planning assessment purposes for a specific site to estimate environmental flow effects on yield for human use 2 continental and global scale rough water yield estimates especially considering the climate change effects simultaneously 3 hydrological research where the system with carry over reservoirs is being investigated particularly our method could be applied quickly across a continent under both historical and future climate scenarios to estimate larger scale water availability including environmental flow requirements paired with its reliance on flow statistics that can be inferred from spatially continuous climatic data typically the effect of environmental flows on yield for human use for future scenarios uses a combination of river systems modeling ecological modeling and possibly input from global climate models kirby et al 2015 wang et al 2018 such modeling requires considerable site specific data and calibration ren et al 2018 which makes these methods difficult to apply quickly for multiple scenarios or over multiple sites for example when the effect of climate change and environmental flows on sustainable yields were analyzed for rivers across the murray darling basin representing just one seventh of australia four different kinds of simulation models were required climate modeling catchment water yield modeling river modeling and groundwater modeling and it took over 3 years and a very large team of over 200 scientists and technicians to complete csiro 2009 in contrast our simplified method only requires readily available local variables mean annual inflows and the coefficient of variation c v without the need for time consuming and data intensive modeling despite its simplicity the original gould dincer method has been widely applied mcmahon et al 2007a mcmahon et al 2011 peel et al 2015 petheram et al 2017 xie et al 2013 similarly our modified gould dincer method can be usefully applied for simplified modeling at a site recognizing the limitations of the method moreover as noted already by pairing with regional methods which can estimate these hydrological statistics based on climatic data useful estimates can be made even in the absence of streamflow gauging 6 3 water yield estimation under changing climate this paper focuses on overcoming the barrier to rapid assessment of the impact of supplying environmental flows on the yield available for other uses we demonstrate how the method can be applied to estimate reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated carry over systems at the continental scale under changing climate note that our focus is not on how to translate these results into planning recommendations in any case translating modeling results into planning recommendations is not straightforward and there is a lack of consensus in the literature as to how best to achieve it for example between top down the planning process is directly using gcm scenarios and bottom up scenario neutral looking at ranges of plausible future changes in key variables type approaches to climate risk assessments prudhomme et al 2010 however regardless of which approach is chosen our method may be a useful initial tool for prioritizing reservoirs for further detailed analysis of climate change risks and developing strategies to mitigate those risks the modified gould dincer method can also help support an analysis of the uncertainty in yield changes with uncertain climate futures using a parameter sensitivity analysis in our analysis section 5 1 3 yield was more sensitive to c v of annual streamflow compared with other parameters u β and s this is because c v not only affects the water yield estimates for human use but also impacts the cumulative environmental flow requirements equation 12 similarly storage capacity s is also sensitive to c v mcmahon et al 2007a which further impacts the yield thus as our understanding of how climate change affects rainfall variability and hence streamflow variability such climate change effects and uncertainty on reservoir yield can be explored meanwhile for further exploring the uncertainty in water yield changes with uncertain future climate conditions we demonstrated the results based on six gcms and two rcps for a total of 12 future climate realizations note that we acknowledge that there is bias between observed historical data and gcm historical data however we did not implement a bias correction to make the historical gcm match the observed historical data as this was not necessary to demonstrate the utility of our modified gould dincer method we focus on the relative difference percentage change between a historic model run and future projection from the same model and the same rcp scenario under the assumption that any bias is stationarity for each gcm we acknowledge that the climate elasticity of runoff and the assumption that bias is stationarity on historical and future scenarios for each gcm may be contested future research needs to explore if bias related to gcm variables e g precipitation and pet remain similar during the different periods also future work should take bias correction into account before applying gcm data which makes the precipitation and pet of the gcm more realistic the modified method could be helpful to estimate the level of current and future water stress at a continental or national scale which could contribute toward indicator 6 4 2 of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations un at the continental or global scale to determine the level of water stress due to large reservoirs 6 4 limitations we tested the power function model equation 12 of environmental water requirements using ten river sites further testing was not possible due to a lack of specific detailed environmental flow requirements we acknowledge that this is a first feasibility test and hope that future studies will take advantage of new data or data from other regions to allow the assumptions and fitted parameters to be tested further than was possible in this initial study we also acknowledge that thorough sensitivity analyses should be demonstrated in the future meanwhile for simplicity we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by assuming a hypothetical carry over reservoir based on the continental hydrology in australia and us we acknowledge that this is a limitation and our next step is to apply our method to the global river network with real carry over reservoirs to do a more comprehensive analysis taking the impact of reservoir capacities and non stationary hydrology into account moreover due to the availability of the latest cmip 6 dataset we recommend using cmip6 data for future studies the modified gould dincer method has some other limitations firstly the limitations of the original gould dincer method still apply to the modified gould dincer method the gould dincer method assumes the annual inflow series is independent however the presence of auto correlated annual inflows can impact the performance of the gould dincer method mcmahon et al 2007b equation 8 provide a correction for lag one serial correlation that can be used if required though the impact of long term climate variability has not yet been investigated moreover annual flow distributions rarely follow theoretical distributions perfectly although we have attempted to allow for a variety of flow conditions via multiple variants normal distribution lognormal distribution gamma distribution assuming any one of these distributions will commonly induce error which will be larger or smaller depending on the case study meanwhile the original gould dincer method assumed the reservoir does not spill during the critical draw down period however in reality the reservoir could spill under different operating rules and policies in addition this method can only be used for a system with a single carryover storage however in reality multiple reservoirs are often built to maximize water for human use our further research aims to extend the gould dincer method for application to systems with multiple carryover reservoirs 7 conclusion by representing the multi year cumulative environmental flow and modifying the well known gould dincer method this paper provides a relatively simple method to assess yield subject to environmental water requirements in regulated systems especially on a larger scale under a changing climate firstly we evaluate the method using ten global examples with specific environmental water requirements and a range of annual flow c v s in general our assumed function form power function to represent cumulative environmental water requirements performs well these positive results suggest the method might be a promising rapid assessment tool we applied the method to assess reservoir yield subject to environmental water requirements in australia and us under changing climate on average the provision of environmental water leads to about a 15 and 13 decrease in yield for human use for australia and us respectively both environmental water provision and climate change cause about a 24 and 27 decline in australia under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively which also cause about a 17 and 18 decline in the us under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively if future environmental water demand might change with the change in future hydrology our results suggest that the adjusted environmental water allows about a 2 and 3 increase in australia and us wide yield for human use respectively compared with

2269,the exploration of the sources and fate of nitrate in surface waters along with the evaluation of the implementation of environmental regulations is essential for preventing and remediating the serious problem of nitrate pollution however the nitrate sources and transformations in the yangtze river and its changes after strict environmental regulation remain unclear in this pursuit the present study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of the nitrate source and transformations in the yangtze river by determining the nitrate isotopic compositions δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and water chemistry during the wet and dry seasons furthermore the current measurements of the nitrate sources and transformations after the environmental regulations were compared to the historical records in 2006 the results showed that the no3 n concentration gradually increased along the river similar to that in 2006 however the spatial pattern of δ15n and δ18o of no3 values obviously changed after the environmental regulations it was found that the δ15n no3 values increased from the headwater to the lower stream which can be due to assimilation of phytoplankton the δ18o no3 values showed a gradual decrease in the headwater area an increase at the upper stream and stabilized in the middle and lower stream in addition the δ18o no3 value was significantly higher during the wet season than in the dry season p 0 05 however there was no significant seasonal difference in no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 value and nitrate source and transformations the results of source apportionment indicated that the dominated nitrate source changed from the manure and sewage to soil n after the implementation of the environmental regulations however the major nitrate transformations were not affected by the environmental regulations and nitrification was still prevalent in the yangtze river watershed the change of the dominated nitrate source validated the effectiveness of the environmental regulation however the increase in the nitrate concentration reflected the heavy inputs of residual nitrate from the watershed this study identified the nitrate sources and transformation processes and its changes after strict environmental regulations and provided significant information for adjusting and formulating new policies to further control the nitrate pollution keywords nitrate dual stable isotopes spatiotemporal pattern nitrate transformation yangtze river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river systems connect the land and ocean and play an essential role in the global nitrogen n cycle gruber and galloway 2008 over the past decades excessive n loading from fertilizer applications sewage discharge and manure runoff have induced widespread environmental problems in the rivers and estuaries galloway et al 2008 gruber and galloway 2008 rockstrom et al 2009 the current boom in the reservoir building alters the eco hydrological processes of the river systems and contributes to a higher n retention in the surface water akbarzadeh et al 2019 wu et al 2015 nitrate is the most thermodynamically stable and n dominant compound accumulated in the river systems and its enrichment poses a potential threat to drinking water supplies apart from promoting eutrophication conley et al 2009 thus controlling the nitrate pollution no3 n 10 mg l 1 world health organization has a great implication in improving the river ecosystem and human health kaushal et al 2011 rockstrom et al 2009 the effective way for mitigating the nitrate contamination in rivers is to quantitatively allocate the nitrate sources and then employ rational strategies xue et al 2009 dual isotope technique δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 is useful for the apportionment of nitrate sources in rivers hu et al 2019 kaushal et al 2011 li et al 2010 xue et al 2012 the isotopic characteristics of the different nitrate sources are different to a certain extent hence the nitrate sources of river water need to be identified by analyzing the nitrate isotopic compositions kendall et al 2007 xiong et al 2021 xue et al 2009 stable isotope mixing models siar is a useful approach used by many studies to further quantitatively estimate the contributions of different nitrate sources hu et al 2019 parnell et al 2010 in addition the nitrate isotopic compositions also provide a valuable information about the biogeochemical transformations of nitrate e g assimilation nitrification and denitrification which is vital for understanding the nitrate pollution hu et al 2019 li et al 2010 isotopic fractionations during biogeochemical transformations alter the δ15n and δ18o values of the original nitrate and thus there could be some uncertainties in the source appointments xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 even so the dual isotope method δ15n and δ18o of nitrate is still considered to be a reliable method for deciphering the sources and transformations of nitrate since the information for the original sources and biogeochemical processes remains unchanged kaushal et al 2011 matiatos et al 2021 meanwhile the other ancillary data e g land use pattern cl concentration δ18o h2o were also widely applied to reduce the uncertainties and verify the reliability of results hu et al 2019 xuan et al 2020 xue et al 2012 until now the dual isotope method has been successfully applied for groundwater fukada et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 small montane streams bourgeois et al 2018 city rivers xuan et al 2020 and large rivers li et al 2010 yue et al 2017 studying the source apportionment and biogeochemical processes of nitrate in large rivers is important to understand the regional global n budget and cycling dagg et al 2004 seitzinger et al 2002 the yangtze river yr is one of the world s largest rivers and discharges about 6 8 16 1 tg din yr 1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen which is mainly nitrate to the east china sea chen et al 2019 yan et al 2010 previous studies have used the dual isotope method to investigate the nitrate sources and transformations in the yr but were limited to its tributaries estuary and the three gorges reservoir tgr in the upper stream of yr liu et al 2020 yan et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 all these findings reported that the isotopic signature of no3 and its biogeochemical process in the yr were significantly influenced by seasonal changes because of difference in hydrological processes and microbial activity between the dry and wet season zhao et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 only one study was conducted at the watershed scale to reveal the spatial distribution of the nitrate sources and biogeochemical processes in the mainstream of the yr from the headwater to the estuary li et al 2010 a significant decrease of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the middle and lower yr stream were noted and n fertilizer and urban sewage effluent were found to be the major sources of nitrate as reported by li et al 2010 however the study was limited to the spatial pattern of the nitrate in the wet season but the information in the dry season was not clearly investigated for a better understanding of the source and transformation of nitrate over the past decade the chinese government has implemented a series of strategies and management practices by reducing application of n fertilizer improvement of sewage treatments and demolition of small reservoirs that had direct or indirect effects on the regional n loading cui et al 2021 huang et al 2021 consequently recent studies reported a significant decrease of n loading and improvement of the yr water quality cui et al 2021 huang et al 2021 however it is still unknown whether the sources and major transformation processes of nitrate have changed after the implementation of environmental protection policy in this study the seasonal and spatial variation of the nitrate concentration and isotopic data δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o along the yangtze river watershed were determined specifically our objectives were 1 to quantitively trace the source of nitrate during the wet and dry season along the yangtze river 2 to clarify the major process of biogeochemical transformations of nitrate in the river water 3 to determine whether the concentrations origin and transformation process of nitrate have changed during the past decade we hypothesized that 1 the nitrate concentration isotopic characteristics and its sources were different between the wet and dry season and along the river 2 the concentration isotopic characteristics sources and major transformation processes of nitrate also changed after the implementation of the environmental protection policy our study helps to understand the sources and biogeochemical transformation of nitrate under the watershed scale and effectively reduce nitrate accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river yr originates from the tanggula mountains in qinghai tibetan plateau and flows into the east china sea draining a basin area of 1 8 106 km2 the yr is the longest and most primary river in china including the eight major tributaries jinshajing river the upper mainstream of the yangtze river yalong river minjiang river jialingjiang river wujiang river hanjiang river donting lake and poyang lake fig 1 in this study based on channel characteristics and watershed topography the yr basin was divided into four sub basins the headwater area sites 1 10 upper stream sites 11 26 middle stream sites 27 32 and lower stream sites 33 40 fig 1 table s1 the headwater and upper stream had a high elevation gradient and high flow velocity and contained number of reservoirs including the famous three gorges reservoir tgr fig 1 the flow velocity decreased in the middle and lower streams while the water discharge remarkably increased especially in the middle stream xiong et al 2021 the yr basin dominantly has subtropical monsoon climate with cold dry winters and hot wet summers the mean annual precipitation for the whole catchment area is about 1045 mm that mainly occurs between may and september the landscape of the yr basin consists of 41 0 forest land 26 7 agricultural land 23 2 grassland 2 9 construction land and 3 1 unused land the land use pattern varies greatly among the different sub basins fig s1 the headwater area mainly consists of the forest and grassland and there is more agricultural land around the sichuan basin of the upper stream and the middle lower yangtze plains fig s1 the total amount of synthetic fertilizers applied periodically throughout the year in the agricultural regions approximated to 5 1 tg n in 2017 cui et al 2021 animal manure is also used on the agricultural land mainly in spring and autumn chen et al 2019 2 2 sampling and analyses the river water samples were collected from the mainstream of the yangtze river and its main tributaries during the wet and dry seasons jun july 2019 and november december 2019 a total of 80 surface river water samples 40 samples each in the wet and dry seasons 32 mainstream water samples and 8 tributary water samples were collected fig 1 table s1 the locations of the sampling sites during both wet and dry seasons were the same in addition 8 rain samples during the wet season were collected the location of the sampling sites is shown in fig 1 a portion of each river water sample 100 ml including the rain samples was filtered on site using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter paper and subjected to polyethylene bottles with airtight caps for detection of the nutrient concentration and nitrate isotope analysis all water samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 20 before analyzing field parameters for water samples including temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured in situ using a multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi professional plus 6600 v2 usa the concentrations of cl and no2 mg l 1 in the filtered samples were determined by ion chromatography thermo fisher ics 900 and the concentrations mg l 1 of no3 n and nh4 n were determined using a continuous flow analyzer system cfa systea analytical technology germany the δd and δ18o h2o values were analyzed by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo scientific milan italy and the data had been published in our previous study wang 2022 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 in brief the no2 and no3 in the sample were converted to n2o by the denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp aureofaciens atcc 13985 that lacks the n2o reductase activity then the n2o was extracted and purified using a trace gas preconcentrator unit isoprime ltd cheadle hulme cheadle uk and the isotope ratio values δ15n and δ18o were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv uk at institute of surface earth system science tianjin university the influence of no2 was negligible due to the no2 concentration was lower than 1 of no3 concentrations so the measured δ15n n2o or δ18o n2o represents the signature of δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 four international nitrates usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea no3 were used to calibrate the isotope values of the samples the analytical precision for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were 0 3 and 0 5 respectively stable isotope ratios are reported in delta δ notation as follows 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r 15n 14n or 18o 16o the δ15n and δ18o values are reported related to atmospheric n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively 2 3 estimation of nitrate source contributions with siar the contribution of different nitrate sources was evaluated using the bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar parnell et al 2010 application of nitrogenous fertilizer atmospheric n deposition and sewage industrial effluent discharge substantially affects the yr basin nitrate budget li et al 2010 therefore five potential nitrate sources soil precipitation no3 fertilizer nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage were considered in this study isotopic values of nitrate in precipitation were measured directly while the typical isotopic composition values for soil no3 fertilizer nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage were collected as per previous studies kendall et al 2007 xiong et al 2021 xue et al 2009 the typical isotopic composition values of the potential sources are summarized in table s2 more detailed information on the siar model is provided in the supplementary materials besides nitrate source apportionment in 2006 was also conducted based on the isotopic composition values of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 collected from li et al 2010 table s3 to assess whether there was a change in the nitrate source contributions in the area over the past decade 2 4 statistics and calculations one way anova with the post hoc test tukey hsd was used to test the differences in cl concentrations no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 between seasons and between sub basins including the mainstream and tributary paired t test was also applied to compare nitrate concentrations and isotopic composition between 2006 li et al 2010 and 2019 this study relationships between δ15n no3 value and no3 n concentration δ15n no3 value and δ18o no3 value as well as between no3 n concentration and cl concentrations were assessed using the pearson s correlation p 0 05 the above statistical analyses were performed using all of the samples including the mainstream and tributary samples distribution normality for the assessed parameters was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov normality test statistical analysis was performed using r software package version 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in the nitrate and physiochemical parameters the δ18o no3 values varied from 2 6 to 9 6 with a significantly higher average of 2 1 2 3 in the wet season and lower average of 0 5 1 9 in the dry season fig 3c d table 1 p 0 05 however the no3 n concentration and δ15n no3 value did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 except for that no3 n concentration in the lower stream was slightly higher in the dry season 1 6 0 5 mg l 1 than that in the wet season 1 1 0 4 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 2 table 1 the average water temperature in the wet season 24 7 5 7 was significantly higher than that in the dry season 13 3 4 2 p 0 05 however the do concentration was significantly lower in the wet season 7 5 1 0 mg l 1 than that in the dry season 9 5 0 8 mg l 1 p 0 05 table 1 3 2 spatial variations in the nitrate concentration and its comparison to the values in 2006 similarly to the year 2006 the no3 n concentration in 2019 was also increased from the headwater to the lower stream fig 2 table 1 li et al 2010 on comparison with the spatial pattern of δ15n and δ18o of no3 in the wet season of 2006 decreased from upstream to downstream li et al 2010 the δ15n no3 value in the wet season of 2019 slightly increased while the δ18o no3 value initially decreased then increased and finally stabilized along the river even though the spatial variations of δ18o no3 value were not significantly different at sub basin level fig 3 table 1 in addition there was no significant change in the δ15n no3 in the dry season except a little fluctuation in the upper reach sites 11 17 fig 3b table 1 compared with the other stream segments the water temperature in the headwater area was dramatically lower while the cl concentration was significantly higher table 1 3 3 correlation between the concentrations isotopes of nitrate and hydro chemical characteristics almost all samples collected during the wet and dry seasons were distributed near the theoretical line of nitrification fig 4 the composition of δd h2o and δ18o h2o in the wet and dry seasons generally lied on the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 5 a whose calculation was based on data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2006 revealing that precipitation was the major water source for the yr river meanwhile significant positive correlations between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were observed both in the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 fig 5b 3 4 apportionments of nitrate in the 2006 and 2019 at the source of yr the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the river water samples of 2019 and potential sources are shown in fig 6 all the samples lacked clear differences within season and sub basins fig 6 the results of most of the samples were within the soil n zone range and few samples were within the scope of nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage fig 6 results from the siar model revealed no noticeable spatial and seasonal variations in the nitrate source apportionment fig 7 soil n was the most significant contributor of nitrate especially in the headwater area and upper stream 40 4 44 1 but slightly lower in the middle and lower stream 32 5 36 2 nh4 fertilizer 19 0 27 5 and manure and sewage 16 7 29 6 exhibited a similar contribution proportion to the nitrate along the river however the nitrate loading from no3 fertilizer 8 0 14 0 and precipitation 1 8 4 8 were relatively low fig 7 the siar results showed that the main source of nitrate in 2006 was manure and sewage fig 8 and fig s8 the site level comparison indicated that the cl concentration δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in 2019 along the yr was significantly lower than that in the 2006 but the no3 n concentration in 2019 was slightly higher figs 2 and 3 table s3 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal and spatial patterns of nitrate and influencing factors similar with the data collected by li et al 2010 the no3 n concentration from the current study showed an increase from the headwater area toward downstream fig 2 this could be due to the continuous n inputs from the shore side towns cities and agricultural activities during the transport of the river water to the estuary table s4 kaushal et al 2011 the abundant anthropogenic n inputs e g especially sewage and manure also explained the increase of δ15n no3 in the wet season along the river fig 3a previous studies have suggested that land use management and human activities are the main cause of nitrate concentration enrichment and isotopic composition in river ecosystems kaushal et al 2011 xue et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 the close relationship between the δ15n no3 value and the land use pattern of the different tributaries partly confirmed this point fig s6 another and more possible explanation for the increasing δ15n no3 values could be the preferential absorption of the lighter 14n by phytoplankton leading to an enrichment by heavy 15n in the residual nitrate teranes and bernasconi 2000 zhang et al 2022 a recent study has reported the prevalence of assimilation of phytoplankton in the yr zhang et al 2022 however in the dry season the loading of anthropogenic n inputs was reduced as a result of the reduction of the flushing rates and the assimilation of phytoplankton was also limited by the low water temperature which could be the reason for the insignificant change of δ15n no3 along the river fig 3b and fig s6 table 1 in the headwater area the river water was partly fed by snowmelt δ18o no3 48 60 and expected to exhibit a higher δ18o no3 fig 3c d li et al 2020 xia et al 2019 however the δ18o no3 values within the headwater area gradually decreased possibly due to the continuous mixing of nitrate from soil fertilizer and manure lower δ18o no3 than snowmelt fig 3c d in addition the decrease in δ18o no3 could be also caused by the prevalent nitrification in the vegetation covered basin vitousek et al 1989 during the nitrification 2 3rd of the o atoms of the newly formed nitrate can be derived from h2o kendall and mcdonnell 2012 and thus the change in δ18o h2o partly determined the patterns of δ18o no3 for example both of the δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 decreased in the headwater area and gradually increased in the upper middle stream fig 3 and fig s3 furthermore the enrichment of δ18o h2o caused by the evaporated water in the wet season led to a significantly higher δ18o no3 value in the wet season than in the dry season fig 3 and fig s3 table 1 li et al 2010 found that the δ15n and δ18o of no3 values decreased from upstream to downstream with a distinct decreasing turnover point in the area of three gorges reservoir completed in may 2006 the remineralization of organic matter was considered as the major reason for the decreasing isotopic values of nitrate li et al 2010 in contrast to these results the effects of the reservoir construction on the nitrate isotopes composition were not observed in our study sites 23 26 fig 3 this might be because the signals of remineralization could be masked by the stronger dilution effects by multiple nitrate sources li et al 2019 4 2 investigating n cycling processes with stable isotopes it is necessary to study the n transformation since it substantially determines the reliability of nitrate source apportionments our results demonstrated that most of the measured δ18o no3 values for both wet and dry seasons were closely distributed to the theoretical line of nitrification fig 4 indicating a strong nitrification process the isotopic signals of nitrification were reported in the mainstream li et al 2010 and the tributaries of the yr li et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 however those results were contrary to our hypothesis that the major transformation processes of nitrate changed after the environmental regulation concentration of ammonium ions from the terrestrial soil sewage and fertilizers could be a substrate for nitrification and the high do concentrations in the yr 8 5 1 4 mg l 1 could also favor nitrification xuan et al 2020 xuan et al 2019 yue et al 2017 if that nitrate was mainly produced by microbial nitrification a significant relationship could be expected between the δ15n no3 values and no3 n concentrations however such a relationship was not found fig s4c indicating the presence of more than one biological process to be responsible for the pattern of δ15n and δ18o of nitrate observed in this study li et al 2013 ohte et al 2010 another possibility is that the dilution and mixing of nitrate from the upstream and its tributaries could weaken the relationship ogrinc et al 2008 yuan et al 2017 in addition three of the measured δ18o no3 samples in the wet season site 1 32 and 37 exceeded the theoretical value which could be attributed to the considerable no3 inputs from the snowmelt precipitation and no3 fertilizers a positive correlation was determined between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 signifying the assimilation or and denitrification processes fig 5b kendall et al 2007 the do concentration in the river water was 8 5 1 4 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than the suitable conditions to support denitrification 2 mg l 1 rivett et al 2008 hence the denitrification process in our river water samples was difficult to occur moreover the ratio of δ15n no3 to δ18o no3 was 1 37 in the wet season and 1 03 in the dry season respectively and both values were not within the theoretical range in the occurrence of denitrification 1 5 2 0 kendall et al 2007 in addition several studies documented that denitrification hardly occurred in surface waters especially in large rivers 5 km2 peterson et al 2001 xue et al 2012 hence the parallel increase in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 could have possibly resulted from the assimilation rather than denitrification during assimilation the lighter 14n was preferentially assimilated by the phytoplankton and therefore the δ15n values of the suspended particulate matter were less than or equal to the δ15n no3 values kendall et al 2007 the δ15n no3 values in the present study were higher but not significantly compared to the δ15n of the suspended particulate matter fig s7 supporting that the no3 uptake occurred during the phytoplankton assimilation zhang et al 2022 overall the nitrification and no3 assimilation could be the major processes in the yr watershed 4 3 source apportionment of nitrate and impact of environmental regulations the siar output revealed that the nitrate sources apportionments did not vary significantly among the seasons and sub basins fig 7 soil n was the dominant contributor of nitrate especially in the headwater area and upper stream which was in good agreement with the previous studies carried out in the lancang river near the headwater of yr guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 a fraction of soil organic n was nitrated in the riverbank which was transported to the river b the process of leaching and surface runoff xia et al 2018 another possibility is that the soil organic n could be transported directly into the river by soil erosion and the nitrification process occurs in the river water wang et al 2017 however the main nitrate source of yr in 2006 was manure and sewage li et al 2010 figs 8 and s8 the change in the dominated nitrate source after the implementation of the environmental regulations was also supported by the hydro chemical characteristics of river water samples chloride cl is typically derived from sewage and manure and its stable nature in surface water makes it a useful indicator of no3 sources koba et al 1997 in this study the weak correlation between cl and no3 concentration in the dry season and the negative correlation in the wet season confirmed that the sewage and manure was not the dominant source of nitrate fig s4a in addition the high cl concentrations and low no3 cl ratios of sites 1 2 3 5 and 7 were influenced by evaporate dissolution rather than the sewage and manure inputs fig s4b chetelat et al 2008 the results of current study validated the effectiveness of the chinese government s environmental protection policy such as construction of urban sewage treatment during the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 urban sewage treatment during the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 with a treatment rate reaching 85 and restoration of important rivers and lakes affected by the sewage outfall 2016 2020 however manure and sewage including the nh4 fertilizer still persisted to be the major no3 sources in the yr fig 7 which was consistent with the previous studies on the tgr zhao et al 2019 and tributaries of yr chen et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 nh4 fertilizers urea and ammonium salts are the main n containing fertilizers applied in the yr basin and rapid urbanization has also increased the discharge of manure and sewage especially in the middle and lower streams the low cl concentrations and high no3 cl ratios of sites 20 22 and 31 in the wet season indicated an increased amount of the agricultural input fig s4b anions such as so4 2 cl k and cations like na ca2 and mg2 were significantly related with each other fig s5 which also suggest that the chemical fertilizer sewage and manure enriched with these anions could be the potential source of these anions wang et al 2020 this also partly reflects the important role of chemical fertilizer sewage and manure in the no3 inputs however although the yr water is related to precipitation our results found that the atmospheric nitrate deposition was not a significant source of riverine nitrate and agreed with previous findings li et al 2010 yue et al 2017 although the nitrate source changed from the manure and sewage to soil n after the environmental regulations the no3 n concentration was increased instead of a decrease li et al 2010 table s3 p 0 01 it is likely that the lots of nitrate are more likely to come from the human activities in historical times basu et al 2022 niu et al 2022 to further control and repair the polluted surface water the environmental protection policies such as reducing the n fertilizer application improvement of sewage treatments should be continued to implement 4 4 uncertainty analysis numerous studies have used δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values and siar models to quantify the contributions of different sources in the surface water hu et al 2019 kaushal et al 2011 li et al 2010 xue et al 2012 however some uncertainties still need to be considered the first uncertainty is related to the isotopic signature of the potential nitrate sources dry season precipitation samples were not collected due to sampling restrictions which may cause some uncertainties the isotopic composition values of other nitrate sources were obtained from previous studies with relatively wide ranges leading to possible overlapping as a result this might not accurately apportion the contribution of different potential sources to the riverine nitrate for example in the present study it is difficult to clarify as to what degree the identified soil n source is natural or has a legacy source accumulation from earlier fertilizer manure and sewage leakages and discharges basu et al 2022 niu et al 2022 secondly unpredictable isotopic fractionations during biogeochemical transformations may induce an uncertainty kaushal et al 2011 kendall et al 2007 assimilation and nitrification were the major processes in the yangtze river and the co occurrence of nitrate production and consumption made the identification and quantification of nitrate sources more complicated given the above uncertainties results of the nitrate isotopic compositions and siar models were examined by the land use patterns hydro chemical characteristics e g cl concentration do and isotope of particulate matter hence the current study still provides some valuable insights in the management and pollution control of nitrogenous compounds in the yangtze river 5 conclusion the present study showed that the no3 and δ15n no3 concentration increased along the yr but there was no significant difference between the wet and dry season nitrification was identified as the major process and the strong positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggested the prevalence of assimilation there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of nitrate soil n was the main source of nitrate with a considerable contribution from nh4 fertilizer manure and sewage compared with that in 2006 the δ15n and δ18o of no3 values in this study were significantly decreased but the major process of nitrate transformation was not changed significantly although the no3 n concentration was still significantly increased after the implementation of environmental regulations the decreased contribution of manure and sewage suggest the effectiveness of the environmental policies we believe that these findings are important for prioritizing and adjusting the nitrate reduction strategy credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang methodology data curation writing original draft writing

2269,the exploration of the sources and fate of nitrate in surface waters along with the evaluation of the implementation of environmental regulations is essential for preventing and remediating the serious problem of nitrate pollution however the nitrate sources and transformations in the yangtze river and its changes after strict environmental regulation remain unclear in this pursuit the present study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of the nitrate source and transformations in the yangtze river by determining the nitrate isotopic compositions δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and water chemistry during the wet and dry seasons furthermore the current measurements of the nitrate sources and transformations after the environmental regulations were compared to the historical records in 2006 the results showed that the no3 n concentration gradually increased along the river similar to that in 2006 however the spatial pattern of δ15n and δ18o of no3 values obviously changed after the environmental regulations it was found that the δ15n no3 values increased from the headwater to the lower stream which can be due to assimilation of phytoplankton the δ18o no3 values showed a gradual decrease in the headwater area an increase at the upper stream and stabilized in the middle and lower stream in addition the δ18o no3 value was significantly higher during the wet season than in the dry season p 0 05 however there was no significant seasonal difference in no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 value and nitrate source and transformations the results of source apportionment indicated that the dominated nitrate source changed from the manure and sewage to soil n after the implementation of the environmental regulations however the major nitrate transformations were not affected by the environmental regulations and nitrification was still prevalent in the yangtze river watershed the change of the dominated nitrate source validated the effectiveness of the environmental regulation however the increase in the nitrate concentration reflected the heavy inputs of residual nitrate from the watershed this study identified the nitrate sources and transformation processes and its changes after strict environmental regulations and provided significant information for adjusting and formulating new policies to further control the nitrate pollution keywords nitrate dual stable

essential role in the global nitrogen n cycle gruber and galloway 2008 over the past decades excessive n loading from fertilizer applications sewage discharge and manure runoff have induced widespread environmental problems in the rivers and estuaries galloway et al 2008 gruber and galloway 2008 rockstrom et al 2009 the current boom in the reservoir building alters the eco hydrological processes of the river systems and contributes to a higher n retention in the surface water akbarzadeh et al 2019 wu et al 2015 nitrate is the most thermodynamically stable and n dominant compound accumulated in the river systems and its enrichment poses a potential threat to drinking water supplies apart from promoting eutrophication conley et al 2009 thus controlling the nitrate pollution no3 n 10 mg l 1 world health organization has a great implication in improving the river ecosystem and human health kaushal et al 2011 rockstrom et al 2009 the effective way for mitigating the nitrate contamination in rivers is to quantitatively allocate the nitrate sources and then employ rational strategies xue et al 2009 dual isotope technique δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 is useful for the apportionment of nitrate sources in rivers hu et al 2019 kaushal et al 2011 li et al 2010 xue et al 2012 the isotopic characteristics of the different nitrate sources are different to a certain extent hence the nitrate sources of river water need to be identified by analyzing the nitrate isotopic compositions kendall et al 2007 xiong et al 2021 xue et al 2009 stable isotope mixing models siar is a useful approach used by many studies to further quantitatively estimate the contributions of different nitrate sources hu et al 2019 parnell et al 2010 in addition the nitrate isotopic compositions also provide a valuable information about the biogeochemical transformations of nitrate e g assimilation nitrification and denitrification which is vital for understanding the nitrate pollution hu et al 2019 li et al 2010 isotopic fractionations during biogeochemical transformations alter the δ15n and δ18o values of the original nitrate and thus there could be some uncertainties in the source appointments xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 even so the dual isotope method δ15n and δ18o of nitrate is still considered to be a reliable method for deciphering the sources and transformations of nitrate since the information for the original sources and biogeochemical processes remains unchanged kaushal et al 2011 matiatos et al 2021 meanwhile the other ancillary data e g land use pattern cl concentration δ18o h2o were also widely applied to reduce the uncertainties and verify the reliability of results hu et al 2019 xuan et al 2020 xue et al 2012 until now the dual isotope method has been successfully applied for groundwater fukada et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 small montane streams bourgeois et al 2018 city rivers xuan et al 2020 and large rivers li et al 2010 yue et al 2017 studying the source apportionment and biogeochemical processes of nitrate in large rivers is important to understand the regional global n budget and cycling dagg et al 2004 seitzinger et al 2002 the yangtze river yr is one of the world s largest rivers and discharges about 6 8 16 1 tg din yr 1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen which is mainly nitrate to the east china sea chen et al 2019 yan et al 2010 previous studies have used the dual isotope method to investigate the nitrate sources and transformations in the yr but were limited to its tributaries estuary and the three gorges reservoir tgr in the upper stream of yr liu et al 2020 yan et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 all these findings reported that the isotopic signature of no3 and its biogeochemical process in the yr were significantly influenced by seasonal changes because of difference in hydrological processes and microbial activity between the dry and wet season zhao et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 only one study was conducted at the watershed scale to reveal the spatial distribution of the nitrate sources and biogeochemical processes in the mainstream of the yr from the headwater to the estuary li et al 2010 a significant decrease of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the middle and lower yr stream were noted and n fertilizer and urban sewage effluent were found to be the major sources of nitrate as reported by li et al 2010 however the study was limited to the spatial pattern of the nitrate in the wet season but the information in the dry season was not clearly investigated for a better understanding of the source and transformation of nitrate over the past decade the chinese government has implemented a series of strategies and management practices by reducing application of n fertilizer improvement of sewage treatments and demolition of small reservoirs that had direct or indirect effects on the regional n loading cui et al 2021 huang et al 2021 consequently recent studies reported a significant decrease of n loading and improvement of the yr water quality cui et al 2021 huang et al 2021 however it is still unknown whether the sources and major transformation processes of nitrate have changed after the implementation of environmental protection policy in this study the seasonal and spatial variation of the nitrate concentration and isotopic data δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o along the yangtze river watershed were determined specifically our objectives were 1 to quantitively trace the source of nitrate during the wet and dry season along the yangtze river 2 to clarify the major process of biogeochemical transformations of nitrate in the river water 3 to determine whether the concentrations origin and transformation process of nitrate have changed during the past decade we hypothesized that 1 the nitrate concentration isotopic characteristics and its sources were different between the wet and dry season and along the river 2 the concentration isotopic characteristics sources and major transformation processes of nitrate also changed after the implementation of the environmental protection policy our study helps to understand the sources and biogeochemical transformation of nitrate under the watershed scale and effectively reduce nitrate accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river yr originates from the tanggula mountains in qinghai tibetan plateau and flows into the east china sea draining a basin area of 1 8 106 km2 the yr is the longest and most primary river in china including the eight major tributaries jinshajing river the upper mainstream of the yangtze river yalong river minjiang river jialingjiang river wujiang river hanjiang river donting lake and poyang lake fig 1 in this study based on channel characteristics and watershed topography the yr basin was divided into four sub basins the headwater area sites 1 10 upper stream sites 11 26 middle stream sites 27 32 and lower stream sites 33 40 fig 1 table s1 the headwater and upper stream had a high elevation gradient and high flow velocity and contained number of reservoirs including the famous three gorges reservoir tgr fig 1 the flow velocity decreased in the middle and lower streams while the water discharge remarkably increased especially in the middle stream xiong et al 2021 the yr basin dominantly has subtropical monsoon climate with cold dry winters and hot wet summers the mean annual precipitation for the whole catchment area is about 1045 mm that mainly occurs between may and september the landscape of the yr basin consists of 41 0 forest land 26 7 agricultural land 23 2 grassland 2 9 construction land and 3 1 unused land the land use pattern varies greatly among the different sub basins fig s1 the headwater area mainly consists of the forest and grassland and there is more agricultural land around the sichuan basin of the upper stream and the middle lower yangtze plains fig s1 the total amount of synthetic fertilizers applied periodically throughout the year in the agricultural regions approximated to 5 1 tg n in 2017 cui et al 2021 animal manure is also used on the agricultural land mainly in spring and autumn chen et al 2019 2 2 sampling and analyses the river water samples were collected from the mainstream of the yangtze river and its main tributaries during the wet and dry seasons jun july 2019 and november december 2019 a total of 80 surface river water samples 40 samples each in the wet and dry seasons 32 mainstream water samples and 8 tributary water samples were collected fig 1 table s1 the locations of the sampling sites during both wet and dry seasons were the same in addition 8 rain samples during the wet season were collected the location of the sampling sites is shown in fig 1 a portion of each river water sample 100 ml including the rain samples was filtered on site using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter paper and subjected to polyethylene bottles with airtight caps for detection of the nutrient concentration and nitrate isotope analysis all water samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 20 before analyzing field parameters for water samples including temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured in situ using a multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi professional plus 6600 v2 usa the concentrations of cl and no2 mg l 1 in the filtered samples were determined by ion chromatography thermo fisher ics 900 and the concentrations mg l 1 of no3 n and nh4 n were determined using a continuous flow analyzer system cfa systea analytical technology germany the δd and δ18o h2o values were analyzed by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo scientific milan italy and the data had been published in our previous study wang 2022 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 in brief the no2 and no3 in the sample were converted to n2o by the denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp aureofaciens atcc 13985 that lacks the n2o reductase activity then the n2o was extracted and purified using a trace gas preconcentrator unit isoprime ltd cheadle hulme cheadle uk and the isotope ratio values δ15n and δ18o were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv uk at institute of surface earth system science tianjin university the influence of no2 was negligible due to the no2 concentration was lower than 1 of no3 concentrations so the measured δ15n n2o or δ18o n2o represents the signature of δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 four international nitrates usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea no3 were used to calibrate the isotope values of the samples the analytical precision for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were 0 3 and 0 5 respectively stable isotope ratios are reported in delta δ notation as follows 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r 15n 14n or 18o 16o the δ15n and δ18o values are reported related to atmospheric n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively 2 3 estimation of nitrate source contributions with siar the contribution of different nitrate sources was evaluated using the bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar parnell et al 2010 application of nitrogenous fertilizer atmospheric n deposition and sewage industrial effluent discharge substantially affects the yr basin nitrate budget li et al 2010 therefore five potential nitrate sources soil precipitation no3 fertilizer nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage were considered in this study isotopic values of nitrate in precipitation were measured directly while the typical isotopic composition values for soil no3 fertilizer nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage were collected as per previous studies kendall et al 2007 xiong et al 2021 xue et al 2009 the typical isotopic composition values of the potential sources are summarized in table s2 more detailed information on the siar model is provided in the supplementary materials besides nitrate source apportionment in 2006 was also conducted based on the isotopic composition values of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 collected from li et al 2010 table s3 to assess whether there was a change in the nitrate source contributions in the area over the past decade 2 4 statistics and calculations one way anova with the post hoc test tukey hsd was used to test the differences in cl concentrations no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 between seasons and between sub basins including the mainstream and tributary paired t test was also applied to compare nitrate concentrations and isotopic composition between 2006 li et al 2010 and 2019 this study relationships between δ15n no3 value and no3 n concentration δ15n no3 value and δ18o no3 value as well as between no3 n concentration and cl concentrations were assessed using the pearson s correlation p 0 05 the above statistical analyses were performed using all of the samples including the mainstream and tributary samples distribution normality for the assessed parameters was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov normality test statistical analysis was performed using r software package version 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations in the nitrate and physiochemical parameters the δ18o no3 values varied from 2 6 to 9 6 with a significantly higher average of 2 1 2 3 in the wet season and lower average of 0 5 1 9 in the dry season fig 3c d table 1 p 0 05 however the no3 n concentration and δ15n no3 value did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 except for that no3 n concentration in the lower stream was slightly higher in the dry season 1 6 0 5 mg l 1 than that in the wet season 1 1 0 4 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 2 table 1 the average water temperature in the wet season 24 7 5 7 was significantly higher than that in the dry season 13 3 4 2 p 0 05 however the do concentration was significantly lower in the wet season 7 5 1 0 mg l 1 than that in the dry season 9 5 0 8 mg l 1 p 0 05 table 1 3 2 spatial variations in the nitrate concentration and its comparison to the values in 2006 similarly to the year 2006 the no3 n concentration in 2019 was also increased from the headwater to the lower stream fig 2 table 1 li et al 2010 on comparison with the spatial pattern of δ15n and δ18o of no3 in the wet season of 2006 decreased from upstream to downstream li et al 2010 the δ15n no3 value in the wet season of 2019 slightly increased while the δ18o no3 value initially decreased then increased and finally stabilized along the river even though the spatial variations of δ18o no3 value were not significantly different at sub basin level fig 3 table 1 in addition there was no significant change in the δ15n no3 in the dry season except a little fluctuation in the upper reach sites 11 17 fig 3b table 1 compared with the other stream segments the water temperature in the headwater area was dramatically lower while the cl concentration was significantly higher table 1 3 3 correlation between the concentrations isotopes of nitrate and hydro chemical characteristics almost all samples collected during the wet and dry seasons were distributed near the theoretical line of nitrification fig 4 the composition of δd h2o and δ18o h2o in the wet and dry seasons generally lied on the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 5 a whose calculation was based on data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2006 revealing that precipitation was the major water source for the yr river meanwhile significant positive correlations between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were observed both in the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 fig 5b 3 4 apportionments of nitrate in the 2006 and 2019 at the source of yr the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the river water samples of 2019 and potential sources are shown in fig 6 all the samples lacked clear differences within season and sub basins fig 6 the results of most of the samples were within the soil n zone range and few samples were within the scope of nh4 fertilizer and manure and sewage fig 6 results from the siar model revealed no noticeable spatial and seasonal variations in the nitrate source apportionment fig 7 soil n was the most significant contributor of nitrate especially in the headwater area and upper stream 40 4 44 1 but slightly lower in the middle and lower stream 32 5 36 2 nh4 fertilizer 19 0 27 5 and manure and sewage 16 7 29 6 exhibited a similar contribution proportion to the nitrate along the river however the nitrate loading from no3 fertilizer 8 0 14 0 and precipitation 1 8 4 8 were relatively low fig 7 the siar results showed that the main source of nitrate in 2006 was manure and sewage fig 8 and fig s8 the site level comparison indicated that the cl concentration δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in 2019 along the yr was significantly lower than that in the 2006 but the no3 n concentration in 2019 was slightly higher figs 2 and 3 table s3 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal and spatial patterns of nitrate and influencing factors similar with the data collected by li et al 2010 the no3 n concentration from the current study showed an increase from the headwater area toward downstream fig 2 this could be due to the continuous n inputs from the shore side towns cities and agricultural activities during the transport of the river water to the estuary table s4 kaushal et al 2011 the abundant anthropogenic n inputs e g especially sewage and manure also explained the increase of δ15n no3 in the wet season along the river fig 3a previous studies have suggested that land use management and human activities are the main cause of nitrate concentration enrichment and isotopic composition in river ecosystems kaushal et al 2011 xue et al 2012 zhao et al 2019 the close relationship between the δ15n no3 value and the land use pattern of the different tributaries partly confirmed this point fig s6 another and more possible explanation for the increasing δ15n no3 values could be the preferential absorption of the lighter 14n by phytoplankton leading to an enrichment by heavy 15n in the residual nitrate teranes and bernasconi 2000 zhang et al 2022 a recent study has reported the prevalence of assimilation of phytoplankton in the yr zhang et al 2022 however in the dry season the loading of anthropogenic n inputs was reduced as a result of the reduction of the flushing rates and the assimilation of phytoplankton was also limited by the low water temperature which could be the reason for the insignificant change of δ15n no3 along the river fig 3b and fig s6 table 1 in the headwater area the river water was partly fed by snowmelt δ18o no3 48 60 and expected to exhibit a higher δ18o no3 fig 3c d li et al 2020 xia et al 2019 however the δ18o no3 values within the headwater area gradually decreased possibly due to the continuous mixing of nitrate from soil fertilizer and manure lower δ18o no3 than snowmelt fig 3c d in addition the decrease in δ18o no3 could be also caused by the prevalent nitrification in the vegetation covered basin vitousek et al 1989 during the nitrification 2 3rd of the o atoms of the newly formed nitrate can be derived from h2o kendall and mcdonnell 2012 and thus the change in δ18o h2o partly determined the patterns of δ18o no3 for example both of the δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 decreased in the headwater area and gradually increased in the upper middle stream fig 3 and fig s3 furthermore the enrichment of δ18o h2o caused by the evaporated water in the wet season led to a significantly higher δ18o no3 value in the wet season than in the dry season fig 3 and fig s3 table 1 li et al 2010 found that the δ15n and δ18o of no3 values decreased from upstream to downstream with a distinct decreasing turnover point in the area of three gorges reservoir completed in may 2006 the remineralization of organic matter was considered as the major reason for the decreasing isotopic values of nitrate li et al 2010 in contrast to these results the effects of the reservoir construction on the nitrate isotopes composition were not observed in our study sites 23 26 fig 3 this might be because the signals of remineralization could be masked by the stronger dilution effects by multiple nitrate sources li et al 2019 4 2 investigating n cycling processes with stable isotopes it is necessary to study the n transformation since it substantially determines the reliability of nitrate source apportionments our results demonstrated that most of the measured δ18o no3 values for both wet and dry seasons were closely distributed to the theoretical line of nitrification fig 4 indicating a strong nitrification process the isotopic signals of nitrification were reported in the mainstream li et al 2010 and the tributaries of the yr li et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 however those results were contrary to our hypothesis that the major transformation processes of nitrate changed after the environmental regulation concentration of ammonium ions from the terrestrial soil sewage and fertilizers could be a substrate for nitrification and the high do concentrations in the yr 8 5 1 4 mg l 1 could also favor nitrification xuan et al 2020 xuan et al 2019 yue et al 2017 if that nitrate was mainly produced by microbial nitrification a significant relationship could be expected between the δ15n no3 values and no3 n concentrations however such a relationship was not found fig s4c indicating the presence of more than one biological process to be responsible for the pattern of δ15n and δ18o of nitrate observed in this study li et al 2013 ohte et al 2010 another possibility is that the dilution and mixing of nitrate from the upstream and its tributaries could weaken the relationship ogrinc et al 2008 yuan et al 2017 in addition three of the measured δ18o no3 samples in the wet season site 1 32 and 37 exceeded the theoretical value which could be attributed to the considerable no3 inputs from the snowmelt precipitation and no3 fertilizers a positive correlation was determined between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 signifying the assimilation or and denitrification processes fig 5b kendall et al 2007 the do concentration in the river water was 8 5 1 4 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than the suitable conditions to support denitrification 2 mg l 1 rivett et al 2008 hence the denitrification process in our river water samples was difficult to occur moreover the ratio of δ15n no3 to δ18o no3 was 1 37 in the wet season and 1 03 in the dry season respectively and both values were not within the theoretical range in the occurrence of denitrification 1 5 2 0 kendall et al 2007 in addition several studies documented that denitrification hardly occurred in surface waters especially in large rivers 5 km2 peterson et al 2001 xue et al 2012 hence the parallel increase in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 could have possibly resulted from the assimilation rather than denitrification during assimilation the lighter 14n was preferentially assimilated by the phytoplankton and therefore the δ15n values of the suspended particulate matter were less than or equal to the δ15n no3 values kendall et al 2007 the δ15n no3 values in the present study were higher but not significantly compared to the δ15n of the suspended particulate matter fig s7 supporting that the no3 uptake occurred during the phytoplankton assimilation zhang et al 2022 overall the nitrification and no3 assimilation could be the major processes in the yr watershed 4 3 source apportionment of nitrate and impact of environmental regulations the siar output revealed that the nitrate sources apportionments did not vary significantly among the seasons and sub basins fig 7 soil n was the dominant contributor of nitrate especially in the headwater area and upper stream which was in good agreement with the previous studies carried out in the lancang river near the headwater of yr guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 a fraction of soil organic n was nitrated in the riverbank which was transported to the river b the process of leaching and surface runoff xia et al 2018 another possibility is that the soil organic n could be transported directly into the river by soil erosion and the nitrification process occurs in the river water wang et al 2017 however the main nitrate source of yr in 2006 was manure and sewage li et al 2010 figs 8 and s8 the change in the dominated nitrate source after the implementation of the environmental regulations was also supported by the hydro chemical characteristics of river water samples chloride cl is typically derived from sewage and manure and its stable nature in surface water makes it a useful indicator of no3 sources koba et al 1997 in this study the weak correlation between cl and no3 concentration in the dry season and the negative correlation in the wet season confirmed that the sewage and manure was not the dominant source of nitrate fig s4a in addition the high cl concentrations and low no3 cl ratios of sites 1 2 3 5 and 7 were influenced by evaporate dissolution rather than the sewage and manure inputs fig s4b chetelat et al 2008 the results of current study validated the effectiveness of the chinese government s environmental protection policy such as construction of urban sewage treatment during the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 urban sewage treatment during the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 with a treatment rate reaching 85 and restoration of important rivers and lakes affected by the sewage outfall 2016 2020 however manure and sewage including the nh4 fertilizer still persisted to be the major no3 sources in the yr fig 7 which was consistent with the previous studies on the tgr zhao et al 2019 and tributaries of yr chen et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 nh4 fertilizers urea and ammonium salts are the main n containing fertilizers applied in the yr basin and rapid urbanization has also increased the discharge of manure and sewage especially in the middle and lower streams the low cl concentrations and high no3 cl ratios of sites 20 22 and 31 in the wet season indicated an increased amount of the agricultural input fig s4b anions such as so4 2 cl k and cations like na ca2 and mg2 were significantly related with each other fig s5 which also suggest that the chemical fertilizer sewage and manure enriched with these anions could be the potential source of these anions wang et al 2020 this also partly reflects the important role of chemical fertilizer sewage and manure in the no3 inputs however although the yr water is related to precipitation our results found that the atmospheric nitrate deposition was not a significant source of riverine nitrate and agreed with previous findings li et al 2010 yue et al 2017 although the nitrate source changed from the manure and sewage to soil n after the environmental regulations the no3 n concentration was increased instead of a decrease li et al 2010 table s3 p 0 01 it is likely that the lots of nitrate are more likely to come from the human activities in historical times basu et al 2022 niu et al 2022 to further control and repair the polluted surface water the environmental protection policies such as reducing the n fertilizer application improvement of sewage treatments should be continued to implement 4 4 uncertainty analysis numerous studies have used δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values and siar models to quantify the contributions of different sources in the surface water hu et al 2019 kaushal et al 2011 li et al 2010 xue et al 2012 however some uncertainties still need to be considered the first uncertainty is related to the isotopic signature of the potential nitrate sources dry season precipitation samples were not collected due to sampling restrictions which may cause some uncertainties the isotopic composition values of other nitrate sources were obtained from previous studies with relatively wide ranges leading to possible overlapping as a result this might not accurately apportion the contribution of different potential sources to the riverine nitrate for example in the present study it is difficult to clarify as to what degree the identified soil n source is natural or has a legacy source accumulation from earlier fertilizer manure and sewage leakages and discharges basu et al 2022 niu et al 2022 secondly unpredictable isotopic fractionations during biogeochemical transformations may induce an uncertainty kaushal et al 2011 kendall et al 2007 assimilation and nitrification were the major processes in the yangtze river and the co occurrence of nitrate production and consumption made the identification and quantification of nitrate sources more complicated given the above uncertainties results of the nitrate isotopic compositions and siar models were examined by the land use patterns hydro chemical characteristics e g cl concentration do and isotope of particulate matter hence the current study still provides some valuable insights in the management and pollution control of nitrogenous compounds in the yangtze river 5 conclusion the present study showed that the no3 and δ15n no3 concentration increased along the yr but there was no significant difference between the wet and dry season nitrification was identified as the major process and the strong positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggested the prevalence of assimilation there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of nitrate soil n was the main source of nitrate with a considerable contribution from nh4 fertilizer manure and sewage compared with that in 2006 the δ15n and δ18o of no3 values in this study were significantly decreased but the major process of nitrate transformation was not changed significantly although the no3 n concentration was still significantly increased after the implementation of environmental regulations the decreased contribution of manure and sewage suggest the effectiveness of the environmental policies we believe that
