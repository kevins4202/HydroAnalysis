23650,based on rigid block collapse mechanism and employing the upper bound theorem of limit analysis the ultimate vertical uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors embedded horizontally in two layered sand has been determined closed form analytical expressions were derived for computing the vertical uplift resistance in terms of dimensionless uplift factors f γ and f q due to the components of soil unit weight γ and surcharge pressure q acting on the ground surface respectively for given embedment ratios of the anchor the effect of relative position and thickness of sand layer with higher angle of internal friction φ h and unit weight γ h and sand layer with lower angle of internal friction φ l and unit weight γ l on the magnitude of f γ and f q was studied for different length to width ratio of anchor varying from unity to infinity square to strip the solutions obtained from the present theory compare reasonably well with the available data from literature keywords anchors layered sand limit analysis upper bound uplift resistance 1 introduction horizontal plate anchors are often used for providing the uplift resistance to various structures such as transmission towers dry docks and pipelines under water etc the uplift resistance must be greater than the anticipated uplift load acting on these structures which can be achieved with a great flexibility on the selection of shape size and embedment depth of plate anchors depending upon type of structure sub soil conditions construction feasibility and space availability for the installation of anchors in this regard different shapes and sizes of anchors are being employed to meet the requirements of various design needs in order to compute the vertical uplift capacity of different shapes of plate anchors placed in homogeneous soil a number of investigations have been reported meyerhof and adams 1968 das and seeley 1975 rowe and davis 1982 murray and geddes 1987 dickin 1988 ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 merifield et al 2006 kumar and kouzer 2008 liu et al 2011 rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 sahoo and kumar 2013 o loughlin et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the applications of the above discussed studies are limited only to homogeneous soil deposits in practice however soil deposits are rarely homogenous the determination of uplift resistance of anchors placed in the non homogeneous soil has been addressed by a few researchers stewart 1985 bouazza and finlay 1990 manjunath 1997 kumar 2003 sakai and tanaka 2007 bhattacharya and kumar 2015 2016 by conducting small scale model tests stewart 1985 has made an attempt to increase the uplift capacity of a shallow anchor buried in clay seabed by placing a cohesionless layer over the clay bed it was reported that the displacement of anchor required to obtain substantial improvement in uplift capacity would almost be equal to the depth at which anchors are embedded in the clay layer by performing a limited number of model tests on shallow plate anchors buried in two layered sand bouazza and finlay 1990 have reported that the uplift capacity of anchors is greatly dependent on the relative strength and thickness of two layers and the embedment depth of anchor with the help of simple rigid wedge collapse mechanism and by using the upper bound theorem of limit analysis kumar 2003 has obtained expressions for estimating the uplift capacity of strip and circular anchors buried in two layered sand sakai and tanaka 2007 have evaluated the uplift resistance direction of the shear band propagation and the scale effect of a shallow circular anchor in two layered sand by carrying out 1 g model test and elasto plastic finite element analysis by employing finite element lower bound limit analysis numerical solutions have been produced for determining the uplift capacity of strip and circular anchors embedded i in clay under undrained condition overlain by sand layer bhattacharya and kumar 2015 and ii in two layered sand medium bhattacharya and kumar 2016 however it seems hardly any work has been reported for determining the ultimate uplift resistance of rectangular anchors placed horizontally in a non homogeneous soil particularly in layered sand in this note theoretical expressions have been developed to compute the uplift resistance of shallow rectangular anchor plates buried horizontally in two layered sand by employing the upper bound theorem of limit analysis and with the assumptions of translational failure mechanism similar to that considered earlier by murray and geddes 1987 in the analysis it has been considered that both the unit weight and internal friction angle of top soil layer is different from that of bottom soil layer recently ganesh and sahoo 2017 have obtained solutions for examining the influence of groundwater table fluctuations on the uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors using similar concept as that of present study however the internal friction angles of both top and bottom soil layers are set to be equal furthermore to the best of the authors knowledge no studies seem to have been reported for computing the vertical uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors buried in layered soil by considering the influence of surcharge pressure on the ground surface therefore the effect of relative position of sand layers on the uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors owing to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge pressure has been examined in the present study 2 problem statement a rigid plate rectangular anchor with length l and width b is placed horizontally at a depth h below the ground surface in a two layered sand with i h 1 and h 2 ii φ 1 and φ 2 and iii γ 1 and γ 2 are the thickness angle of internal friction and unit weight of upper and lower layer of sand as illustrated in fig 1 the ground surface is horizontal and is subjected to uniform surcharge pressure q the thickness of anchor plate is assumed to be negligible as compared to its length and width the magnitude of the uplift resistance is not affected by the roughness of the horizontal plate anchors rowe and davis 1982 therefore the angle of interface friction between the anchor plate and the surrounding soil mass is taken equal to angle of internal friction of sand it is the internal friction angle of lower layer sand φ 2 for the present problem depending on the position of both the soil layers φ 1 and φ 2 become φ h or φ l and γ 1 and γ 2 become γ h or γ l here higher internal friction angle φ h and unit weight γ h and lower internal friction angle φ l and unit weight γ l are used for differentiating the sand layers in the two layered system considering relative resistance of sand layers for different combinations that is loose and medium dense sand layers loose and dense sand layers medium dense and dense sand layers the soil mass in both the layers are assumed to be perfectly plastic satisfying mohr coulomb failure criterion with an associated flow rule the principle of superposition is assumed to be valid for determining the total uplift resistance that is the factors f γ and f q are determined separately i γ 0 q 0 for computing f γ and ii γ 0 q 0 for computing f q it needs to be mentioned that the failure load obtained with the usage of the principle of superposition remains always smaller than the true failure load that is the solution obtained with this assumption remains always on the safer side it is intended to determine the magnitude of the ultimate uplift load p u per unit length of anchor plate which will lead to ultimate shear failure 3 analysis 3 1 collapse mechanism following kumar 2003 the rigid wedge collapse mechanisms for rectangular anchors buried in two layered sand with i sand layer of higher internal friction angle underlying sand with lower internal friction angle φ 1 φ 2 and ii sand layer having higher angle of internal friction overlying sand layer with lower internal friction angle φ 1 φ 2 as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively has been assumed in the present analysis similar to murray and geddes 1987 the improvement in the upper bound solution is obtained by introducing the portions of right circular arcs in the collapse mechanism at each corner of the section normal to the anchor central axis from both laboratory experiments and elasto plastic three dimensional finite element analysis performed by rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 for square and rectangular plate anchors embedded in homogeneous dense sand the same type of collapse mechanism consisting of circular arcs at each corners and straight boundaries along the edges of the anchor plate have been identified taking into account the symmetric nature of problem about the vertical planes yox and yoz as illustrated in fig 1 only one fourth of the collapse mechanism is taken into account for performing the present analysis the angle of shearing resistance φ m along the interface of two layers is assumed to be equal to the average of friction angles φ 1 and φ 2 based on the analysis of single isolated anchors in homogeneous sand murray and geddes 1987 and in non homogeneous two layered sand kumar 2003 it can easily be shown that the minimum magnitudes of p u always occur corresponding to the maximum kinematic admissible values of the variables η 1 and η 2 that is the variables η 1 and η 2 should satisfy the following equality constraints 1a η 1 π 2 φ 1 1b η 2 π 2 φ 2 where η 1 and η 2 are the angles of inclination of the rupture surfaces with respect to horizontal plane at the bottom and top layer of sand respectively a critical collapse mechanism satisfying eq 1 leads to the conclusion that no relative movement between the blocks can occur and also the velocities of various blocks simultaneously become equal to the anchor velocity v 0 hence the velocity of all the soil blocks is marked as v 0 fig 2 therefore the angle of shearing resistance φ m along the interface of two layers will not affect the results presented in this note due to the fact that there is no relative movement between blocks at the time of collapse 3 2 computation of vertical uplift resistance based on the chosen collapse mechanism as provided in fig 2a and b the magnitude of the collapse load p u of rectangular anchor plate is determined by equating the total rate of work done by the external and body forces to the rate of dissipation of total internal energy for an associated frictional material the total internal energy dissipated within the soil medium is equal to zero chen 1975 the total rate of work done by the body forces w γ and the total rate of work done by the external force resulting from surcharge pressure q on the ground surface w q is determined by the following expressions 2a w γ π 1 γ 1 v d π 1 π 2 γ 2 v d π 2 2b w q a q v d a where v is the vertical velocity component of the soil blocks and is taken equal to v 0 in the present study for the two layered sand system considered herein the total work done by the body forces is estimated by integrating separately the contribution of body forces in the top sand layer of volume π 1 and the bottom sand layer of volume π 2 which are bounded by the rupture planes on the basis of the application of upper bound theorem of limit analysis the following expression could be obtained for determining the magnitude of the collapse load p u of rectangular anchor plate 3 p u v 0 π 1 γ 1 d π 1 π 2 γ 2 d π 2 a q d a v 0 this shows that the magnitude of p u simply becomes equal to the sum of body forces due to sand layers within the boundary of the planar rupture surfaces and external force resulting from the surcharge pressure acting on the ground surface and can be denoted as 4 p u p u γ p u q where the values p u γ and p u q refer to the component of total pullout resistance offered by self weight of sand and surcharge pressure respectively and are determined using the principle of superposition that is p u γ and p u q are computed from eq 3 separately by taking i γ 0 q 0 and ii γ 0 q 0 respectively by simplifying eq 3 p u γ and p u q can be expressed in the following form 5a p u γ γ 1 h 1 b l b l h 1 tan φ 1 2 h 2 tan φ 2 π 3 h 1 2 tan 2 φ 1 π h 2 tan φ 2 h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 h 2 b l b l h 2 tan φ 2 π 3 h 2 2 tan 2 φ 2 5b p u q q b l 2 b l h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 π h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 2 it has been reported that the superposition rule provides a safe estimate of collapse load for stability problems related to anchors and foundations meyerhof and adams 1968 chen 1975 rowe and davis 1982 bolton and lau 1993 soubra 1999 kumar and sahoo 2013 however the magnitude of p u obtained herein will remain exactly same as that obtained without superposition rule γ 0 q 0 since the geometry of critical collapse mechanism remains the same whether p u computed combinedly or independently owing to contribution of soil self weight and surcharge pressure this fact has also been pointed out by kumar 2003 when analyzing the vertical pullout resistance of strip and circular plate anchors buried in two layered sand medium because the magnitudes of p u become minimum when essential kinematic admissibility conditions are satisfied for validating the upper bound theorem in limit load analysis that is when the variables η 1 and η 2 reach their maximum admissible values as given in eq 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 expression for uplift capacity the expression for finding the ultimate uplift capacity p u of rectangular anchors buried in two layered sand could be written as the sum of contribution due to unit weight of sand and surcharge pressure separately as similar to that defined by kumar 2003 6a p u p u a γ m b f γ q f q 6b γ m γ 1 h 1 γ 2 h 2 h 1 h 2 in this a refers to the area of rectangular anchor plate f γ and f q denote the non dimensional uplift factors due to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge respectively γ m is the weighted average unit weight of two layered soil mass system based on the above definition the uplift factors f γ and f q for the case of two layered sand could be easily obtained by using the expressions given in eq 5 and are expressed as follows for two layered sand 7 f γ γ 1 γ m λ 1 1 1 ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 2 λ 2 tan φ 2 π 3 ϑ λ 1 2 tan 2 φ 1 π ϑ λ 2 tan φ 2 λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 γ m λ 2 1 1 ϑ λ 2 tan φ 2 π 3 ϑ λ 2 2 tan 2 φ 2 8 f q 1 2 1 ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 π ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 2 where λ 1 h 1 b λ 2 h 2 b and ϑ b l it needs to mentioned that for the rectangular plate anchors buried at an embedment depth of h in homogeneous sand having an angle of internal friction φ and unit weight γ the uplift factors f γ and f q can be obtained from eqs 6 8 in three different ways which are listed as follows 9a i λ 1 λ 2 λ φ 1 φ 1 φ and γ 1 γ 1 γ 9b ii λ 1 0 λ 2 λ φ 1 0 φ 2 φ γ 1 0 and γ 2 γ 9c iii λ 2 0 λ 1 λ φ 2 0 φ 1 φ γ 2 0 and γ 1 γ the results of all these cases reduce to the same analytical expressions for determining the uplift factors f γ and f q which are applicable for the case of rectangular plate anchors buried in homogeneous sand by putting different conditions of eq 9 in eqs 7 and 8 the unique solution obtained for f γ and f q is presented as 10 f γ λ 1 1 ϑ λ tan φ π 3 ϑ λ 2 tan 2 φ 11 f q 1 2 1 ϑ λ tan φ π ϑ λ 2 tan 2 φ where λ h b refers to the embedment ratio of rectangular anchor plate the unique nature of solution obtained from all cases of eq 9 verifies the correctness of the analytical formulation developed in this study for applying to the two layered sand medium 4 2 variation of uplift factors for λ 3 figs 3 and 4 provide typical variations of f γ and f q with the normalized thickness of sand layer having higher angle of internal friction λ h that is i λ h λ 1 for the case of sand layer with higher internal friction angle overlying a layer of lower internal friction angle sand φ h φ 1 φ l φ 2 and γ h γ 1 γ l γ 2 where thickness of higher friction layer is equal to h 1 with reference to the ground surface and ii λ h λ 2 for higher frictional resistance sand layer underlying lower frictional resistance sand layer φ l φ 1 φ 2 φ h and γ l γ 1 γ 2 γ h where h 2 is the thickness of higher frictional layer with reference to the anchor plate for different combinations of h 2 and r φ i e r φ φ h φ l and r γ γ h γ l figs 3 and 4 has been plotted using eq 4 and eq 5 respectively since the values of unit weight and internal friction angle of sand generally lie in a range of 14 20 kn m3 and 30 45 the effect of relative position and thickness of sand layers on the magnitude of f γ and f q was examined for φ h 45 0 with two values of φ l equal to 30 and 36 taking r γ 1 4 corresponding to r φ 1 5 and r γ 1 2 corresponding to r φ 1 25 from fig 3 a b and 4 it can be noticed that the magnitude of both the uplift factors f γ and f q increases continuously with an increase in the value of λ h and ϑ for given values of λ h the magnitude of f γ invariably higher for the case of higher frictional sand layer underlying lower frictional sand layer than that for sand layer of higher internal frictional resistance overlying sand layer of lower internal friction resistance however the magnitude of f q is independent of the relative positions of both the layers that is f q invariably becomes the same irrespective of the position of higher and lower frictional resistance sand layer this can easily be verified from eq 8 that by interchanging both the values λ 1 and φ 1 simultaneously with λ 2 and φ 2 the solutions do not change at all further for a given friction angle φ h of sand layer with higher internal friction angle the magnitude of f γ is found to increase continuously with a decrease in the value of h 2 and r φ the uplift factors f γ and f q increases with an increase in the values of b l and attains the maximum value for b l 1 square anchor and becomes the minimum when b l 0 strip anchor for a given embedment ratio the difference between the magnitude of f γ corresponding to higher frictional resistance layer placed over lower frictional resistance layer and lower frictional layer with an overlay of higher frictional layer is defined as δ f γ it has been observed that δ f γ is found to be i the maximum when the thickness of both layers are equal and ii increases continuously with an increase in the values of b l and becomes a minimum value for strip anchors and maximum value for square anchor the increase in the magnitudes of δ f γ with an increase in the values of b l is mainly due to the transition of two dimensional plane strain deformation conditions to three dimensional tri axial deformation conditions this transition has been modeled effectively with the inclusion of circular portion at the corners in the collapse mechanism and the same was also observed in the experimental studies as well as in the elasto plastic 3d finite element analysis carried out by rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 for square and rectangular plate anchors embedded in homogeneous dense sand the values of λ h varies in between 0 and λ that is λ λ h λ l where λ l is the normalized thickness of sand layer having lower angle of internal friction when λ h 0 the anchor is embedded in a homogenous sand layer with lower internal friction angle and the anchor is embedded in a homogenous sand layer with higher internal friction angle for λ h λ it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the magnitudes of both the uplift factors f γ and f q become exactly equal to that of an anchor embedded in a homogeneous sand i for φ 30 0 and φ 36 0 when λ h 0 and ii for φ 45 0 when λ h 3 it needs to be mentioned that the variation of the uplift factors f γ and f q with λ h and ϑ was discussed only for λ 3 and for values of λ other than 3 the variation of f γ and f q can easily be obtained by using the closed form expressions given in eqs 4 and 5 it has been found that the trend of variation of f γ and f q with λ h and ϑ is the same for all the values of λ hence for a selected value of λ 3 the solutions have been presented and discussed herein 5 comparison of present results with the existing solutions since no experimental or theoretical studies are available for determining the uplift capacity of rectangular anchors buried in layered sand 1 for a rectangular anchor in homogenous sand the present solutions are compared with the experimental and elasto plastic finite element solutions of rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 and with the experimental results of das and seeley 1975 as shown in fig 5 a b 2 the variation of f γ with λ h obtained from the present analysis with b l 1 that is the case of square anchor has been compared with the experimental results of bouazza and finlay 1990 and analytical solutions of kumar 2003 for circular anchors in layered soil as presented in fig 6 a b rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 have conducted uplift tests on anchors at an embedment ratio λ of 2 for different values of l b buried in dense sand with internal friction angle φ dilatancy angle ψ and unit weight γ equal to 45 20 and 16 5 kn m3 respectively das and seeley 1975 have performed models tests on anchors with different values of l b and embedment ratios buried in loose sand with γ 14 81 kn m3 and φ 31 0 bouazza and finlay 1990 have carried out model tests on circular anchors with dense sand underlying a layer of loose sand fig 6a and a layer of medium dense sand fig 6b the unit weight and angle of internal friction of loose medium dense and dense sands are 15 23 kn m3 and 33 8 16 07 kn m3 and 39 and 16 87 kn m3 and 43 7 respectively the closed form formulations proposed by kumar 2003 and in the present work are based on the assumption of associated flow rule the dilatancy predicted with the assumption of associated flow rule ψ φ is always greater than that generally experienced by cohesionless soils thus the true uplift resistance would be lower than or equal to the solutions obtained with the assumption of associated flow rule rowe and davis 1982 drescher and detournay 1993 however the magnitude of limit load for a material obeying non associated flow rule can be determined from the formulation based on associate flow rule by replacing the value of angle of internal friction of soil φ with a modified internal friction angle φ for a known value of dilatancy angle ψ as per the recommendation of drescher and detournay 1993 michalowski and shi 1995 12 φ tan 1 cos ψ sin φ 1 sin ψ sin φ since no information is available for the dilatancy angle in the model tests of das and seeley 1975 and bouazza and finlay 1990 in order to compare the theoretical solutions obtained from the present analysis as well as kumar 2003 with the experimental results the value of ψ is approximately taken equal to φ 30 0 bolton 1986 this approximate relationship has already been found to predict reasonably good magnitude of uplift capacity of plate anchors buried in sand hanna et al 2007 it can be seen that the present solutions are in good agreement with the experimental results provided by different researchers as discussed above in case of strip anchors embedded in two layered sand the solutions obtained in the present study for uplift factors f γ and f q can be simplified by substituting ϑ 0 in eqs 7 8 as follows 13 f γ γ 1 γ m λ 1 1 λ 1 tan φ 1 2 λ 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 γ m λ 2 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 14 f q 1 2 λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 these expressions have been found to be exactly identical to the analytical expressions developed by kumar 2003 for the case of strip anchors embedded in two layered sand the variation of f γ and f q with λ h λ from the present upper bound limit analysis are also compared with the numerical lower bound solutions of bhattacharya and kumar 2016 for strip anchors in layered sand as illustrated in fig 7 as expected the values of f γ and f q obtained from lower bound finite element limit analysis bhattacharya and kumar 2016 are found to be lower than that of present upper bound limit analysis it can further be found that the present analytical expression as given in eq 10 is exactly the same with the analytical expression provided by murray and geddes 1987 for a rectangular anchor embedded in homogenous sand therefore no specific comparison has been made between the solutions obtained from the present analysis with that of murray and geddes 1987 in terms of numerical values it is worth noting that no experimental or analytical studies are available for evaluating the factor f q in the case of rectangular anchors buried either in homogeneous or in layered sand the variation of f γ and f q with λ h λ from the present analysis with b l 1 has been compared with the results of kumar 2003 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 for circular anchors as illustrated in fig 8 it can be noticed that the present solutions are found to compare reasonably well with the results of kumar 2003 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 6 remarks based on the extent of rupture zone at the ultimate shear failure the anchors can be classified as shallow or deep the failure zone reaches ground surface in the case of shallow anchor due to which the uplift resistance of shallow anchors increases continuously with increasing the embedment ratio on the other hand in the case of deep anchors the rupture zone is localized only around the anchor plate beyond a certain embedment ratio that is the critical embedment ratio λ c r which results almost a constant magnitude of uplift resistance with further increase in the values of λ from the experimental results dickin 1988 the anchors with embedment ratio approximately greater than 6 buried in loose sand were found to behave as deep anchors whereas the deep behavior in the case of dense sand was not observed even when embedment ratio reached to 8 which was the maximum embedment ratio in the experimental investigation of dickin 1988 the present analysis has been carried out based on the assumption that the rupture surfaces at ultimate shear failure extend up to the ground surface thus the applicability of theoretical study presented herein will be limited to shallow anchors moreover in case of shallow embedded anchors the rupture surfaces are found to be closely linear in nature from the laboratory model tests ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 liu et al 2011 in the present analysis the effect of water table on the uplift capacity of anchors has not been taken into account however the solutions obtained from this analysis can still be used by simply substituting submerged unit weight of soil γ in place of bulk unit weight of soil γ in the case of anchor plate located below water table further the value of φ can be kept constant for obtaining the solutions as the variation in the value of φ above and below the water level is found to be negligible in granular soils krishnamurthy and kameswara rao 1975 7 conclusions for computing the ultimate uplift resistance of rectangular anchors buried horizontally in two layer sand closed form theoretical solutions has been developed by applying upper bound theorem of limit analysis with the assumptions of simple rigid wedge collapse mechanism for a given value of λ h the uplift resistance of the anchor due to unit weight component has been found to be higher for anchors embedded in higher internal friction sand layer with a overlay of lower internal friction sand layer as compared to the anchors placed in sand layer with lower angle of internal friction underlying sand layer having higher angle of internal friction on the other hand the surcharge component of uplift resistance does not change with the relative position of sand layers the difference in the magnitude of f γ due to different position of the sand layers become the maximum value when the thickness of both layers is equal this maximum value continuously increases with increasing the b l ratio and has been found to be the minimum for strip anchor and maximum in the case of square anchor the analytical expressions produced in this note are expected to be useful for purpose of design of rectangular plate anchors embedded in two layered sand 
23650,based on rigid block collapse mechanism and employing the upper bound theorem of limit analysis the ultimate vertical uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors embedded horizontally in two layered sand has been determined closed form analytical expressions were derived for computing the vertical uplift resistance in terms of dimensionless uplift factors f γ and f q due to the components of soil unit weight γ and surcharge pressure q acting on the ground surface respectively for given embedment ratios of the anchor the effect of relative position and thickness of sand layer with higher angle of internal friction φ h and unit weight γ h and sand layer with lower angle of internal friction φ l and unit weight γ l on the magnitude of f γ and f q was studied for different length to width ratio of anchor varying from unity to infinity square to strip the solutions obtained from the present theory compare reasonably well with the available data from literature keywords anchors layered sand limit analysis upper bound uplift resistance 1 introduction horizontal plate anchors are often used for providing the uplift resistance to various structures such as transmission towers

resistance of rectangular plate anchors buried in layered soil by considering the influence of surcharge pressure on the ground surface therefore the effect of relative position of sand layers on the uplift resistance of rectangular plate anchors owing to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge pressure has been examined in the present study 2 problem statement a rigid plate rectangular anchor with length l and width b is placed horizontally at a depth h below the ground surface in a two layered sand with i h 1 and h 2 ii φ 1 and φ 2 and iii γ 1 and γ 2 are the thickness angle of internal friction and unit weight of upper and lower layer of sand as illustrated in fig 1 the ground surface is horizontal and is subjected to uniform surcharge pressure q the thickness of anchor plate is assumed to be negligible as compared to its length and width the magnitude of the uplift resistance is not affected by the roughness of the horizontal plate anchors rowe and davis 1982 therefore the angle of interface friction between the anchor plate and the surrounding soil mass is taken equal to angle of internal friction of sand it is the internal friction angle of lower layer sand φ 2 for the present problem depending on the position of both the soil layers φ 1 and φ 2 become φ h or φ l and γ 1 and γ 2 become γ h or γ l here higher internal friction angle φ h and unit

per unit length of anchor plate which will lead to ultimate shear failure 3 analysis 3 1 collapse mechanism following kumar 2003 the rigid wedge collapse mechanisms for rectangular anchors buried in two layered sand with i sand layer of higher internal friction angle underlying sand with lower internal friction angle φ 1 φ 2 and ii sand layer having higher angle of internal friction overlying sand layer with lower internal friction angle φ 1 φ 2 as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively has been assumed in the present analysis similar to murray and geddes 1987 the improvement in the upper bound solution is obtained by introducing the portions of right circular arcs in the collapse mechanism at each corner of the section normal to the anchor central axis from both laboratory experiments and elasto plastic three dimensional finite element analysis performed by rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 for square and rectangular plate anchors embedded in homogeneous dense sand the same type of collapse mechanism consisting of circular arcs at each corners and straight boundaries along the edges of the anchor plate have been identified taking into account the symmetric nature of problem about the vertical planes yox and yoz as illustrated in fig 1 only one fourth of the collapse mechanism is taken into account for performing the present analysis the angle of shearing resistance φ m along the interface of two layers is assumed to be equal to the average of friction angles φ 1 and φ 2 based on the analysis of single isolated anchors in homogeneous sand murray and geddes 1987 and in non homogeneous two layered sand kumar 2003 it can easily be shown that the minimum magnitudes of p u always occur corresponding to the maximum kinematic admissible values of the variables η 1 and η 2 that is the variables η 1 and η 2 should satisfy the following equality constraints 1a η 1 π 2 φ 1 1b η 2 π 2 φ 2 where η 1 and η 2 are the angles of inclination of the rupture surfaces with respect to horizontal plane at the bottom and top layer of sand respectively a critical collapse mechanism satisfying eq 1 leads to the conclusion that no relative movement between the blocks can occur and also the velocities of various blocks simultaneously become equal to the anchor velocity v 0 hence the velocity of all the soil blocks is marked as v 0 fig 2 therefore the angle of shearing resistance φ m along the interface of two layers will not affect the results presented in this note due to the fact that there is no relative movement between blocks at the time of collapse 3 2 computation of vertical uplift resistance based on the chosen collapse mechanism as provided in fig 2a and b the magnitude of the collapse load p u of rectangular anchor plate is determined by equating the total rate of work done by the external and body forces to the rate of dissipation of total internal energy for an associated frictional material the total internal energy dissipated within the soil medium is equal to zero chen 1975 the total rate of work done by the body forces w γ and the total rate of work done by the external force resulting from surcharge pressure q on the ground surface w q is determined by the following expressions 2a w γ π 1 γ 1 v d π 1 π 2 γ 2 v d π 2 2b w q a q v d a where v is the vertical velocity component of the soil blocks and is taken equal to v 0 in the present study for the two layered sand system considered herein the total work done by the body forces is estimated by integrating separately the contribution of body forces in the top sand layer of volume π 1 and the bottom sand layer of volume π 2 which are bounded by the rupture planes on the basis of the application of upper bound theorem of limit analysis the following expression could be obtained for determining the magnitude of the collapse load p u of rectangular anchor plate 3 p u v 0 π 1 γ 1 d π 1 π 2 γ 2 d π 2 a q d a v 0 this shows that the magnitude of p u simply becomes equal to the sum of body forces due to sand layers within the boundary of the planar rupture surfaces and external force resulting from the surcharge pressure acting on the ground surface and can be denoted as 4 p u p u γ p u q where the values p u γ and p u q refer to the component of total pullout resistance offered by self weight of sand and surcharge pressure respectively and are determined using the principle of superposition that is p u γ and p u q are computed from eq 3 separately by taking i γ 0 q 0 and ii γ 0 q 0 respectively by simplifying eq 3 p u γ and p u q can be expressed in the following form 5a p u γ γ 1 h 1 b l b l h 1 tan φ 1 2 h 2 tan φ 2 π 3 h 1 2 tan 2 φ 1 π h 2 tan φ 2 h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 h 2 b l b l h 2 tan φ 2 π 3 h 2 2 tan 2 φ 2 5b p u q q b l 2 b l h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 π h 1 tan φ 1 h 2 tan φ 2 2 it has been reported that the superposition rule provides a safe estimate of collapse load for stability problems related to anchors and foundations meyerhof and adams 1968 chen 1975 rowe and davis 1982 bolton and lau 1993 soubra 1999 kumar and sahoo 2013 however the magnitude of p u obtained herein will remain exactly same as that obtained without superposition rule γ 0 q 0 since the geometry of critical collapse mechanism remains the same whether p u computed combinedly or independently owing to contribution of soil self weight and surcharge pressure this fact has also been pointed out by kumar 2003 when analyzing the vertical pullout resistance of strip and circular plate anchors buried in two layered sand medium because the magnitudes of p u become minimum when essential kinematic admissibility conditions are satisfied for validating the upper bound theorem in limit load analysis that is when the variables η 1 and η 2 reach their maximum admissible values as given in eq 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 expression for uplift capacity the expression for finding the ultimate uplift capacity p u of rectangular anchors buried in two layered sand could be written as the sum of contribution due to unit weight of sand and surcharge pressure separately as similar to that defined by kumar 2003 6a p u p u a γ m b f γ q f q 6b γ m γ 1 h 1 γ 2 h 2 h 1 h 2 in this a refers to the area of rectangular anchor plate f γ and f q denote the non dimensional uplift factors due to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge respectively γ m is the weighted average unit weight of two layered soil mass system based on the above definition the uplift factors f γ and f q for the case of two layered sand could be easily obtained by using the expressions given in eq 5 and are expressed as follows for two layered sand 7 f γ γ 1 γ m λ 1 1 1 ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 2 λ 2 tan φ 2 π 3 ϑ λ 1 2 tan 2 φ 1 π ϑ λ 2 tan φ 2 λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 γ m λ 2 1 1 ϑ λ 2 tan φ 2 π 3 ϑ λ 2 2 tan 2 φ 2 8 f q 1 2 1 ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 π ϑ λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 2 where λ 1 h 1 b λ 2 h 2 b and ϑ b l it needs to mentioned that for the rectangular plate anchors buried at an embedment depth of h in homogeneous sand having an angle of internal friction φ and unit weight γ the uplift factors f γ and f q can be obtained from eqs 6 8 in three different ways which are listed as follows 9a i λ 1 λ 2 λ φ 1 φ 1 φ and γ 1 γ 1 γ 9b ii λ 1 0 λ 2 λ φ 1 0 φ 2 φ γ 1 0 and γ 2 γ 9c iii λ 2 0 λ 1 λ φ 2 0 φ 1 φ γ 2 0 and γ 1 γ the results of all these cases reduce to the same analytical expressions for determining the uplift factors f γ and f q which are applicable for the case of rectangular plate anchors buried in homogeneous sand by putting different conditions of eq 9 in eqs 7 and 8 the unique solution obtained for f γ and f q is presented as 10 f γ λ 1 1 ϑ λ tan φ π 3 ϑ λ 2 tan 2 φ 11 f q 1 2 1 ϑ λ tan φ π ϑ λ 2 tan 2 φ where λ h b refers to the embedment ratio of rectangular anchor plate the unique nature of solution obtained from all cases of eq 9 verifies the correctness of the analytical formulation developed in this study for applying to the two layered sand medium 4 2 variation of uplift factors for λ 3 figs 3 and 4 provide typical variations of f γ and f q with the normalized thickness of sand layer having higher angle of internal friction λ h that is i λ h λ 1 for the case of sand layer with higher internal friction angle overlying a layer of lower internal friction angle sand φ h φ 1 φ l φ 2 and γ h γ 1 γ l γ 2 where thickness of higher friction layer is equal to h 1 with reference to the ground surface and ii λ h λ 2 for higher frictional resistance sand layer underlying lower frictional resistance sand layer φ l φ 1 φ 2 φ h and γ l γ 1 γ 2 γ h where h 2 is the thickness of higher frictional layer with reference to the anchor plate for different combinations of h 2 and r φ i e r φ φ h φ l and r γ γ h γ l figs 3 and 4 has been plotted using eq 4 and eq 5 respectively since the values of unit weight and internal friction angle of sand generally lie in a range of 14 20 kn m3 and 30 45 the effect of relative position and thickness of sand layers on the magnitude of f γ and f q was examined for φ h 45 0 with two values of φ l equal to 30 and 36 taking r γ 1 4 corresponding to r φ 1 5 and r γ 1 2 corresponding to r φ 1 25 from fig 3 a b and 4 it can be noticed that the magnitude of both the uplift factors f γ and f q increases continuously with an increase in the value of λ h and ϑ for given values of λ h the magnitude of f γ invariably higher for the case of higher frictional sand layer underlying lower frictional sand layer than that for sand layer of higher internal frictional resistance overlying sand layer of lower internal friction resistance however the magnitude of f q is independent of the relative positions of both the layers that is f q invariably becomes the same irrespective of the position of higher and lower frictional resistance sand layer this can easily be verified from eq 8 that by interchanging both the values λ 1 and φ 1 simultaneously with λ 2 and φ 2 the solutions do not change at all further for a given friction angle φ h of sand layer with higher internal friction angle the magnitude of f γ is found to increase continuously with a decrease in the value of h 2 and r φ the uplift factors f γ and f q increases with an increase in the values of b l and attains the maximum value for b l 1 square anchor and becomes the minimum when b l 0 strip anchor for a given embedment ratio the difference between the magnitude of f γ corresponding to higher frictional resistance layer placed over lower frictional resistance layer and lower frictional layer with an overlay of higher frictional layer is defined as δ f γ it has been observed that δ f γ is found to be i the maximum when the thickness of both layers are equal and ii increases continuously with an increase in the values of b l and becomes a minimum value for strip anchors and maximum value for square anchor the increase in the magnitudes of δ f γ with an increase in the values of b l is mainly due to the transition of two dimensional plane strain deformation conditions to three dimensional tri axial deformation conditions this transition has been modeled effectively with the inclusion of circular portion at the corners in the collapse mechanism and the same was also observed in the experimental studies as well as in the elasto plastic 3d finite element analysis carried out by rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 for square and rectangular plate anchors embedded in homogeneous dense sand the values of λ h varies in between 0 and λ that is λ λ h λ l where λ l is the normalized thickness of sand layer having lower angle of internal friction when λ h 0 the anchor is embedded in a homogenous sand layer with lower internal friction angle and the anchor is embedded in a homogenous sand layer with higher internal friction angle for λ h λ it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the magnitudes of both the uplift factors f γ and f q become exactly equal to that of an anchor embedded in a homogeneous sand i for φ 30 0 and φ 36 0 when λ h 0 and ii for φ 45 0 when λ h 3 it needs to be mentioned that the variation of the uplift factors f γ and f q with λ h and ϑ was discussed only for λ 3 and for values of λ other than 3 the variation of f γ and f q can easily be obtained by using the closed form expressions given in eqs 4 and 5 it has been found that the trend of variation of f γ and f q with λ h and ϑ is the same for all the values of λ hence for a selected value of λ 3 the solutions have been presented and discussed herein 5 comparison of present results with the existing solutions since no experimental or theoretical studies are available for determining the uplift capacity of rectangular anchors buried in layered sand 1 for a rectangular anchor in homogenous sand the present solutions are compared with the experimental and elasto plastic finite element solutions of rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 and with the experimental results of das and seeley 1975 as shown in fig 5 a b 2 the variation of f γ with λ h obtained from the present analysis with b l 1 that is the case of square anchor has been compared with the experimental results of bouazza and finlay 1990 and analytical solutions of kumar 2003 for circular anchors in layered soil as presented in fig 6 a b rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 have conducted uplift tests on anchors at an embedment ratio λ of 2 for different values of l b buried in dense sand with internal friction angle φ dilatancy angle ψ and unit weight γ equal to 45 20 and 16 5 kn m3 respectively das and seeley 1975 have performed models tests on anchors with different values of l b and embedment ratios buried in loose sand with γ 14 81 kn m3 and φ 31 0 bouazza and finlay 1990 have carried out model tests on circular anchors with dense sand underlying a layer of loose sand fig 6a and a layer of medium dense sand fig 6b the unit weight and angle of internal friction of loose medium dense and dense sands are 15 23 kn m3 and 33 8 16 07 kn m3 and 39 and 16 87 kn m3 and 43 7 respectively the closed form formulations proposed by kumar 2003 and in the present work are based on the assumption of associated flow rule the dilatancy predicted with the assumption of associated flow rule ψ φ is always greater than that generally experienced by cohesionless soils thus the true uplift resistance would be lower than or equal to the solutions obtained with the assumption of associated flow rule rowe and davis 1982 drescher and detournay 1993 however the magnitude of limit load for a material obeying non associated flow rule can be determined from the formulation based on associate flow rule by replacing the value of angle of internal friction of soil φ with a modified internal friction angle φ for a known value of dilatancy angle ψ as per the recommendation of drescher and detournay 1993 michalowski and shi 1995 12 φ tan 1 cos ψ sin φ 1 sin ψ sin φ since no information is available for the dilatancy angle in the model tests of das and seeley 1975 and bouazza and finlay 1990 in order to compare the theoretical solutions obtained from the present analysis as well as kumar 2003 with the experimental results the value of ψ is approximately taken equal to φ 30 0 bolton 1986 this approximate relationship has already been found to predict reasonably good magnitude of uplift capacity of plate anchors buried in sand hanna et al 2007 it can be seen that the present solutions are in good agreement with the experimental results provided by different researchers as discussed above in case of strip anchors embedded in two layered sand the solutions obtained in the present study for uplift factors f γ and f q can be simplified by substituting ϑ 0 in eqs 7 8 as follows 13 f γ γ 1 γ m λ 1 1 λ 1 tan φ 1 2 λ 2 tan φ 2 γ 2 γ m λ 2 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 14 f q 1 2 λ 1 tan φ 1 λ 2 tan φ 2 these expressions have been found to be exactly identical to the analytical expressions developed by kumar 2003 for the case of strip anchors embedded in two layered sand the variation of f γ and f q with λ h λ from the present upper bound limit analysis are also compared with the numerical lower bound solutions of bhattacharya and kumar 2016 for strip anchors in layered sand as illustrated in fig 7 as expected the values of f γ and f q obtained from lower bound finite element limit analysis bhattacharya and kumar 2016 are found to be lower than that of present upper bound limit analysis it can further be found that the present analytical expression as given in eq 10 is exactly the same with the analytical expression provided by murray and geddes 1987 for a rectangular anchor embedded in homogenous sand therefore no specific comparison has been made between the solutions obtained from the present analysis with that of murray and geddes 1987 in terms of numerical values it is worth noting that no experimental or analytical studies are available for evaluating the factor f q in the case of rectangular anchors buried either in homogeneous or in layered sand the variation of f γ and f q with λ h λ from the present analysis with b l 1 has been compared with the results of kumar 2003 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 for circular anchors as illustrated in fig 8 it can be noticed that the present solutions are found to compare reasonably well with the results of kumar 2003 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 6 remarks based on the extent of rupture zone at the ultimate shear failure the anchors can be classified as shallow or deep the failure zone reaches ground surface in the case of shallow anchor due to which the uplift resistance of shallow anchors increases continuously with increasing the embedment ratio on the other hand in the case of deep anchors the rupture zone is localized only around the anchor plate beyond a certain embedment ratio that is the critical embedment ratio λ c r which results almost a constant magnitude of uplift resistance with further increase in the values of λ from the experimental results dickin 1988 the anchors with embedment ratio approximately greater than 6 buried in loose sand were found to behave as deep anchors whereas the deep behavior in the case of dense sand was not observed even when embedment ratio reached to 8 which was the maximum embedment ratio in the experimental investigation of dickin 1988 the present analysis has been carried out based on the assumption that the rupture surfaces at ultimate shear failure extend up to the ground surface thus the applicability of theoretical study presented herein will be limited to shallow anchors moreover in case of shallow embedded anchors the rupture surfaces are found to be closely linear in nature from the laboratory model tests ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 liu et al 2011 in the present analysis the effect of water table on the uplift capacity of anchors has not been taken into account however the solutions obtained from this analysis can still be used by simply substituting submerged unit weight of soil γ in place of bulk unit weight of soil γ in the case of anchor plate located below water table further the value of φ can be kept constant for obtaining the solutions as the variation in the value of φ above and below the water level is found to be negligible in granular soils krishnamurthy and kameswara rao 1975 7 conclusions for computing the ultimate uplift resistance of rectangular anchors buried horizontally in two layer sand closed form theoretical solutions has been developed by applying upper bound theorem of limit analysis with the assumptions of simple rigid wedge collapse mechanism for a given value of λ h the uplift resistance of the anchor due to unit weight component has been found to be higher for anchors embedded in higher internal friction sand layer with a overlay of lower internal friction sand layer as compared to the anchors placed in sand layer with lower angle of internal friction underlying sand layer having higher angle of internal friction on the other hand the surcharge component of uplift resistance does not change with the relative position of sand layers the difference in the magnitude of f γ due to different position of the sand layers become the maximum value when the thickness of both layers is equal this maximum value continuously increases with increasing the b l ratio and has been found to be the minimum for strip anchor and maximum in the case of square anchor the analytical expressions produced in this note are expected to be useful for purpose of design of rectangular plate anchors embedded in two layered sand 
23651,cavitation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in ocean engineering in order to figure out the relationship between cavitation cloud and cavitation erosion high speed visualization and erosion test of cavitation jet were simultaneously performed the temporal and spatial distributions of cavitation cloud was analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition pod and the morphology of eroded specimen was analyzed from both macroscopic and microcosmic perspectives the results show that pod modes of side view images are able to estimate the maximum radial distribution of cavitation pits while the energy fraction of the first pod mode can serve as an indicator of specimen mass loss the intensity of cavitation erosion is decided by both the bubble concentration and collapse intensity at specimen surface at a medium standoff distance where collapse intensity and bubble concentration are well compromised maximum cavitation erosion is achieved the aggravation of cavitation erosion is the combined consequences of the growth of single cavitation pits and the connection of adjacent pits these results suggest that the collapse of cavitation bubbles is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion the findings are expected to improve the physical understanding of the relationship between cavitation phenomenon and cavitation damage keywords cavitation jet high speed visualization proper orthogonal decomposition erosion test laser microscope 1 introduction cavitation is a common phenomenon in ocean engineering which was firstly observed by reynolds 1894 and gained growing attention after parsons and cook 1919 recognized it as the source of severe erosion of warship propellers cavitation happens when vapor cavities called cavitation bubbles are formed in liquid this is realized by dropping local pressure below saturated vapor pressure crum 1982 mørch 2009 when subjected to high pressure cavitation bubble collapses generating extremely high local pressure and temperature up to several gpa and thousands of k alehossein and qin 2007 choi and chahine 2016 franc et al 2011 if a cavitation bubble collapses close enough to a solid wall it will induce high speed micro jet and shock waves benjamin and ellis 1966 minsier et al 2009 momma and lichtarowicz 1995 tomita and shima 1986 which can cause permanent deformation pits or craters at material surface once their aggressiveness exceeds the threshold decided by material properties choi et al 2014 hsiao et al 2014 pöhl et al 2015 marine equipment such as rudder and propeller are typical parts that suffer from cavitation damage cavitation can also cause noise vibration and low efficiency in fluid machinery arndt 1981 although cavitation is not welcomed in most of engineering situations cavitation jet that takes advantage of the energy of cavitation bubble collapse has enjoyed extensive researches and applications since 1980s cavitation is firstly induced in nozzle throat where local pressure drops dramatically due to bernoulli s principle microscopic roughness of nozzle inner surface small solid impurities and dissolved gases in the liquid provide sites for heterogeneous nucleation holl 1970 mørch 2007 cavitation bubbles travel with water jet and then expand in shear layer where turbulent pressure can be very low forming coalesce called cavitation cloud as cavitation bubbles approach the target local pressure will recover and bubbles will collapse at target surface leading to cavitation damage it has been proven that cavitation jet can clean the underwater pipelines of offshore oil platforms improve drilling rate of petroleum wells gensheng et al 2005 johnson et al 1984 and perform shotless peening soyama et al 2011 et al it also serves as an efficient way to decide material s resistance to cavitation erosion g134 95 2006 among the researches on cavitation jet there are two popular ways erosion test and high speed visualization erosion test focuses on the mass loss damage pattern and failure mechanism of test samples many researches have been done concerning the effects of relevant factors on the erosion results of cavitation jet chahine and courbiere 1987 hattori et al 2006 hutli et al 2016 2017 kim et al 2014 li et al 2016 2017 soyama 2013 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 watanabe et al 2016 yamaguchi and shimizu 1987 yamauchi et al 1995 including nozzle geometry upstream pressure standoff distance cavitation number fluid temperature et al the double peaks of mass loss along standoff distance and ring shape distribution of spherical cavitation pits were recognized as representative features of cavitation jet on the other hand high speed visualization directly observes the cavitation cloud in cavitation jet collapse of cavitation cloud is closely related to cavitation erosion high speed photography was firstly adopted by chahine et al 1987 who found there was periodic shedding of cavitation cloud in cavitation jet a typical cycle of cavitation cloud contains four stages inception transition shedding and collapse hydraulic conditions such as upstream pressure and cavitation number would affect the size and shedding frequency of cavitation cloud afterwards soyama et al 1995 used high speed photography to visualize cavitation jet from conical cylindrical and horn nozzles they observed that the shedding frequency of cavitation cloud decreased while the maximum length of cavitation cloud increased with upstream pressure hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 agreed on the inverse relationship between upstream pressure and shedding frequency nishimura et al 2012 decided the similarity law between shedding frequency and hydraulic conditions by high speed visualization wright et al 2013 investigated the size traveling distance shedding frequency and front velocity of cavitation cloud under different reynolds numbers utilizing frame difference method sato and cooperators hayashi and sato 2014 saito and sato 2006 sato et al 2009a argued that the re entrant jet formed by the downstream cavitation cloud collapse was responsible for the shedding of cavitation cloud issued from horn type nozzle this theory that re entrant jet periodically pinches off cavitation cloud at nozzle exit was accepted by some researches stanley et al 2011 2014 watanabe et al 2016 and it is very similar to the cavitation cloud shedding mechanism above hydrofoils dular et al 2005 recently there were attempts to find the link between the behavior of cavitation cloud and cavitation erosion several pioneering works have been done dular et al 2004 conducted optical observation of cavitation structures above hydrofoils and an obvious correlation between cavitation structures and cavitation erosion was found the position and distribution of pits on hydrofoil surface correlated to the distribution of the images standard deviation of gray level later on petkovšek and dular 2013 presented a study about simultaneous observations of cavitation structures and cavitation erosion besides demonstrating the cause and effect between cavitation cloud collapse and cavitation erosion they also found that the topology of cavitation cloud before collapse played a major role in erosion in cavitation jet watanabe et al 2016 experimentally studied the variations of cavitation cloud structure and erosion characteristics they found the erosion distribution on specimen can be reproduced in the time difference images of the cavitation cloud shadowgraphs hutli et al 2017 proved that the distribution of cavitation bubble collapse at sample surface well matched the area of ring shape erosion however previous works about cavitation jet hutli et al 2016 2017 sato et al 2013 soyama 2005 watanabe et al 2016 usually used a couple of images from one or two cycles to represent the global behavior of cavitation cloud which we think is defective although cavitation cloud has an obviously periodic behavior they does not behave exactly the same in different cycles in terms of size and duration in most experiments plunger pumps were used to provide upstream pressure and the fluctuation of pump pressure cannot be avoid wright et al 2013 thus cavitation cloud appears differently in high pressure and low pressure phases peng et al 2016 sato et al 2013 to accurately reflect the spatial distribution of cavitation cloud it is necessary to introduce an approach that contains statistical ideas in present study proper orthogonal decomposition pod was used pod is a method that can distinguish spatial and temporal coherent structures in flow field it decomposes a time series of vector or scalar field into a set of basic spatial modes and temporal coefficients chatterjee 2000 holmes et al 1998 pod enjoys applications in many domains such as data compression signal analysis image processing and fluid mechanics berkooz et al 1993 chen et al 2012 fogleman et al 2004 watanabe et al 2015a recently pod was introduced to the study of cavitation flow utturkar et al 2005 applied pod to characterize the difference between cavitation models danlos et al 2014 proposed to use energy fraction of the second pod mode to distinguish different cavitation regimes in a convergent divergent nozzle prothin et al 2016 highlighted the spatial and temporal behavior of cavitation cloud on a hydrofoil at high reynolds number using pod for cavitation jet watanabe et al 2015b obtained the spatial modes showing cavitation cloud distribution it was found that cavitation cloud resided around center jet in an axisymmetric manner this paper is going to address the temporal and spatial characteristics of cavitation cloud the erosion ability of cavitation jet and the relationship between the two it is hoped that present work can improve the physical understanding of the cavitation phenomenon and cavitation damage of cavitation jet the experimental setup and data processing method are detailed in section 2 section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the results and analysis periodic behavior of cavitation cloud pod results cavitation noise erosion patterns and their correlations 2 material and methods 2 1 test rig and experiment conditions the joint experiments of high speed observation and erosion test were carried out at high pressure water jet laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing the test rig is schematically depicted in fig 1 a a high pressure plunger pump kmt streamline sl v50 with an inbuilt bladder accumulator provided the upstream pressure which could be read from a pressure gauge accuracy 0 3 fs at pump outlet the pressure loss along the pipelines was ignored a turbine flowmeter accuracy 0 5 fs was used to measure the flow rate a cylindrical nozzle fig 1 b was used with throat diameter of 0 3 mm a cylindrical water vessel made of transparent acrylic resin with diameter of 35 cm and height of 25 cm was used to produce submerge condition the lateral and axial coordinates x and y were defined with the origin set at the nozzle exit standoff distance y can be adjusted at a resolution of 0 1 mm and the non dimensional standoff distance nsd is defined as y throat diameter in all experiments upstream pressure was set at 50 mpa flow rate was 0 96 0 05 l min nozzle discharge coefficient was about 0 71 cavitation number σ p d o w n s t r e a m p v a p o u r 0 5 ρ v t h r o a t 2 is 0 038 standoff distances ranging from 2 5 to 60 mm nsd 8 3 200 were investigated tap water was used and additional cold water was injected to the vessel through a tube with diameter 25 mm water temperature in the vessel was maintained at 20 23 c during the experiments measured by an infrared thermometer resolution 0 5 c maximum error 1 c thus the effect of water thermal properties was minimized dular 2016 hattori et al 2006 2013 the water in supply tank was prepared a day before experiment and exposed to atmosphere for 24 h and the water temperature and the concentration of cavitation nuclei in terms of dissolved gas were thought to be constant for tank water there would be more cavitation nuclei after experiments which resulted from the collapsed cavitation bubbles to keep a constant water quality the water in vessel was replaced by fresh tank water and stayed still for 10 min before next test 2 2 record of data sets a high speed camera phantom v310 lens af80 200mmf 2 8d was used to visualize the cavitation cloud from side view the camera was operated at a frame rate of 20 000 fps with shutter time 50 μs each data set contained 2000 images that covered 0 1 s of observation rough image size was 128 504 pixels and spatial resolution was 0 08 mm pixel illumination was provided by a 2000 w halogen lamp placed in front of the camera as a result cavitation cloud appeared as the bright region in image while the black part corresponded to the liquid phase during the experiments film would not begin until the upstream pressure reached the set value a hydrophone brüel kjær type 8105 was placed 80 mm from nozzle at the same height to record the cavitation noise hydrophone and cold water tube were placed at different circumferential positions 2 3 erosion specimen the specimen used for erosion test was pure aluminum disks chinese standard 1060 the chemical composition and physical properties are listed in tables 1 and 2 the diameter was 100 mm while the height was 8 mm as suggested by kim et al 2014 the surface of specimen was deliberately polished and the surface roughness ra was less than 1 μm measured by a laser microscope keyence vk x160k the initial mass was measured by an electronic balance resolution 0 1 mg after each erosion test the specimen was air dried and weighted again to calculate mass loss every data point of mass loss was the average of three repetition experiments eroded specimen were also scanned by the laser microscope 2 4 image processing using pod in order to remove possible non uniform illumination and lens blur each data set of images were subtracted by corresponding background images which were taken before cavitation jet was initiated images were clipped to highlight cavitation cloud and were transformed into gray scale images each pixel on image was represented by a gray value between 0 black and 255 white then the data sets were processed with pod pod was firstly adopted to study turbulent flow by lumley 1967 who applied this method to analyze transient velocity fields large scale structures that contribute to a flow field can be highlighted by low order pod modes pod is essentially a linear approximation method which disintegrates transient vector field and scalar field into the sum of a series of orthonormal basis functions modes φ m and corresponding weighting coefficients chatterjee 2000 chen et al 2013 modes contain spatial information while weighting coefficients contain temporal information about the filed field at a specific time is called a snapshot and the number of modes is equal to the number of snapshots in this paper the number of snapshots is 2000 which is much smaller than the number of spatial pixels thus the snapshot method proposed by sirovich 1987 was used each gray image of cavitation cloud can be regarded as a snapshot of gray level field g danlos et al 2014 prothin et al 2016 the principle is to decompose k snapshots g k into a linear combination of m modes and k m weighting coefficients c m k 1 g k m 1 m c m k φ m where φ m represents the mth pod mode this can be done as follows firstly represent the gray levels of all pixels in k snapshots with a two dimensional k i j matrix u 2 u u i 1 j 1 1 u i 1 j 2 1 u i 1 j j 1 u i 2 j 1 1 u i 2 j 2 1 u i i j j 1 u i 1 j 1 2 u i 1 j 2 2 u i 1 j j 2 u i 2 j 1 2 u i 2 j 2 2 u i i j j 2 u i 1 j 1 k u i 1 j 2 k u i 1 j j k u i 2 j 1 k u i 2 j 2 k u i i j j k u i 1 j 1 k u i 1 j 2 k u i 1 j j k u i 2 j 1 k u i 2 j 2 k u i i j j k where u i j k is the gray level of a pixel with position i j in kth snapshot i and j are the number of pixels in horizontal vertical axis of an image representing its geometrical size then the spatial correlation matrix w is 3 w 1 k u u t the sequence of orthonormal modes that reflect the basic structures of the dynamic field are determined by solving following equations 4 k 1 k g k m 1 m c m k φ m f min φ i φ j δ i j 0 i j 1 i j where f is frobenius norm this is done in two steps 1 find the eigenvalues λ m and eigenvectors β m of w 5 w β m λ m β m 2 project u onto each eigenvector β m m 1 2 m modes are the normalized projections the weighting coefficients are computed by projecting the original snapshots onto modes which are presented as a matrix 6 c c 1 1 c 2 1 c m 1 c 1 2 c 2 2 c m 2 c 1 k c 2 k c m k where c m k represents the contribution of mth mode to the reconstruction of kth snapshot k m modes embody the basic compositions of the field snapshots can be reconstructed through eq 1 i e summing the products of every mode and corresponding coefficients here modes of gray level field illustrate the fundamental compositions of cavitation cloud in particular if the process is dominated by a periodic behavior low order modes should be organized in pairs which represent of the same orthogonal component of the periodic phenomenon graftieaux et al 2001 in velocity field k e m 0 5 k 1 k c m k 2 can be interpreted as the kinetic energy per unit mass included in the mth mode berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 the energy fraction ef k e m is then defined as 7 k e m k e m m 1 m k e m which reflects the degree of contribution of each mode to the reconstructions of all snapshots modes are arranged with decreasing ef begin with mode 1 in this paper a statistical decomposition is considered converged if an increase in the number of snapshots leads to nearly the same efs for low order modes 3 results and discussion 3 1 periodic behavior of cavitation cloud fig 2 displays a typical behavior of cavitation cloud in about one cycle which clearly shows inception transition shedding and collapse soyama 2005 watanabe et al 2016 the unsteady behavior of cavitation cloud is thought to be closely related to the complex pressure gradient in jet shear layer gray level is proportional to the local vapor fraction de giorgi et al 2013 the initiation of a new cavitation cloud happens at about 0 ms while the former cavitation cloud near the specimen has totally collapsed the new cloud grows and rapidly moves downstream beginning to contact specimen at 0 4 ms when cavitation bubbles reach specimen surface the stagnation pressure will lead to the collapse of bubbles which finally cause cavitation erosion the destructive collapse of massive cavitation bubbles continues from 0 5 to 1 15 ms the re entrant motion shrinking of the upper part of cavitation cloud before shedding is pointed by arrow a hutli et al 2016 sato et al 2009b around 1 ms the shedding of cavitation cloud occurs the bump shape protrusions as that shown in dot square b are the projections of large three dimensional cavitation structures which have strong link to the coherent structures in shear layer guoyi and shimizu 2013 hoyt and taylor 1981 hutli et al 2017 ran and katz 1994 soyama et al 2009 compared with the situation without specimen a major difference is that the collapse of cavitation cloud happens before shedding due to the faster recovery of local pressure however as mentioned before fig 2 cannot be regarded as a fair representation of the cavitation cloud in a global sense although all cycles contain four stages noteworthy difference of cavitation intensity as well as the duration in individual stages can be found in different cycles 3 2 pod results a convergence test allows to determine the number of snapshots that is necessary to validate pod as shown in fig 3 2000 snapshots is enough to achieve good convergence in present gray level field modes efs represent their degree of contribution to the reconstruction of all cavitation cloud snapshots the first 5 pod modes and their efs at nsd 33 3 200 are shown in figs 4 6 in general for all cases more than 90 of total efs is possessed by the first five modes which are the fundamental compositions of cavitation cloud gray level filed most of the modes are symmetrically distributed around jet center line this agrees with the results of watanabe et al 2015b the 1st modes with ef larger than 78 are very similar to the ensemble average gray level fields as mentioned before that low order modes 2 5 are organized in pairs is the evidence of periodic behavior of the cavitation cloud in cavitation jet callenaere et al 2001 modes 2 comprise two counter rotating lobe like structures while modes 3 represent the same structures with a delay spatial shift to downstream direction this is a classical feature of cavitation shedding prothin et al 2016 higher order modes also follow this rule except that under small nsds the structures can shift to horizontal direction possibly due to the interference of specimen when nsd is 33 3 mode 1 shows the direct contact of cavitation cloud with the specimen besides mode 2 and 3 also show the massive distribution of cavitation cloud at specimen surface as nsd increases cavitation cloud cannot reach specimen in mode 1 and the mode that captures the extensive contact between cavitation cloud and specimen gradually shifts to higher order e g the 3rd mode when nsd are 66 7 and 100 the 5th mode when nsd are 133 3 166 7 and 200 additionally the vapor fraction at specimen surface valued from gray value is decreasing meaning less cavitation bubbles could reach and collapse at specimen surface in this way if we assume that the damage potential of cavitation cloud is the same and predict the intensity of cavitation erosion only based on pod modes it may lead to an elusive conclusion that cavitation erosion should decrease with increasing nsd however as demonstrated by the next sections this is not the truth nevertheless pod modes do successfully predict the area of cavitation erosion on specimen the contact lengths between cavitation cloud and specimen which are the side projections capturing the collapse area of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface are marked in modes that captures the conspicuous contact between the two figs 4 6 a satisfying agreement is achieved between the contact lengths and the diameters of erosion rings fig 10 it seems present results are more credible than the time difference images used by watanabe et al 2016 where only a few of images were selected to represent the whole erosion process 3 3 cavitation noise cavitation noise results from the collapse of cavitation bubbles noise magnitude can be used to measure the intensity of cavitation bubbles collapse to exclude the influence of mechanical noise the background noise of experimental system under non submerge condition was measure multiple times and the mean noise value was subtracted from original records the filtered hydrophone signals and acoustic power of cavitation noise are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively note that hydrophone recorded the cavitation noise in the whole flow filed not only that near specimen surface it is found that cavitation noise firstly increases and then converges with nsd this means that although a large number of cavitation bubbles do reach the specimen under small nsd fig 4 their collapse is much less intensive due to premature size and only have limited damage potential that can hardly lead to obvious cavitation erosion alehossein and qin 2007 qin et al 2007 as shown in fig 10 on the other hand under large nsds a majority of bubble collapse happen far from the specimen figs 5 and 6 and cannot induce any damage lauterborn and bolle 1975 philipp and lauterborn 1998 vogel et al 1989 so the maximum cavitation damage shall happen in an intermediate nsd where a good balance between collapse intensity and bubble concentration is realized at specimen surface 3 4 mass loss and erosion patterns the mass loss of specimen under different nsds and exposure times to cavitation jet is given in fig 9 as nsd increases mass loss falls from the first peak rises to a second peak and finally falls again the double peaks of mass loss is a unique characteristic of cavitation jet momma and lichtarowicz 1995 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 yamauchi et al 1995 the first peak is attributed to high speed water jet while the second jet is the result of severe cavitation damage in present study the optimal nsd for cavitation erosion is 91 7 the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of specimen after being eroded for 1200 s are presented in figs 10 and 11 the areas for microscopic observation are the blue squares highlighted in fig 10 the change of erosion pattern is conspicuous under small nsds fig 10 a and b the central hole eroded by water jet is huge and accounts for almost all the mass loss while the effect of cavitation is trivial in terms of mass loss it is believed that under small nsds cavitation bubbles does not have much time to grow before they reach the target consequently cavitation bubbles that collapse at specimen surface are simply not large enough to cause significant damage in spite of this cavitation bubbles does change the surface morphology around central hole leaving shallow craters pear skin surface fig 11 a as nsd increases the erosion ability of water jet steeply attenuates while the influence of cavitation becomes increasingly important when nsd is 66 7 fig 10 c cavitation erosion in the form of a lot of hemispheric pits is observable a typical ring shape distribution of cavitation pits is obtained an undamaged zone exists between the cavitation ring and central hole fig 11 b the central hole is much smaller at the optimal cavitation nsd 91 7 where the collapse intensity and bubble concentration is well balanced the cavitation erosion is most remarkable most cavitation pits are much deeper than the central hole their edge rises higher above the original surface due to plastic flow of metal fig 11 c as nsd further increases fig 10 e h both the macroscopic diameter and microscopic pit size of erosion ring decreases the undamaged zone gradually disappears because of the closure of shear layer forming canyon like morphology fig 11 d the attenuation of cavitation erosion at large nsd results from two facts 1 less cavitation bubbles are able to reach the specimen as shown by the fading shade at specimen surface in figs 5 and 6 2 even for cavitation bubbles that successfully reach the target their damage potential is highly restrained after several cycles of collapse and rebound brennen 2013 on the other hand assuming there is no velocity slip between cavitation bubbles and waterjet guoyi et al 2016 under small nsd cavitation nuclei just don t have enough time to grow into large size before they reach the target alehossein and qin 2007 qin et al 2007 note that microscopically cavitation erosion is caused by micro jet and shock wave resulting from single cavitation bubble collapse under the same hydraulic conditions the intensity of micro jet and shock wave are decided by the maximum size of cavitation bubble before collapse choi and chahine 2016 field et al 2012 pöhl et al 2015 tomita and shima 1986 in this way although a lot of cavitation bubbles do reach and collapse at specimen surface fig 4 their size are just too small to cause serious damage this suggests that the collapse of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion pod modes alone can only capture the area of cavitation erosion but fail to predict the intensity of cavitation erosion nevertheless a qualitative correlation between mass loss and the energy fraction of mode 1 is found fig 12 it is possible to use the energy fraction of mode 1 as an indicator to find the optimal nsd for cavitation jet the evolution of cavitation erosion is depicted from both macroscopic fig 13 and microscopic fig 14 perspectives figs 13 and 14 are not the consecutive images of one single specimen but from 6 specimen being exposed to cavitation jet for specific times in the beginning only shallow craters are visible on specimen surface fig 14 a which are mainly plastic deformation as exposure time increases at macroscopic level the diameter of central hole and cavitation ring both increase and finally converge after 960 s fig 13 from microscopic aspect the expansion of cavitation erosion is through 1 the growth of single cavitation pits in depth and diameter as they are impacted by continuous bubble collapse and 2 the connection of adjacent pits when they are close enough to each others the red circles in fig 14 d and e capture the connection process of cavitation pits the ridges between pits are preferable sites for bubble collapse because of their protruding shape therefore the ridges get thinner and finally vanish forming bigger cavitation pits like the one shown in fig 14 f 4 conclusion in present study high speed visualization and erosion test of cavitation jet were performed at the same time the temporal and spatial distributions of cavitation cloud were analyzed using pod pod modes are able to highlight the spatial characteristics of cavitation cloud in cavitation jet low order pod modes are organized in pairs which confirms the periodicity of cavitation phenomenon compared with the time difference shadowgraph images watanabe et al 2016 the spatial modes of 2000 side view images are more credible to estimate the maximum radial distribution of cavitation pits but they alone cannot be used to evaluate the intensity of cavitation erosion the collapse of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion the intensity of cavitation erosion is decided by both the bubble concentration at specimen can be estimated from pod and the collapse intensity estimated from cavitation noise at a proper nsd in this case 91 7 where collapse intensity and bubble concentration are well balanced maximum cavitation erosion is achieved the morphology of eroded specimen are analyzed from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives damage pattern changes with nsd under small nsd cavitation erosion is trivial while the central hole eroded by high speed water jet is the dominant contributor for mass loss as nsd increases cavitation erosion rises and then falls while the erosion of water jet monotonically attenuates typical ring shape distribution of cavitation pits can be obtained at medium nsds high speed visualization can provide hints for the erosion ability of cavitation jet the energy fraction of pod mode 1 derived from temporal coefficients is proposed to be an indicator to decide the optimal nsd from a microscopic point of view the aggravation of cavitation erosion is the jointed results of the growth of single cavitation pits and the connection of adjacent pits the ridges and protrusions are preferable sites for bubble collapse acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant number u1562212 and chinese ministry of science and technology grant

23651,cavitation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in ocean engineering in order to figure out the relationship between cavitation cloud and cavitation erosion high speed visualization and erosion test of cavitation jet were simultaneously performed the temporal and spatial distributions of cavitation cloud was analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition pod and the morphology of eroded specimen was analyzed from both macroscopic and microcosmic perspectives the results show that pod modes of side view images are able to estimate the maximum radial distribution of cavitation pits while the energy fraction of the first pod mode can serve as an indicator of specimen mass loss the intensity of cavitation erosion is decided by both the bubble concentration and collapse intensity at specimen surface at a medium standoff distance where collapse intensity and bubble concentration are well compromised maximum cavitation erosion is achieved the aggravation of cavitation erosion is the combined consequences of the growth of single cavitation pits and the connection of adjacent pits these results suggest that the collapse of cavitation bubbles is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion the findings are expected to improve the physical understanding of the relationship between cavitation phenomenon and cavitation damage keywords cavitation jet high speed visualization proper orthogonal decomposition erosion test laser microscope 1 introduction cavitation is a common phenomenon in ocean engineering which was firstly observed by reynolds 1894 and gained growing attention after parsons and cook 1919 recognized it as the source of severe erosion of warship propellers cavitation happens when vapor cavities called cavitation bubbles are formed in liquid this is realized by dropping local pressure below saturated vapor pressure crum 1982 mørch 2009 when subjected to high pressure cavitation bubble collapses generating extremely high local pressure and temperature up to several gpa and thousands of k alehossein and qin 2007 choi and chahine 2016 franc et al 2011 if a cavitation bubble collapses close enough to a solid wall it will induce high speed micro jet and shock waves benjamin and ellis 1966 minsier et al 2009 momma and lichtarowicz 1995 tomita and shima 1986 which can cause permanent deformation pits or craters at material surface once their aggressiveness exceeds the threshold decided by material properties choi et al 2014 hsiao et al 2014 pöhl et al 2015 marine equipment such as rudder and propeller are typical parts that suffer from cavitation damage cavitation can also cause noise vibration and low efficiency in fluid machinery arndt 1981 although cavitation is not welcomed in most of engineering situations cavitation jet that takes advantage of the energy of cavitation bubble collapse has enjoyed extensive researches and applications since 1980s cavitation is firstly induced in nozzle throat where local pressure drops dramatically due to bernoulli s principle microscopic roughness of nozzle inner surface small solid impurities and dissolved gases in the liquid provide sites for heterogeneous nucleation holl 1970 mørch 2007 cavitation bubbles travel with water jet and then expand in shear layer where turbulent pressure can be very low forming coalesce called cavitation cloud as cavitation bubbles approach the target local pressure will recover and bubbles will collapse at target surface leading to cavitation damage it has been proven that cavitation jet can clean the underwater pipelines of offshore oil platforms improve drilling rate of petroleum wells gensheng et al 2005 johnson et al 1984 and perform shotless peening soyama et al 2011 et al it also serves as an efficient way to decide material s resistance to cavitation erosion g134 95 2006 among the researches on cavitation jet there are two popular ways erosion test and high speed visualization erosion test focuses on the mass loss damage pattern and failure mechanism of test samples many researches have been done concerning the effects of relevant factors on the erosion results of cavitation jet chahine and courbiere 1987 hattori et al 2006 hutli et al 2016 2017 kim et al 2014 li et al 2016 2017 soyama 2013 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 watanabe et al 2016 yamaguchi and shimizu 1987 yamauchi et al 1995 including nozzle geometry upstream pressure standoff distance cavitation number fluid temperature et al the double peaks of mass loss along standoff distance and ring shape distribution of spherical cavitation pits were recognized as representative features of cavitation jet on the other hand high speed visualization directly observes the cavitation cloud in cavitation jet collapse of cavitation cloud is closely related to cavitation erosion high speed photography was firstly adopted by chahine et al 1987 who found there was periodic shedding of cavitation cloud in cavitation jet a typical cycle of cavitation cloud contains four stages inception transition shedding and collapse hydraulic conditions such as upstream pressure and cavitation number would affect the size and shedding frequency of cavitation cloud afterwards soyama et al 1995 used high speed photography to visualize cavitation jet from conical cylindrical and horn nozzles they observed that the shedding frequency of cavitation cloud decreased while the maximum length of cavitation cloud increased with upstream pressure hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 agreed on the inverse relationship between upstream pressure and shedding frequency nishimura et al 2012 decided the similarity law between shedding frequency and hydraulic conditions by high speed visualization wright et al 2013 investigated the size traveling distance shedding frequency and front velocity of cavitation cloud under different reynolds numbers utilizing frame difference method sato and cooperators hayashi and sato 2014 saito and sato 2006 sato et al 2009a argued that the re entrant jet formed by the downstream cavitation cloud collapse was responsible for the shedding of cavitation cloud issued from horn type nozzle this theory that re entrant jet periodically pinches off cavitation cloud at nozzle exit was accepted by some researches stanley et al 2011 2014 watanabe et al 2016 and it is very similar to the cavitation cloud shedding mechanism above hydrofoils dular et al 2005 recently there were attempts to find the link between the behavior of cavitation cloud and cavitation erosion several pioneering works have been done dular et al 2004 conducted optical observation of cavitation structures above hydrofoils and an obvious correlation between cavitation structures and cavitation erosion was found the position and distribution of pits on hydrofoil surface correlated to the distribution of the images standard deviation of gray level later on petkovšek and dular 2013 presented a study about simultaneous observations of cavitation structures and cavitation erosion besides demonstrating the cause and effect between cavitation cloud collapse and cavitation erosion they also found that the topology of cavitation cloud before collapse played a major role in erosion in cavitation jet watanabe et al 2016 experimentally studied the variations of cavitation cloud structure and erosion characteristics they found the erosion distribution on specimen can be reproduced in the time difference images of the cavitation cloud shadowgraphs hutli et al 2017 proved that the distribution of cavitation bubble collapse at sample surface well matched the area of ring shape erosion however previous works about cavitation jet hutli et al 2016 2017 sato et al 2013 soyama 2005 watanabe et al 2016 usually used a couple of images from one or two cycles to represent the global behavior of cavitation cloud which we think is defective although cavitation cloud has an obviously periodic behavior they does not behave exactly the same in different cycles in terms of size and duration in most experiments plunger pumps were used to provide upstream pressure and the fluctuation of pump pressure cannot be avoid wright et al 2013 thus cavitation cloud appears differently in high pressure and low pressure phases peng et al 2016 sato et al 2013 to accurately reflect the spatial distribution of cavitation cloud it is necessary to introduce an approach that contains statistical ideas in present study proper orthogonal decomposition pod was used pod is a method that can distinguish spatial and temporal coherent structures in flow field it decomposes a time series of vector or scalar field into a set of basic spatial modes and temporal coefficients chatterjee 2000 holmes et al 1998 pod enjoys applications in many domains such as data compression signal analysis image processing and fluid mechanics berkooz et al 1993 chen et al 2012 fogleman et al 2004 watanabe et al 2015a recently pod was introduced to the study of cavitation flow utturkar et al 2005 applied pod to characterize the difference between cavitation models danlos et al 2014 proposed to use energy fraction of the second pod mode to distinguish different cavitation regimes in a convergent divergent nozzle prothin et al 2016 highlighted the spatial and temporal behavior of cavitation cloud on a hydrofoil at high reynolds number using pod for cavitation jet watanabe et al 2015b obtained the spatial modes showing cavitation cloud distribution it was found that cavitation cloud resided around center jet in an axisymmetric manner this paper is going to address the temporal and spatial characteristics of cavitation cloud the erosion ability of cavitation jet and the relationship between the two it is hoped that present work can improve the physical understanding of the cavitation phenomenon and cavitation damage of cavitation jet the experimental setup and data processing method are detailed in section 2 section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the results and analysis periodic behavior of cavitation cloud pod results cavitation noise erosion patterns and their correlations 2 material and methods 2 1 test rig and experiment conditions the joint experiments of high speed observation and erosion test were carried out at high pressure water jet laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing the test rig is schematically depicted in fig 1 a a high pressure plunger pump kmt streamline sl v50 with an inbuilt bladder accumulator provided the upstream pressure which could be read from a pressure gauge accuracy 0 3 fs at pump outlet the pressure loss along the pipelines was ignored a turbine flowmeter accuracy 0 5 fs was used to measure the flow rate a cylindrical nozzle fig 1 b was used with throat diameter of 0 3 mm a cylindrical water vessel made of transparent acrylic resin with diameter of 35 cm and height of 25 cm was used to produce submerge condition the lateral and axial coordinates x and y were defined with the origin set at the nozzle exit standoff distance y can be adjusted at a resolution of 0 1 mm and the non dimensional standoff distance nsd is defined as y throat diameter in all experiments upstream pressure was set at 50 mpa flow rate was 0 96 0 05 l min nozzle discharge coefficient was about 0 71 cavitation number σ p d o w n s t r e a m p v a p o u r 0 5 ρ v t h r o a t 2 is 0 038 standoff distances ranging from 2 5 to 60 mm nsd 8 3 200 were investigated tap water was used and additional cold water was injected to the vessel through a tube with diameter 25 mm water temperature in the vessel was maintained at 20 23 c during the experiments measured by an infrared thermometer resolution 0 5 c maximum error 1 c thus the effect of water thermal properties was minimized dular 2016 hattori et al 2006 2013 the water in supply tank was prepared a day before experiment and exposed to atmosphere for 24 h and the water temperature and the concentration of cavitation nuclei in terms of dissolved gas were thought to be constant for tank water there would be more cavitation nuclei after experiments which resulted from the collapsed cavitation bubbles to keep a constant water quality the water in vessel was replaced by fresh tank water and stayed still for 10 min before next test 2 2 record of data sets a high speed camera phantom v310 lens af80 200mmf 2 8d was used to visualize the cavitation cloud from side view the camera was operated at a frame rate of 20 000 fps with shutter time 50 μs each data set contained 2000 images that covered 0 1 s of observation rough image size was 128 504 pixels and spatial resolution was 0 08 mm pixel illumination was provided by a 2000 w halogen lamp placed in front of the camera as a result cavitation cloud appeared as the bright region in image while the black part corresponded to the liquid phase during the experiments film would not begin until the upstream pressure reached the set value a hydrophone brüel kjær type 8105 was placed 80 mm from nozzle at the same height to record the cavitation noise hydrophone and cold water tube were placed at different circumferential positions 2 3 erosion specimen the specimen used for erosion test was pure aluminum disks chinese standard 1060 the chemical composition and physical properties are listed in tables 1 and 2 the diameter was 100 mm while the height was 8 mm as suggested by kim et al 2014 the surface of specimen was deliberately polished and the surface roughness ra was less than 1 μm measured by a laser microscope keyence vk x160k the initial mass was measured by an electronic balance resolution 0 1 mg after each erosion test the specimen was air dried and weighted again to calculate mass loss every data point of mass loss was the average of three repetition experiments eroded specimen were also scanned by the laser microscope 2 4 image processing using pod in order to remove possible non uniform illumination and lens blur each data set of images were subtracted by corresponding background images which were taken before cavitation jet was initiated images were clipped to highlight cavitation cloud and were transformed into gray scale images each pixel on image was represented by a gray value between 0 black and 255 white then the data sets were processed with pod pod was firstly adopted to study turbulent flow by lumley 1967 who applied this method to analyze transient velocity fields large scale structures that contribute to a flow field can be highlighted by low order pod modes pod is essentially a linear approximation method which disintegrates transient vector field and scalar field into the sum of a series of orthonormal basis functions modes φ m and corresponding weighting coefficients chatterjee 2000 chen et al 2013 modes contain spatial information while weighting coefficients contain temporal information about the filed field at a specific time is called a snapshot and the number of modes is equal to the number of snapshots in this paper the number of snapshots is 2000 which is much smaller than the number of spatial pixels thus the snapshot method proposed by sirovich 1987 was used each gray image of cavitation cloud can be regarded as a snapshot of gray level field g danlos et al 2014 prothin et al 2016 the principle is to decompose k snapshots g k into a linear combination of m modes and k m weighting coefficients c m k 1 g k m 1 m c m k φ m where φ m represents the mth pod mode this can be done as follows firstly represent the gray levels of all pixels in k snapshots with a two dimensional k i j matrix u 2 u u i 1 j 1 1 u i 1 j 2 1 u i 1 j j 1 u i 2 j 1 1 u i 2 j 2 1 u i i j j 1 u i 1 j 1 2 u i 1 j 2 2 u i 1 j j 2 u i 2 j 1 2 u i 2 j 2 2 u i i j j 2 u i 1 j 1 k u i 1 j 2 k u i 1 j j k u i 2 j 1 k u i 2 j 2 k u i i j j k u i 1 j 1 k u i 1 j 2 k u i 1 j j k u i 2 j 1 k u i 2 j 2 k u i i j j k where u i j k is the gray level of a pixel with position i j in kth snapshot i and j are the number of pixels in horizontal vertical axis of an image representing its geometrical size then the spatial correlation matrix w is 3 w 1 k u u t the sequence of orthonormal modes that reflect the basic structures of the dynamic field are determined by solving following equations 4 k 1 k g k m 1 m c m k φ m f min φ i φ j δ i j 0 i j 1 i j where f is frobenius norm this is done in two steps 1 find the eigenvalues λ m and eigenvectors β m of w 5 w β m λ m β m 2 project u onto each eigenvector β m m 1 2 m modes are the normalized projections the weighting coefficients are computed by projecting the original snapshots onto modes which are presented as a matrix 6 c c 1 1 c 2 1 c m 1 c 1 2 c 2 2 c m 2 c 1 k c 2 k c m k where c m k represents the contribution of mth mode to the reconstruction of kth snapshot k m modes embody the basic compositions of the field snapshots can be reconstructed through eq 1 i e summing the products of every mode and corresponding coefficients here modes of gray level field illustrate the fundamental compositions of cavitation cloud in particular if the process is dominated by a periodic behavior low order modes should be organized in pairs which represent of the same orthogonal component of the periodic phenomenon graftieaux et al 2001 in velocity field k e m 0 5 k 1 k c m k 2 can be interpreted as the kinetic energy per unit mass included in the mth mode berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 the energy fraction ef k e m is then defined as 7 k e m k e m m 1 m k e m which reflects the degree of contribution of each mode to the reconstructions of all snapshots modes are arranged with decreasing ef begin with mode 1 in this paper a statistical decomposition is considered converged if an increase in the number of snapshots leads to nearly the same efs for low order modes 3 results and discussion 3 1 periodic behavior of cavitation cloud fig 2 displays a typical behavior of cavitation cloud in about one cycle which clearly shows inception transition shedding and collapse soyama 2005 watanabe et al 2016 the unsteady behavior of cavitation cloud is thought to be closely related to the complex pressure gradient in jet shear layer gray level is proportional to the local vapor fraction de giorgi et al 2013 the initiation of a new cavitation cloud happens at about 0 ms while the former cavitation cloud near the specimen has totally collapsed the new cloud grows and rapidly moves downstream beginning to contact specimen at 0 4 ms when cavitation bubbles reach specimen surface the stagnation pressure will lead to the collapse of bubbles which finally cause cavitation erosion the destructive collapse of massive cavitation bubbles continues from 0 5 to 1 15 ms the re entrant motion shrinking of the upper part of cavitation cloud before shedding is pointed by arrow a hutli et al 2016 sato et al 2009b around 1 ms the shedding of cavitation cloud occurs the bump shape protrusions as that shown in dot square b are the projections of large three dimensional cavitation structures which have strong link to the coherent structures in shear layer guoyi and shimizu 2013 hoyt and taylor 1981 hutli et al 2017 ran and katz 1994 soyama et al 2009 compared with the situation without specimen a major difference is that the collapse of cavitation cloud happens before shedding due to the faster recovery of local pressure however as mentioned before fig 2 cannot be regarded as a fair representation of the cavitation cloud in a global sense although all cycles contain four stages noteworthy difference of cavitation intensity as well as the duration in individual stages can be found in different cycles 3 2 pod results a convergence test allows to determine the number of snapshots that is necessary to validate pod as shown in fig 3 2000 snapshots is enough to achieve good convergence in present gray level field modes efs represent their degree of contribution to the reconstruction of all cavitation cloud snapshots the first 5 pod modes and their efs at nsd 33 3 200 are shown in figs 4 6 in general for all cases more than 90 of total efs is possessed by the first five modes which are the fundamental compositions of cavitation cloud gray level filed most of the modes are symmetrically distributed around jet center line this agrees with the results of watanabe et al 2015b the 1st modes with ef larger than 78 are very similar to the ensemble average gray level fields as mentioned before that low order modes 2 5 are organized in pairs is the evidence of periodic behavior of the cavitation cloud in cavitation jet callenaere et al 2001 modes 2 comprise two counter rotating lobe like structures while modes 3 represent the same structures with a delay spatial shift to downstream direction this is a classical feature of cavitation shedding prothin et al 2016 higher order modes also follow this rule except that under small nsds the structures can shift to horizontal direction possibly due to the interference of specimen when nsd is 33 3 mode 1 shows the direct contact of cavitation cloud with the specimen besides mode 2 and 3 also show the massive distribution of cavitation cloud at specimen surface as nsd increases cavitation cloud cannot reach specimen in mode 1 and the mode that captures the extensive contact between cavitation cloud and specimen gradually shifts to higher order e g the 3rd mode when nsd are 66 7 and 100 the 5th mode when nsd are 133 3 166 7 and 200 additionally the vapor fraction at specimen surface valued from gray value is decreasing meaning less cavitation bubbles could reach and collapse at specimen surface in this way if we assume that the damage potential of cavitation cloud is the same and predict the intensity of cavitation erosion only based on pod modes it may lead to an elusive conclusion that cavitation erosion should decrease with increasing nsd however as demonstrated by the next sections this is not the truth nevertheless pod modes do successfully predict the area of cavitation erosion on specimen the contact lengths between cavitation cloud and specimen which are the side projections capturing the collapse area of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface are marked in modes that captures the conspicuous contact between the two figs 4 6 a satisfying agreement is achieved between the contact lengths and the diameters of erosion rings fig 10 it seems present results are more credible than the time difference images used by watanabe et al 2016 where only a few of images were selected to represent the whole erosion process 3 3 cavitation noise cavitation noise results from the collapse of cavitation bubbles noise magnitude can be used to measure the intensity of cavitation bubbles collapse to exclude the influence of mechanical noise the background noise of experimental system under non submerge condition was measure multiple times and the mean noise value was subtracted from original records the filtered hydrophone signals and acoustic power of cavitation noise are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively note that hydrophone recorded the cavitation noise in the whole flow filed not only that near specimen surface it is found that cavitation noise firstly increases and then converges with nsd this means that although a large number of cavitation bubbles do reach the specimen under small nsd fig 4 their collapse is much less intensive due to premature size and only have limited damage potential that can hardly lead to obvious cavitation erosion alehossein and qin 2007 qin et al 2007 as shown in fig 10 on the other hand under large nsds a majority of bubble collapse happen far from the specimen figs 5 and 6 and cannot induce any damage lauterborn and bolle 1975 philipp and lauterborn 1998 vogel et al 1989 so the maximum cavitation damage shall happen in an intermediate nsd where a good balance between collapse intensity and bubble concentration is realized at specimen surface 3 4 mass loss and erosion patterns the mass loss of specimen under different nsds and exposure times to cavitation jet is given in fig 9 as nsd increases mass loss falls from the first peak rises to a second peak and finally falls again the double peaks of mass loss is a unique characteristic of cavitation jet momma and lichtarowicz 1995 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 yamauchi et al 1995 the first peak is attributed to high speed water jet while the second jet is the result of severe cavitation damage in present study the optimal nsd for cavitation erosion is 91 7 the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of specimen after being eroded for 1200 s are presented in figs 10 and 11 the areas for microscopic observation are the blue squares highlighted in fig 10 the change of erosion pattern is conspicuous under small nsds fig 10 a and b the central hole eroded by water jet is huge and accounts for almost all the mass loss while the effect of cavitation is trivial in terms of mass loss it is believed that under small nsds cavitation bubbles does not have much time to grow before they reach the target consequently cavitation bubbles that collapse at specimen surface are simply not large enough to cause significant damage in spite of this cavitation bubbles does change the surface morphology around central hole leaving shallow craters pear skin surface fig 11 a as nsd increases the erosion ability of water jet steeply attenuates while the influence of cavitation becomes increasingly important when nsd is 66 7 fig 10 c cavitation erosion in the form of a lot of hemispheric pits is observable a typical ring shape distribution of cavitation pits is obtained an undamaged zone exists between the cavitation ring and central hole fig 11 b the central hole is much smaller at the optimal cavitation nsd 91 7 where the collapse intensity and bubble concentration is well balanced the cavitation erosion is most remarkable most cavitation pits are much deeper than the central hole their edge rises higher above the original surface due to plastic flow of metal fig 11 c as nsd further increases fig 10 e h both the macroscopic diameter and microscopic pit size of erosion ring decreases the undamaged zone gradually disappears because of the closure of shear layer forming canyon like morphology fig 11 d the attenuation of cavitation erosion at large nsd results from two facts 1 less cavitation bubbles are able to reach the specimen as shown by the fading shade at specimen surface in figs 5 and 6 2 even for cavitation bubbles that successfully reach the target their damage potential is highly restrained after several cycles of collapse and rebound brennen 2013 on the other hand assuming there is no velocity slip between cavitation bubbles and waterjet guoyi et al 2016 under small nsd cavitation nuclei just don t have enough time to grow into large size before they reach the target alehossein and qin 2007 qin et al 2007 note that microscopically cavitation erosion is caused by micro jet and shock wave resulting from single cavitation bubble collapse under the same hydraulic conditions the intensity of micro jet and shock wave are decided by the maximum size of cavitation bubble before collapse choi and chahine 2016 field et al 2012 pöhl et al 2015 tomita and shima 1986 in this way although a lot of cavitation bubbles do reach and collapse at specimen surface fig 4 their size are just too small to cause serious damage this suggests that the collapse of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion pod modes alone can only capture the area of cavitation erosion but fail to predict the intensity of cavitation erosion nevertheless a qualitative correlation between mass loss and the energy fraction of mode 1 is found fig 12 it is possible to use the energy fraction of mode 1 as an indicator to find the optimal nsd for cavitation jet the evolution of cavitation erosion is depicted from both macroscopic fig 13 and microscopic fig 14 perspectives figs 13 and 14 are not the consecutive images of one single specimen but from 6 specimen being exposed to cavitation jet for specific times in the beginning only shallow craters are visible on specimen surface fig 14 a which are mainly plastic deformation as exposure time increases at macroscopic level the diameter of central hole and cavitation ring both increase and finally converge after 960 s fig 13 from microscopic aspect the expansion of cavitation erosion is through 1 the growth of single cavitation pits in depth and diameter as they are impacted by continuous bubble collapse and 2 the connection of adjacent pits when they are close enough to each others the red circles in fig 14 d and e capture the connection process of cavitation pits the ridges between pits are preferable sites for bubble collapse because of their protruding shape therefore the ridges get thinner and finally vanish forming bigger cavitation pits like the one shown in fig 14 f 4 conclusion in present study high speed visualization and erosion test of cavitation jet were performed at the same time the temporal and spatial distributions of cavitation cloud were analyzed using pod pod modes are able to highlight the spatial characteristics of cavitation cloud in cavitation jet low order pod modes are organized in pairs which confirms the periodicity of cavitation phenomenon compared with the time difference shadowgraph images watanabe et al 2016 the spatial modes of 2000 side view images are more credible to estimate the maximum radial distribution of cavitation pits but they alone cannot be used to evaluate the intensity of cavitation erosion the collapse of cavitation bubbles at specimen surface is a necessary but not sufficient condition for severe cavitation erosion the intensity of cavitation erosion is decided by both the bubble concentration at specimen can be estimated from pod and the collapse intensity estimated from cavitation noise at a proper nsd in this case 91 7 where collapse intensity and bubble concentration are well balanced maximum cavitation erosion is achieved the morphology of eroded specimen are analyzed from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives damage pattern changes with nsd under small nsd cavitation erosion is trivial while the central hole eroded by high speed water jet is the dominant contributor for mass loss as nsd increases cavitation erosion rises and then falls while the erosion of water jet monotonically attenuates typical ring shape distribution of cavitation pits can be obtained at medium nsds high speed visualization can provide hints for the erosion ability of cavitation jet the energy fraction of pod mode 1 derived from temporal coefficients is proposed to be an indicator to decide the optimal nsd from a microscopic point of view the aggravation of cavitation erosion is the jointed results of the growth of single cavitation pits and the connection of adjacent pits the ridges and protrusions are preferable sites for bubble collapse acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant number u1562212 and chinese ministry of science and technology grant

23652,with the characteristics of large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters it is difficult to control accurately the oil heating process in an oil replenishing device for deep sea hydraulic system four temperature control methods are presented and compared in this paper i e proportional integral derivative controller pid controller fuzzy pid controller smith fuzzy pid

with nearly no overshoot which further proves that the modified smith fuzzy pid controller is able to sufficiently meet the challenges of industrial applications containing varying system parameters keywords modified smith predictor fuzzy pid temperature control oil heating oil replenishing device 1 introduction hydraulic system has been widely used in deep sea devices due to its long service life stable and reliable performance however the impurities in hydraulic oil such as water and air bubbles could seriously damage the quality of hydraulic oil phillips 2006 and result in significant reduction of oil bulk modulus as well as mechanic motion precision which would yield the control error for deep sea hydraulic equipment thereafter we have developed an oil replenish device hao 2013 which has multi functions of oil suction filtration degasification dehydration and oil replenishing it is used to process the oil treatment and replenish the deep sea hydraulic system with the treated oil the whole device works in the laboratory base it is known that through vacuum filtration and heating operation water and air bubbles in hydraulic oil could be effectively removed because of the characteristics of large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of hydraulic oil heating system it is difficult to control accurately the oil temperature during heating process under work condition if the oil temperature exceeds 55 c the service life of hydraulic oil would be shortened by half when the temperature increases 8 c hao 2013 the oil temperature control still remains a challenge temperature control is a process of measuring detecting and adjusting temperatures to achieve a desired value it is widely used in industry sectors such as food processing and transportation central heating chemical engineering etc temperature control is a typical time delay case it is known that time delays have a deleterious effect on both the stability and performance of controlled systems and are generally harder to control unless the lag compensated udwadia et al 2003 so far two methods are acknowledged feasible to handle time delay one is model based control such as pid controller smith predictor robust control and the other is model free adaptive control such as smith fuzzy controller intelligent control zhang 2012 for temperature control in various occasions different control approaches were applied to eliminate the time delay phenomenon for temperature control of a central heating system a pd plus pi controller was proposed feeding back the environment temperature and the temperature of the heated room koumboulis and kouvakas 2010 a joint design method of closed loop identification and imc internal model control for the cooling temperature control system with input time delay was presented abe et al 2003 an expert system for the humidity and temperature control in hvac systems was brought forth using anfis artificial neural fuzzy interface system and optimization with fuzzy modeling approach soyguder and alli 2009 however with regard to the oil temperature control during the heating process to the author s knowledge little research has been done so far especially to tackle this challenge in our research to avoid the damage to oil quality caused by high temperature and to ensure the effective filtration as well four oil temperature control methods of an oil replenishing device are simulated and analyzed i e the pid controller the fuzzy pid controller the smith fuzzy pid controller and the modified smith fuzzy pid controller with its advantages of simple structure and easy operation pid controller is widely used in industrial production zhang et al 2011 esfahani et al 2015 skjong and pedersen 2016 fuzzy pid controller combining the conventional pid and the fuzzy rules identifies the fuzzy relation between pid controller parameters and system error error change rate fadaei and salahshoor 2008 then tunes the pid controller parameters by fuzzy rules smith predictor control proposed by o j m smith in 1957 feliu batlle et al 2013 deals with the problem of large time delay of system and connects a compensation link to the original controller in parallel in order to compensate pure lag process modified smith predictor has structural improvement by adding a first order filter to smith predator s uma and a seshagiri rao proposed a modified smith predictor which consists of a set point tracking controller and a disturbance rejection controller for the purpose of enhancing control of non minimum phase unstable second order time delay processes with without zero uma and rao 2016 based on two degree of freedom control structure yin proposed a modified smith predictor scheme for a class of unstable processes with time delay yin et al 2014 the modified smith predictor used in this paper was proposed by yang et al yang 2005 adding a first order filter to the original smith control loop to overcome the interference caused by inaccurate model and further to enhance the robustness of control system in this paper the oil heating process is simulated based on the above mentioned four controllers and their corresponding step response curves are obtained thereafter in the cases of model matching and mismatching after analyzing and comparing the curves through four indicators i e rise time settling time steady state error and maximum overshoot the modified smith fuzzy pid controller is proved to have the best control effect furthermore through pic16f877a mcu these four control methods are applied to the actual oil temperature control system in the oil replenishing device the experimental data of oil temperature changing over time also verifies that the modified smith fuzzy pid controller is able to meet the challenges of the oil temperature control process after a brief introduction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the structure of oil replenishing device is introduced in section 3 the mathematic model of the oil heating control system is presented and the relevant parameters are defined and set four control methods are illustrated and their simulation results are obtained compared and analyzed in section 4 the experimental process is described and the results analysis is carried out in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 oil replenishing device the device structure and entity are shown in fig 1 the oil replenishing device consists of a vacuum pump a high precision oil filter an immersion electrical heater and a vacuum tank with the capacity of 60 l oil the heater located near the bottom of tank has the maximum power of 2 kw to be adjusted by a designed program to let the oil be heated evenly the inner circulation is switched on during the heating process the steps of oil purification process are specifically listed as follows a connect the oil inlet pipe to an external oil tank open the vacuum pump and vacuumize the vacuum tank the internal and external pressure difference would cause the oil from the external oil tank to pass the high precision oil filter where the solid particles are filtered into the vacuum tank b close the inlet valve once the volume of oil in the vacuum tank reaches the set value keep the vacuum pump running to maintain a low pressure in the vacuum tank c start the electric heaters and heat the oil according to the preset control program in the heating and vacuum environment air nucleons would develop into air bubbles and deviate from oil quickly meanwhile compared with hydraulic oil water reaches first the saturated vapor pressure and thus could also be separated from oil in real operations only through controlling relay on and off it is hard to control the oil temperature rising speed and to maintain it at the expected value due to the large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of oil heating system in the operation process the oil temperature trends to deviate from the set value however excessive oil temperature would lead to oil molecules polymerize and thus further generate impurities which not only shortens oil service life but also spoils its quality lou 2014 on the other hand if oil temperature is lower than the set value air nucleus would develop inadequately resulting in air bubbles rising slowly and water hardly being evaporated from oil therefore to ensure the effective filtration as well as high oil quality the oil temperature needs to be controlled accurately by an intelligent control method 3 the mathematical model of oil heating system 3 1 the system transfer function since the mathematical model of the industrial process is often a high order model it is challenging to apply to controller design to simplify it to a first or second order transfer function while reserving the main characters of controlled system is more preferred rivas perez et al 2014 in a control system of residual oil outlet temperature in a coke furnace wu et al 2014 wu chose a general first order plus dead time model formulation obtained by a step response as its transfer function sun established a temperature control mathematical model by applying heat transfer theory a first order transfer function as well with pure lag sun et al 2015 in this paper the oil heating system is taken as the controlled object and has non vibration and self balance under step input its transfer function could be described as a first order transfer function g s shown in eq 1 with a time delay yang 2005 wang and shi 2011 which not only reserves the main features of controlled object but also facilitates the theoretical analysis and the real control operation 1 g s k t s 1 e τ s where k is amplification factor t is time constant τ is pure delayed time in this paper the parameters are obtained by step response method li 2014 3 2 system step response curve taking the electrical heater power p t as the system step input and the oil temperature f t as the system output we get the oil temperature time curve the environment temperature in the laboratory is 22 c the power of the heaters used to heat the oil is set at 1 kw with 20 l oil in the tank the temperature time data is shown in table 1 in order to remove air and water more effectively the expected temperature is set at 60 c in the research during oil purification process the curve shown in fig 2 is plotted from the data in table 1 the initial temperature is set 19 9 c as the coordinate origin so as to solve the parameters of the system s mathematical model conveniently 3 3 identification of transfer function parameters the first order approximation method was applied zheng et al 2014 in this paper and the system step response curve was used to identify the transfer function parameters the equations are shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 f t 1 0 39 h f t 2 0 63 h where f t is the oil temperature time curve shown in fig 2 and h t is the oil temperature time curve obtained by the mathematical model of system setting h f 59 8 c according to system step response curve it could be obtained that f t 1 23 32 f t 2 37 67 and t 1 303 03 t 2 528

59 t 4 980 81 and f t 3 0 55 f f t 4 0 87 f the verification condition is satisfied and the transfer function of hydraulic oil heating system is shown in eq 5 5 g s 22 8 451 85 1 e 77 11 s 4 the system controller research and simulation 4 1 pid controller pid controller is the basic and the most used module in discrete control system over 90 control loops were designed with pid method yin et al 2014 akbari hasanjani et al 2015 pid controller consists of proportional unit p integral unit i and differential unit d the basic equation of pid controller is shown in eq 6 6 u t k p e t 1 t i e t

integral coefficient and differential coefficient respectively in this paper the simulation model controlled by pid controller is established by matlab simulink shown in fig 3 where k p 0 2098 k i 0 000386 and k d 3 505 4 2 fuzzy pid controller fuzzy pid controller tunes pid three parameters by fuzzy controller consider the oil temperature error e and error change rate ec as input variables and δk p correction proportional gain δk i correction integral gain δk d correction derivative gain which adjust the values of pid parameters as output variables thus the whole fuzzy controller is a two input and three output system the fuzzy domain of e ec δk p δk i and δk d are selected from 6 to 6 the fuzzy subsets of input and output variables are nb nm ns zo ps pm pb where nb represents negative big nm is abbreviation of negative middle ns is negative small zo is zero ps is positive small pm is positive middle pb is positive big this paper adopts the mean of maximum method zheng et al 2014 to clear the fuzzy results and the membership function of input and output variables are all triangular displayed in fig 4 the fuzzy control rules are demonstrated in table 2 the fuzzy controller in this paper adopts mamdani fuzzy guo et al 2016 inference algorithm to reason and applies weighted mean method to deblur the fuzzy pid controller simulation model is shown in fig 5 4 3 smith fuzzy pid controller the smith predictor is used to correct the lag of the system sun et al 2015 at a given signal it estimates the dynamic characteristics of system under disturbances in advance and then compensates by the predictor to reduce system s overshoot and to shorten the adjustment process guo and liu 2003 through introducing the compensation link in system feedback loop smith predictor separates the pure lag link of controlled object from the other parts of control system the structure diagram of smith predictor is shown in fig 6 where r s is expected value of system y s is measured value of system g c s is the controller transfer function e τ m s is pure lag link g p s is mathematical model of system τ is lag time g m s is the mathematical model of smith predictor the function of smith predictive compensation is expressed as g m s 1 e τ s the transfer function of the control system is shown in eq 7 7 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g m 1 e τ m s g c s g p s e τ s if g p s g m s τ τ m then eq 7 could be rewritten as 8 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g p s since the closed loop part of eq 8 does not contain the pure lag link e τ s after the smith estimated compensation it no longer affects the characteristic equation of the system this control method has good control effect fig 7 shows the structure diagram of temperature control system based on smith fuzzy pid controller which combines the fuzzy pid controller and smith predictor this system not only possesses the fuzzy pid controller s advantage of good dynamic performance but also is able to compensate the system s time lag part by smith predictor consequently it is capable of enhancing the robustness of oil heating system and improving system s control performance sun et al 2010 the simulation model of smith fuzzy pid controller is shown in fig 8 however if g p s g m s τ τ m the item with time delay factor in the closed loop part of eq 7 would severely damage the control effect the compensation effect of smith predictor heavily depends on accurate mathematical model of system feliu batlle et al 2009 if there is margin error between the estimated model and the real model the control quality would deteriorate and even diverge duan 2010 for control system which lacks accurate mathematical model or has pure lag link and time varying parameters like oil heating processes smith predictor fails to obtain satisfactory control effect 4 4 modified smith predictor fuzzy pid controller the previous analysis shows that the conventional smith predictor can only effectively eliminate the negative effect of large time delay by obtaining an accurate mathematical model of controlled system for an oil heating system with large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters yamada et al 2010 it is difficult to obtain the accurate mathematical model in order to further reduce the requirement of model accuracy and achieve better control effect a first order filter is added to the original smith control loop to improve the control system s robustness and adaptability the structure diagram of modified smith predictor is shown in fig 9 where 1 t f s 1 is the form of the first order filter t f t m k c k m is the filter time constant t m is the predictor constant k c is g c s gain k m is smith predictor gain the closed loop system transfer function is shown in eq 9 9 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g m s g c s g p s e τ s g m s e τ m s 1 t f s 1 if g p s g m s τ τ m eq 9 is the same as the conventional smith predictor control program and the improved program has no effect on the system only the output response shifted by a pure lag time if g p s g m s τ τ m a first order inertial link 1 t f s 1 is introduced to the main feedback channel it functions as a buffer to mismatch predictor model t f could be adjusted to change the characteristic equation roots and therefore the performance of the control system could be improved accordingly benefitting to system stability yang 2005 when t f 0 the system is equivalent to the conventional smith predictor control system chen and yang 2007 the simulation model of modified smith fuzzy pid controller is shown in fig 10 where the value of t f is 8 by adjusting 4 5 analysis of simulation results in this paper the simulation results of pid controller fuzzy pid controller smith fuzzy pid controller modified smith fuzzy pid controller are presented and compared the initial oil temperature is 19 9 c and the oil temperature is expected to be 60 c thus the step size is 40 c the total simulation time is 2220 s the simulation results obtained by four control methods are illustrated by the step response curves shown in fig 11 their corresponding specific parameters are listed in table 3 the controlled system s performance of rapidity stability accuracy and oscillation amplitude are reflected by four indicators i e rise time settling time steady state error and maximum overshoot the stability and accuracy of the controlled system are primarily concerned in the research because the actual oil temperature needs to be set as certain value in order to steadily heat the system and sufficiently remove air and water in the oil meanwhile the overshoot reflects the system stability and thus significant as well excessive overshoot means that the oil temperature in the control process is prone to yielding overheating which would not only threaten the system safety but spoil the quality of hydraulic oil in real hydraulic oil heating processes due to the complex oil heating system its corresponding accurate mathematical model is hardly obtained furthermore since the ambient temperature and the working conditions vary over time the mathematical model itself tends to change which may lead to the mismatch between the theoretical model and the actual one in the control process therefore it is necessary to analyze the actual control effect of different control methods in the case of model mismatch here we simulate and analyze a case which is most difficult to control accurately where k p k t p t and τ p τ zhang 2012 the actual parameters of mathematical model in oil heating process is k p 30 t p 381 85 and τ p 85 the step response curve is shown in fig 12 the corresponding four performance indicators are displayed in table 4 in the case of model match smith fuzzy pid controller and modified smith fuzzy pid controller can not only keep the advantage of dynamic performance of fuzzy pid control but also have the advantage of compensation for pure lag link the time required to reach steady state is 1152 s and the overshoot amount is only 0 4 which satisfy the requirement of small overshoot in this system in the case of model mismatch after increasing the numeric value of k p and τ p the maximum overshoots of both pid controller and fuzzy pid controller have climbed up dramatically from 7 9 to 37 2 and from 3 3 to 24 2 respectively meanwhile from the settling time perspective the step response curves of pid controller and fuzzy pid controller have relatively significant oscillation compared with the corresponding ones in the case of model match thus they require longer time to reach the steady stage however the modified smith fuzzy pid controller with a first order filter could effectively reduce the model mismatch interference on the control effect and the time to reach a steady stage is 1143 s its corresponding curve in fig 12 has little oscillation as well and the overshoot amount is 0 4 therefore the control system based on modified smith fuzzy pid controller has the minimum overshoot and the settling time with the best robustness among four control methods and is able to meet the requirement of high precision oil filter in this equipment 5 experiment 5 1 hardware and software design in this section pic16f877a mcu is used to implement the intelligent control of oil heating process in an oil replenishing system two electric heaters are used to heat the oil and their heating power is taken as the system input signal through controlling the heating power mcu controls the oil heating rate to avoid uneven heating the selected jcj100zb screw fixed temperature sensors are positioned at different places of the vacuum tank the measured temperature is averaged and converted into an analog signal and fed back to the control system hydraulic oil vacuumizing and heating is carried out in a vacuum tank which is made of stainless steel 304 with a nominal wall thickness of 5 mm the hardware components and oil heating process are shown in figs 13 and 14 in order to verify the control effect four controllers are applied to the oil temperature control process separately in experiments taking the relatively complicated modified smith fuzzy pid controller as an example the software structure of the heating system is shown in fig 15 the flowcharts of fuzzy pid control algorithm realized by mcu and the combination of fuzzy pid and modified smith predictor are displayed in figs 16 and 17 respectively 5 2 experimental process and results analysis the oil replenishing device utilizes vacuumizing and heating methods for oil purification specific steps are explained as follows a connect the oil inlet pipe with an external oil tank open the vacuum pump to vacuumize the vacuum tank through internal and external pressure difference lead the oil from the external oil tank to pass the high precision oil filter where the solid particles are filtered into the vacuum tank b close the inlet valve once 20 l oil is available in the vacuum tank the vacuum pump keeps working so that the vacuum pressure in the vacuum tank maintains at 0 06 mpa c switch on the electric heaters and heat the oil according to preset program considering the possible external disturbances to the measured value the oil temperature was measured and collected and its average value was taken the initial oil temperature is around 20 c fig 18 shows the change of oil temperature with time under four different controllers and the relevant indexes are displayed in table 5 as shown in table 5 during oil heating process pid controller has the largest settling time and overshoot indicating that only a single pid controller is less effective the indexes of both fuzzy pid and smith fuzzy vary slightly which imply that the compensation effect of smith predictor is not predominant in the case of model mismatch on the other hand the modified smith fuzzy pid has the minimum overshoot of 0 3 and the shortest time of 1845 s to achieve stability proving that the first order filter the minimum could reduce the error interference and benefit the stability of this system the experiment results also verified that the modified smith fuzzy pid controller has the best control effect for the oil heating system in this oil replenishing device 6 conclusions for an oil replenishing device this paper established the mathematical model of its oil heating system by first order approximation method by comparing pid controller fuzzy pid controller smith fuzzy pid controller and modified smith fuzzy pid controller those four control methods we have simulated the oil heating process in the cases of both model match and mismatch it is found that in both cases the step response curves of modified smith fuzzy pid controller could achieve the expected value in the shortest time with the minimum overshoot among four curves which indicates its best stability and accuracy therefore it is believed safely to draw the conclusion that the control system under modified smith fuzzy pid controller possesses the best robustness moreover this paper has built the hardware system of oil replenishing system and applied those four control methods into the oil heating process as well the experimental results show that under modified smith fuzzy pid control the actual oil temperature could be stabilized at the expected value and there is hardly any overshoot during the heating process it is verified that modified smith fuzzy pid controller is able to meet the challenge of large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of oil heating system in this oil replenishing device and accomplish the accurate oil temperature control acknowledgements this work was

life stable and reliable performance however the impurities in hydraulic oil such as water and air bubbles could seriously damage the quality of hydraulic oil phillips 2006 and result in significant reduction of oil bulk modulus as well as mechanic motion precision which would yield the control error for deep sea hydraulic equipment thereafter we have developed an oil replenish device hao 2013 which has multi functions of oil suction filtration degasification dehydration and oil replenishing it is used to process the oil treatment and replenish the deep sea hydraulic system with the treated oil the whole device works in the laboratory base it is known that through vacuum filtration and heating operation water and air bubbles in hydraulic oil could be effectively removed because of the characteristics of large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of hydraulic oil heating system it is difficult to control accurately the oil temperature during heating process under work condition if the oil temperature exceeds 55 c the service life of hydraulic oil would be shortened by half when the temperature increases 8 c hao 2013 the oil temperature control still remains a challenge temperature control is a process of measuring detecting and adjusting temperatures to achieve a desired value it is widely used in industry sectors such as food processing and transportation central heating chemical engineering etc temperature control is a typical time delay case it is known that time delays have a deleterious effect on both the stability and performance of controlled systems and are generally harder to control unless the lag compensated udwadia et al 2003 so far two methods are acknowledged feasible to handle time delay one is model based control such as pid controller smith predictor robust control and the other is model free adaptive control such as smith fuzzy controller intelligent control zhang 2012 for temperature control in various occasions different control approaches were applied to eliminate the time delay phenomenon for temperature control of a central heating system a pd plus pi controller was proposed feeding back the environment temperature and the temperature of the heated room koumboulis and kouvakas 2010 a joint design method of closed loop identification and imc internal model control for the cooling temperature control system with input time delay was presented abe et al 2003 an expert system for the humidity and temperature control in hvac systems was brought forth using anfis artificial neural fuzzy interface system and optimization with fuzzy modeling approach soyguder and alli 2009 however with regard to the oil temperature control during the heating process to the author s knowledge little research has been done so far especially to tackle this challenge in our research to avoid the damage to oil quality caused by high temperature and to ensure the effective filtration as well four oil temperature control methods of an oil replenishing device are simulated and analyzed i e the pid controller the fuzzy pid controller the smith fuzzy pid controller and the modified smith fuzzy pid controller with its advantages of simple structure and easy operation pid controller is widely used in industrial production zhang et al 2011 esfahani et al 2015 skjong and pedersen 2016 fuzzy pid controller combining the conventional pid and the fuzzy rules identifies the fuzzy relation between pid controller parameters and system error error change rate fadaei and salahshoor 2008 then tunes the pid controller parameters by fuzzy rules smith predictor control proposed by o j m smith in 1957 feliu batlle et al 2013 deals with the problem of large time delay of system and connects a compensation link to the original controller in parallel in order to compensate pure lag process modified smith predictor has structural improvement by adding a first order filter to smith predator s uma and a seshagiri rao proposed a modified smith predictor which consists of a set point tracking controller and a disturbance rejection controller for the purpose of enhancing control of non minimum phase unstable second order time delay processes with without zero uma and rao 2016 based on two degree of freedom control structure yin proposed a modified smith predictor scheme for a class of unstable processes with time delay yin et al 2014 the modified smith predictor used in this paper was proposed by yang et al yang 2005 adding a first order filter to the original smith control loop to overcome the interference caused by inaccurate model and further to enhance the robustness of control system in this paper the oil heating process is simulated based on the above mentioned four controllers and their corresponding step response curves are obtained thereafter in the cases of model matching and mismatching after analyzing and comparing the curves through four indicators i e rise time settling time steady state error and maximum overshoot the modified smith fuzzy pid controller is proved to have the best control effect furthermore through pic16f877a mcu these four control methods are applied to the actual oil temperature control system in the oil replenishing device the experimental data of oil temperature changing over time also verifies that the modified smith fuzzy pid controller is able to meet the challenges of the oil temperature control process after a brief introduction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the structure of oil replenishing device is introduced in section 3 the mathematic model of the oil heating control system is presented and the relevant parameters are defined and set four control methods are illustrated and their simulation results are obtained compared and analyzed in section 4 the experimental process is described and the results analysis is carried out in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 oil replenishing device the device structure and entity are shown in fig 1 the oil replenishing device consists of a vacuum pump a high precision oil filter an immersion electrical heater and a vacuum tank with the capacity of 60 l oil the heater located near the bottom of tank has the maximum power of 2 kw to be adjusted by a designed program to let the oil be heated evenly the inner circulation is switched on during the heating process the steps of oil purification process are specifically listed as follows a connect the oil inlet pipe to an external oil tank open the vacuum pump and vacuumize the vacuum tank the internal and external pressure difference would cause the oil from the external oil tank to pass the high precision oil filter where the solid particles are filtered into the vacuum tank b close the inlet valve once the volume of oil in the vacuum tank reaches the set value keep the vacuum pump running to maintain a low pressure in the vacuum tank c start the electric heaters and heat the oil according to the preset control program in the heating and vacuum environment air nucleons would develop into air bubbles and deviate from oil quickly meanwhile compared with hydraulic oil water reaches first the saturated vapor pressure and thus could also be separated from oil in real operations only through controlling relay on and off it is hard to control the oil temperature rising speed and to maintain it at the expected value due to the large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of oil heating system in the operation process the oil temperature trends to deviate from the set value however excessive oil temperature would lead to oil molecules polymerize and thus further generate impurities which not only shortens oil service life but also spoils its quality lou 2014 on the other hand if oil temperature is lower than the set value air nucleus would develop inadequately resulting in air bubbles rising slowly and water hardly being evaporated from oil therefore to ensure the effective filtration as well as high oil quality the oil temperature needs to be controlled accurately by an intelligent control method 3 the mathematical model of oil heating system 3 1 the system transfer function since the mathematical model of the industrial process is often a high order model it is challenging to apply to controller design to simplify it to a first or second order transfer function while reserving the main characters of controlled system is more preferred rivas perez et al 2014 in a control system of residual oil outlet temperature in a coke furnace wu et al 2014 wu chose a general first order plus dead time model formulation obtained by a step response as its transfer function sun established a temperature control mathematical model by applying heat transfer theory a first order transfer function as well with pure lag sun et al 2015 in this paper the oil heating system is taken as the controlled object and has non vibration and self balance under step input its transfer function could be described as a first order transfer function g s shown in eq 1 with a time delay yang 2005 wang and shi 2011 which not only reserves the main features of controlled object but also facilitates the theoretical analysis and the real control operation 1 g s k t s 1 e τ s where k is amplification factor t is time constant τ is pure delayed time in this paper the parameters are obtained by step response method li 2014 3 2 system step response curve taking the electrical heater power p t as the system step input and the oil temperature f t as the system output we get the oil temperature time curve the environment temperature in the laboratory is 22 c the power of the heaters used to heat the oil is set at 1 kw with 20 l oil in the tank the temperature time data is shown in table 1 in order to remove air and water more effectively the expected temperature is set at 60 c in the research during oil purification process the curve shown in fig 2 is plotted from the data in table 1 the initial temperature is set 19 9 c as the coordinate origin so as to solve the parameters of the system s mathematical model conveniently 3 3 identification of transfer function parameters the first order approximation method was applied zheng et al 2014 in this paper and the system step response curve was used to identify the transfer function parameters the equations are shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 f t 1 0 39 h f t 2 0 63 h where f t is the oil temperature time curve shown in fig 2 and h t is the oil temperature time curve obtained by the mathematical model of system setting h f 59 8 c according to system step response curve it could be obtained that f t 1 23 32 f t 2 37 67 and t 1 303 03 t 2 528 95 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 τ 2 t 1 t 2 k h h 0 p p 0 t 451 85 τ 77 11 and k 22 8 are obtained from eq 3 and these parameters are verified in eq 4 4 t 3 0 8 t τ t 4 2 t τ f t 3 0 55 f f t 4 0 87 f where t 3 438 59 t 4 980 81 and f t 3 0 55 f f t 4 0 87 f the verification condition is satisfied and the transfer function of hydraulic oil heating system is shown in eq 5 5 g s 22 8 451 85 1 e 77 11 s 4 the system controller research and simulation 4 1 pid controller pid controller is the basic and the most used module in discrete control system over 90 control loops were designed with pid method yin et al 2014 akbari hasanjani et al 2015 pid controller consists of proportional unit p integral unit i and differential unit d the basic equation of pid controller is shown in eq 6 6 u t k p e t 1 t i e t d t t d d e t d t where e t is deviation signal t i is integral time constant t d is differentiating time constant setting k i k p t i k d k p t d k p k i and k d represent proportionality coefficient integral coefficient and differential coefficient respectively in this paper the simulation model controlled by pid controller is established by matlab simulink shown in fig 3 where k p 0 2098 k i 0 000386 and k d 3 505 4 2 fuzzy pid controller fuzzy pid controller tunes pid three parameters by fuzzy controller consider the oil temperature error e and error change rate ec as input variables and δk p correction proportional gain δk i correction integral gain δk d correction derivative gain which adjust the values of pid parameters as output variables thus the whole fuzzy controller is a two input and three output system the fuzzy domain of e ec δk p δk i and δk d are selected from 6 to 6 the fuzzy subsets of input and output variables are nb nm ns zo ps pm pb where nb represents negative big nm is abbreviation of negative middle ns is negative small zo is zero ps is positive small pm is positive middle pb is positive big this paper adopts the mean of maximum method zheng et al 2014 to clear the fuzzy results and the membership function of input and output variables are all triangular displayed in fig 4 the fuzzy control rules are demonstrated in table 2 the fuzzy controller in this paper adopts mamdani fuzzy guo et al 2016 inference algorithm to reason and applies weighted mean method to deblur the fuzzy pid controller simulation model is shown in fig 5 4 3 smith fuzzy pid controller the smith predictor is used to correct the lag of the system sun et al 2015 at a given signal it estimates the dynamic characteristics of system under disturbances in advance and then compensates by the predictor to reduce system s overshoot and to shorten the adjustment process guo and liu 2003 through introducing the compensation link in system feedback loop smith predictor separates the pure lag link of controlled object from the other parts of control system the structure diagram of smith predictor is shown in fig 6 where r s is expected value of system y s is measured value of system g c s is the controller transfer function e τ m s is pure lag link g p s is mathematical model of system τ is lag time g m s is the mathematical model of smith predictor the function of smith predictive compensation is expressed as g m s 1 e τ s the transfer function of the control system is shown in eq 7 7 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g m 1 e τ m s g c s g p s e τ s if g p s g m s τ τ m then eq 7 could be rewritten as 8 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g p s since the closed loop part of eq 8 does not contain the pure lag link e τ s after the smith estimated compensation it no longer affects the characteristic equation of the system this control method has good control effect fig 7 shows the structure diagram of temperature control system based on smith fuzzy pid controller which combines the fuzzy pid controller and smith predictor this system not only possesses the fuzzy pid controller s advantage of good dynamic performance but also is able to compensate the system s time lag part by smith predictor consequently it is capable of enhancing the robustness of oil heating system and improving system s control performance sun et al 2010 the simulation model of smith fuzzy pid controller is shown in fig 8 however if g p s g m s τ τ m the item with time delay factor in the closed loop part of eq 7 would severely damage the control effect the compensation effect of smith predictor heavily depends on accurate mathematical model of system feliu batlle et al 2009 if there is margin error between the estimated model and the real model the control quality would deteriorate and even diverge duan 2010 for control system which lacks accurate mathematical model or has pure lag link and time varying parameters like oil heating processes smith predictor fails to obtain satisfactory control effect 4 4 modified smith predictor fuzzy pid controller the previous analysis shows that the conventional smith predictor can only effectively eliminate the negative effect of large time delay by obtaining an accurate mathematical model of controlled system for an oil heating system with large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters yamada et al 2010 it is difficult to obtain the accurate mathematical model in order to further reduce the requirement of model accuracy and achieve better control effect a first order filter is added to the original smith control loop to improve the control system s robustness and adaptability the structure diagram of modified smith predictor is shown in fig 9 where 1 t f s 1 is the form of the first order filter t f t m k c k m is the filter time constant t m is the predictor constant k c is g c s gain k m is smith predictor gain the closed loop system transfer function is shown in eq 9 9 y s r s g c s g p s e τ s 1 g c s g m s g c s g p s e τ s g m s e τ m s 1 t f s 1 if g p s g m s τ τ m eq 9 is the same as the conventional smith predictor control program and the improved program has no effect on the system only the output response shifted by a pure lag time if g p s g m s τ τ m a first order inertial link 1 t f s 1 is introduced to the main feedback channel it functions as a buffer to mismatch predictor model t f could be adjusted to change the characteristic equation roots and therefore the performance of the control system could be improved accordingly benefitting to system stability yang 2005 when t f 0 the system is equivalent to the conventional smith predictor control system chen and yang 2007 the simulation model of modified smith fuzzy pid controller is shown in fig 10 where the value of t f is 8 by adjusting 4 5 analysis of simulation results in this paper the simulation results of pid controller fuzzy pid controller smith fuzzy pid controller modified smith fuzzy pid controller are presented and compared the initial oil temperature is 19 9 c and the oil temperature is expected to be 60 c thus the step size is 40 c the total simulation time is 2220 s the simulation results obtained by four control methods are illustrated by the step response curves shown in fig 11 their corresponding specific parameters are listed in table 3 the controlled system s performance of rapidity stability accuracy and oscillation amplitude are reflected by four indicators i e rise time settling time steady state error and maximum overshoot the stability and accuracy of the controlled system are primarily concerned in the research because the actual oil temperature needs to be set as certain value in order to steadily heat the system and sufficiently remove air and water in the oil meanwhile the overshoot reflects the system stability and thus significant as well excessive overshoot means that the oil temperature in the control process is prone to yielding overheating which would not only threaten the system safety but spoil the quality of hydraulic oil in real hydraulic oil heating processes due to the complex oil heating system its corresponding accurate mathematical model is hardly obtained furthermore since the ambient temperature and the working conditions vary over time the mathematical model itself tends to change which may lead to the mismatch between the theoretical model and the actual one in the control process therefore it is necessary to analyze the actual control effect of different control methods in the case of model mismatch here we simulate and analyze a case which is most difficult to control accurately where k p k t p t and τ p τ zhang 2012 the actual parameters of mathematical model in oil heating process is k p 30 t p 381 85 and τ p 85 the step response curve is shown in fig 12 the corresponding four performance indicators are displayed in table 4 in the case of model match smith fuzzy pid controller and modified smith fuzzy pid controller can not only keep the advantage of dynamic performance of fuzzy pid control but also have the advantage of compensation for pure lag link the time required to reach steady state is 1152 s and the overshoot amount is only 0 4 which satisfy the requirement of small overshoot in this system in the case of model mismatch after increasing the numeric value of k p and τ p the maximum overshoots of both pid controller and fuzzy pid controller have climbed up dramatically from 7 9 to 37 2 and from 3 3 to 24 2 respectively meanwhile from the settling time perspective the step response curves of pid controller and fuzzy pid controller have relatively significant oscillation compared with the corresponding ones in the case of model match thus they require longer time to reach the steady stage however the modified smith fuzzy pid controller with a first order filter could effectively reduce the model mismatch interference on the control effect and the time to reach a steady stage is 1143 s its corresponding curve in fig 12 has little oscillation as well and the overshoot amount is 0 4 therefore the control system based on modified smith fuzzy pid controller has the minimum overshoot and the settling time with the best robustness among four control methods and is able to meet the requirement of high precision oil filter in this equipment 5 experiment 5 1 hardware and software design in this section pic16f877a mcu is used to implement the intelligent control of oil heating process in an oil replenishing system two electric heaters are used to heat the oil and their heating power is taken as the system input signal through controlling the heating power mcu controls the oil heating rate to avoid uneven heating the selected jcj100zb screw fixed temperature sensors are positioned at different places of the vacuum tank the measured temperature is averaged and converted into an analog signal and fed back to the control system hydraulic oil vacuumizing and heating is carried out in a vacuum tank which is made of stainless steel 304 with a nominal wall thickness of 5 mm the hardware components and oil heating process are shown in figs 13 and 14 in order to verify the control effect four controllers are applied to the oil temperature control process separately in experiments taking the relatively complicated modified smith fuzzy pid controller as an example the software structure of the heating system is shown in fig 15 the flowcharts of fuzzy pid control algorithm realized by mcu and the combination of fuzzy pid and modified smith predictor are displayed in figs 16 and 17 respectively 5 2 experimental process and results analysis the oil replenishing device utilizes vacuumizing and heating methods for oil purification specific steps are explained as follows a connect the oil inlet pipe with an external oil tank open the vacuum pump to vacuumize the vacuum tank through internal and external pressure difference lead the oil from the external oil tank to pass the high precision oil filter where the solid particles are filtered into the vacuum tank b close the inlet valve once 20 l oil is available in the vacuum tank the vacuum pump keeps working so that the vacuum pressure in the vacuum tank maintains at 0 06 mpa c switch on the electric heaters and heat the oil according to preset program considering the possible external disturbances to the measured value the oil temperature was measured and collected and its average value was taken the initial oil temperature is around 20 c fig 18 shows the change of oil temperature with time under four different controllers and the relevant indexes are displayed in table 5 as shown in table 5 during oil heating process pid controller has the largest settling time and overshoot indicating that only a single pid controller is less effective the indexes of both fuzzy pid and smith fuzzy vary slightly which imply that the compensation effect of smith predictor is not predominant in the case of model mismatch on the other hand the modified smith fuzzy pid has the minimum overshoot of 0 3 and the shortest time of 1845 s to achieve stability proving that the first order filter the minimum could reduce the error interference and benefit the stability of this system the experiment results also verified that the modified smith fuzzy pid controller has the best control effect for the oil heating system in this oil replenishing device 6 conclusions for an oil replenishing device this paper established the mathematical model of its oil heating system by first order approximation method by comparing pid controller fuzzy pid controller smith fuzzy pid controller and modified smith fuzzy pid controller those four control methods we have simulated the oil heating process in the cases of both model match and mismatch it is found that in both cases the step response curves of modified smith fuzzy pid controller could achieve the expected value in the shortest time with the minimum overshoot among four curves which indicates its best stability and accuracy therefore it is believed safely to draw the conclusion that the control system under modified smith fuzzy pid controller possesses the best robustness moreover this paper has built the hardware system of oil replenishing system and applied those four control methods into the oil heating process as well the experimental results show that under modified smith fuzzy pid control the actual oil temperature could be stabilized at the expected value and there is hardly any overshoot during the heating process it is verified that modified smith fuzzy pid controller is able to meet the challenge of large inertia large time delay and time varying parameters of oil heating system in this oil replenishing device and accomplish the accurate oil temperature control acknowledgements this work was

23653,ultra large container ship ulcs structures feature large deck openings and low torsional rigidity it is essential to accurately evaluate the maximum loading carrying capacity of ship structures when the ship sails at an oblique heading in rough sea the horizontal and torsional moments may approach or even exceed the magnitude of vertical bending moment in such cases hull girder ultimate strength assessment of container ships under load combinations comprising of vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is necessary in their structural design stage in this paper special attentions are thus paid to the hull girder ultimate strength of an ulcs i e a typical 10 000 teu container ship subjected to combined three load components mentioned above which is also a common load case in ships and ship shaped offshore structures and it is assumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely a series of nonlinear finite element analyses nfea is carried out effects of fabrication related initial imperfections are investigated in the present study based on the computed numerical results the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope considering initial deformation and incorporating the interaction relationships among three kinds of load components mentioned above is established keywords ulcs nfea initial imperfection ultimate strength assessment ultimate strength interaction relationship 3d ultimate strength envelope 1 introduction the ulcs is regarded as one of the most representative high tech products in the modern shipping industry for its particular characteristics larger deck opening larger hatch deformation higher speed higher stability requirement and high strength steel used more compared with normal container ships hhi hyundai heavy industries has developed an ulcs capable of carrying 13 000 teu as described in choi et al 2006 generally the ultimate strength assessment for vessels is of importance and the most essential strength measure is the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment which is usually referred to as the maximum hull girder loading capacity of the ship smith 1977 however in modern ship structural design the maximum loading carrying capacity of ship hulls under combined loads is considered to be a necessary safety index especially for vessels such as ultra large container ships due to its characteristics therefore it is of great importance to understand thoroughly the ultimate strength behaviors of ship hull girders under combined loads tracing the process of the progressive collapse and predicting a more complete and accurate ultimate strength envelope of hull girders are thus of great significance there have been a lot of efforts on the numerical analysis about ultimate strength behaviors of plates stiffened panels and box beams under combined loads conducted in previous literature a series of nonlinear finite element analysis to investigate the collapse behavior of plates having circular hole under combined biaxial compression and edge shear loads had been performed by paik 2008 and later paik and seo 2009a b has numerically conducted the ultimate strength behaviors study on steel unstiffened and stiffened plate structures subject to combined biaxial compression and lateral pressure actions and developed some useful insights on nonlinear finite element method application a comprehensive study including experimental and numerical study of finite element model of box beams under combined action of bending and torsion had been conducted by kim and chai 2008 for large scale ship structures paik et al 2008a b numerically dealt with methods useful for the ultimate limit state assessment of ships and ship shaped offshore structures the buckling and post buckling characteristics of hull girders under bending moment and combined loads have also been investigated to assess the hull girder strength paik and kim 2008 benson et al 2013 saad eldeen et al 2013 furthermore the safety margin of a 10 000 teu container ship under two load combinations had been explored by mohammed et al 2016 more recently from all the aforementioned literature it can see that most of studies assume the interaction relationships of hull girder structures ultimate strength between two load components like biaxial compressive loads or combined bending moment and torsion have similar equation forms that may be generalized to the following form namely 1 σ x σ x u α σ y σ y u β 1 2 m v m v u α m t m t u β 1 where σ x and σ y are applied longitudinal and transverse axial compression of a plate respectively σ x u and σ y u are the ultimate strength of a plate under longitudinal and transverse axial compression alone respectively m v and m t are applied bending and torsional moment respectively m v u and m t u are ultimate strength under individual bending moment and torsion respectively the exponents α and β depend on the size and type of the plate or ship however there are few investigations carried out for the maximum loading carrying capacity under combined three load components such as vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion in this regard this paper explores the progressive collapse of hull girder by applying nfea using commercial fea program abaqus cae and the ultimate strength interaction relationship of a typical 10 000 teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined the three load components one full hull compartment between two neighboring transverse bulkheads located at mid ship for the ulcs is adopted and modeled as study case in the present study to obtain insights into the ultimate strength behavior of hull girder under different combined two load components i e combined vertical bending and horizontal bending moments combined vertical bending and torsional moments and combined horizontal bending and torsional moments and combined the three load components it is presumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely and only one load direction of horizontal and torsional load component is applied during the fe analysis for the study purpose since the importance of vertical ultimate strength of ship hulls sagging and hogging moments are considered for vertical bending stiffened panel structures are commonly fabricated by fusion welding accordingly the construction members would have initial geometrical imperfections and residual stress during the process and it is basically assumed that these initial imperfections could affect the ultimate strength of construction members significantly paik and thayamballi 2003 therefore it is necessary to take into account the effects of initial geometrical imperfection mainly considering its shape and magnitude in the ultimate strength assessment as for residual stress it is not accounted for because of the present study purpose although it also affects the ultimate strength of stiffened plate structures paik and kim 2008 the influences of initial geometrical imperfections on the ultimate strength are investigated in this paper a series of collapse analyses is performed based on the numerical results obtained the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope representing a relatively complete picture of hull girder collapse is obtained and a simple design formula involving initial imperfection for predicting the ultimate strength of hull girder under vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is proposed 2 finite element modeling 2 1 description of object ship characteristics the principal characteristics of the object ship are shown in fig 1 in conjunction with tables 1 and 2 where fig 1 represents the typical transverse mid ship section of the ulcs and tables 1 and 2 show the main dimensions and most details of the ship the finite element model is illustrated in fig 2 a where x y and z denote longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively the origin locates in the outer bottom shell and at the intersection between the central longitudinal section and the left cross section of the fe model as depicted in fig 2 and the following relevant discussions are based on this coordinate system additionally the elastic perfectly plastic material is taken into account and the yield stress of the construction member is 355 mpa for ah material and 390 mpa for eh material and the young s modulus is 2 06e 05 mpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 while the density is 7 85e 09 t mm3 2 2 element type and mesh size convergence according to abaqus6 10 2010 documents the s4r element is a 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element that is capable of reduced integration which makes it computationally less expensive while the s3 element is a 3 node triangular general purpose shell element membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflection effects can be taken into account for adopting these types of elements it is common sense that the mesh size of finite element model should be fine enough to accurately simulate the collapse behavior of structures however more finer the mesh is more computational efforts should be caused in this regard a balance between result accuracy and computation efforts must be made and it is required that the number of mesh in a space between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners should be enough to get the required numerical accuracy i e it need capture the buckling collapse mode of the stiffened panel properly fine classnk 2014 thus adopting only two meshes in the space may be not enough in the present study two types of mesh sizes have been taken into account for mesh convergence study as represented in fig 2 shown in table 3 are the results fig 3 shows the progressive behavior of the ulcs under vertical bending moment varying the mesh precision note s 4 and s 8 denotes there are four and eight elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners on the panel respectively nt denotes the total number of elements us denotes ultimate strength di denotes the difference of ultimate strength between two cases ce denotes computation time under the same computer configuration it is shown in table 3 that the difference of ultimate strength between these two types of mesh is very small but that of computation efforts is huge and the progressive behavior of the ulcs under vertical bending is almost the same for the two types of mesh as is shown in fig 3 therefore the s 4 case is better to be selected for the fe model based on the study the fe model consists of 152 865 elements totally including 152 617 linear quadrilateral elements of type s4r and 248 linear triangular elements of type s3 in the present study 3 nonlinear finite element analysis 3 1 load application and boundary conditions boundary conditions are hugely important in the ultimate strength analysis using nfea different boundary conditions cause different warping stresses which can affect the ultimate strength of hull girder the ultimate strength of a hull girder under torsion with varying warping stresses has been discussed by paik et al 2001 conclusions show that the torsional stiffness may be significantly affected by warping stresses but the discrepancy of ultimate strength under bending or torsion is very small between partially restrained and completely restrained boundary conditions in this section three types of study cases are considered to investigate the effect of warping stresses on the hull girder ultimate strength of the ulcs and decide the boundary condition adopted in this paper namely fully free partially restrained and completely restrained for longitudinal warping displacements which is carried out in steps similar to the method introduced by paik et al 2001 which is described as follows for full free case it is that the longitudinal displacement degrees of freedom at all nodes are set free except one node at aft end cross section see fig 4 on the outer bottom center line to prevent the rigid body motion for partially restrained case it is that all degrees of freedom at the nodes of aft end are set to be fixed whereas the rest are free for completely restrained case it is that all degrees of freedom at the nodes of aft end are fixed meanwhile the longitudinal displacement degrees of freedom at all nodes are also fixed to facilitate the application of loads and boundary in this paper the two end cross sections of the fe model are attached to the reference points rp 1 and rp 2 by rigid body tie constraint as is shown in fig 4 which can keep the end sections of hull girder remain plane during the fe analysis the reference point is a designed point on which loads like forces moments or displacements applied can be efficiently transferred into a specific selection of nodes or elements the reference points are defined as the intersection between neutral axis and center symmetric line of the cross sections and set free classnk 2014 note that using the rigid body constraint means the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and does not affect the result solution as described in mohammed et al 2016 and cui et al 2017 which is also verified in this paper by comparison results between when torsion is imposed in the reference point of this paper and in the shear center of the cross section therefore the loads and boundary imposed are assigned on the reference points in the research and the combined loads are exerted simultaneously instead of sequentially the rotation angle method is adopted to simulate the external loads caused by the still water moment and wave moment which is applied at the reference point of fore end rp 1 the applied rotation angle should be large enough to obtain the ultimate bending moment of the hull girder which is set to be 0 005 rad in the paper the explicit dynamic analysis method is adopted in this paper that could consider the transient influence of time relative to the implicit static analysis method and avoid the convergence problem in iterative solution which is beneficial for large scale models ming et al 2017 to make the static or quasi static problem simulated and analyzed more accurately in the explicit dynamic analysis the point is to set a reasonable loading time theoretically the loading time should close to a quarter of the actual maximum wave period however if the actual loading time assessed by the wave period was used it would be very time consuming the short loading time can save computation time but too short loading time might overestimate the predicted results due to the hardening of material and effect of inertial ming et al 2017 generally it is considered that the loading time should be selected for at least 10 times of the model base frequency cycle so that the kinetic energy could keep small enough during the fe analysis in this paper the loading time is set to be 2s fig 5 a shows the vertical bending moment versus bending angle curves and fig 5 b shows the torsional moment versus twisting angle curves table 4 shows values of the hull girder ultimate strength of the ulcs under the three types of study cases it can be known from fig 5 that the effect of warping on the ultimate strength is larger under torsional moment than under vertical bending moments the presence of warping stress affects the post ultimate strength whereas has slight effects on the initial stiffness of hull girder under vertical bending however has significant effects on the ultimate torsional strength when the warping displacements are restrained torsion will develop warping stresses as well as shear stresses which can increase the ultimate torsional strength with increase in the degree of warping restraints the torsional rigidity increases as is shown in fig 5 b for the second boundary condition since warping displacements are partially restrained both warping and shear stresses are developed by torsional moment and torsional rigidity will not be so small like full free case and not very large like completely restrained case which is similar as described in paik et al 2001 therefore the boundary adopted for the following studies in this paper is that the aft end cross section of the hull girder is fixed while the fore end is set free because of the rigid body tie constraints used in both end sections according to thin walled mechanics both bi moments and warping stresses exist on both ends which means the adopted boundary condition lies somewhere between the partially restrained warping and entirely restrained warping boundary conditions so it can be accepted paik et al 2001 cui et al 2017 3 2 initial imperfection it is well recognized that the shape of the stiffened plate initial deformation is equivalent to the first elastic buckling mode which could give the lowest resistance against the ultimate strength however many researchers have investigated the effects of the deflection shape and magnitude of the initial deformation of welded steel plates and assumed the shape as a double fourier series will be better to model the reality of these structures paik et al 2004 yao et al 1992 1998 for this paper the local thin horse mode of initial deformation is imposed on local panels and that of flexural buckling and tripping modes on stiffeners to represent actual initial deflection in stiffened panels located in mid ship section of the hull girder including double side shell structures and double bottom structures tanaka et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the following post welding initial geometrical imperfection expression of thin horse mode based on double fourier series is accounted for as eq 3 3 w w 0 sin m π x a sin n π y b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflection a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frames and b is the distance between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners in the present study n is always kept constant and equal to 1 m is the number of buckling half wave which is equal to a b and need to be an integer otherwise it is taken as the minimum integer satisfying a b m m 1 the tripping mode of initial deflection for stiffener local sideways can be expressed as v s 4 v s v o s z h w sin π x a where h w is the height of the stiffener v o s is the magnitude which could be 0 001a according to yao et al 1998 as for w 0 i e the amplitude of the initial deformation of the local plate there have been many researchers explored it according to faulkner 1975 the formula of w 0 is indicated as follows 5 w 0 k β 2 t w for t w t k β 2 t for t w t where β b t σ y e is the slenderness ratio of the plate which is an important parameter to affect the ultimate strength of plates t is the plate thickness σ y is the material yield stress and e is the young s modulus and t w is the thickness of stiffener web k is a coefficient which may approximately be in the range 0 05 0 15 for marine structures according to masaoka 1996 w 0 is defined as the following form 6 w 0 k b 2 t where k is a coefficient which may be taken as k 8 10 5 for marine structures according to smith et al 1988 w 0 is defined as follows 7 w 0 0 025 β 2 t 0 1 β 2 t 0 3 β 2 t for slight level for average level for severe level β and t are defined as eq 5 an example of initial deflection mode for the hull girder with average level according to smith et al 1988 is represented in fig 6 which is scaled by 200 for clear exhibition 4 results and discussions 4 1 the effects of initial imperfection on ultimate strength of hull girder since the significance of initial deflection on the maximum load carrying capacity of hull girder six types of amplitudes of initial deflection from extensive literature as indicated in previous section have been chosen to be accounted for in the present study which are w 0 7 according to faulkner w 0 5 according to masaoka and w 0 2 5 for slight level w 0 10 for average level which is more common circumstance w 0 30 for severe level according to smith additionally w 0 16 which is plate thickness of the outer side shell is also taken into account the analysis results of the hull girder against pure vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional moments are illustrated in figs 7 9 respectively fig 7a shows the reduction of the ultimate strength of the hull girder under pure vertical bending moment with varying amplitudes of initial imperfection the ordinate in fig 7a m v m v 0 represents the reduction factor of the ultimate strength where m v and m v 0 denotes the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment with and without taking account of initial imperfection respectively it can be seen from fig 7a that the increase of the amplitude of initial imperfection could cause severe reduction of the ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder under both sagging and hogging moment and the reduction is becoming more considerable when the amplitude of initial imperfection approaches or exceeds plate thickness this indicates that suitable magnitude of initial deflection should be adopted in fe analysis fig 7b shows the progressive collapse of the hull girder with initial geometrical deflection under pure vertical bending including sagging and hogging moments it is observed from fig 7b that the initial loading paths are almost the same for different initial deflections whereas the unloading paths are varied widely in other words the presence of initial imperfection has slight influence on the initial stiffness of hull girder but has significant influence on the ultimate vertical bending strength values figs 8a and 9a show the reduction of the ultimate strength of the hull girder under pure horizontal bending and torsional moments with varying amplitude of initial imperfection respectively figs 8b and 9b show the progressive collapse of the hull girder under pure horizontal bending and torsional moments respectively it is observed from figs 8a and 9a that the ultimate strength under horizontal bending and torsional moment decreases slightly with the increase of the magnitude of initial imperfection the maximum ultimate strength reduction percentage under horizontal bending moment and torsion is about only 4 and 2 respectively compared with intact hull girder both of which are far smaller than the maximum vertical ultimate strength reduction it can be seen from figs 8b and 9b that no significant difference can be observed between the progressive collapse behaviors with different initial imperfection while some efforts have been made to predict the initial imperfections theoretically and numerically approximate methods based on the insights from measurements are usually adopted for design purposes because of the complexity of the phenomena of initial imperfection involved paik and thayamballi 2003 if the initial deformation mode adopted is consistent with the local failure shape of the hull girder ultimate limit state which will reduce maximally the ultimate strength of ship hulls the initial deformation mode assumed in this paper i e the local thin horse mode is the most unfavorable to a panel under predominantly longitudinal compressive axial loads such as double bottom under hogging moments and double side shells under sagging moments e g container vessels subjected to vertical bending moment this initial deformation mode may be different from the local failure shape of the hull girder ultimate limit state under torsional and horizontal moments torsional failure deformation usually occurs in the diagonal direction of the plate and when the hull girder is under horizontal bending moment one side shell is subjected to compressive loads whereas another is subjected to tension which may increase the tensile strength of the side subjected to tension with this initial deformation therefore from all the cases it can be concluded that the effects of initial imperfections assumed in this paper on the ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder are more significant whereas on the ultimate horizontal and torsional strength of the hull girder are less significant with respect to ultimate vertical bending strength 4 2 ultimate strength analyses under individual load component in this section a series of hull girder s ultimate strength analyses is conducted under pure vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion respectively for simplicity only the amplitude of initial defection w 0 10 average level according to smith as stated in section 4 1 is considered as study case the von mises stress distributions of the hull girder at the ultimate limit state and post ultimate limit state under vertical bending including sagging and hogging torsional and horizontal bending moments are represented in fig 10 a d respectively shown in fig 11 a c are the progressive collapses of the hull girder from the figures mentioned above it can be seen that the von mises stress distributions and failure modes are quite different between the three load cases this indicates that combined two or three load components would result in the unfavorable condition for marine structures which also conforms to the real situation since container ships can be characterized as a hull girder with very large deck opening this type of ship has a relatively small torsional rigidity compared to the ships with closed cross section which thus is more vulnerable to the torsional moment the effect of torsion on the ultimate longitudinal strength of hull girder may be significant therefore ultimate strength assessments under combined loads should be carried out 4 3 ultimate strength analysis under combined two load components in an actual ship vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion generally do not peak at the same time however from the point of view of the ultimate loading carrying capacity of hull girder that is considered as a particularly important factor for evaluation of hull girder safety margin it is necessary to analyze the ultimate strength collapse behaviors and interaction relationships under different combined loads which could obtain the most dangerous failure mode and ultimate strength envelope of hull girder sequentially ensure the safety of ships under various wave conditions of course the total longitudinal loads of hull girder generally include two parts wave induce loads and still water induced loads the former is related to wave direction and shape the latter is related to loading condition of ship mohammed et al 2012 obtained the global wave load combination from the short term and long term analyses which is presented in table 5 where the magnitude of vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is the biggest the second and the minimum respectively therefore it may be concluded that it is a very severe case when vertical bending and horizontal bending moments are combined since the two load components are very big however it should be noted that the ultimate strength of ship hulls with low torsional rigidity such as container ships can be reduced significantly when torsion is large thus it is also a very severe case when vertical bending moment and torsion are combined for container ships in this paper the ultimate strength of hull girder is analyzed from the perspective of hull girder structural loading carrying capacity and the wave direction is not considered and also it is assumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely paik et al 2001 4 3 1 progressive collapse behaviors firstly the ultimate strength of the hull girder under sagging and hogging moments in conjunction with five different magnitudes of torsion is investigated the influence of applied torsions on the ultimate vertical bending strength is shown in fig 12 where the pure sagging and hogging load cases are also plotted for comparison similarly the effect of torsion on the ultimate horizontal strength is represented in fig 13 and the effect of horizontal moment on the ultimate vertical strength is represented in fig 14 it is evident from figs 12 14 that combined loads have considerable effects on the hull girder ultimate strength in addition the ultimate strength in the main direction decreases significantly with the increase of the second load component furthermore when the value of applied second load component is close to the ultimate strength under the load alone the reduction is more considerable to further assess the ultimate strength under combined loads it would be better to study the ultimate strength interaction relationships between combined load components 4 3 2 ultimate strength interaction relationships under combined two loads in this section a series of analyses for the ultimate strength interaction relationships of the ulcs between combined two load components is conducted it is assumed that all the loads are applied as the same proportion simultaneously during one case five cases are analyzed to investigate the ultimate strength interaction relationships between each two load component firstly the ultimate strength interaction relationship among vertical bending including sagging and hogging moment and torsion is investigated which is usually given by the expression as follows 8 m v m v u α 1 m t m t u β 1 1 on the basis of computed numerical results the equations representing ultimate strength interaction relationship among combined vertical bending and torsional moments are empirically derived by curve fitting method as the following and represented in fig 15 9 m v m v u 1 42 m t m t u 5 03 1 for sagging m v m v u 1 56 m t m t u 5 26 1 for hogging the relevancy between the fe analysis results and the derived eq 9 are also plotted as a reference in fig 15 it is seen that the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are respectively 0 0015 and 0 9979 for sagging case 0 0005 and 0 9992 for hogging case which means that the eq 9 will be reasonable to predict the ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs between vertical bending moment and torsion to verify the above formulations derived by curve fitting method for an example container vessel i e the typical 10 000 teu container ship they are compared with the following equations proposed by paik et al 2001 for a typical 4300 teu container ship which are also plotted in fig 15 10 m v m v u 3 1 m t m t u 3 1 1 for sagging m v m v u 3 7 m t m t u 3 7 1 for hogging it should be noted that the eq 10 is established assuming that the magnitude of torsion is not predominant meanwhile torsion is not a very sensitive load component affecting the ultimate vertical bending strength of ship hulls paik et al 2001 it is seen that from fig 15 when the magnitude of torsion is not large the differences between eq 9 and eq 10 are negligible and the mean absolute error mae for the whole eq 9 and eq 10 are only 0 033 for sagging case and 0 038 for hogging case therefore from the above analysis the ultimate strength interaction relationship obtained among vertical bending and torsion and the method adopted in this paper have certain accuracy and commonality for container ships especially for ulcs and could be used for speedy reference but the exponents may need to be tuned for different ship types and sizes particularly similarly the ultimate strength interaction relationship among combined horizontal bending moment and torsion is generally given by the following expression 11 m h m h u α 2 m t m t u β 2 1 applying an approach similar to that mentioned above the equation representing ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs among combined horizontal bending moment and torsion is derived by curve fitting based on numerical results as follows 12 m h m h u 1 35 m t m t u 4 48 1 fig 16 shows the ultimate strength interaction relationship between horizontal bending moment and torsion along with the relevancy between fe results and the derived equation as is shown in fig 16 the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are 0 0001 and 0 9999 respectively comparing the computed numerical results with eq 12 this indicates that eq 12 can predict the ultimate strength interaction relationship between combined horizontal bending moment and torsion finally the ultimate strength interaction relationship among vertical bending and horizontal bending moments is given by the following expression 13 m v m v u α 3 m h m h u β 3 1 based on computed fe results the equation representing ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and horizontal bending moments is derived as follows 14 m v m v u 1 08 m h m h u 1 93 1 for sagging m v m v u 1 67 m h m h u 1 48 1 for hogging fig 17 shows the ultimate strength interaction relationship in which the corresponding relevancy between numerical results and the derived eq 14 are also plotted the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are respectively 0 0013 and 0 9981 for sagging 0 0014 and 0 9975 for hogging therefore it can be concluded that eq 14 is in fairly good agreement with the ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and horizontal bending moments 4 4 the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs in order to determine a more accurate hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs and obtain a complete picture of hull girder response at the ultimate limit state which is the limiting condition beyond which the ship hull will fail to perform its functions it is of course important to analyze the ultimate strength of the hull girder under combined three load components i e vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional moments which could simulate the most extreme load case suffered in a lifetime for a ship based on the numerical results the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs is obtained which represents the true hull girder safety margin moreover because of the significant influences of initial deformation on ultimate strength of hull girder the formula for predicting ultimate strength interaction under a combination of three load components involving amplitudes of initial deformations is also proposed 4 4 1 ultimate strength interaction under combined three load components the most point to assess the ultimate strength of the hull girder under combined three load components is to investigate the strength interaction relationship with the three loads simultaneously applied that can be derived in the present study by three sets of interaction relationships between combined each two load components i e vertical bending moment versus torsion relationship horizontal bending moment versus torsion relationship and vertical bending moment versus horizontal bending moment relationship as stated in previous section three sets of the ultimate strength interaction relationships between each two load components are given by eq 8 eq 11 and eq 13 respectively when we are going to add the 3rd dimension load to the interaction relationship among two load components the ultimate strength in each dimension will be decreased because of the influence of the 3rd load component as stated in section 4 3 1 now we use the three sets of 2d interaction relationships mentioned above to derive a new 3d relationship for the study purpose i e for the emphasis on the methodology that mainly focus on magnitudes of ultimate strength only the sagging moment is taken into account to represent the vertical bending moment for conservative study and also for the sake of compute efforts in this section firstly torsion is chosen to be the parameter the 3rd load component affecting the ultimate vertical and horizontal strength therefore the changed ultimate vertical and horizontal strength can be derived according to eq 8 and eq 11 respectively as follows 15 m v u c m v u 1 m t m t u β 1 1 α 1 16 m h u c m h u 1 m t m t u β 2 1 α 2 where m v u c and m h u c are the changed vertical bending and horizontal bending ultimate strength because of applied torsion respectively for simplification we make m v r 1 m t m t u β 1 1 α 1 and m h r 1 m t m t u β 2 1 α 2 then we replace m v u and m h u in eq 13 with m v u c and m h u c respectively a new equation could be obtained which is given by the following expression 17 m v m v u m v r α 3 m h m h u m h r β 3 1 secondly m t m t u m h m h u and m v m v u are replaced by x y and z representing three load components respectively submitting them into eq 17 then it will involve three dimensions which will be rewritten in the following form 18 z 1 x β 1 1 α 1 α 3 y 1 x β 2 1 α 2 β 3 1 the eq 18 is the ultimate strength interaction relationship among three load components based on the coefficients α 1 β 3 calculated in eq 9 eq 12 and eq 14 the three dimensional interaction relationship of the typical ulcs is obtained by eq 19 as follows and represented in fig 18 which is also the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs with the amplitude of initial defection w 0 10 it should be noted that obtaining the picture needs plenty of statistics 19 z 1 x 5 03 1 1 42 1 08 y 1 x 4 48 1 1 35 1 93 1 in addition a series of nfeas is conducted to verify the procedure of deriving the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship a number of finite element results 170 cases are carried out actually is obtained and shown in fig 18 the mean absolute error mae between the fe results and eq 19 is 0 03 which indicates that the formula eq 19 can fit the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship reasonably well 4 4 2 the 3d ultimate strength envelope involving initial deflection as discussed in previous section initial defection has significant effects on the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment moreover torsional moments are normally considered to be important for container ships with low torsional rigidity therefore it is of great importance to explore the effects of initial geometrical imperfection on the ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and torsional moments the case has been analyzed when the magnitude of initial defection w 0 10 and the result has been represented in the eq 9 additionally in order to further investigate the ultimate strength interaction relationship considering different initial deflection a number of additional cases are taken into account to be analyzed which can not only guarantee the accuracy of the curve fitting methodology but verify whether the empirical formula proposed satisfies other amplitudes of initial deflection the results are represented in fig 19 which gives the ultimate strength interaction relationship with different amplitudes of initial deflection along with the relevancy between numerical results and these corresponding derived equations it can be observed from fig 19 that all the standard errors are very small that are close to zero and the coefficients of relevancy are very close to one therefore it can be concluded that these formulas can be conservatively utilized for the prediction of the hull girder ultimate strength interaction relationships under combined vertical bending moment and torsion this indicates that the exponents derived by curve fitting are reasonable table 6 summarizes the values of exponents α 1 and β 1 with corresponding initial deformation amplitude w 0 based on the values observed from table 6 a closed form formula as a function of the amplitude of initial deflection w 0 is empirically derived as follows by curve fitting methodology and represented in fig 20 20 α 1 2 34 1 07 1 e w 0 5 18 21 β 1 3 38 2 03 1 e w 0 6 23 the standard error and coefficient of relevancy between fe results and the derived interaction relationships are also plotted in fig 20 when three significant figures for derived exponents are accounted for it can be seen from fig 20 that the eq 20 and eq 21 are derived reasonably well and can apparently predict the interaction relationships between w 0 and α 1 β 1 respectively to study the uncertainty of the formula obtained four cases are adopted to represent two three four and five significant figures for the derived components respectively obviously comparison results show that the corresponding relevancy is very similar as is shown in fig 20 a and fig 20 b which means the derived interaction equations in the paper are quite stable and can be used for uniformity all the derived exponents in the paper are set to be 3 significant figures combining eq 20 and eq 21 with eq 18 a new ultimate strength interaction relationship under combined three load components can be obtained as follows 22 z 1 x β 1 1 α 1 α 3 y 1 x β 2 1 α 2 β 3 1 α 1 2 34 1 07 1 e w 0 5 18 β 1 3 38 2 03 1 e w 0 6 23 eq 22 represents the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs considering combined vertical bending horizontal bending torsion interaction incorporating amplitudes of initial deformations in eq 22 different 3d ultimate strength interaction relationships under different amplitudes of initial deformations can be obtained directly the exponents apart from α 1 and β 1 keep the same with that represented in eq 12 and eq 14 in which the initial deformation amplitude w 0 is taken at average level 5 conclusions this paper focuses on the ultimate strength characteristics of the ultra large container ship and a typical 10 000 teu container ship is adopted for the case study the ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder under pure vertical bending moment pure horizontal bending moment and pure torsion and ultimate strength interaction relationships between two load components each and between three load components are investigated the primary influencing factors including element sizes boundary conditions and initial imperfections are studied and it is assumed that only one load direction for horizontal and torsional load component is adopted but sagging and hogging moments are considered for vertical bending during the nonlinear fe analysis and the three kinds of load components can be combined each other freely based on the computed numerical results from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on the ultimate strength analyses against individual bending and torsional moment carried out by varying a number of key parameters mentioned above it can be seen that these parameters should be carefully chosen as they have significant impacts to the ultimate strength of hull girder and a balance between result accuracy and computation resources should be made in the nonlinear fe analysis 2 it is evident that the influence of initial imperfection on the hull girder ultimate strength is not negligible the ultimate strength decreases as the magnitude of initial deformation increases and decreases very quickly when the magnitude approaches or exceeds the corresponding plate thickness the local thin horse mode initial deformation has more significant effects on ultimate vertical bending strength than ultimate horizontal and torsional strength for container ships 3 combined loads can result in lower ultimate strength for ship hulls than that under pure bending or pure torsion actions when the second load applied is close to the ultimate strength against the individual load the reduction is more considerable 4 the proposed equations for the prediction of the hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between each two load component show approving curve fitting capabilities moreover the strength interaction under three load components has been deduced by three sets of interaction relationships between each two load components additionally a three dimensional picture representing hull girder strength envelope at the ultimate limit state is obtained 5 the presence of initial imperfection can change the strength interaction relationship under three load components based on the nonlinear finite element results the empirical formula predicting the hull girder 3d ultimate strength envelope incorporating varying initial deformations is investigated and the formula is verified quite stable after the uncertainty analysis and can be extracted for speedy reference finally further study is encouraged for the development of equations predicting hull girder ultimate strength envelope incorporating more load components to obtain a more complete picture of hull girder collapse acknowledgements the authors would like to

23653,ultra large container ship ulcs structures feature large deck openings and low torsional rigidity it is essential to accurately evaluate the maximum loading carrying capacity of ship structures when the ship sails at an oblique heading in rough sea the horizontal and torsional moments may approach or even exceed the magnitude of vertical bending moment in such cases hull girder ultimate strength assessment of container ships under load combinations comprising of vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is necessary in their structural design stage in this paper special attentions are thus paid to the hull girder ultimate strength of an ulcs i e a typical 10 000 teu container ship subjected to combined three load components mentioned above which is also a common load case in ships and ship shaped offshore structures and it is assumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely a series of nonlinear finite element analyses nfea is carried out effects of fabrication related initial imperfections are investigated in the present study based on the computed numerical results the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope considering initial deformation and incorporating the interaction relationships among three kinds of load components mentioned above is established keywords ulcs nfea initial imperfection ultimate strength assessment ultimate strength interaction relationship 3d ultimate strength envelope 1 introduction the ulcs is regarded as one of the most representative high tech products in the modern shipping industry for its particular characteristics larger deck opening larger hatch deformation higher speed higher stability requirement and high strength steel used more compared with normal container ships hhi hyundai heavy industries has developed an ulcs capable of carrying 13 000 teu as described in choi et al 2006 generally the ultimate strength assessment for vessels is of importance and the most essential strength measure is the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment which is usually referred to as the maximum hull girder loading capacity of the ship smith 1977 however in modern ship structural design the maximum loading carrying capacity of ship hulls under combined loads is considered to be a necessary safety index especially for vessels such as ultra large container ships due to its characteristics therefore it is of great importance to understand thoroughly the ultimate strength behaviors of ship hull girders under combined loads tracing the process of the progressive collapse and predicting a more complete and accurate ultimate strength envelope of hull girders are thus of great significance there have been a lot of efforts on the numerical analysis about ultimate strength behaviors of plates stiffened panels and box beams under combined loads conducted in previous literature a series of nonlinear finite element analysis to investigate the collapse behavior of plates having circular hole under combined biaxial compression and edge shear loads had been performed by paik 2008 and later paik and seo 2009a b has numerically conducted the ultimate strength behaviors study on steel unstiffened and stiffened plate structures subject to combined biaxial compression and lateral pressure actions and developed some useful insights on nonlinear finite element method application a comprehensive study including experimental and numerical study of finite element model of box beams under combined action of bending and torsion had been conducted by kim and chai 2008 for large scale ship structures paik et al 2008a b numerically dealt with methods useful for the ultimate limit state assessment of ships and ship shaped offshore structures the buckling and post buckling characteristics of hull girders under bending moment and combined loads have also been investigated to assess the hull girder strength paik and kim 2008 benson et al 2013 saad eldeen et al 2013 furthermore the safety margin of a 10 000 teu container ship under two load combinations had been explored by mohammed et al 2016 more recently from all the aforementioned literature it can see that most of studies assume the interaction relationships of hull girder structures ultimate strength between two load components like biaxial compressive loads or combined bending moment and torsion have similar equation forms that may be generalized to the following form namely 1 σ x σ x u α σ y σ y u β 1 2 m v m v u α m t m t u β 1 where σ x and σ y are applied longitudinal and transverse axial compression of a plate respectively σ x u and σ y u are the ultimate strength of a plate under longitudinal and transverse axial compression alone respectively m v and m t are applied bending and torsional moment respectively m v u and m t u are ultimate strength under individual bending moment and torsion respectively the exponents α and β depend on the size and type of the plate or ship however there are few investigations carried out for the maximum loading carrying capacity under combined three load components such as vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion in this regard this paper explores the progressive collapse of hull girder by applying nfea using commercial fea program abaqus cae and the ultimate strength interaction relationship of a typical 10 000 teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined the three load components one full hull compartment between two neighboring transverse bulkheads located at mid ship for the ulcs is adopted and modeled as study case in the present study to obtain insights into the ultimate strength behavior of hull girder under different combined two load components i e combined vertical bending and horizontal bending moments combined vertical bending and torsional moments and combined horizontal bending and torsional moments and combined the three load components it is presumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely and only one load direction of horizontal and torsional load component is applied during the fe analysis for the study purpose since the importance of vertical ultimate strength of ship hulls sagging and hogging moments are considered for vertical bending stiffened panel structures are commonly fabricated by fusion welding accordingly the construction members would have initial geometrical imperfections and residual stress during the process and it is basically assumed that these initial imperfections could affect the ultimate strength of construction members significantly paik and thayamballi 2003 therefore it is necessary to take into account the effects of initial geometrical imperfection mainly considering its shape and magnitude in the ultimate strength assessment as for residual stress it is not accounted for because of the present study purpose although it also affects the ultimate strength of stiffened plate structures paik and kim 2008 the influences of initial geometrical imperfections on the ultimate strength are investigated in this paper a series of collapse analyses is performed based on the numerical results obtained the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope representing a relatively complete picture of hull girder collapse is obtained and a simple design formula involving initial imperfection for predicting the ultimate strength of hull girder under vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is proposed 2 finite element modeling 2 1 description of object ship characteristics the principal characteristics of the object ship are shown in fig 1 in conjunction with tables 1 and 2 where fig 1 represents the typical transverse mid ship section of the ulcs and tables 1 and 2 show the main dimensions and most details of the ship the finite element model is illustrated in fig 2 a where x y and z denote longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively the origin locates in the outer bottom shell and at the intersection between the central longitudinal section and the left cross section of the fe model as depicted in fig 2 and the following relevant discussions are based on this coordinate system additionally the elastic perfectly plastic material is taken into account and the yield stress of the construction member is 355 mpa for ah material and 390 mpa for eh material and the young s modulus is 2 06e 05 mpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 while the density is 7 85e 09 t mm3 2 2 element type and mesh size convergence according to abaqus6 10 2010 documents the s4r element is a 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element that is capable of reduced integration which makes it computationally less expensive while the s3 element is a 3 node triangular general purpose shell element membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflection effects can be taken into account for adopting these types of elements it is common sense that the mesh size of finite element model should be fine enough to accurately simulate the collapse behavior of structures however more finer the mesh is more computational efforts should be caused in this regard a balance between result accuracy and computation efforts must be made and it is required that the number of mesh in a space between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners should be enough to get the required numerical accuracy i e it need capture the buckling collapse mode of the stiffened panel properly fine classnk 2014 thus adopting only two meshes in the space may be not enough in the present study two types of mesh sizes have been taken into account for mesh convergence study as represented in fig 2 shown in table 3 are the results fig 3 shows the progressive behavior of the ulcs under vertical bending moment varying the mesh precision note s 4 and s 8 denotes there are four and eight elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners on the panel respectively nt denotes the total number of elements us denotes ultimate strength di denotes the difference of ultimate strength between two cases ce denotes computation time under the same computer configuration it is shown in table 3 that the difference of ultimate strength between these two types of mesh is very small but that of computation efforts is huge and the progressive behavior of the ulcs under vertical bending is almost the same for the two types of mesh as is shown in fig 3 therefore the s 4 case is better to be selected for the fe model based on the study the fe model consists of 152 865 elements totally including 152 617 linear quadrilateral elements of type s4r and 248 linear triangular elements of type s3 in the present study 3 nonlinear finite element analysis 3 1 load application and boundary conditions boundary conditions are hugely important in the ultimate strength analysis using nfea different boundary conditions cause different warping stresses which can affect the ultimate strength of hull girder the ultimate strength of a hull girder under torsion with varying warping stresses has been discussed by paik et al 2001 conclusions show that the torsional stiffness may be significantly affected by warping stresses but the discrepancy of ultimate strength under bending or torsion is very small between partially restrained and completely restrained boundary conditions in this section three types of study cases are considered to investigate the effect of warping stresses on the hull girder ultimate strength of the ulcs and decide the boundary condition adopted in this paper namely fully free partially restrained and completely restrained for longitudinal warping displacements which is carried out in steps similar to the method introduced by paik et al 2001 which is described as follows for full free case it is that the longitudinal displacement degrees of freedom at all nodes are set free except one node at aft end cross section see fig 4 on the outer bottom center line to prevent the rigid body motion for partially restrained case it is that all degrees of freedom at the nodes of aft end are set to be fixed whereas the rest are free for completely restrained case it is that all degrees of freedom at the nodes of aft end are fixed meanwhile the longitudinal displacement degrees of freedom at all nodes are also fixed to facilitate the application of loads and boundary in this paper the two end cross sections of the fe model are attached to the reference points rp 1 and rp 2 by rigid body tie constraint as is shown in fig 4 which can keep the end sections of hull girder remain plane during the fe analysis the reference point is a designed point on which loads like forces moments or displacements applied can be efficiently transferred into a specific selection of nodes or elements the reference points are defined as the intersection between neutral axis and center symmetric line of the cross sections and set free classnk 2014 note that using the rigid body constraint means the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and does not affect the result solution as described in mohammed et al 2016 and cui et al 2017 which is also verified in this paper by comparison results between when torsion is imposed in the reference point of this paper and in the shear center of the cross section therefore the loads and boundary imposed are assigned on the reference points in the research and the combined loads are exerted simultaneously instead of sequentially the rotation angle method is adopted to simulate the external loads caused by the still water moment and wave moment which is applied at the reference point of fore end rp 1 the applied rotation angle should be large enough to obtain the ultimate bending moment of the hull girder which is set to be 0 005 rad in the paper the explicit dynamic analysis method is adopted in this paper that could consider the transient influence of time relative to the implicit static analysis method and avoid the convergence problem in iterative solution which is beneficial for large scale models ming et al 2017 to make the static or quasi static problem simulated and analyzed more accurately in the explicit dynamic analysis the point is to set a reasonable loading time theoretically the loading time should close to a quarter of the actual maximum wave period however if the actual loading time assessed by the wave period was used it would be very time consuming the short loading time can save computation time but too short loading time might overestimate the predicted results due to the hardening of material and effect of inertial ming et al 2017 generally it is considered that the loading time should be selected for at least 10 times of the model base frequency cycle so that the kinetic energy could keep small enough during the fe analysis in this paper the loading time is set to be 2s fig 5 a shows the vertical bending moment versus bending angle curves and fig 5 b shows the torsional moment versus twisting angle curves table 4 shows values of the hull girder ultimate strength of the ulcs under the three types of study cases it can be known from fig 5 that the effect of warping on the ultimate strength is larger under torsional moment than under vertical bending moments the presence of warping stress affects the post ultimate strength whereas has slight effects on the initial stiffness of hull girder under vertical bending however has significant effects on the ultimate torsional strength when the warping displacements are restrained torsion will develop warping stresses as well as shear stresses which can increase the ultimate torsional strength with increase in the degree of warping restraints the torsional rigidity increases as is shown in fig 5 b for the second boundary condition since warping displacements are partially restrained both warping and shear stresses are developed by torsional moment and torsional rigidity will not be so small like full free case and not very large like completely restrained case which is similar as described in paik et al 2001 therefore the boundary adopted for the following studies in this paper is that the aft end cross section of the hull girder is fixed while the fore end is set free because of the rigid body tie constraints used in both end sections according to thin walled mechanics both bi moments and warping stresses exist on both ends which means the adopted boundary condition lies somewhere between the partially restrained warping and entirely restrained warping boundary conditions so it can be accepted paik et al 2001 cui et al 2017 3 2 initial imperfection it is well recognized that the shape of the stiffened plate initial deformation is equivalent to the first elastic buckling mode which could give the lowest resistance against the ultimate strength however many researchers have investigated the effects of the deflection shape and magnitude of the initial deformation of welded steel plates and assumed the shape as a double fourier series will be better to model the reality of these structures paik et al 2004 yao et al 1992 1998 for this paper the local thin horse mode of initial deformation is imposed on local panels and that of flexural buckling and tripping modes on stiffeners to represent actual initial deflection in stiffened panels located in mid ship section of the hull girder including double side shell structures and double bottom structures tanaka et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the following post welding initial geometrical imperfection expression of thin horse mode based on double fourier series is accounted for as eq 3 3 w w 0 sin m π x a sin n π y b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflection a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frames and b is the distance between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners in the present study n is always kept constant and equal to 1 m is the number of buckling half wave which is equal to a b and need to be an integer otherwise it is taken as the minimum integer satisfying a b m m 1 the tripping mode of initial deflection for stiffener local sideways can be expressed as v s 4 v s v o s z h w sin π x a where h w is the height of the stiffener v o s is the magnitude which could be 0 001a according to yao et al 1998 as for w 0 i e the amplitude of the initial deformation of the local plate there have been many researchers explored it according to faulkner 1975 the formula of w 0 is indicated as follows 5 w 0 k β 2 t w for t w t k β 2 t for t w t where β b t σ y e is the slenderness ratio of the plate which is an important parameter to affect the ultimate strength of plates t is the plate thickness σ y is the material yield stress and e is the young s modulus and t w is the thickness of stiffener web k is a coefficient which may approximately be in the range 0 05 0 15 for marine structures according to masaoka 1996 w 0 is defined as the following form 6 w 0 k b 2 t where k is a coefficient which may be taken as k 8 10 5 for marine structures according to smith et al 1988 w 0 is defined as follows 7 w 0 0 025 β 2 t 0 1 β 2 t 0 3 β 2 t for slight level for average level for severe level β and t are defined as eq 5 an example of initial deflection mode for the hull girder with average level according to smith et al 1988 is represented in fig 6 which is scaled by 200 for clear exhibition 4 results and discussions 4 1 the effects of initial imperfection on ultimate strength of hull girder since the significance of initial deflection on the maximum load carrying capacity of hull girder six types of amplitudes of initial deflection from extensive literature as indicated in previous section have been chosen to be accounted for in the present study which are w 0 7 according to faulkner w 0 5 according to masaoka and w 0 2 5 for slight level w 0 10 for average level which is more common circumstance w 0 30 for severe level according to smith additionally w 0 16 which is plate thickness of the outer side shell is also taken into account the analysis results of the hull girder against pure vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional moments are illustrated in figs 7 9 respectively fig 7a shows the reduction of the ultimate strength of the hull girder under pure vertical bending moment with varying amplitudes of initial imperfection the ordinate in fig 7a m v m v 0 represents the reduction factor of the ultimate strength where m v and m v 0 denotes the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment with and without taking account of initial imperfection respectively it can be seen from fig 7a that the increase of the amplitude of initial imperfection could cause severe reduction of the ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder under both sagging and hogging moment and the reduction is becoming more considerable when the amplitude of initial imperfection approaches or exceeds plate thickness this indicates that suitable magnitude of initial deflection should be adopted in fe analysis fig 7b shows the progressive collapse of the hull girder with initial geometrical deflection under pure vertical bending including sagging and hogging moments it is observed from fig 7b that the initial loading paths are almost the same for different initial deflections whereas the unloading paths are varied widely in other words the presence of initial imperfection has slight influence on the initial stiffness of hull girder but has significant influence on the ultimate vertical bending strength values figs 8a and 9a show the reduction of the ultimate strength of the hull girder under pure horizontal bending and torsional moments with varying amplitude of initial imperfection respectively figs 8b and 9b show the progressive collapse of the hull girder under pure horizontal bending and torsional moments respectively it is observed from figs 8a and 9a that the ultimate strength under horizontal bending and torsional moment decreases slightly with the increase of the magnitude of initial imperfection the maximum ultimate strength reduction percentage under horizontal bending moment and torsion is about only 4 and 2 respectively compared with intact hull girder both of which are far smaller than the maximum vertical ultimate strength reduction it can be seen from figs 8b and 9b that no significant difference can be observed between the progressive collapse behaviors with different initial imperfection while some efforts have been made to predict the initial imperfections theoretically and numerically approximate methods based on the insights from measurements are usually adopted for design purposes because of the complexity of the phenomena of initial imperfection involved paik and thayamballi 2003 if the initial deformation mode adopted is consistent with the local failure shape of the hull girder ultimate limit state which will reduce maximally the ultimate strength of ship hulls the initial deformation mode assumed in this paper i e the local thin horse mode is the most unfavorable to a panel under predominantly longitudinal compressive axial loads such as double bottom under hogging moments and double side shells under sagging moments e g container vessels subjected to vertical bending moment this initial deformation mode may be different from the local failure shape of the hull girder ultimate limit state under torsional and horizontal moments torsional failure deformation usually occurs in the diagonal direction of the plate and when the hull girder is under horizontal bending moment one side shell is subjected to compressive loads whereas another is subjected to tension which may increase the tensile strength of the side subjected to tension with this initial deformation therefore from all the cases it can be concluded that the effects of initial imperfections assumed in this paper on the ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder are more significant whereas on the ultimate horizontal and torsional strength of the hull girder are less significant with respect to ultimate vertical bending strength 4 2 ultimate strength analyses under individual load component in this section a series of hull girder s ultimate strength analyses is conducted under pure vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion respectively for simplicity only the amplitude of initial defection w 0 10 average level according to smith as stated in section 4 1 is considered as study case the von mises stress distributions of the hull girder at the ultimate limit state and post ultimate limit state under vertical bending including sagging and hogging torsional and horizontal bending moments are represented in fig 10 a d respectively shown in fig 11 a c are the progressive collapses of the hull girder from the figures mentioned above it can be seen that the von mises stress distributions and failure modes are quite different between the three load cases this indicates that combined two or three load components would result in the unfavorable condition for marine structures which also conforms to the real situation since container ships can be characterized as a hull girder with very large deck opening this type of ship has a relatively small torsional rigidity compared to the ships with closed cross section which thus is more vulnerable to the torsional moment the effect of torsion on the ultimate longitudinal strength of hull girder may be significant therefore ultimate strength assessments under combined loads should be carried out 4 3 ultimate strength analysis under combined two load components in an actual ship vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion generally do not peak at the same time however from the point of view of the ultimate loading carrying capacity of hull girder that is considered as a particularly important factor for evaluation of hull girder safety margin it is necessary to analyze the ultimate strength collapse behaviors and interaction relationships under different combined loads which could obtain the most dangerous failure mode and ultimate strength envelope of hull girder sequentially ensure the safety of ships under various wave conditions of course the total longitudinal loads of hull girder generally include two parts wave induce loads and still water induced loads the former is related to wave direction and shape the latter is related to loading condition of ship mohammed et al 2012 obtained the global wave load combination from the short term and long term analyses which is presented in table 5 where the magnitude of vertical bending moment horizontal bending moment and torsion is the biggest the second and the minimum respectively therefore it may be concluded that it is a very severe case when vertical bending and horizontal bending moments are combined since the two load components are very big however it should be noted that the ultimate strength of ship hulls with low torsional rigidity such as container ships can be reduced significantly when torsion is large thus it is also a very severe case when vertical bending moment and torsion are combined for container ships in this paper the ultimate strength of hull girder is analyzed from the perspective of hull girder structural loading carrying capacity and the wave direction is not considered and also it is assumed that the three kinds of main loads can be combined each other freely paik et al 2001 4 3 1 progressive collapse behaviors firstly the ultimate strength of the hull girder under sagging and hogging moments in conjunction with five different magnitudes of torsion is investigated the influence of applied torsions on the ultimate vertical bending strength is shown in fig 12 where the pure sagging and hogging load cases are also plotted for comparison similarly the effect of torsion on the ultimate horizontal strength is represented in fig 13 and the effect of horizontal moment on the ultimate vertical strength is represented in fig 14 it is evident from figs 12 14 that combined loads have considerable effects on the hull girder ultimate strength in addition the ultimate strength in the main direction decreases significantly with the increase of the second load component furthermore when the value of applied second load component is close to the ultimate strength under the load alone the reduction is more considerable to further assess the ultimate strength under combined loads it would be better to study the ultimate strength interaction relationships between combined load components 4 3 2 ultimate strength interaction relationships under combined two loads in this section a series of analyses for the ultimate strength interaction relationships of the ulcs between combined two load components is conducted it is assumed that all the loads are applied as the same proportion simultaneously during one case five cases are analyzed to investigate the ultimate strength interaction relationships between each two load component firstly the ultimate strength interaction relationship among vertical bending including sagging and hogging moment and torsion is investigated which is usually given by the expression as follows 8 m v m v u α 1 m t m t u β 1 1 on the basis of computed numerical results the equations representing ultimate strength interaction relationship among combined vertical bending and torsional moments are empirically derived by curve fitting method as the following and represented in fig 15 9 m v m v u 1 42 m t m t u 5 03 1 for sagging m v m v u 1 56 m t m t u 5 26 1 for hogging the relevancy between the fe analysis results and the derived eq 9 are also plotted as a reference in fig 15 it is seen that the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are respectively 0 0015 and 0 9979 for sagging case 0 0005 and 0 9992 for hogging case which means that the eq 9 will be reasonable to predict the ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs between vertical bending moment and torsion to verify the above formulations derived by curve fitting method for an example container vessel i e the typical 10 000 teu container ship they are compared with the following equations proposed by paik et al 2001 for a typical 4300 teu container ship which are also plotted in fig 15 10 m v m v u 3 1 m t m t u 3 1 1 for sagging m v m v u 3 7 m t m t u 3 7 1 for hogging it should be noted that the eq 10 is established assuming that the magnitude of torsion is not predominant meanwhile torsion is not a very sensitive load component affecting the ultimate vertical bending strength of ship hulls paik et al 2001 it is seen that from fig 15 when the magnitude of torsion is not large the differences between eq 9 and eq 10 are negligible and the mean absolute error mae for the whole eq 9 and eq 10 are only 0 033 for sagging case and 0 038 for hogging case therefore from the above analysis the ultimate strength interaction relationship obtained among vertical bending and torsion and the method adopted in this paper have certain accuracy and commonality for container ships especially for ulcs and could be used for speedy reference but the exponents may need to be tuned for different ship types and sizes particularly similarly the ultimate strength interaction relationship among combined horizontal bending moment and torsion is generally given by the following expression 11 m h m h u α 2 m t m t u β 2 1 applying an approach similar to that mentioned above the equation representing ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs among combined horizontal bending moment and torsion is derived by curve fitting based on numerical results as follows 12 m h m h u 1 35 m t m t u 4 48 1 fig 16 shows the ultimate strength interaction relationship between horizontal bending moment and torsion along with the relevancy between fe results and the derived equation as is shown in fig 16 the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are 0 0001 and 0 9999 respectively comparing the computed numerical results with eq 12 this indicates that eq 12 can predict the ultimate strength interaction relationship between combined horizontal bending moment and torsion finally the ultimate strength interaction relationship among vertical bending and horizontal bending moments is given by the following expression 13 m v m v u α 3 m h m h u β 3 1 based on computed fe results the equation representing ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and horizontal bending moments is derived as follows 14 m v m v u 1 08 m h m h u 1 93 1 for sagging m v m v u 1 67 m h m h u 1 48 1 for hogging fig 17 shows the ultimate strength interaction relationship in which the corresponding relevancy between numerical results and the derived eq 14 are also plotted the standard error and coefficient of relevancy are respectively 0 0013 and 0 9981 for sagging 0 0014 and 0 9975 for hogging therefore it can be concluded that eq 14 is in fairly good agreement with the ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and horizontal bending moments 4 4 the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs in order to determine a more accurate hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs and obtain a complete picture of hull girder response at the ultimate limit state which is the limiting condition beyond which the ship hull will fail to perform its functions it is of course important to analyze the ultimate strength of the hull girder under combined three load components i e vertical bending horizontal bending and torsional moments which could simulate the most extreme load case suffered in a lifetime for a ship based on the numerical results the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs is obtained which represents the true hull girder safety margin moreover because of the significant influences of initial deformation on ultimate strength of hull girder the formula for predicting ultimate strength interaction under a combination of three load components involving amplitudes of initial deformations is also proposed 4 4 1 ultimate strength interaction under combined three load components the most point to assess the ultimate strength of the hull girder under combined three load components is to investigate the strength interaction relationship with the three loads simultaneously applied that can be derived in the present study by three sets of interaction relationships between combined each two load components i e vertical bending moment versus torsion relationship horizontal bending moment versus torsion relationship and vertical bending moment versus horizontal bending moment relationship as stated in previous section three sets of the ultimate strength interaction relationships between each two load components are given by eq 8 eq 11 and eq 13 respectively when we are going to add the 3rd dimension load to the interaction relationship among two load components the ultimate strength in each dimension will be decreased because of the influence of the 3rd load component as stated in section 4 3 1 now we use the three sets of 2d interaction relationships mentioned above to derive a new 3d relationship for the study purpose i e for the emphasis on the methodology that mainly focus on magnitudes of ultimate strength only the sagging moment is taken into account to represent the vertical bending moment for conservative study and also for the sake of compute efforts in this section firstly torsion is chosen to be the parameter the 3rd load component affecting the ultimate vertical and horizontal strength therefore the changed ultimate vertical and horizontal strength can be derived according to eq 8 and eq 11 respectively as follows 15 m v u c m v u 1 m t m t u β 1 1 α 1 16 m h u c m h u 1 m t m t u β 2 1 α 2 where m v u c and m h u c are the changed vertical bending and horizontal bending ultimate strength because of applied torsion respectively for simplification we make m v r 1 m t m t u β 1 1 α 1 and m h r 1 m t m t u β 2 1 α 2 then we replace m v u and m h u in eq 13 with m v u c and m h u c respectively a new equation could be obtained which is given by the following expression 17 m v m v u m v r α 3 m h m h u m h r β 3 1 secondly m t m t u m h m h u and m v m v u are replaced by x y and z representing three load components respectively submitting them into eq 17 then it will involve three dimensions which will be rewritten in the following form 18 z 1 x β 1 1 α 1 α 3 y 1 x β 2 1 α 2 β 3 1 the eq 18 is the ultimate strength interaction relationship among three load components based on the coefficients α 1 β 3 calculated in eq 9 eq 12 and eq 14 the three dimensional interaction relationship of the typical ulcs is obtained by eq 19 as follows and represented in fig 18 which is also the 3d hull girder ultimate strength envelope of the ulcs with the amplitude of initial defection w 0 10 it should be noted that obtaining the picture needs plenty of statistics 19 z 1 x 5 03 1 1 42 1 08 y 1 x 4 48 1 1 35 1 93 1 in addition a series of nfeas is conducted to verify the procedure of deriving the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship a number of finite element results 170 cases are carried out actually is obtained and shown in fig 18 the mean absolute error mae between the fe results and eq 19 is 0 03 which indicates that the formula eq 19 can fit the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship reasonably well 4 4 2 the 3d ultimate strength envelope involving initial deflection as discussed in previous section initial defection has significant effects on the ultimate strength under vertical bending moment moreover torsional moments are normally considered to be important for container ships with low torsional rigidity therefore it is of great importance to explore the effects of initial geometrical imperfection on the ultimate strength interaction relationship between vertical bending and torsional moments the case has been analyzed when the magnitude of initial defection w 0 10 and the result has been represented in the eq 9 additionally in order to further investigate the ultimate strength interaction relationship considering different initial deflection a number of additional cases are taken into account to be analyzed which can not only guarantee the accuracy of the curve fitting methodology but verify whether the empirical formula proposed satisfies other amplitudes of initial deflection the results are represented in fig 19 which gives the ultimate strength interaction relationship with different amplitudes of initial deflection along with the relevancy between numerical results and these corresponding derived equations it can be observed from fig 19 that all the standard errors are very small that are close to zero and the coefficients of relevancy are very close to one therefore it can be concluded that these formulas can be conservatively utilized for the prediction of the hull girder ultimate strength interaction relationships under combined vertical bending moment and torsion this indicates that the exponents derived by curve fitting are reasonable table 6 summarizes the values of exponents α 1 and β 1 with corresponding initial deformation amplitude w 0 based on the values observed from table 6 a closed form formula as a function of the amplitude of initial deflection w 0 is empirically derived as follows by curve fitting methodology and represented in fig 20 20 α 1 2 34 1 07 1 e w 0 5 18 21 β 1 3 38 2 03 1 e w 0 6 23 the standard error and coefficient of relevancy between fe results and the derived interaction relationships are also plotted in fig 20 when three significant figures for derived exponents are accounted for it can be seen from fig 20 that the eq 20 and eq 21 are derived reasonably well and can apparently predict the interaction relationships between w 0 and α 1 β 1 respectively to study the uncertainty of the formula obtained four cases are adopted to represent two three four and five significant figures for the derived components respectively obviously comparison results show that the corresponding relevancy is very similar as is shown in fig 20 a and fig 20 b which means the derived interaction equations in the paper are quite stable and can be used for uniformity all the derived exponents in the paper are set to be 3 significant figures combining eq 20 and eq 21 with eq 18 a new ultimate strength interaction relationship under combined three load components can be obtained as follows 22 z 1 x β 1 1 α 1 α 3 y 1 x β 2 1 α 2 β 3 1 α 1 2 34 1 07 1 e w 0 5 18 β 1 3 38 2 03 1 e w 0 6 23 eq 22 represents the 3d ultimate strength interaction relationship of the ulcs considering combined vertical bending horizontal bending torsion interaction incorporating amplitudes of initial deformations in eq 22 different 3d ultimate strength interaction relationships under different amplitudes of initial deformations can be obtained directly the exponents apart from α 1 and β 1 keep the same with that represented in eq 12 and eq 14 in which the initial deformation amplitude w 0 is taken at average level 5 conclusions this paper focuses on the ultimate strength characteristics of the ultra large container ship and a typical 10 000 teu container ship is adopted for the case study the ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder under pure vertical bending moment pure horizontal bending moment and pure torsion and ultimate strength interaction relationships between two load components each and between three load components are investigated the primary influencing factors including element sizes boundary conditions and initial imperfections are studied and it is assumed that only one load direction for horizontal and torsional load component is adopted but sagging and hogging moments are considered for vertical bending during the nonlinear fe analysis and the three kinds of load components can be combined each other freely based on the computed numerical results from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on the ultimate strength analyses against individual bending and torsional moment carried out by varying a number of key parameters mentioned above it can be seen that these parameters should be carefully chosen as they have significant impacts to the ultimate strength of hull girder and a balance between result accuracy and computation resources should be made in the nonlinear fe analysis 2 it is evident that the influence of initial imperfection on the hull girder ultimate strength is not negligible the ultimate strength decreases as the magnitude of initial deformation increases and decreases very quickly when the magnitude approaches or exceeds the corresponding plate thickness the local thin horse mode initial deformation has more significant effects on ultimate vertical bending strength than ultimate horizontal and torsional strength for container ships 3 combined loads can result in lower ultimate strength for ship hulls than that under pure bending or pure torsion actions when the second load applied is close to the ultimate strength against the individual load the reduction is more considerable 4 the proposed equations for the prediction of the hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between each two load component show approving curve fitting capabilities moreover the strength interaction under three load components has been deduced by three sets of interaction relationships between each two load components additionally a three dimensional picture representing hull girder strength envelope at the ultimate limit state is obtained 5 the presence of initial imperfection can change the strength interaction relationship under three load components based on the nonlinear finite element results the empirical formula predicting the hull girder 3d ultimate strength envelope incorporating varying initial deformations is investigated and the formula is verified quite stable after the uncertainty analysis and can be extracted for speedy reference finally further study is encouraged for the development of equations predicting hull girder ultimate strength envelope incorporating more load components to obtain a more complete picture of hull girder collapse acknowledgements the authors would like to

23654,the three dimensional nonlinear dynamic model of a long marine riser with kelvin voigt viscoelasticity properties under vortex induced vibration is proposed and investigated the objective is to find the appropriate viscoelastic coefficients to suppress the nonlinear dynamic response of a marine riser the pipe is placed in a uniform cross flow and geometric nonlinearities are considered two distributed and coupled van der pol wake oscillators are applied to characterize the fluctuating lift and drag coefficients respectively the highly nonlinear fluid structure interaction equations are directly coupled and solved by the finite element method firstly the model is validated by comparing with published experimental data and numerical simulation results then modal analysis is performed to determine the impact of viscoelastic coefficients on the natural frequency for different damping values a nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out to determine the impacts of the viscoelastic coefficients on displacements stresses modal variation and phase portraits the results show that the viscoelastic coefficients have a significant effect on the natural frequency of the studied marine riser it is also demonstrated that appropriate viscoelastic coefficients are very important to effectively suppress the maximum displacements and stresses keywords marine riser 3 d response viscoelasticity vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of a long marine riser subjected to a steady uniform flow generates several intriguing fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena which are widely found in ocean engineering such as risers mooring cables and pipelines the vivs are the major reason of fatigue damage and reduction in structure lifetime the increase of operational lifetime of any structure is a constant occurrence for different engineering fields one of the ways to increase structures lifetime may reduce vibration amplitudes by optimizing based designs that account for viscoelastic materials some researchers start to pay attention to the experimental and mathematical model for viscoelastic pipes borges et al 2011 2014a pham et al 2016 over the past several decades models that predict the response of marine risers have received considerable attention the majority of research efforts related to the cylinder viv modeling simulation and experiment in the past have dedicated to investigate flexibly mounted rigid cylinders bearman 2011 sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and long flexible cylinders brika and laneville 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009 srinil 2010 2011 wu et al 2012 for rigid cylinders facchinetti et al 2004 presented a refined wake oscillator however geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities properties are very important to the accuracy of response amplitudes srinil and zanganeh 2012 zanganeh and srinil 2014 for flexible long cylinders with initial straight configurations such as vertical top tensioned risers song et al 2011 a 3 d phenomenological model for the analysis and prediction of viv of long flexible pipe in uniform was presented by zanganeh and srinil 2016 by relying on the finite difference method fdm this model can accurately predict the nonlinear dynamic response of marine risers it should be noted that the effects of internal fluid are neglected in aforementioned models as for the viv dynamic responses of a flexible fluid conveying riser some researchers have dedicated to investigate the nonlinear dynamic responses in the last decades kaewunruen et al 2005 keber and wiercigroch 2008 paidoussis 1998 based on the principle of virtual work a model for analyzing the viv of extensible steel catenary risers transporting internal flows was established by meng and chen 2012 some excitations such as pulsating internal fluid and top end excitation have also been discussed for riser transporting internal fluid in detail dai et al 2014a 2014b he et al 2017 furthermore cross flow cf viv of a flexible fluid conveying pipe which internal velocities are from subcritical to supercritical have also been examined in recent years dai et al 2014b meng et al 2017 however a 3 d dynamic model is not mentioned and these models don t account for the viscoelastic effect of these structures consequently material viscoelasticity of marine risers has been investigated by some researchers in the last few years including experiments and numerical simulations bahraini et al 2013 2014 bi and hao 2016 eldred et al 2012 galucio et al 2004 lesieutre et al 2015 palmeri and ntotsios 2016 a finite element formulation for transient dynamic analysis of sandwich beams with embedded viscoelastic material was presented by galucio et al 2004 and the results illustrated that the model had a good agreement with experimental data borges et al 2011 2014b proposed and investigated a concept to suppress vibrations of steel catenary risers by using viscoelastic sandwich layers and a great increase of damping was observed considering kelvin voigt viscoelasticity of pipe material the cross flow direction dynamics of simply supported fluid conveying pipes with geometric imperfections were studied by wang et al 2012 but the effect of material viscoelasticity on the response of the riser is not discussed however insights into the fully coupled cf in line il and axial ax viv of a marine riser considering material viscoelasticity are still lacking in the literature therefore the present research aims at overcoming such model limitation by considering three dimensional dynamic responses of a marine viscoelastic riser in this work the 3 d nonlinear viv prediction model of a marine riser with material viscoelasticity is developed which is not reported before next by considering geometric nonlinearities the three dimensional viv prediction model of the riser under internal flow is presented in section 2 in section 3 nonlinear hydrodynamic lift and drag forces are discussed the model validation with numerical and experimental comparisons is first discussed and the natural frequency and nonlinear dynamic responses influenced by viscoelastic coefficient are investigated in detail for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities in section 4 the main findings of the present paper are drawn out in section 5 2 three dimensional viv mathematical model for marine viscoelastic risers in this paper the fully submerged pipe is assumed to perfectly straight at its vertical static equilibrium under the apparent weight the marine riser is simply supported at both ends and placed within a uniform fluid flow with cross flow velocity u z aligned with z direction as shown in fig 1 a the euler bernoulli beam theory is utilized to model the slender viscoelastic pipe in the current work the pipe material is assumed to be viscoelastic according to the kelvin voigt formulation therefore the relationship between the stress and strain may be expressed as follows 1 σ 1 e e t e ε where σ and ε are the stress and strain respectively e is the coefficient of internal dissipation and t is the time let a e e eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 2 σ 1 a t e ε variation results corresponding to a long flexible circular cylinder subjected to a steady uniform flow can follow the researches of ricciardi and saitta 2008 and srinil et al 2009 following zanganeh and srinil 2016 and accounting for the effect of internal dissipation the nonlinear partial differential equations of 3 d coupled cf il and ax motions of a flexible long viscoelastic pipe can be expressed as follows 3 m m a u c u e i u i v a e i u i v t u 1 a t e a r w u w u 1 2 1 a t e a r 3 u u 2 u w 2 2 w w u u v 2 2 v v u f x 4 m m a v c v e i v i

neutrally buoyant vertical or horizontal cylinder t is a constant tension that is to say t t t as considered in the experimental model of song et al 2011 the boundary conditions of the riser are assumed as simply supported pipe and can be expressed as follows 7 u 0 t 0 v 0 t 0 w 0 t 0 8 u 0 t 0 v 0 t 0 w 0 t 0 9 u l t 0 v l t 0 w l t 0 10 u l t 0 v l t 0 w l t 0 3 hydrodynamic forces by considering the relative velocities between the cf and the pipe the components of drag and lift forces in three directions are shown in fig 1 c especially the project of stationary pipe is show in fig 1 d the drag and lift forces identified with il and cf directions act on the pipe section with a clockwise horizontal angle θ in the x y plane and vertical angle γ in the x z plane accordingly the projected three dimensional fluid forces can be expressed as follows 11 f x f l cos γ sin θ f d cos γ sin θ 12 f y f l cos γ cos θ f d cos γ sin θ 13 f z f l sin γ f d sin γ in which f d and f l are drag and lift forces respectively and can be depicted as 14 f d 1 2 ρ d u r e l 2 c d c d 15 f l 1 2 ρ d u r e l 2 c l where c d is the mean drag coefficient assumed as c d 1 2 c d and c l are time

c l c l 0 facchinetti et al 2004 the variations of p and q can be described as 17 p 2 ε u ω f p 2 1 p 4 ω f 2 p λ u d u 18 q ε v ω f q 2 1 q ω f 2 q λ v d v herein ω f 2 π s t u d is the vortex

numerical simulations system parameters related to numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the highly nonlinear partial differential eqs 3 5 in conjunction with eqs 17 18 are solved by fem implemented in comsol multiphysics v5 2a software mehrzad tabatabaian 2016 initial conditions are specified at the static equilibrium for the riser u v w u v w 0 with p 2 p 0 and q 2 q 0 for wake variables the coupled partial differential equations are first reduced to second order partial differential coupled equations then the coupled equations are directly expressed in the general form pde interface of comsol the shape function type is lagrange and the order of finite element is quadratic the time step δ t 0 001 s and the element size δ z 0 1 m have been chosen through a series of convergence yielding stable simulations of all considered viscoelasticity coefficients and flow velocities in this study case validation tests of numerical simulations with the experimental model and finite difference approach of zanganeh and srinil 2016 have been performed the natural frequency and nonlinear dynamic responses influenced by viscoelastic coefficients are also investigated for different cross flow velocities 4 1 model validation with numerical and experimental comparisons model validations are first performed through comparisons with published experiment by song et al 2011 and numerical simulation results concluded by zanganeh and srinil 2016 which have highlighted the importance of considering the axial dynamic coupling the amplification of il mean displacements the geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities therefore numerical prediction results based on the fully nonlinear 3 d model are compared with experimental results of song et al 2011 and fdm results of zanganeh and srinil 2016 as shown in fig 2 inspecting the curves from fig 2a and c it is noted that numerical and experimental of obtained maximum il a u m a x d and cf a v m a x d amplitudes are compared with the increase of u and fig 2b and d depict the associated root mean square rms results a u r m s d a v r m s d with the increase of u r which is defined as u r u f 0 d with f 0 being the dominant oscillation frequency of riser inspecting the plots in fig 2a it is noted that the maximum cross flow displacement predicted by the numerical simulation results is slightly larger than the experimental value especially when the cross flow velocity is 0 3 m s the experimental results are located at the lowest amplitude the simulation results are in the maximum position on the contrary however a great difference occurs in the il response comparison with numerical results and experimental value fig 2c it is consistent with fig 2b and d for cf and il responses respectively in general the fem results are slightly larger than the experimental and fdm results this can be explained that a damping error between numerical and experimental model leads to the different results in addition the boundary conditions are also discrepant the top boundary condition in experiment is spring support whereas the top boundary condition in numerical simulation is simply support 4 2 natural frequency in order to determine the natural frequency of marine riser for different viscoelastic coefficients the hydrodynamic forces on the right side of eqs 3 5 are removed to analyze the natural frequency of marine risers the first nine frequencies of the marine riser are displayed in fig 3 with different viscoelastic coefficients when c 0 01 fig 3a and c 0 11 fig 3b respectively clearly it can be seen from fig 3 that the viscoelastic coefficient has little effect on the frequency if the natural mode is lower than mode 6 furthermore as the mode order of the riser is higher than mode 6 the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on the natural frequency decreases with the increase of mode order it follows from the plotted curves in fig 3 that the natural frequency of the riser decreases faster as the viscoelasticity coefficient increases for different damping values 4 3 three dimensional viv responses the impact of the viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of marine riser are investigated for different cf velocities of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s which are corresponding to the first mode third mode fifth mode and seventh mode of the cf responses of the riser respectively when the viscoelastic coefficient is not considered the plotted curves in fig 4 show the maximum il 4a cf 4b and ax 4c displacements of flexible riser for different values of cross flow velocity inspecting the plots in fig 4a and b it is noted that the maximum il cf and ax displacements decrease linearly with the increase of the viscoelasticity coefficient however it is observed from fig 4c and d that the maximum il cf and ax displacements increase firstly and then decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient in fig 4c whereas the maximum il cf and ax displacements first decrease when a is change from 0 to 0 01 then increase when a is change from 0 01 to 0 02 and decrease finally with increasing the viscoelastic coefficient in fig 4d this is due to the fact that the viscoelastic coefficients have a significant effect on the natural frequencies of higher order modes for flexible pipe for larger cross flow velocity the response mode order is higher the natural frequency will decrease resulting in the increase of maximum displacement whereas the viscoelastic coefficient will decrease the maximum displacement within the same mode order therefore the dynamic response amplitudes of the marine riser are determined by combination both viscoelastic coefficient and cf velocity which have an important effect on the higher natural frequency of the riser and the vortex shedding frequency respectively the variations of the maximum and minimum il bending cf bending and longitudinal stresses as functions of viscoelastic coefficient are plotted in figs 5 8 when the cross flow velocity is chosen to be 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s respectively clearly it can be seen from fig 5 that the maximum and minimum il cf and longitudinal stresses decrease linearly with the increase of viscoelasticity coefficient the results concluded from fig 6 show that the maximum and minimum il cf and longitudinal stresses decrease with the increase of viscoelasticity coefficient however the variations of the maximum and minimum il and longitudinal stresses in figs 7 8 are more complicated it is found that the maximum il and longitudinal stresses first increase and then decrease with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient in fig 7 whereas the maximum longitudinal stresses decrease firstly then increase and decrease finally in fig 8 inspecting the plotted curves in figs 5 8 it is noted that the maximum and minimum cf stresses decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient for different cross flow velocities therefore an appropriate viscoelastic coefficient should be chosen to suppress the three dimensional dynamic response of marine riser figs 9 12 presents the influences of viscoelastic coefficient on the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses of the riser when u 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s respectively inspecting fig 9 it is found that the il displacement responses are combination both modal 1 and modal 3 and the cf displacement responses are mode 1 it is also revealed that the viscoelastic coefficient has a little impact on the il and cf displacement amplitudes fig 10 portrays the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses for different viscoelastic coefficients when cf velocity are 0 3 m s it can be seen from fig 10 that the il displacement response show modal 5 and the cf displacement responses are mode 3 moreover the mode distribution of the il displacement responses is not regular as for u 0 6 m s fig 11 illustrates that the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses for different viscoelastic coefficients inspecting fig 11 it is found that the il displacement response show modal 9 and the cf displacement responses are mode 5 it is also revealed that the mode distribution of the il displacement responses is not regular and the distribution characteristics are different with increasing the values of viscoelastic coefficient the il and cf displacement responses of the riser at a 0 001 fig 12a 0 03 fig 12b and 0 11 fig 12c are plotted in fig 12 with an equal time interval when u 0 8 m s the plotted curves in fig 12 show the mode associated with the cf displacement responses of marine riser will vary with viscoelastic coefficient in fig 12a the result demonstrates that mode 11 dominates the il displacement responses and the cf displacement responses of riser are mode 7 as can be seen from fig 12b and c it can be concluded that mode 9 plays an important role in the il displacement responses and the cf displacement responses of the riser shows mode 5 it is also revealed that the mode transition phenomenon of the il displacement keep pace with those of cf as for the il displacement response it is found that the displacement amplitudes are larger when the viscoelastic coefficient is larger furthermore the results from fig 12 evidence that an increase in the viscoelastic coefficient results in the decrease of the cf mode order of the riser for constant u this is because the effect of viscoelastic coefficient on ax displacements and longitudinal stresses is firstly decreased due to the fact that an increase in the viscoelastic coefficient leads to the decrease of natural frequency for higher cf velocity and viscoelastic coefficient owns damping effect it is revealed that the damping effect has a significant effect on the responses of the riser for larger viscoelastic coefficient and higher cf velocity it is also found that if the mode order jumping decreases the displacement will increase to dominate the variation of riser response within small range this can explain the dynamic response complexity of mariner riser with the change of viscoelastic coefficient under larger cf velocity in general the response modes of the riser are decided by combination of the vortex shedding frequency related to the cf velocity and natural frequency influenced by the viscoelastic coefficient the frequency analyses reveal that the natural frequency is decreased with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient and the decreased amplitude of natural frequency is increased with the increase of mode order however the order of response mode is decreased with the increase of viscoelastic efficient due to the fact that the damping effect of viscoelastic efficient dominates the responses of the riser moreover we can predict that the mode transition phenomenon is easier happened when the vortex shedding frequency excited by cf velocity is more closed to the critical value of the mode transition therefore the mode transition phenomenon can occur with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient when the cf velocity is appropriate the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of flexible pipe is also investigated for low and high cross flow velocity namely u 0 3 m s and u 0 8 m s as shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the plotted contours from fig 10 illustrates the spatial time varying il fig 13a and d cf fig 13b and e and ax fig 13c and f steady state dynamic responses of displacements at a 0 001 and 0 11 inspecting the plots in fig 13 it is noted that the effect of the viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of flexible pipe is very little and the overall responses are governed by the standing wave the plotted contours from fig 14 also illustrate the spatial time varying il fig 14a d and g cf fig 14b e and h and ax fig 14c f and i steady state dynamic responses of displacements at a 0 001 0 03 and 0 11 however the overall displacement responses are simultaneously governed by the standing and travelling wave characteristics inspecting the plots in fig 14 it is noted that viscoelastic coefficient has a significant effect on the displacement responses of the pipe the results from fig 14 also illustrate that the cf response mode of the flexible pipe will change from mode 7 to mode 5 with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient this can be explained by the influence of the viscoelastic coefficient on the higher natural frequencies of the pipe it is also found that il and ax oscillation frequencies are nearly twice the cf oscillation frequencies as the riser undergoes higher vibration modes in il and ax directions due to greater vortex shedding frequencies in order to investigate the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on stresses the transverse bending and longitudinal stresses stresses can be evaluated by eqs 22 24 zanganeh and srinil 2016 the positive and negative sign represent compressive and bending stresses in cf and il directions respectively 22 σ u z t d 2 e u z t 23 σ v z t d 2 e v z t 24 σ z t e w 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the total il bending cf bending and longitudinal stresses responses in association with the displacements plots in figs 13 and 14 are illustrated in figs 15 and 16 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that the overall stress responses of the flexible pipe are governed by the standing wave characteristics in il and cf directions and stresses distribution in the longitudinal direction of riser is symmetrical inspecting the plots in fig 15 the space time regions of maximum stresses in the il and cf directions increase with the increase of a i e the stress distribution is more uniform when a is larger the results plotted in fig 16 show that the overall stress responses of the flexible pipe are dominated by the standing and travelling wave characteristics at the same time in il and cf directions and stresses distribution in the longitudinal direction of riser is symmetrical inspecting fig 16 it is noted that the il and cf response mode of the flexible pipe will all reduce with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient this can be explained by the influence of the viscoelastic coefficient on the higher natural frequencies of the pipe overall the magnitudes of cf and il bending stresses are within the same order and these highlight that il stress contributions cannot be neglected although il amplitudes are smaller than cf amplitudes it can be also concluded from figs 15 and 16 that all longitudinal stresses are much larger than il and cf bending stresses 4 4 motion trajectories and phase portrait analysis concerning the effect of the viscoelastic coefficient on the orbital motions of flexible pipe fig 17 plots orbital motions at different locations along riser span by characterizing il cf u v il ax u w and ax cf w v trajectories for two different specified viscoelasticity coefficients with constant u 0 3 m s seven points are chosen to show the orbital motions inspecting the plots in fig 17 it is noted that most of the il cf and ax cf trajectories show figure of eight shapes with variable phase difference and some modulations for different viscoelasticity coefficient however most of the il ax trajectories reveal crescent shapes with variable phase difference and some modulations it is also found that all trajectories are symmetrical about the ax direction and the maximum values of il cf and ax displacements will decrease with increasing viscoelastic coefficients it should be mentioned that the orbital motions of the pipe are very chaotic due to the large cross flow velocity therefore phase diagram at the center of riser span z 0 5l is chosen to characterize the dynamic responses of the pipe for different viscoelastic coefficients as shown in fig 18 inspecting the plotted curves from fig 18 it is noted that the dynamic responses are not periodic for il and cf responses when a is 0 001 and 0 03 as a is 0 11 the phase diagram of il and cf directions are multiline and closed single line for il and cf phase diagrams respectively the results indicate that the dynamic responses are aperiodic and periodic 5 conclusions this paper mainly established a three dimensional viv prediction model including structural geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities to depict the dynamic behavior of a flexible pipe which accounts for kelvin voigt viscoelastic model based on this model several analyses have been carried out using fem for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities some conclusions and suggestions are established 1 the frequency analyses demonstrated that the natural frequency of the studied riser decreases with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient and the natural frequency decreases rapidly with the increase of mode order 2 a nonlinear analysis was carried out by fem in order to study the impacts of the viscoelastic coefficient and cross flow velocity on the displacements the stresses the orbit motions and phase diagrams of the riser the results showed that when cross flow velocity is low the il cf and ax displacement and stress responses of the riser decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient therefore viscoelasticity can effectively suppress the responses of the flexible pipe as the cross flow velocity exceeded the critical value it was found that the impact of the viscoelastic efficient on the response of flexible pipe is more complex it can also suppress the responses of the riser by choosing an appropriate value for the viscoelastic coefficient 3 orbit motions and phase diagram of the il and cf directions for the riser show that the dynamic responses present periodic and aperiodic responses for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities overall the viscoelastic coefficient of the pipe has significant influences on nonlinear dynamic responses including frequencies displacements and stresses the model established in this paper provides an effective approach to analyze and predict the nonlinear viv dynamic responses of flexible viscoelastic pipe for different top pre tension and cross flow velocity moreover the relevant theories can guide the implementation of vibration control it is very useful to suppress the riser response by designing the appropriate viscoelastic coefficient for a marine riser in the future some works can focus on three dimensional viv dynamics of a flexible pipe conveying fluid which is single phase flow or gas liquid flow and pipe models

23654,the three dimensional nonlinear dynamic model of a long marine riser with kelvin voigt viscoelasticity properties under vortex induced vibration is proposed and investigated the objective is to find the appropriate viscoelastic coefficients to suppress the nonlinear dynamic response of a marine riser the pipe is placed in a uniform cross flow and geometric nonlinearities are considered two

to determine the impact of viscoelastic coefficients on the natural frequency for different damping values a nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out to determine the impacts of the viscoelastic coefficients on displacements stresses modal variation and phase portraits the results show that the viscoelastic coefficients have a significant effect on the natural frequency of the studied marine riser it is also demonstrated that appropriate viscoelastic coefficients are very important to effectively suppress the maximum displacements and stresses keywords marine riser 3 d response viscoelasticity vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of a long marine riser subjected to a steady uniform flow generates several intriguing fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena which are widely found in ocean engineering such as risers mooring cables and pipelines the vivs are the major reason of fatigue damage and reduction in structure lifetime the increase of operational lifetime of any structure is a constant occurrence for different engineering fields one of the ways to increase structures lifetime may reduce vibration amplitudes by optimizing based designs that account for viscoelastic materials some researchers start to pay attention to the experimental and mathematical model for viscoelastic pipes borges et al 2011 2014a pham et al 2016 over the past several decades models that predict the response of marine risers have received considerable attention the majority of research efforts related to the cylinder

brika and laneville 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009 srinil 2010 2011 wu et al 2012 for rigid cylinders facchinetti et al 2004 presented a refined wake oscillator however geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities properties are very important to the accuracy of response amplitudes srinil and zanganeh 2012 zanganeh and srinil 2014 for flexible long cylinders with initial straight configurations such as vertical top tensioned risers song et al 2011 a 3 d phenomenological model for the analysis and prediction of viv of long flexible pipe in uniform was presented by zanganeh and srinil 2016 by relying on the finite difference method fdm this model can accurately predict the nonlinear dynamic response of marine risers it should be noted that the effects of internal fluid are neglected in aforementioned models as for the viv dynamic responses of a flexible fluid conveying riser some researchers have dedicated to investigate the nonlinear dynamic responses in the last decades kaewunruen et al 2005 keber and wiercigroch 2008 paidoussis 1998 based on the principle of virtual work a model for analyzing the viv of extensible steel catenary risers transporting internal flows was established by meng and chen 2012 some excitations such as pulsating internal fluid and top end excitation have also been discussed for riser transporting internal fluid in detail dai et al 2014a 2014b he et al 2017 furthermore cross flow cf viv of a flexible fluid conveying pipe which internal velocities are from subcritical to supercritical have also been examined in recent years dai et al 2014b meng et al 2017 however a 3 d dynamic model is not mentioned and these models don t account for the viscoelastic effect of these structures consequently material viscoelasticity of marine risers

results illustrated that the model had a good agreement with experimental data borges et al 2011 2014b proposed and investigated a concept to suppress vibrations of steel catenary risers by using viscoelastic sandwich layers and a great increase of damping was observed considering kelvin voigt viscoelasticity of pipe material the cross flow direction dynamics of simply supported fluid conveying pipes with geometric imperfections were studied by wang et al 2012 but the effect of material viscoelasticity on the response of the riser is not discussed however insights into the fully

influenced by viscoelastic coefficient are investigated in detail for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities in section 4 the main findings of the present paper are drawn out in section 5 2 three dimensional viv mathematical model for marine viscoelastic risers in this paper the fully submerged pipe is assumed to perfectly straight at its vertical static equilibrium under the

projected three dimensional fluid forces can be expressed as follows 11 f x f l cos γ sin θ f d cos γ sin θ 12 f y f l cos γ cos θ f d cos γ sin θ 13 f z f l sin γ f d sin γ in which f d and f l are drag and lift forces respectively and can be depicted as 14 f d 1 2 ρ d u r e l 2 c d c d 15 f l 1 2 ρ d u r e l 2 c l where c d is the mean drag coefficient assumed as c d 1 2 c d and c l are time varying drag and lift coefficients respectively the total velocity relative to the pipe can be written as 16 u r e l u 1 u u v u 2 w u 2 by introducing wake variables p 2 c d c d 0 srinil 2011 and q 2 c l c l 0 facchinetti et al 2004 the variations of p and q can be described as 17 p 2 ε u ω f p 2 1 p 4 ω f 2 p λ u d u 18 q ε v ω f q 2 1 q ω f 2 q λ v d v herein ω f 2 π s t u d is the vortex

adopted equal as ε u 0 3 λ u λ v 12 based on srinil and zanganeh 2012 for rigid cylinders and ε v recent calibration in zanganeh and srinil 2016 then substituting eqs 14 16 and eqs 17 18 into eqs 11

cylinder assumed as c d 0 0 2 c l 0 0 3 4 numerical studies and discussions in this section a long flexible straight and slender riser model experimentally tested by song et al 2011 can be used for numerical simulations system parameters related to numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the highly nonlinear partial differential eqs 3 5 in conjunction with eqs 17 18 are solved by fem implemented in comsol multiphysics v5 2a software mehrzad tabatabaian 2016 initial conditions are specified at the static equilibrium for the riser u v w u v w 0 with p 2 p 0 and q 2 q 0 for wake variables the coupled partial differential equations are first reduced to second order partial differential coupled equations then the coupled equations are directly expressed in the general form pde interface of comsol the shape function type is lagrange and the order of finite element is quadratic the time step δ t 0 001 s and the element size δ z 0 1 m have been chosen through a series of convergence yielding stable simulations of all considered viscoelasticity coefficients and flow velocities in this study case validation tests of numerical simulations with the experimental model and finite difference approach of zanganeh and srinil 2016 have been performed the natural frequency and nonlinear dynamic responses influenced by viscoelastic coefficients are also investigated for different cross flow velocities 4 1 model validation with numerical and experimental comparisons model validations are first performed through comparisons with published experiment by song et al 2011 and numerical simulation results concluded by zanganeh and srinil 2016 which have highlighted the importance of considering the axial dynamic coupling the amplification of il mean displacements the geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities therefore numerical prediction results based on the fully nonlinear 3 d model are compared with experimental results of song et al 2011 and fdm results of zanganeh and srinil 2016 as shown in fig 2 inspecting the curves from fig 2a and c it is noted that numerical and experimental of obtained maximum il a u m a x d and cf a v m a x d amplitudes are compared with the increase of u and fig 2b and d depict the associated root mean square rms results a u r m s d a v r m s d with the increase of u r which is defined as u r u f 0 d with f 0 being the dominant oscillation frequency of riser inspecting the plots in fig 2a it is noted that the maximum cross flow displacement predicted by the numerical simulation results is slightly larger than the experimental value especially when the cross flow velocity is 0 3 m s the experimental results are located at the lowest amplitude the simulation results are in the maximum position on the contrary however a great difference occurs in the il response comparison with numerical results and experimental value fig 2c it is consistent with fig 2b and d for cf and il responses respectively in general the fem results are slightly larger than the experimental and fdm results this can be explained that a damping error between numerical and experimental model leads to the different results in addition the boundary conditions are also discrepant the top boundary condition in experiment is spring support whereas the top boundary condition in numerical simulation is simply support 4 2 natural frequency in order to determine the natural frequency of marine riser for different viscoelastic coefficients the hydrodynamic forces on the right side of eqs 3 5 are removed to analyze the natural frequency of marine risers the first nine frequencies of the marine riser are displayed in fig 3 with different viscoelastic coefficients when c 0 01 fig 3a and c 0 11 fig 3b respectively clearly it can be seen from fig 3 that the viscoelastic coefficient has little effect on the frequency if the natural mode is lower than mode 6 furthermore as the mode order of the riser is higher than mode 6 the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on the natural frequency decreases with the increase of mode order it follows from the plotted curves in fig 3 that the natural frequency of the riser decreases faster as the viscoelasticity coefficient increases for different damping values 4 3 three dimensional viv responses the impact of the viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of marine riser are investigated for different cf velocities of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s which are corresponding to the first mode third mode fifth mode and seventh mode of the cf responses of the riser respectively when the viscoelastic coefficient is not considered the plotted curves in fig 4 show the maximum il 4a cf 4b and ax 4c displacements of flexible riser for different values of cross flow velocity inspecting the plots in fig 4a and b it is noted that the maximum il cf and ax displacements decrease linearly with the increase of the viscoelasticity coefficient however it is observed from fig 4c and d that the maximum il cf and ax displacements increase firstly and then decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient in fig 4c whereas the maximum il cf and ax displacements first decrease when a is change from 0 to 0 01 then increase when a is change from 0 01 to 0 02 and decrease finally with increasing the viscoelastic coefficient in fig 4d this is due to the fact that the viscoelastic coefficients have a significant effect on the natural frequencies of higher order modes for flexible pipe for larger cross flow velocity the response mode order is higher the natural frequency will decrease resulting in the increase of maximum displacement whereas the viscoelastic coefficient will decrease the maximum displacement within the same mode order therefore the dynamic response amplitudes of the marine riser are determined by combination both viscoelastic coefficient and cf velocity which have an important effect on the higher natural frequency of the riser and the vortex shedding frequency respectively the variations of the maximum and minimum il bending cf bending and longitudinal stresses as functions of viscoelastic coefficient are plotted in figs 5 8 when the cross flow velocity is chosen to be 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s respectively clearly it can be seen from fig 5 that the maximum and minimum il cf and longitudinal stresses decrease linearly with the increase of viscoelasticity coefficient the results concluded from fig 6 show that the maximum and minimum il cf and longitudinal stresses decrease with the increase of viscoelasticity coefficient however the variations of the maximum and minimum il and longitudinal stresses in figs 7 8 are more complicated it is found that the maximum il and longitudinal stresses first increase and then decrease with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient in fig 7 whereas the maximum longitudinal stresses decrease firstly then increase and decrease finally in fig 8 inspecting the plotted curves in figs 5 8 it is noted that the maximum and minimum cf stresses decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient for different cross flow velocities therefore an appropriate viscoelastic coefficient should be chosen to suppress the three dimensional dynamic response of marine riser figs 9 12 presents the influences of viscoelastic coefficient on the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses of the riser when u 0 1 m s 0 3 m s 0 6 m s and 0 8 m s respectively inspecting fig 9 it is found that the il displacement responses are combination both modal 1 and modal 3 and the cf displacement responses are mode 1 it is also revealed that the viscoelastic coefficient has a little impact on the il and cf displacement amplitudes fig 10 portrays the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses for different viscoelastic coefficients when cf velocity are 0 3 m s it can be seen from fig 10 that the il displacement response show modal 5 and the cf displacement responses are mode 3 moreover the mode distribution of the il displacement responses is not regular as for u 0 6 m s fig 11 illustrates that the il with removed mean values and cf displacement responses for different viscoelastic coefficients inspecting fig 11 it is found that the il displacement response show modal 9 and the cf displacement responses are mode 5 it is also revealed that the mode distribution of the il displacement responses is not regular and the distribution characteristics are different with increasing the values of viscoelastic coefficient the il and cf displacement responses of the riser at a 0 001 fig 12a 0 03 fig 12b and 0 11 fig 12c are plotted in fig 12 with an equal time interval when u 0 8 m s the plotted curves in fig 12 show the mode associated with the cf displacement responses of marine riser will vary with viscoelastic coefficient in fig 12a the result demonstrates that mode 11 dominates the il displacement responses and the cf displacement responses of riser are mode 7 as can be seen from fig 12b and c it can be concluded that mode 9 plays an important role in the il displacement responses and the cf displacement responses of the riser shows mode 5 it is also revealed that the mode transition phenomenon of the il displacement keep pace with those of cf as for the il displacement response it is found that the displacement amplitudes are larger when the viscoelastic coefficient is larger furthermore the results from fig 12 evidence that an increase in the viscoelastic coefficient results in the decrease of the cf mode order of the riser for constant u this is because the effect of viscoelastic coefficient on ax displacements and longitudinal stresses is firstly decreased due to the fact that an increase in the viscoelastic coefficient leads to the decrease of natural frequency for higher cf velocity and viscoelastic coefficient owns damping effect it is revealed that the damping effect has a significant effect on the responses of the riser for larger viscoelastic coefficient and higher cf velocity it is also found that if the mode order jumping decreases the displacement will increase to dominate the variation of riser response within small range this can explain the dynamic response complexity of mariner riser with the change of viscoelastic coefficient under larger cf velocity in general the response modes of the riser are decided by combination of the vortex shedding frequency related to the cf velocity and natural frequency influenced by the viscoelastic coefficient the frequency analyses reveal that the natural frequency is decreased with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient and the decreased amplitude of natural frequency is increased with the increase of mode order however the order of response mode is decreased with the increase of viscoelastic efficient due to the fact that the damping effect of viscoelastic efficient dominates the responses of the riser moreover we can predict that the mode transition phenomenon is easier happened when the vortex shedding frequency excited by cf velocity is more closed to the critical value of the mode transition therefore the mode transition phenomenon can occur with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient when the cf velocity is appropriate the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of flexible pipe is also investigated for low and high cross flow velocity namely u 0 3 m s and u 0 8 m s as shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the plotted contours from fig 10 illustrates the spatial time varying il fig 13a and d cf fig 13b and e and ax fig 13c and f steady state dynamic responses of displacements at a 0 001 and 0 11 inspecting the plots in fig 13 it is noted that the effect of the viscoelastic coefficient on the displacements of flexible pipe is very little and the overall responses are governed by the standing wave the plotted contours from fig 14 also illustrate the spatial time varying il fig 14a d and g cf fig 14b e and h and ax fig 14c f and i steady state dynamic responses of displacements at a 0 001 0 03 and 0 11 however the overall displacement responses are simultaneously governed by the standing and travelling wave characteristics inspecting the plots in fig 14 it is noted that viscoelastic coefficient has a significant effect on the displacement responses of the pipe the results from fig 14 also illustrate that the cf response mode of the flexible pipe will change from mode 7 to mode 5 with the increase of viscoelastic coefficient this can be explained by the influence of the viscoelastic coefficient on the higher natural frequencies of the pipe it is also found that il and ax oscillation frequencies are nearly twice the cf oscillation frequencies as the riser undergoes higher vibration modes in il and ax directions due to greater vortex shedding frequencies in order to investigate the impact of viscoelastic coefficient on stresses the transverse bending and longitudinal stresses stresses can be evaluated by eqs 22 24 zanganeh and srinil 2016 the positive and negative sign represent compressive and bending stresses in cf and il directions respectively 22 σ u z t d 2 e u z t 23 σ v z t d 2 e v z t 24 σ z t e w 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the total il bending cf bending and longitudinal stresses responses in association with the displacements plots in figs 13 and 14 are illustrated in figs 15 and 16 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that the overall stress responses of the flexible pipe are governed by the standing wave characteristics in il and cf directions and stresses distribution in the longitudinal direction of riser is symmetrical inspecting the plots in fig 15 the space time regions of maximum stresses in the il and cf directions increase with the increase of a i e the stress distribution is more uniform when a is larger the results plotted in fig 16 show that the overall stress responses of the flexible pipe are dominated by the standing and travelling wave characteristics at the same time in il and cf directions and stresses distribution in the longitudinal direction of riser is symmetrical inspecting fig 16 it is noted that the il and cf response mode of the flexible pipe will all reduce with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient this can be explained by the influence of the viscoelastic coefficient on the higher natural frequencies of the pipe overall the magnitudes of cf and il bending stresses are within the same order and these highlight that il stress contributions cannot be neglected although il amplitudes are smaller than cf amplitudes it can be also concluded from figs 15 and 16 that all longitudinal stresses are much larger than il and cf bending stresses 4 4 motion trajectories and phase portrait analysis concerning the effect of the viscoelastic coefficient on the orbital motions of flexible pipe fig 17 plots orbital motions at different locations along riser span by characterizing il cf u v il ax u w and ax cf w v trajectories for two different specified viscoelasticity coefficients with constant u 0 3 m s seven points are chosen to show the orbital motions inspecting the plots in fig 17 it is noted that most of the il cf and ax cf trajectories show figure of eight shapes with variable phase difference and some modulations for different viscoelasticity coefficient however most of the il ax trajectories reveal crescent shapes with variable phase difference and some modulations it is also found that all trajectories are symmetrical about the ax direction and the maximum values of il cf and ax displacements will decrease with increasing viscoelastic coefficients it should be mentioned that the orbital motions of the pipe are very chaotic due to the large cross flow velocity therefore phase diagram at the center of riser span z 0 5l is chosen to characterize the dynamic responses of the pipe for different viscoelastic coefficients as shown in fig 18 inspecting the plotted curves from fig 18 it is noted that the dynamic responses are not periodic for il and cf responses when a is 0 001 and 0 03 as a is 0 11 the phase diagram of il and cf directions are multiline and closed single line for il and cf phase diagrams respectively the results indicate that the dynamic responses are aperiodic and periodic 5 conclusions this paper mainly established a three dimensional viv prediction model including structural geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities to depict the dynamic behavior of a flexible pipe which accounts for kelvin voigt viscoelastic model based on this model several analyses have been carried out using fem for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities some conclusions and suggestions are established 1 the frequency analyses demonstrated that the natural frequency of the studied riser decreases with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient and the natural frequency decreases rapidly with the increase of mode order 2 a nonlinear analysis was carried out by fem in order to study the impacts of the viscoelastic coefficient and cross flow velocity on the displacements the stresses the orbit motions and phase diagrams of the riser the results showed that when cross flow velocity is low the il cf and ax displacement and stress responses of the riser decrease with the increase of the viscoelastic coefficient therefore viscoelasticity can effectively suppress the responses of the flexible pipe as the cross flow velocity exceeded the critical value it was found that the impact of the viscoelastic efficient on the response of flexible pipe is more complex it can also suppress the responses of the riser by choosing an appropriate value for the viscoelastic coefficient 3 orbit motions and phase diagram of the il and cf directions for the riser show that the dynamic responses present periodic and aperiodic responses for different viscoelastic coefficients and cross flow velocities overall the viscoelastic coefficient of the pipe has significant influences on nonlinear dynamic responses including frequencies displacements and stresses the model established in this paper provides an effective approach to analyze and predict the nonlinear viv dynamic responses of flexible viscoelastic pipe for different top pre tension and cross flow velocity moreover the relevant theories can guide the implementation of vibration control it is very useful to suppress the riser response by designing the appropriate viscoelastic coefficient for a marine riser in the future some works can focus on three dimensional viv dynamics of a flexible pipe conveying fluid which is single phase flow or gas liquid flow and pipe models
