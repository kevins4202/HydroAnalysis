observer adaptive sliding mode control unmeasured state 1 introduction with the increasing reliance on oceans exploitation in a spectrum of human activities the research for advance marine mechatronic systems is attracting more and more attention dynamic positioning dp system is a sort of typical marine mechatronic system from a control perspective for surface vessels and is essential for many marine applications such as drilling pipe laying and diving support shi et al 2017 with the advances of the nonlinear control the dp nonlinear control has gradually gained much attention and various approaches have been used for dp systems to achieve better performance such as robust control wang et al 2018 hybrid control nguyen et al 2007 fault tolerant control chen m et al 2016 etc hu et al 2015 hu and du 2018 do 2011 veksler et al 2016 værnø et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b however highly coupled control channels unknown time varying disturbances and strong nonlinearity increase the design difficulty of the robust control for dp systems which makes it still an open topic sørensen 2011 input saturation giving rise to degraded performance and even instability of the dp control system is a potential problem for the dp system due to the fact that the commanded control inputs calculated by the dp controller are possibly constrained by the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can produce in du et al 2016 du jialu et al proposed a robust dynamic surface control strategy where an auxiliary dynamic system to handle input saturation perez and donaire proposed dp proportional integral control where disturbances and input saturation were handled by the integral action with anti windup scheme perez and donaire 2009 considering the constraint of sensors in accuracy and cost only the positions of ships can be measured in practice while the positions and velocities of ships are necessary in the control design for dynamic positioning ship fossen and strand 1999 considering the dynamic positioning in the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the ship unmeasured velocities and unknown time varying disturbances an adaptive robust output feedback controller du et al 2015 was developed for the dp system by merging adaptive rbf neural networks and high gain observer into the vectorial backstepping method but high gain observer can only guarantee the boundedness of estimation error and can t be analyzed in the frame of lyapunov theory which is not good to analysis the stability of closed loop systems in addition if the coriolis matrix and the nonlinear damping term are considered the error system of observer will contain the nonlinear term related to the estimated state which makes the proof of the convergence of the estimated error system very complicated in wondergem et al 2011 a state observer is proposed to estimate the velocities for ship with highly nonlinearity and semi globally uniformly stable is guaranteed for closed loop system based on the above discussions it should be pointed out that all the aforementioned formation controllers can only obtain asymptotic convergence at best which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time by virtue of adding a power integrator wang et al 2016a b an adaptive robust finite time tracking control scheme for trajectory tracking of a fully actuated marine surface vehicle with unknown disturbances is proposed whereas the unmeasured state and input saturation are ignored in zhang et al 2018a a finite time controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship with input constrained but it s still based on the assumption that all states are available it should be pointed out that almost all the research even up to now deals with dynamic positioning control design either in the presence of unknown time varying disturbance or without angular velocity measurements or with actuator saturation only the integrated design to deal with those issues all together still needs further research inspired by the aforementioned discussion a continuous finite time observer based constrained adaptive sliding output feedback controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship while the coriolis matrix hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix input saturation unmeasured states unknown time varying environment disturbances and transient performance are considered simultaneously a continue finite time state observer is proposed to estimate the unmeasured states of dynamic positioning ship in finite time an auxiliary system is constructed to handle with the control saturation and the signal generated by the auxiliary system is introduced to design a terminal sliding mode surface while the fast convergence is achieved under multiple constraints in addition an adaptive update law is introduced and the prior knowledge of disturbance is no need the finite time convergence of loop system is proved strictly finally simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme the main contributions lie in the following three aspects 1 a finite time state observer based adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship with the coriolis matrix and hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix while the problems of input saturation unmeasured states and unknown time varying environment disturbances are solved simultaneously when the finite time convergence is achieved 2 a continues finite time state observer is proposed for dynamic positioning ship considering the coriolis matrix and hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix which is seldom to be studied without requirement for prior knowledge of disturbance the rate of convergence is improved and chattering is avoided 3 the chatter free nominal output controller is proposed while the steady performance is guaranteed since the input saturation lasts short time the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem formulation of control is detailed for vessels and several preliminaries are given following in section 3 the control strategy is proposed the vessel dynamics and the proposed control schemes are simulated in section 4 and concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 problem formulation the nonlinear motion mathematical model of a dynamic positioning ship with coriolis matrix and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping matrix fossen 2012 can be expressed as 1 η j ψ υ 2 υ m 1 c υ υ m 1 d υ υ m 1 s a t τ m 1 τ d where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame consisting of the surge position x the sway position y and the yaw angle ψ 0 2 π of the ship υ u v r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity v the yaw rate r of the ship j ψ is the rotation matrix given by 3 j ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 here m denotes inertia matrix and is positive defining c υ denotes coriolis matrix and d υ is hydrodynamic damping matrix including linear terms and nonlinear terms τ d represents the lumped disturbance s a t τ s a t τ 1 s a t τ 2 s a t τ 3 t represents the constrained control input vector produced by propeller and thruster system consisting of force τ 1 in surge force τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw in particular the constrained input can be described as follows 4 s a t τ i τ i max i f τ i τ i max τ i i f τ i min τ i τ i max τ i min i f i f τ i τ i min where τ max i denotes the maximum control forces or moments that the ship s propulsion system can produce respectively let defining x 1 η x 2 j υ j j ψ and the equations 1 and 2 can be rewritten as 5 x 1 x 2 6 x 2 f x 1 x 2 j m 1 s a t τ d t where f x 1 x 2 s r j m 1 c j t x 2 d j t x 2 j t x 2 d t j m 1 τ d let us define as follows 7 f c x 1 x 2 s r j m 1 c j t x 2 j t 8 f d x 1 x 2 j m 1 d j t x 2 j t x 2 9 f x 1 x 2 f c x 1 x 2 x 2 f d x 1 x 2 without loss of generality some assumptions are introduced first assumption 1 wondergem et al 2011 considering the nonlinear functions 7 and 8 the following inequalities are achieved f d x 1 x 2 f d x 1 y d m 1 d m 2 x 2 y x 2 y f c x 1 x 2 y f c x 1 y x 2 and f c x 1 x 2 f c m x 2 here stands for the determinant of a matrix d m 1 d m 2 and f c m are unknown constants assumption 2 defining d t j m 1 τ d and it s unknown time varying yet bounded that is there exists unknown positive constants d j such that d t d m where d m is unknown constant assumption 3 for the δ τ it is assumed to satisfy the following condition δ τ τ s a t τ σ where σ is known constant remark 1 from the view of a practical control system the difference δ τ between the desired control input τ and the actual control input s a t τ cannot be large the reason is that the system controllability should be satisfied when control input saturation occurs due to the disturbance and system states are bounded the control input needed is bounded thus the assumption is bounded is reasonable to satisfy this assumption the parameter σ can be large the following lemmas and definition are given here to express the approaches to design finite time controller and observer for dynamic positioning ship definition 1 hong et al 2002 consider the following system 10 x t f x t where f d ℜ n is non lipschitz continuous on a neighborhood d of the origin x 0 in ℜ n the equilibrium x 0 of 10 is finite time convergent if there are an open neighborhood u of the origin and a function t x u 0 0 such that every solution trajectory x t x 0 of 10 starting from the initial point x 0 u 0 is well defined and unique in forward time for t 0 t x x 0 and lim t t x x 0 x t x 0 0 here t x x 0 is called the convergence time of the initial state x 0 the equilibrium of 10 is finite time stable if it is lyapunov stable and finite time convergent if u d ℜ n the origin is a globally finite time stable equilibrium lemma 1 bhat and bernstein 2000 considering system 10 suppose there exists a continuous function v x such that the following conditions hold i is positive definite ii there exist real numbers c α 0 1 and an open neighborhood d 0 d of the origin such that then the origin is a finite time stable equilibrium of system 10 if u u 0 ℜ n the origin is a globally finite time stable equilibrium of system 10 in addition the finite convergence time t v x 0 1 α c 1 α lemma 2 shen and xia 2008 suppose there is a lyapunov function v x defined on a neighborhood of the origin d ℜ n such that the following conditions hold i is positive definite ii there exist real numbers b c α 0 1 and an open neighborhood d 0 d of the origin such that v x b v x c v x α 0 then the origin of 10 is locally finite time stable in addition the finite convergence time t 1 b 1 α ln v x 0 1 α c c lemma 3 zhu et al 2010 consider system 10 and suppose that there exist continuous function v x scalars c α 0 1 and 0 η such that v x c v x α η then the trajectory of system 10 is practical finite time stable in addition the time needed to reach such a neighborhood is bounded as where v x 0 is the initial value of v x remark 2 it is clear from lemma 3 that any asymptotically stable system is practically finite time stable however for some systems with absolutely unknown disturbance such as system 1 2 in the presence of unknown external disturbance the asymptotical stability cannot be obtained easily since the sysytem states can be only forced to converge into a neighborhood of the sliding surface in finite time so the finite time convergeness is called practical finite time stablity lemma 4 hu and jiang 2018 consider the system 10 suppose there is a lyapunov function v x positive constants p 1 0 1 p 2 p 1 α 0 β 0 and γ 0 let v 0 be the initial value of v x then the following statements hold v x α v x p 1 β v x p 2 then the trajectory of the system 10 is finite time uniformly ultimately bounded the settling time is bounded as follows t v 0 1 p 1 α θ 1 p 1 where θ 0 α is arbitrary positive constant the control objective in our context is to design a finite time control law τ c for dynamic positioning vehicle in the absence of velocity measurements and subject to input saturation and disturbances to track exactly the desired trajectory x d y d ψ d t 3 main results in this subsection a finite time observer based adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is designed to achieve the control object aforementioned in particular the controller designed here can be divided into four parts an auxiliary is introduced to handle with input saturation an adaptive state feedback controller is designed assuming all the states are known a continuous finite time state observer is constructed to estimate the state in finite time and an adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is integrated based the previous steps 3 1 auxiliary system design firstly an auxiliary system is designed to deal with the influence of input saturation under assumption 3 and the lemma 5 is provided here lemma 5 chen et al 2015 an auxiliary system is constructed as following 11 ξ a ξ b ξ r 0 σ g sgn ξ j m 1 δ τ where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t is the state of the auxiliary system a d i a g a i 3 3 and b d i a g b i 3 3 are design matrix while a i 0 and b i 0 i 1 2 3 in addition sgn ξ sgn ξ 1 sgn ξ 2 sgn ξ 3 t g d i a g g i 3 3 where g i is the i t h row of the control gain matrix j m 1 and r 0 0 1 the auxiliary state converges to zero in finite time proof the proof of lemma 5 is shown in the appendix 3 2 adaptive sliding mode state feedback controller design considering the signal generated by auxiliary system provided in lemma 5 and a state feedback controller is constructed in forms of three theorems firstly defining the error surface vectors 12 z 1 x 1 x 1 d 13 z 2 x 2 x 2 d ξ where x 1 d and x 2 d are desired trajectory and velcoties in this paper the sliding mode surface shao et al 2017 is designed as following 14 s z 2 k β z 1 where z 1 z 11 z 12 z 13 t z 2 z 21 z 22 z 23 t s s 1 s 2 s 3 t β z 1 β z 11 β z 12 β z 13 t β z 1 i s i g r 1 z 1 i i f s i 0 o r s i 0 z 1 i θ l 11 z 1 i l 12 s i g 2 z 1 i i f s i 0 z 1 i θ k is a design matrix s i z 2 i k s i g r 1 z 1 i s i g r 1 z 1 i z 1 i r 1 s i g n z 1 i 0 r 1 1 l 11 2 r θ r 1 1 l 12 r 1 θ r 1 2 therefore the differential of β z 1 is 15 β z 1 i r 1 z 1 i r 1 1 z 1 i i f s i 0 o r s i 0 z 1 i θ l 11 z 1 i 2 l 12 z 1 i z 1 i i f s i 0 z 1 i θ based on the sliding mode surface 14 auxiliary system 11 and assumption 2 an adaptive sliding mode controller is designed as 16 τ m j t τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 17 τ 1 f x 1 x 2 k β z 1 k 1 s k 2 s i g r 1 s x 2 d 18 τ 2 a ξ b ξ r 0 σ g sgn ξ 19 τ 3 s s d ˆ m 20 d ˆ m k d ε d d ˆ m t s where τ 1 is a feedback term τ 2 is a compensated term for saturation and τ 3 is an robust adaptive compensated term k 1 k 2 are design matrix and k d ε d are design parameters τ 3 can compensate the unknown time varying external disturbance and the upper bound information of disturbance is not required which not only reduces the conservative problem caused by designing too high upper bound but also can effectively weaken the chattering in order to prove the finite time convergence of controller we designed three steps are provided here in theorem 1 firstly the uniformly ultimate bounded of closed loop system is proved so that the boundedness of adaptive estimated error is garanteed the finite time convergence of sliding mode surface is achieved finally we will prove that the position of dynamic positioning ship can be converged into the small region around the desired trajectory theorem 1 considering the dynamic positioning ship model 5 and 6 the proposed controller 16 19 and adaptive law 20 guarantees that x 1 and x 2 converge to small regions around the equilibrium points in finite time proof the proof of theorem 1 is shown in the appendix 3 3 continuous finite time state observer design in most cases measurements of the ship s velocities are not available therefore estimations of the velocities must be computed from noisy position and heading measurements through a state observer hu et al 2018 hu and niu 2017 liu et al 2016 in the sequel a continuous finite time observer is designed for dynamic positioning ship to eatimate the velocities based on the position in finite time and the following conclusion can be given theorem 2 considering the dynamic positioning ship 5 and 6 the finite time observer is proposed 21 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 l 1 s i g x ˆ 1 x 1 r 2 1 2 22 x ˆ 2 f x 1 x ˆ 2 j ψ m 1 τ l 2 s i g x ˆ 1 x 1 r 2 where 0 r 2 1 is a design parameter l 1 d i a g l i and l 2 d i a g l i i 1 2 3 are the design observer matrix based on the dynamic positioning ship the error dynamic system of observer we designed can be expressed as 23 x 1 x 2 l 1 s i g x 1 r 2 1 2 24 x 2 f x 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 f x 1 x 2 x 2 d t l 2 s i g x 1 r 2 where estimation errors are defined as x 1 x ˆ 1 x 1 and x 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 then the origin of the observation errors dynamic system 23 and 24 is locally fast finite time uniformly ultimately bounded proof the proof of theorem 2 is shown in the appendix remark 3 corsidering the relationship of x 1 η and x 2 j ψ υ when the estimation state x ˆ 2 is achieved the estimation velocities can be obtained based on υ ˆ j 1 ψ x ˆ 2 since the ψ is known remark 4 according theorem 2 the finite time convergent observer we designed is continuous and does not create the chattering phenomenon hu et al 2018 wang et al 2016a b which improve the performance comparing with the existing resluts in addition the disturbance information is not required fu and yu 2018 which means our approach is more robust and the properties of the multiple input multiple output nonlinear system have been considered liu et al 2016 which means the process of proof is more rigorous 3 4 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller design in this section combing with the auxiliary system 11 adaptive sliding mode state feedback controller 16 20 continuous finite time observer 21 and 22 an adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed here firstly the modified sliding mode surface can be construted as 25 s ˆ z ˆ 2 k ˆ β z ˆ 1 where the state x 1 x 2 in sliding mode surface 14 are replaced by estimation x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 in 21 and 22 at this point the adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller and adaptive law are designed as 26 τ ˆ m j t τ ˆ 1 τ ˆ 2 τ ˆ 3 27 τ ˆ 1 f x 1 x ˆ 2 k β z ˆ 1 k 1 s ˆ k 2 s i g r 1 s ˆ x 2 d 28 τ ˆ 2 a ξ b ξ r 0 σ g sgn ξ 29 τ ˆ 3 s ˆ s ˆ d ˆ m 30 d ˆ m k d ε d d ˆ m t s ˆ in order to prove the finite time ability theorem 3 is provided here theorem 3 under assumption 1 assumption 3 considering the dynamic positioning ship 5 and 6 with unmeasured state input saturation and unknown time varying external disturbance the proposed adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller 26 29 finite time observer 21 22 auxiliary system 11 and adaptive law 30 can guarantee that x 1 and x 2 converge to small regions around the equilibrium points in finite time proof the proof of theorem 3 is shown in the appendix remark 5 when auxiliary systems or anti windup control is introduced to handle with the input saturation a nominal controller is constructed without considering the input constraint since the time of saturation is short it s important to establish a nominal control approach such that good steady performance can be achieved in this paper a nominal adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is designed as 31 τ ˆ m j t τ ˆ 1 τ ˆ 3 32 τ ˆ 1 f x 1 x ˆ 2 k β z ˆ 1 k 1 s ˆ k 2 s i g r 1 s ˆ x 2 d 33 τ ˆ 3 s ˆ s ˆ d ˆ m 34 d ˆ m k d ε d d ˆ m t s ˆ where the input saturation is not occurred and the ξ 0 which means the error vector is z 2 x 2 x 2 d the other parameters are just as what they are defined in 26 30 in addition the estimation states are measured by finite time observer design in theorem 2 remark 6 it should point out that the nominal adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller consisting the controller 31 34 and the observer 21 22 is inherently continuous which means that it s chatter free the sign function is replaced by continuous function s i g and the adaptive update law is introduced to estimate the upper bound of lumped disturbance which means the chattering caused by the discontinuous function and the unknown disturbance is effectively reduced remark 7 in this paper the finite time output feedback controller is designed for dynamic positioning with input constraint and unknown disturbance for further work it will be interesting to consider the finite time control with dynamic uncertainties and state constraint maryam 2018 he et al 2017 2019 xiao and yin 2016 li et al 2019 4 simulations in order to present the proposed control strategy in the previous section work effectively numerical simulations tested on a supply vessel called cybership ⅱ skjetne et al 2005 which is a 1 70 scale replica of a supply ship whose main parameters is shown in table 1 are performed and the results are shown in this section the actuator input limitation is set as τ i max 50 the unknown external disturbances yu et al 2018 τ d with significantly large magnitude and high frequency which can be roughly considered as complex environment including ocean winds waves and currents are governed by τ d 2 cos 0 5 t cos t 0 3 cos 0 5

simulation contain three parts the simulation for nominal controller the simulation for controller considering the input saturation and the contrasting case which shows the superiority of our scheme comparing with the existing results scenario 1 nominal controller in remark 5 based on the controller proposed in remark 5 and the parameters can be chosen as l 1 d i a g 10 20 20 l 2 d i a g 150 50 100 r 2 0 6 r 1 0 7 θ 0 2 k d i a g 1 5 0 8 0 8 k 1 d i a g 8 9 2 k 2 d i a g 7 7 2 scenario 2 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller in theorem 3 choosing the parameters for controller developed in theorem 3 as following l 1 d i a g 10 20 20 l 2 d i a g 150 50 100 r 2 0 6 r 1 0 7 r 0 0 6 θ 0 5 k d i a g 30 30 30 k 1 d i a g 8 9 2 k 2 d i a g 7 7 2 a d i a g 5 3 5 b d i a g 2 2 5 scenario 3 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller in theorem 3 with worse ocean environment to prove the capability of anti disturbance the disturbance is enhanced as large as 10 times without regulating the parameters of controller and observer in scenario 2 that is to say the disturbance can be designed as τ d 10 τ d scenario 4 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller based on a traditional observer in wondergem et al 2011 to illustrate the superiority of our approach a controller based on a conventional observer proposed in wondergem et al 2011 is provided due to the input constraint and the rate of convergence aren t considered in wondergem et al 2011 the controller is based on the theorem 3 while the observer is established as in wondergem et al 2011 and the observer can be designed as 35 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 l 1 x ˆ 1 x 1 36 x ˆ 2 f x 1 x ˆ 2 j ψ m 1 τ l 2 x ˆ 1 x 1 the parameters of controller and observer are chosen as l 1 d i a g 1 5 1 5 1 5 l 2 d i a g 200 200 200 r 1 0 7 θ 0 5 k d i a g 30 30 30 k 1 d i a g 8 9 2 k 2 d i a g 7 7 2 a d i a g 5 3 5 b d i a g 2 2 5 scenario 5 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller in theorem 3 and scenario 4 with model uncertainties to prove the robust of the controller we designed the disturbance of model uncertainties fu et al 2018 is introduced without adjusting the parameters of controller and observer in scenario 2 and scenario 4 where the lumped disturbance can be design as τ d 2 cos 0 5 t cos t 0 3 cos 0 5 t sin 0 5 t 3 0 01 sin 0 1 t 0 6 sin 1 1 t cos 0 3 t ν 3 0 6 u 0 1 sin t 10 u r u 0 1 sin t 4 u r 10 v 2 0 1 sin t figs 1 6 show the performance of nominal controller in scenario 1 for dynamic positioning ship without input saturation the actual trajectory and desired trajectory are showed in fig 1 during the initial stage the nominal adaptive sliding mode controller we designed can ensure that the dynamic positioning ship track to the desired trajectory quickly with small overshoot which means that good transient performance is achieved in addition the tracking error in other stages can be guaranteed even if the gradient of desired trajectory changes significantly the track errors of trajectory and velocities are showed in figs 2 and 3 respectively it can be found that the trajectory error of the dynamic positioning ship can be maintained within 5 10 3 m while the heading angle can track the desired value quickly and the error can converge into 0 02 r a d without any chattering phenomenon the velocities errors can be maintained smoothly within 0 02 m s 0 01 m s and 0 02 r a d s respectively fig 4 shows the control input without constraint figs 5 and 6 show the observer error of finite time observer we proposed it shows that the observer errors fall into zero approximately in a short time period it can also be observed that x 1 converge to the acceptable accuracy of 1 10 4 m r a d within 1 s while the estimation error in velocities can be maintained within 5 10 3 m s 5 10 3 m s and 8 10 3 r a d s respectively in addition no knowledge of external disturbance is required while only the boundedness is requested to be guaranteed for the observer we designed from figs 7 12 the performance of nominal controller in scenario 2 for dynamic positioning ship in the present of input saturation are showed the actual trajectories under controller in theorem 3 are shown in fig 7 from which we can see that the proposed controller can achieve fast transient response and high steady state accuracy despite the presence of external disturbances and input saturation and lack of velocity measurements in particular fig 8 shows the track errors in surge sway and yaw direction respectively where the steady performance can be seen figs 9 and 10 show the input signal with constraint and signal generated by auxiliary system due to the fact that the disturbance is non zero whereas the control input is zero at the initial moment the saturation is activated and the auxiliary system handle with the effect caused by input saturation timely when control input τ i 50 n n m the nominal controller proposed in remark 5 which guarantees the good performance can be achieved figs 11 and 12 show the observer error considering the input constraint from which we can find that it doesn t affect the estimation of observer and the observer still maintains accurate estimation performance while the estimation error converge into 2 10 3 m s 1 10 3 m s and 1 10 2 r a d s respectively from fig 13 anti disturbance performance of controller we designed is showed compared with the scenario 2 the disturbance in this simulation is enhanced as larger as 10 times than that in scenario 2 while the parameters of controller and observer are not changed as shown in fig 13 since the initial disturbance is very large while the control input is constrained so that the overshoot is more obvious than fig 7 then the auxiliary system is activated and the controller we designed can make the ship following the desired trajectory within short time it s illustrated that the controller provided in theorem 3 can withstand worse environment while the parameters adjusting aren t required from figs 14 17 a comparison simulation is provided to better show the convergence speed and robustness of the proposed controller and observer comparing with the existing works in wondergem et al 2011 it can be found in fig 14 that the actual trajectory in scenario 4 has a significant oscilation in the initial stage and the convergence time is longer than the resluts in scenario 2 which is more obvious in fig 15 in the case that the controllers are the same and the steady performance are similar the transient porformance is based on the observer from fig 16 and fig 17 we can find that a better trasient proformance is achieved by the observer we designed in which the overshoot is less and the converbence time is shorter summarizing all the cases considered the fast convergence rate of the proposed controller and observer have been verified from fig 18 and fig 19 a comparison with model uncertanties while the parameters aren t adjusted between controller in scenario 2 and controller based on traditional observer in scenario 4 is showed it can be found from fig 18 that the actual trajectory based on traditional observer has a significant oscilation in the initial stage while the trajectory based on the theorem 3 is more smooth it s obvious that the controller and observer we designed have better robustness against to uncertainties in addition the estimation errors comparsion between two observers with uncertainties is provided from fig 19 we can find that the observer we designed can estimate the accurate state within shorter time more smoothly in this thesis the controller and observer we desinged have good robustness in conclusion when the input saturation isn t activated the nominal adaptive sliding mode controller we designed can ensure the good control performance of the dynamic positioning ship when the control input of the dynamic positioning ship exceeds the input constraint the designed auxiliary system can quickly compensate for the control performance degradation caused by the saturation constraint even in the worese environment the ship can maintain good steady performance and parameters adujsting is not required at the same time compared with the conventional state observer the control method designed in this paper has a better trasient performance in addition the controller and observer provded in theorem 3 have robust against the uncertainty while there is no need to change the parameters 5 conclusion in this paper an adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is investigated for dynamic positioning ship considering the coriolis matrix hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix input saturation unmeasured states unknown time varying environment disturbances and transient performance simultaneously a continue finite time state observer is proposed to estimate the unmeasured states of dynamic positioning ship in finite time and an auxiliary system is constructed to handle with the control saturation a terminal sliding mode surface consisting the signal generated by the auxiliary system is designed while the fast convergence is achieved under multiple constraints in addition an adaptive update law is introduced that the prior knowledge of disturbance is no need fast convergence rate of the closed loop system is ensured by analyzing system stability in light of finite time control theory numerical simulation results and comparison have shown the advantages and improvements of the proposed control scheme further work includes low computational complexity algorithm to adjust parameters and finite time control design for the dynamic positioning with state constraints and dynamic uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement kun liang conceptualization

strictly finally simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control scheme keywords dynamic positioning system input saturation continuous finite time observer adaptive sliding mode control unmeasured state 1 introduction with the increasing reliance on oceans exploitation in a spectrum of human activities the research for advance marine mechatronic systems is attracting more and more attention dynamic positioning dp system is a sort of typical marine mechatronic system from a control perspective for surface vessels and is essential for many marine applications such as drilling pipe laying and diving support shi et al 2017 with the advances of the nonlinear control the dp nonlinear control has gradually gained much attention and various approaches have been used for dp systems to achieve better performance such as robust control wang et al 2018 hybrid control nguyen et al 2007 fault tolerant control chen m et al 2016 etc hu et al 2015 hu and du 2018 do 2011 veksler et al 2016 værnø et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b however highly coupled control channels unknown time varying disturbances and strong nonlinearity increase the design difficulty of the robust control for dp systems which makes it still an open topic sørensen 2011 input saturation giving rise to degraded performance and even instability of the dp control system is a potential problem for the dp system due to the fact that the commanded control inputs calculated by the dp controller are possibly constrained by the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can produce in du et al 2016 du jialu et al proposed a robust dynamic surface control strategy where an auxiliary dynamic system to handle input saturation perez and donaire proposed dp proportional integral control where disturbances and input saturation were handled by the integral action with anti windup scheme perez and donaire 2009 considering the constraint of sensors in accuracy and cost only the positions of ships can be measured in practice while the positions and velocities of ships are necessary in the control design for dynamic positioning ship fossen and strand 1999 considering the dynamic positioning in the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the ship unmeasured velocities and unknown time varying disturbances an adaptive robust output feedback controller du et al 2015 was developed for the dp system by merging adaptive rbf neural networks and high gain observer into the vectorial backstepping method but high gain observer can only guarantee the boundedness of estimation error and can t be analyzed in the frame of lyapunov theory which is not good to analysis the stability of closed loop systems in addition if the coriolis matrix and the nonlinear damping term are considered the error system of observer will contain the nonlinear term related to the estimated state which makes the proof of the convergence of the estimated error system very complicated in wondergem et al 2011 a state observer is proposed to estimate the velocities for ship with highly nonlinearity and semi globally uniformly stable is guaranteed for closed loop system based on the above discussions it should be pointed out that all the aforementioned formation controllers can only obtain asymptotic convergence at best which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time by virtue of adding a power integrator wang et al 2016a b an adaptive robust finite time tracking control scheme for trajectory tracking of a fully actuated marine surface vehicle with unknown disturbances is proposed whereas the unmeasured state and input saturation are ignored in zhang et al 2018a a finite time controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship with input constrained but it s still based on the assumption that all states are available it should be pointed out that almost all the research even up to now deals with dynamic positioning control design either in the presence of unknown time varying disturbance or without angular velocity measurements or with actuator saturation only the integrated design to deal with those issues all together still needs further research inspired by the aforementioned discussion a continuous finite time observer based constrained adaptive sliding output feedback controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship while the coriolis matrix hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix input saturation unmeasured states unknown time varying environment disturbances and transient performance are considered simultaneously a continue finite time state observer is proposed to estimate the unmeasured states of dynamic positioning ship in finite time an auxiliary system is constructed to handle with the control saturation and the signal generated by the auxiliary system is introduced to design a terminal sliding mode surface while the fast convergence is achieved under multiple constraints in addition an adaptive update law is introduced and the prior knowledge of disturbance is no need the finite time convergence of loop system is proved strictly finally simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme the main contributions lie in the following three aspects 1 a finite time state observer based adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is developed for dynamic positioning ship with the coriolis matrix and hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix while the problems of input saturation unmeasured states and unknown time varying environment disturbances are solved simultaneously when the finite time convergence is achieved 2 a continues finite time state observer is proposed for dynamic positioning ship considering the coriolis matrix and hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix which is seldom to be studied without requirement for prior knowledge of disturbance the rate of convergence is improved and chattering is avoided 3 the chatter free nominal output controller is proposed while the steady performance is guaranteed since the input saturation lasts short time the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem formulation of control is detailed for vessels and several preliminaries are given following in section 3 the control strategy is proposed the vessel dynamics and the proposed control schemes are simulated in section 4 and concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 problem formulation the nonlinear motion mathematical model of a dynamic positioning ship with coriolis matrix and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping matrix fossen 2012 can be expressed as 1 η j ψ υ 2 υ m 1 c υ υ m 1 d υ υ m 1 s a t τ m 1 τ d where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame consisting of the surge position x the sway position y and the yaw angle ψ 0 2 π of the ship υ u v r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity v the yaw rate r of the ship j ψ is the rotation matrix given by 3 j ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 here m denotes inertia matrix and is positive defining c υ denotes coriolis matrix and d υ is hydrodynamic damping matrix including linear terms and nonlinear terms τ d represents the lumped disturbance s a t τ s a t τ 1 s a t τ 2 s a t τ 3 t represents the constrained control input vector produced by propeller and thruster system consisting of force τ 1 in surge force τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw in particular the constrained input can be described as follows 4 s a t τ i τ i max i f τ i τ i max τ i i f τ i min τ i τ i max τ i min i f i f τ i τ i min where τ max i denotes the maximum control forces or moments that the ship s propulsion system can produce respectively let defining x 1 η x 2 j υ j j ψ and the equations 1 and 2 can be rewritten as 5 x 1 x 2 6 x 2 f x 1 x 2 j m 1 s a t τ d t where f x 1 x 2 s r j m 1 c j t x 2 d j t x 2 j t x 2 d

introduced first assumption 1 wondergem et al 2011 considering the nonlinear functions 7 and 8 the following inequalities are achieved f d x 1 x 2 f d x 1 y d m 1 d m 2 x 2 y x 2 y f c x 1 x 2 y f c x

that is there exists unknown positive constants d j such that d t d m where d m is unknown constant assumption 3 for the δ τ it is assumed to satisfy the following condition δ τ τ s a t τ σ where σ is known constant remark 1 from the view of a practical control system the difference δ τ between the desired control input τ and the actual control input s a t τ cannot be large the reason is that the system controllability should be satisfied when control input saturation occurs due to the disturbance and system states are bounded the control input needed is bounded thus the assumption is bounded is reasonable to satisfy this assumption the parameter σ can be large the following lemmas and definition are given here to express the approaches to design finite time controller and observer for dynamic positioning ship definition 1 hong et al 2002 consider the following system 10 x t f x t where f d ℜ n is non lipschitz continuous on a neighborhood d of the origin x 0 in ℜ n the equilibrium x 0 of 10 is finite time convergent if there are an open neighborhood u of the origin and a function t x u 0 0 such that every solution trajectory x t x 0 of 10 starting from the initial point x 0 u 0 is well defined and unique in forward time for t 0 t x x 0 and lim t t x x 0 x t x 0 0 here t x x 0 is called the convergence time of the initial state x 0 the equilibrium of 10 is finite time stable if it is lyapunov stable and finite time convergent if u d ℜ n the origin is a globally finite time stable equilibrium lemma 1 bhat and bernstein 2000 considering system 10 suppose there exists a continuous function v x such that the following conditions hold i is positive definite ii there exist real numbers c α 0 1 and an open neighborhood d 0 d of the origin such that then the origin is a finite time stable equilibrium of system 10 if u u 0 ℜ n the origin is a globally finite time stable equilibrium of system 10 in addition the finite convergence time t v x 0 1 α c 1 α lemma 2 shen and xia 2008 suppose there is a lyapunov function v x defined on a neighborhood of the origin d ℜ n such that the following conditions hold i is positive definite ii there exist real numbers b c α 0 1 and an open neighborhood d 0 d of the origin such that v x b v x c v x α 0 then the origin of 10 is locally finite time stable in addition the finite convergence time t 1 b 1 α ln v x 0 1 α c c lemma 3 zhu et al 2010 consider system 10 and suppose that there exist continuous function v x scalars c α 0 1 and 0 η such that v x c v x α η then the trajectory of system 10 is practical finite time stable in addition the time needed to reach such a neighborhood is bounded as where v x 0 is the initial value of v x remark 2 it is clear from lemma 3 that any asymptotically stable system is practically finite time stable however for some systems with absolutely unknown disturbance such as system 1 2 in the presence of unknown external disturbance the asymptotical stability cannot be obtained easily since the sysytem states can be only forced to converge into a neighborhood of the sliding surface in finite time so the finite time convergeness is called practical finite time stablity lemma 4 hu and jiang 2018 consider the system 10 suppose there is a lyapunov function v x positive constants p 1 0 1 p 2 p 1 α 0 β 0 and γ 0 let v 0 be the initial value of v x then the following statements hold v x α v x p 1 β v x p 2 then the trajectory of the system 10 is finite time uniformly ultimately bounded the settling time is bounded as follows t v 0 1 p 1 α θ 1 p 1 where θ 0 α is arbitrary positive

disturbances to track exactly the desired trajectory x d y d ψ d t 3 main results in this subsection a finite time observer based adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is designed to achieve the control object aforementioned in particular the controller designed here can be divided into four parts an auxiliary is introduced to handle with input saturation an adaptive state

feedback controller is integrated based the previous steps 3 1 auxiliary system design firstly an auxiliary system is designed to deal with the influence of input saturation under assumption 3 and the lemma 5 is provided here lemma 5 chen et al 2015 an auxiliary system is constructed as following 11 ξ a ξ b ξ r 0 σ g sgn ξ j m 1 δ τ where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t is the state of the auxiliary system a d i a

generated by auxiliary system provided in lemma 5 and a state feedback controller is constructed in forms of three theorems firstly defining the error surface vectors 12 z 1 x 1 x 1 d 13 z 2 x 2 x 2 d ξ where x 1 d and x 2 d are desired trajectory and velcoties in this paper the sliding mode surface shao et al 2017 is designed as following 14 s z 2 k β z 1 where z 1 z 11 z 12 z 13 t z 2 z 21 z 22 z

compensated term k 1 k 2 are design matrix and k d ε d are design parameters τ 3 can compensate the unknown time varying external disturbance and the upper bound information of disturbance is not required which not only reduces the conservative problem caused by designing too high upper bound but also can effectively weaken the chattering in order to prove the finite time convergence of controller we designed three steps are provided here in theorem 1 firstly the uniformly ultimate bounded of closed loop system is proved so that the boundedness of adaptive estimated error is garanteed the finite time convergence of sliding mode surface is achieved finally we will prove that the position of dynamic positioning ship can be converged into the small region around the desired trajectory theorem 1 considering the dynamic positioning ship model 5 and 6 the proposed controller 16 19 and adaptive law 20 guarantees that x 1 and x 2 converge to small regions around the equilibrium points in finite time proof the proof of theorem 1 is shown in the appendix 3 3 continuous finite time state observer design in most cases measurements of the ship s velocities are not available therefore estimations of the velocities must be computed from noisy position and heading measurements through a state observer hu et al 2018 hu and niu 2017 liu et al 2016 in the sequel a continuous finite time observer is designed for dynamic positioning ship to eatimate the velocities based on the position in finite time and the following conclusion can be given theorem 2 considering the dynamic positioning ship 5 and 6 the finite time observer is proposed 21 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 l 1 s i g x ˆ 1 x 1 r 2 1 2 22 x ˆ 2 f x 1 x ˆ 2 j ψ m 1 τ l 2 s i g x ˆ 1 x 1 r 2 where 0 r 2 1 is a design parameter l 1 d i a g l i and l 2 d i a g l i i 1 2 3 are the design observer matrix based on the dynamic positioning ship the error dynamic system of observer we designed can be expressed as 23 x 1 x

dynamic system 23 and 24 is locally fast finite time uniformly ultimately bounded proof the proof of theorem 2 is shown in the appendix remark 3 corsidering the relationship of x 1 η and x 2 j ψ υ when the estimation state x ˆ 2 is achieved the estimation velocities can be obtained based on υ ˆ j 1 ψ x ˆ 2 since the ψ is known remark 4 according theorem 2 the finite time convergent observer we designed is continuous and does not create the chattering phenomenon hu et al 2018 wang et al 2016a b which improve the performance comparing with the existing resluts in addition the disturbance information is not required fu and yu 2018 which means our approach is more robust and the properties of the multiple input multiple output nonlinear system have been considered liu et al 2016 which means the process of proof is more rigorous 3 4 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller design in this section combing with the auxiliary system 11 adaptive sliding mode state feedback controller 16 20 continuous finite time observer 21 and 22 an adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed here firstly the modified sliding mode surface can be construted as 25 s ˆ z ˆ 2 k ˆ β z ˆ 1 where the state x 1 x 2 in sliding mode surface 14 are replaced by estimation x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 in 21 and 22 at this point the adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller and adaptive law are designed as 26 τ ˆ m j t τ ˆ 1 τ ˆ 2 τ ˆ 3 27 τ ˆ 1 f x 1 x ˆ 2 k β z ˆ 1 k 1 s ˆ k 2 s i g r 1 s ˆ x 2 d 28 τ ˆ 2 a ξ b ξ r 0 σ g sgn ξ 29 τ ˆ 3 s ˆ s ˆ d ˆ m 30 d ˆ m k d ε d d ˆ m t s ˆ in order to prove the finite time ability theorem 3 is provided here theorem 3 under assumption 1 assumption 3 considering the dynamic positioning ship 5 and 6 with unmeasured state input saturation and unknown time varying external disturbance the proposed adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller 26 29 finite time observer 21 22 auxiliary system 11 and adaptive law 30 can guarantee that x 1 and x 2 converge to small regions around the equilibrium points in finite time proof the proof of theorem 3 is shown in the appendix remark 5 when auxiliary systems or anti windup control is introduced to handle with the input saturation a nominal controller is constructed without considering the input constraint since the time of saturation is short it s important to establish a nominal control approach such that good steady performance can be achieved in this paper a nominal adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is designed as 31 τ ˆ m j t τ ˆ 1 τ ˆ 3 32 τ ˆ 1 f x 1 x ˆ 2 k β z ˆ 1 k 1 s ˆ k 2 s i g r 1 s ˆ x 2 d 33 τ ˆ 3 s ˆ s ˆ d ˆ m 34 d ˆ m k d ε d d ˆ m t s ˆ where the input saturation is not occurred and the ξ 0 which means the error vector is z 2 x 2 x 2 d the other parameters are just as what they are defined in 26 30 in addition the estimation states are measured by finite time observer design in theorem 2 remark 6 it should point out that the nominal adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller consisting the controller 31 34 and the observer 21 22 is inherently continuous which means that it s chatter free the sign function is replaced by continuous function s i g and the adaptive update law is introduced to estimate the upper bound of lumped disturbance which means the chattering caused by the discontinuous function and the unknown disturbance is effectively reduced remark 7 in this paper the finite time output feedback controller is designed for dynamic positioning with input constraint and unknown disturbance for further work it will be interesting to consider the finite time control with dynamic uncertainties and state constraint maryam 2018 he et al 2017 2019 xiao and yin 2016 li et al 2019 4 simulations in order to present the proposed control strategy in the previous section work effectively numerical simulations tested on a supply vessel called cybership ⅱ skjetne et al 2005 which is a 1 70 scale replica of a supply ship whose main parameters is shown in table 1 are performed and the results are shown in this section the actuator input limitation is set as τ i max 50 the unknown external disturbances yu et al 2018 τ d

simulation contain three parts the simulation for nominal controller the simulation for controller considering the input saturation and the contrasting case which shows the superiority of our scheme comparing with the existing results scenario 1 nominal controller in remark 5 based on the controller proposed in remark 5 and the parameters can be chosen as l 1 d i a g 10 20 20 l 2 d i a g 150 50

scenario 3 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller in theorem 3 with worse ocean environment to prove the capability of anti disturbance the disturbance is enhanced as large as 10 times without regulating the parameters of controller and observer in scenario 2 that is to say the disturbance can be designed as τ d 10 τ d scenario 4 adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller based on a traditional observer in wondergem et al 2011 to illustrate the superiority of our approach a controller based on a conventional observer proposed in wondergem et al 2011 is provided due to the input constraint and the rate of convergence aren t considered in wondergem et al 2011 the controller is based on the theorem 3 while the observer is established as in wondergem et al 2011 and the observer can be designed as 35 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 l 1 x ˆ 1 x 1 36 x ˆ 2 f x 1 x ˆ 2 j ψ m 1 τ l 2 x ˆ 1 x 1 the parameters of controller and observer are chosen as l 1 d i a g 1 5 1 5 1 5 l 2 d i a g 200

with model uncertainties to prove the robust of the controller we designed the disturbance of model uncertainties fu et al 2018 is introduced without adjusting the parameters of controller and observer in scenario 2 and scenario 4 where the lumped disturbance can be design as τ d 2 cos 0 5 t cos t 0 3 cos 0 5 t sin 0 5 t 3 0 01 sin 0 1 t 0 6 sin 1 1 t cos 0 3 t ν 3 0 6 u 0 1 sin t 10 u r u 0 1 sin t 4 u r 10 v 2 0 1 sin t figs 1 6 show the performance of nominal controller in scenario 1 for dynamic positioning ship without input saturation the actual trajectory and desired trajectory are showed in fig 1 during the initial stage the nominal adaptive sliding mode controller we designed can ensure that the dynamic positioning ship track to the desired trajectory quickly with small overshoot which means that good transient performance is achieved in addition the tracking error in other stages can be guaranteed even if the gradient of desired trajectory changes significantly the track errors of trajectory and velocities are showed in figs 2 and 3 respectively it can be found that the trajectory error of the dynamic positioning ship can be maintained within 5 10 3 m while the heading angle can track the desired value quickly and the error can converge into 0 02 r a d without any chattering phenomenon the velocities errors can be maintained smoothly within 0 02 m s 0 01 m s and 0 02 r a d s respectively fig 4 shows the control input without constraint figs 5 and 6 show the observer error of finite time observer we proposed it shows that the observer errors fall into zero approximately in a short time period it can also be observed that x 1 converge to the acceptable accuracy of 1 10 4 m r a d within 1 s while the estimation error in velocities can be maintained within 5 10 3 m s 5 10 3 m s and 8 10 3 r a d s respectively in addition no knowledge of external disturbance is required while only the boundedness is requested to be guaranteed for the observer we designed from figs 7 12 the performance of nominal controller in scenario 2 for dynamic positioning ship in the present of input saturation are showed the actual trajectories under controller in theorem 3 are shown in fig 7 from which we can see that the proposed controller can achieve fast transient response and high steady state accuracy despite the presence of external disturbances and input saturation and lack of velocity measurements in particular fig 8 shows the track errors in surge sway and yaw direction respectively where the steady performance can be seen figs 9 and 10 show the input signal with constraint and signal generated by auxiliary system due to the fact that the disturbance is non zero whereas the control input is zero at the initial moment the saturation is activated and the auxiliary system handle with the effect caused by input saturation timely when control input τ i 50 n n m the nominal controller proposed in remark 5 which guarantees the good performance can be achieved figs 11 and 12 show the observer error considering the input constraint from which we can find that it doesn t affect the estimation of observer and the observer still maintains accurate estimation performance while the estimation error converge into 2 10 3 m s 1 10 3 m s and 1 10 2 r a d s respectively from fig 13 anti disturbance performance of controller we designed is showed compared with the scenario 2 the disturbance in this simulation is enhanced as larger as 10 times than that in scenario 2 while the parameters of controller and observer are not changed as shown in fig 13 since the initial disturbance is very large while the control input is constrained so that the overshoot is more obvious than fig 7 then the auxiliary system is activated and the controller we designed can make the ship following the desired trajectory within short time it s illustrated that the controller provided in theorem 3 can withstand worse environment while the parameters adjusting aren t required from figs 14 17 a comparison simulation is provided to better show the convergence speed and robustness of the proposed controller and observer comparing with the existing works in wondergem et al 2011 it can be found in fig 14 that the actual trajectory in scenario 4 has a significant oscilation in the initial stage and the convergence time is longer than the resluts in scenario 2 which is more obvious in fig 15 in the case that the controllers are the same and the steady performance are similar the transient porformance is based on the observer from fig 16 and fig 17 we can find that a better trasient proformance is achieved by the observer we designed in which the overshoot is less and the converbence time is shorter summarizing all the cases considered the fast convergence rate of the proposed controller and observer have been verified from fig 18 and fig 19 a comparison with model uncertanties while the parameters aren t adjusted between controller in scenario 2 and controller based on traditional observer in scenario 4 is showed it can be found from fig 18 that the actual trajectory based on traditional observer has a significant oscilation in the initial stage while the trajectory based on the theorem 3 is more smooth it s obvious that the controller and observer we designed have better robustness against to uncertainties in addition the estimation errors comparsion between two observers with uncertainties is provided from fig 19 we can find that the observer we designed can estimate the accurate state within shorter time more smoothly in this thesis the controller and observer we desinged have good robustness in conclusion when the input saturation isn t activated the nominal adaptive sliding mode controller we designed can ensure the good control performance of the dynamic positioning ship when the control input of the dynamic positioning ship exceeds the input constraint the designed auxiliary system can quickly compensate for the control performance degradation caused by the saturation constraint even in the worese environment the ship can maintain good steady performance and parameters adujsting is not required at the same time compared with the conventional state observer the control method designed in this paper has a better trasient performance in addition the controller and observer provded in theorem 3 have robust against the uncertainty while there is no need to change the parameters 5 conclusion in this paper an adaptive sliding mode output feedback controller is investigated for dynamic positioning ship considering the coriolis matrix hydrodynamic nonlinear damping matrix input saturation unmeasured states unknown time varying environment disturbances and transient performance simultaneously a continue finite time state observer is proposed to estimate the unmeasured states of dynamic positioning ship in finite time and an auxiliary system is constructed to handle with the control saturation a terminal sliding mode surface consisting the signal generated by the auxiliary system is designed while the fast convergence is achieved under multiple constraints in addition an adaptive update law is introduced that the prior knowledge of disturbance is no need fast convergence rate of the closed loop system is ensured by analyzing system stability in light of finite time

21866,fatigue is one of the major failure modes of offshore structures typically operating continuously for 20 30 years at sea gradually varying factors such as wave climate change and marine corrosion can contribute significantly to the fatigue damage assessment during the entire design life however these factors are generally ignored this study aims to propose a new fatigue damage assessment method wherein the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion on the fatigue damage assessment of mooring lines are considered by introducing a reasonable model into the hull

marine corrosion are ignored the cumulative fatigue damage during the entire design life is underestimated by up to 35 thus it can be concluded that a design without the consideration of the gradually varying factors poses significant security risks keywords mooring system fatigue damage wave climate change marine corrosion 1 introduction floating offshore platform systems are widely used for the exploitation of marine resources such as offshore oil and gas wind energy and wave energy these systems are designed to operate for up to 20 or even 30 years during which the floating platform and its mooring system are continuously subjected to complex and harsh marine environment loads particularly cyclic wave loading therefore fatigue damage assessment is vital for mooring systems additionally wave climate change and marine corrosion can theoretically have a significant impact on the fatigue damage of the mooring system over its operational life corrosion of offshore structures is inevitable owing to the corrosiveness of seawater melchers et al 2007 which has a significant effect on their strength and reliability gao et al 2005 proposed a time variant reliability model and proved that the annual failure probability significantly increased with the corrosion of mooring chains hou et al 2017 investigated the effects of marine corrosion on the reliability of mooring lines for a fish cage and their results indicated that the reliability of the mooring lines decreased significantly with the increase in corrosion depth qiao et al 2014 discovered that the corrosion effect could not be ignored when assessing the fatigue damage of mooring lines and the fatigue damage in the upper chain was significantly greater than that in the bottom chain for a chain wire chain mooring line waves are considered a dominant load in the fatigue damage assessment of offshore structures hou et al 2018 however wave climate has been continuously changing since carter and draper 1988 first indicated that the marine environment is deteriorating an increasing number of scientists have become aware of the seriousness of this problem furthermore numerous observational and numerical studies have been conducted to analyze this trend with regard to wave climate lim et al 2013 found that not only the once in 50 year wave height during summer but also the frequency and intensity of typhoons have increased in high latitude regions zheng et al 2017 investigated the long term environmental trend in the china sea over the period of 1988 2011 and concluded that wind speed and wave height are increasing at rates of 3 38 cm s yr 1 and 1 52 cm yr 1 respectively gulev and grigorieva 2006 analyzed the secular change and interannual variability of the wind wave swell and significant wave height characteristics over the north atlantic and north pacific based on the international comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set which contains surface meteorological observations made from 1958 to 2002 their analysis indicated that the significant wave heights in both the north atlantic and north pacific at mid latitudes during winter demonstrated a secular increase of 10 40 cm per decade during the last 45 years using 57 year hindcasting 1953 2009 obtained from a spectral wave model and reinforced with a re analysis of the wind field datasets dodet et al 2010 found that there is a considerable increasing trend in significant wave heights of up to 20 cm decade in the north east atlantic furthermore semedo et al 2011 discovered a tremendous growth in the significant wave height of approximately 12 20 cm decade over most of the north pacific and north atlantic between 1957 and 2002 based on the above studies it is clear that the wave climate has an obvious tendency to deteriorate in recent years some researchers have started to investigate the effect of wave climate change on the safety and reliability of offshore structures bitner gregersen et al 2018 studied the impact of wave changes on the structural design and emphasized the importance of considering such changes and vanem and bitner gregersen 2013 argued that a higher wave height will result in a higher probability of structural failure despite the important effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion little research has been conducted in this area therefore in this study we proposed a novel fatigue damage assessment method considering wave climate change and marine corrosion and their combined effects on the fatigue damage of the mooring lines used for a deep water floating platform were

on the fatigue damage of a mooring line finally some concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 coupled dynamic analysis of the floater and mooring system in the time domain in a moored floating structure the nonlinear mooring system is fully coupled with the floater it is important to consider the dynamic interactions between the floater and the mooring system in the time domain for achieving a reliable response prediction vendhan 2019 the governing equation of the dynamic response of the floating platform with the mooring system in the time domain can be defined as follows reinholdtsen and falkenberg 2001 1 m a x t t κ t τ x τ d τ k s x t f m x t f where m is the floater mass matrix a is the added mass matrix x t x t and x t are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the floater respectively κ t τ is the retardation function accounting for frequency dependent damping k s is the hydrostatic restoring stiffness of the floater f m x t is the nonlinear restoring force from the mooring riser system and f is the exciting force from the marine environment the potential flow theory is adopted to calculate the hydrodynamic load on the floater including the first and second order wave exciting forces the first order hydrodynamic problem of a floating body can be divided into three components namely the forces and moments on the body resulting from the incident diffraction and radiation waves for the second order wave force the sum frequency forces can be ignored because of the large natural period of each degree of freedom of motion the low frequency wave force f 2 which can excite the resonance response of the moored floater system can be calculated using the quadratic transfer function qtf matrix pinkster 1975 matos et al 2011 and the diagonal of the qtf matrix ω r ω s corresponds to the mean wave drift forces in the wadam software det norske veritas dnv 1994 det norske veritas dnv 2007 during the coupled dynamic analysis the mooring lines are simulated using the finite element method and their geometry deformation is calculated in the time domain the drag inertial and added mass forces are calculated using morison s equation owing to the small diameter of the section in comparison with the wavelength 3 fatigue damage assessment method 3 1 time domain analysis method for fatigue damage the main advantage of the time domain approach for fatigue damage assessment is that no arbitrary assumptions are necessary therefore the time domain analysis method is always considered the most accurate for fatigue damage assessment and regarded as a benchmark against other methods low 2011 the time series of the mooring line tension can be obtained from the coupled dynamic analysis of a platform mooring system for each short term state and the circles n s corresponding to the tension range t s can be obtained using a specified cycle counting method the fatigue damage d i due to the ith sea state can then be calculated based on the palmgren miner rule 2 d i 365 24 p i t s n s i n s where p i is the occurrence probability of the ith sea state n s i is the number of tension cycles associated with the response range t s under the ith sea state n s is the number to failures at the response range t s determined from the t n curve t is the simulation duration for a short term state in h and 365 24 is the total number of hours over one year as shown in eq 3 the annual cumulative fatigue damage can be calculated by summing the fatigue contribution of all the sea states in a wave scatter diagram 3 d

fatigue strength exponent respectively which are empirical constants to be determined from the experimental data the parameter m is the negative reciprocal slope of the t n curve and for convenience it is often referred to simply as the slope table 1 lists the recommended values of a and m for the t n curves american petroleum institute api 2005 3 3 rainflow counting method when selecting the fatigue damage assessment method in the time domain is a cycle counting algorithm needs to be applied to determine the mooring line tension cycles and ranges from a random time series of the tension process several cycle counting methods exist including peak counting range counting level crossing counting and rainflow counting among these counting methods rainflow counting matsuishi and endo 1968 based on the stress strain hysteresis loop is considered the most suitable for fatigue damage estimation accordingly in this study the rainflow counting method is adopted for fatigue damage assessment 4 fatigue damage analysis method considering the effect of wave climate change and marine corrosion while the short term effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion are minimal they become significant over decades because offshore structures need to operate for 20 30 years during which the fatigue damage accumulates the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion cannot be ignored to improve the rationality and reliability of the fatigue damage assessment of marine structures we proposed a novel fatigue damage analysis method considering such effects 4 1 wave climate change as mentioned in section 1 wave conditions have become increasingly harsher in many sea areas and the rate of wave climate change varies depending on the area in particular several studies have been conducted on the environmental changes the north sea cardone 1996 conducted a numerical hindcast incorporating a ten year history 1980 1989 of the environment in the north atlantic and their results indicate a significant increasing trend in the wave height at several north east atlantic locations within the scope of the wasa project using the wam wave model günther et al 1997 proposed that the maximum annual significant wave height has increased by approximately 5 10 cm yr 1 over the last 40 years through a series of measurements from the seven stones light vessel 1962 1986 bacon and carter 1991 confirmed that the wave height has experienced a significant increasing trend of approximately 2 2 cm yr 1 over the entire north sea area in recent years additionally other researchers found that the significant wave height has experienced a considerable increasing trend in the north sea dodet et al 2010 debernard and røed 2008 in the present study a model of wave climate change with an increasing rate of 2 2 cm yr 1 was selected 4 2 marine corrosion and breaking strength and axial stiffness of mooring chain corrosion is one of the inevitable factors that causes damage to steel structures particularly in marine environments a reduction in the nominal diameter and axial stiffness was selected to represent the effects of corrosion on the mooring chain a uniform corrosion model with the constant corrosion rate recommended by hou et al 2017 was applied in this study to simplify the simulation model according to dnv 2010 the corrosion rate of 0 4 mm year 1 was chosen for mooring chain diameter considering the effect of corrosion on the mooring lines of a floating structure the breaking strength and axial stiffness of the mooring chains decrease over the service years referring to iacs 2015 the breaking strength t b and axial stiffness ea of an un corroded mooring chain with a specific dimensional configuration can be calculated using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 t b c d 2 44 80 d 6 e a 1 01 10 8 d 2 in eqs 5 and 6 c is a grade dependent constant given in the catalog data as grade 2 of 1 37 104 and grade 3 of 1 96 104 d is the nominal diameter of the chain in m and the unit for both the breaking strength t b and axial stiffness ea is kn however when the nominal diameter of the mooring chain decreases due to corrosion the dimensional configuration of the mooring chain changes and the breaking strength can no longer be estimated using eq 5 in the present study the decrease in the breaking strength as the diameter decreases under marine corrosion is described using the simplified formula shown in eq 7 recommended by leira et al 1995 7 t b t b d d 2 the axial stiffness of the mooring chain when considering marine corrosion can be calculated using eq 6 by updating the nominal diameter and can be assessed through eq 8 8 e a e a d d 2 where d is the mooring chain diameter considering the corrosion effect and can be expressed by the initial mooring chain diameter d and the number of service years i d d 0 0004i t b and ea are the residual breaking strength and axial stiffness of the mooring chain with diameter d respectively 4 3 fatigue damage assessment method fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of the fatigue damage assessment method proposed in this study in this method a coupled dynamic analysis of the offshore structures is performed for each year while the significant wave height and mooring chain diameter are updated based on the wave climate change model described in section 4 1 and the marine corrosion model described in section 4 2 respectively fatigue damage of the mooring system is further assessed year by year based on the dynamic results 5 numerical study to quantitatively investigate the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion which are gradually varying factors on the tension response and fatigue damage of mooring lines we conducted a case study of a moored semi submersible production platform 5 1 numerical model of a semi submersible platform and a mooring system the mooring system of a hypothetical semi submersible production platform operating in the north sea was chosen in this numerical study the main dimensions of the platform are listed in table 2 fig 2 depicts the platform model and the mooring system layout as well as the incident wave direction the mooring system which comprises four groups is symmetrical about both the x and y axes there are three lines in each group at departure angles of 40 45 and 50 from the x axis respectively each mooring line comprises three components two segments of studlink chains at the fairlead and anchor and one segment of a spiral strand wire in the middle the properties and configurations of the mooring lines are presented in table 3 5 2 environment conditions the main objective of this study is to investigate the fatigue damage of the mooring lines where the wind and current which are always considered to be constant exhibit only a slight contribution gao and moan 2007 therefore only the waves are considered during the dynamic analysis the long term sea state is generally represented by a number of short term sea conditions which are considered to be stationary stochastic gaussian processes and can be characterized by the wave spectra s f the platform considered in this study is assumed for service in the north sea and the spectral model adopted is the jonswap spectrum which is expressed as a function of the significant wave height h s and spectral peak frequency f p as follows 9 s f β j h s 2 f p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 f f p 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency in hz the parameters σ γ and β j are determined respectively through the following expressions 10 σ 0 07 f o r f f p 0 09 f o r f f p 11 γ 1 t p 5 h s exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s 3 6 h s t p 5 h s 5 t p 3 6 h s 12 β j 0 06238 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 1 094 0 01915 l n γ where t p 1 f p and γ is the peak enhancement factor representing the ratio of the peak energy of the jonswap spectrum to that of the p m spectrum for the long term occurrence frequency of various sea states the wave scatter diagram which is obtained from the above long term statistical model haver and nyhus 1986 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 or long term measured wave data in a certain sea area is often used during the numerical calculation and system design table 4 presents the distribution of h s and t z in the operating sea area the wave states in this wave scatter diagram are considered as the initial service wave conditions for the semi submersible platform 5 3 distribution of the long term line tension ranges under the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion distribution of the long term line tension ranges is the decisive factor for the fatigue damage of the mooring lines investigation of the distribution of the long term line tension ranges under the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion can help understand the effect of the wave climate change and marine corrosion on the fatigue damage of the mooring lines in this study the stochastic waves propagate along the x axis and hence the tension of line 6 which is the most loaded is chosen to be exhibited in the following sections first coupled dynamic analyses under all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram as presented in table 4 are conducted using the software dnv gl sesam and the time series of the mooring line tension are obtained it is should be noted that the diameter of the mooring chain is updated according to the marine corrosion model every year and the wave force on the mooring chain is calculated based on the updated chain diameter then the short term tension ranges and corresponding cycles are counted using the rainflow counting method from the above tension time histories considering the occurrence probability of the sea states the statistics of the long term tension ranges during a period of 1 year can be easily calculated the dimensionless tension range relative tension range or in other words the ratio of the tension range to the minimum breaking strength used in the t n curve function is applied during the fitting of the tension range distribution according to the study conducted by du et al 2019 the long term tension range can be fitted well through the gamma distribution function to investigate the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion on the distribution of the relative mooring line tension range the probability density curves of the relative mooring line tension during different years of operation are compared and only the curves during the initial 5th 10th 15th 20th and 25th years are demonstrated for simplification in this section the changes in the gamma distribution curves during different years of operation are discussed under the influence of different factors as depicted in figs 3 5 fig 3 depicts the difference between the fitting curves of the relative tension range distribution during different years under the effects of wave climate change it is demonstrated that the peaks shift to the right larger relative tension range and the peak values decrease significantly with years of operation the probability density of the relative tension range decreases within a small relative tension region e g the zone of 0 0 007 as the years of operation increase whereas the probability density increases in the larger relative tension range zones in other words the mean and standard deviation of the relative tension range increase year by year under the effect of wave climate change the fitting curves of the relative tension range under the effect of marine corrosion and the combined effect of the two factors are depicted in figs 4 and 5 respectively the changes in the distribution curves are similar to those of curves under the effects of wave climate change comparing fig 4 with fig 3 it can be observed that the peak value under the effect of marine corrosion decreases more quickly with the years of operation than that under the effects of wave climate change although the offset of the peak position under the effects of wave climate change is greater than that considering the effects of marine corrosion comparing fig 5 with figs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the changing trend of the tension range probability density is more significant when the two factors are combined 5 4 fatigue damage of mooring lines under wave climate change and marine corrosion the effects of the gradually varying factors on the fatigue damage of a mooring line can be inferred qualitatively from an investigation into the distribution of the relative tension ranges described in section 5 the fatigue damage of the mooring lines is calculated using the rainflow counting method and the palmgren miner rule as depicted in fig 6 the annual fatigue damage during different years are compared with each other when the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion are considered fig 6 confirms that the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line during different years as computed using the generally applied method is a constant however it increases with an increase in the years of operation under the effect of wave climate change and marine corrosion and their combined effect it can be concluded that the increase in annual fatigue damage caused by marine corrosion which leads to a reduction in the minimum breaking strength of the mooring chain is more severe than that caused by wave climate change for the fatigue damage of the mooring line in consideration of the combined effect of the wave climate change and marine corrosion the degree of damage is undoubtedly the largest as presented in table 5 the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line without considering the effects of the gradually varying factors can be respectively underestimated by 26 and 37 during the last year of the design life in comparison with the result under the conditions of wave climate change and marine corrosion specifically in comparison with the estimated results considering the combined effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion the underestimation of the annual fatigue damage can be over 53 during the 25th year of operation fig 7 depicts the cumulative fatigue damage of the mooring line during the entire design life 25 years under four working conditions i e without considering the gradually varying environment factors general condition in fig 7 considering the effects of wave climate change marine corrosion and their combination in the form of a histogram the results demonstrate that the cumulative fatigue damage under the last three conditions is 1 17 1 28 and 1 53 times the fatigue damage under the general conditions respectively in other words the total fatigue damage of the mooring line is underestimated by 34 when the gradually varying environmental factors are ignored and such a design poses significant security risks additionally the contribution of marine corrosion to the increase in the mooring line fatigue damage is greater than that of wave climate change 6 concluding remarks this study investigated the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion on the mooring line tension response and fatigue damage during the numerical simulation two simplified models were chosen to describe the significant changes in the wave climate and marine corrosion the significant wave height increased obviously by up to 0 022 m each year and the diameter reduction of the mooring chain was determined to be 0 4 mm year coupled dynamic analyses of the semi submersible production platform and its mooring system were conducted using the commercial software sesam and the fatigue damage of the mooring line was assessed using the time domain analysis method the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the distribution of the relative tension ranges which directly determines the mooring line fatigue damage is affected by wave climate change and marine corrosion the peak position of the distribution of the relative tension ranges shifts to the right more quickly under the effect of wave climate change than that under marine corrosion although the peak value of the distribution decreases faster under the effect of marine corrosion than that under wave climate change additionally the distribution curves change faster when both the gradually varying factors are considered than that when only one factor is considered 2 the effects of the gradually varying environmental factors such as wave climate change and marine corrosion on the mooring line fatigue damage are significant and marine corrosion leads to a larger increase in the annual fatigue damage than in the growth of the significant wave heights in the last year of the design life the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line under the general conditions is underestimated by 26 38 and 54 in comparison with the results considering the effects of wave climate change marine corrosion and their combination respectively for the cumulative fatigue damage of the mooring line the result under general conditions is underestimated by 35 in comparison with that under the condition that both the wave climate change and marine corrosion are considered implying that a design without considering

21866,fatigue is one of the major failure modes of offshore structures typically operating continuously for 20 30 years at sea gradually varying factors such as wave climate change and marine corrosion can contribute significantly to the fatigue damage assessment during the entire design life however these factors are generally ignored this study aims to propose a new fatigue damage assessment method wherein the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion on the fatigue damage assessment of mooring lines are considered by introducing a reasonable model into the hull mooring system coupled dynamics the fatigue damage of the mooring lines used for a semi submersible platform is assessed in the time domain using the proposed method the results indicate that wave climate change and marine corrosion have a significant influence on the distribution of the mooring lines tension ranges and fatigue damage assessment when the effects of both wave climate change and marine corrosion are ignored the cumulative fatigue damage during the entire design life is underestimated by up to 35 thus it can be concluded that a design without the consideration of the gradually varying factors poses significant security risks keywords mooring system fatigue damage wave climate change marine corrosion 1 introduction floating offshore platform systems are widely used for the

found that the significant wave height has experienced a considerable increasing trend in the north sea dodet et al 2010 debernard and røed 2008 in the present study a model of wave climate change with an increasing rate of 2 2 cm yr 1 was selected 4 2 marine corrosion and breaking strength and axial stiffness of mooring chain corrosion is one of the inevitable factors that causes damage to steel structures particularly in marine environments a reduction in the nominal diameter and axial stiffness was selected to represent the effects of corrosion on the mooring chain a uniform corrosion model with the constant corrosion rate recommended by hou et al 2017 was applied in this study to simplify the simulation model according to dnv 2010 the corrosion rate of 0 4 mm year 1 was chosen for mooring chain diameter considering the effect of corrosion on the mooring lines of a floating structure the breaking strength and axial stiffness of the mooring chains decrease over the service years referring to iacs 2015 the breaking strength t b and axial stiffness ea of an un corroded mooring chain with a specific dimensional configuration can be calculated using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 t b c d 2 44 80 d 6 e a 1 01 10 8 d 2 in eqs 5 and 6 c is a grade dependent constant given in the catalog data as grade 2 of 1 37 104 and grade 3 of 1 96 104 d is the nominal diameter of the chain in m and the unit for both the breaking strength t b and axial stiffness ea is kn however when the nominal diameter of the mooring chain decreases due to corrosion the dimensional configuration of the mooring chain changes and the breaking strength can no longer be estimated using eq 5 in the present study the decrease in the breaking strength as the diameter decreases under marine corrosion is described using the simplified formula shown in eq 7 recommended by leira et al 1995 7 t b t b d d 2 the axial stiffness of the mooring chain when considering marine corrosion can be calculated using eq 6 by updating the nominal diameter and can be assessed through eq 8 8 e a e a d d 2 where d is the mooring chain diameter considering the corrosion effect and can be expressed by the initial mooring chain diameter d and the number of service years i d d 0 0004i t b and ea are the residual breaking strength and axial stiffness of the mooring chain with diameter d respectively 4 3 fatigue damage assessment method fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of the fatigue damage assessment method proposed in this study in this method a coupled dynamic analysis of the offshore structures is performed for each year while the significant wave height and mooring chain diameter are updated based on the wave climate change model described in section 4 1 and the marine corrosion model described in section 4 2 respectively fatigue damage of the mooring system is further assessed year by year based on the dynamic results 5 numerical study to quantitatively investigate the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion which are gradually varying factors on the tension response and fatigue damage of mooring lines we conducted a case study of a moored semi submersible production platform 5 1 numerical model of a semi submersible platform and a mooring system the mooring system of a hypothetical semi submersible production platform operating in the north sea was chosen in this numerical study the main dimensions of the platform are listed in table 2 fig 2 depicts the platform model and the mooring system layout as well as the incident wave direction the mooring system which comprises four groups is symmetrical about both the x and y axes there are three lines in each group at departure angles of 40 45 and 50 from the x axis respectively each mooring line comprises three components two segments of studlink chains at the fairlead and anchor and one segment of a spiral strand wire in the middle the properties and configurations of the mooring lines are presented in table 3 5 2 environment conditions the main objective of this study is to investigate the fatigue damage of the mooring lines where the wind and current which are always considered to be constant exhibit only a slight contribution gao and moan 2007 therefore only the waves are considered during the dynamic analysis the long term sea state is generally represented by a number of short term sea conditions which are considered to be stationary stochastic gaussian processes and can be characterized by the wave spectra s f the platform considered in this study is assumed for service in the north sea and the spectral model adopted is the jonswap spectrum which is expressed as a function of the significant wave height h s and spectral peak frequency f p as follows 9 s f β j h s 2 f p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 f f p 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency in hz the parameters σ γ and β j are determined respectively through the following expressions 10 σ 0 07 f o r f f p 0 09 f o r f f p 11 γ 1 t p 5 h s exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s 3 6 h s t p 5 h s 5 t p 3 6 h s 12 β j 0 06238 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 1 094 0 01915 l n γ where t p 1 f p and γ is the peak enhancement factor representing the ratio of the peak energy of the jonswap spectrum to that of the p m spectrum for the long term occurrence frequency of various sea states the wave scatter diagram which is obtained from the above long term statistical model haver and nyhus 1986 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 or long term measured wave data in a certain sea area is often used during the numerical calculation and system design table 4 presents the distribution of h s and t z in the operating sea area the wave states in this wave scatter diagram are considered as the initial service wave conditions for the semi submersible platform 5 3 distribution of the long term line tension ranges under the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion distribution of the long term line tension ranges is the decisive factor for the fatigue damage of the mooring lines investigation of the distribution of the long term line tension ranges under the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion can help understand the effect of the wave climate change and marine corrosion on the fatigue damage of the mooring lines in this study the stochastic waves propagate along the x axis and hence the tension of line 6 which is the most loaded is chosen to be exhibited in the following sections first coupled dynamic analyses under all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram as presented in table 4 are conducted using the software dnv gl sesam and the time series of the mooring line tension are obtained it is should be noted that the diameter of the mooring chain is updated according to the marine corrosion model every year and the wave force on the mooring chain is calculated based on the updated chain diameter then the short term tension ranges and corresponding cycles are counted using the rainflow counting method from the above tension time histories considering the occurrence probability of the sea states the statistics of the long term tension ranges during a period of 1 year can be easily calculated the dimensionless tension range relative tension range or in other words the ratio of the tension range to the minimum breaking strength used in the t n curve function is applied during the fitting of the tension range distribution according to the study conducted by du et al 2019 the long term tension range can be fitted well through the gamma distribution function to investigate the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion on the distribution of the relative mooring line tension range the probability density curves of the relative mooring line tension during different years of operation are compared and only the curves during the initial 5th 10th 15th 20th and 25th years are demonstrated for simplification in this section the changes in the gamma distribution curves during different years of operation are discussed under the influence of different factors as depicted in figs 3 5 fig 3 depicts the difference between the fitting curves of the relative tension range distribution during different years under the effects of wave climate change it is demonstrated that the peaks shift to the right larger relative tension range and the peak values decrease significantly with years of operation the probability density of the relative tension range decreases within a small relative tension region e g the zone of 0 0 007 as the years of operation increase whereas the probability density increases in the larger relative tension range zones in other words the mean and standard deviation of the relative tension range increase year by year under the effect of wave climate change the fitting curves of the relative tension range under the effect of marine corrosion and the combined effect of the two factors are depicted in figs 4 and 5 respectively the changes in the distribution curves are similar to those of curves under the effects of wave climate change comparing fig 4 with fig 3 it can be observed that the peak value under the effect of marine corrosion decreases more quickly with the years of operation than that under the effects of wave climate change although the offset of the peak position under the effects of wave climate change is greater than that considering the effects of marine corrosion comparing fig 5 with figs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the changing trend of the tension range probability density is more significant when the two factors are combined 5 4 fatigue damage of mooring lines under wave climate change and marine corrosion the effects of the gradually varying factors on the fatigue damage of a mooring line can be inferred qualitatively from an investigation into the distribution of the relative tension ranges described in section 5 the fatigue damage of the mooring lines is calculated using the rainflow counting method and the palmgren miner rule as depicted in fig 6 the annual fatigue damage during different years are compared with each other when the effects of the wave climate change and marine corrosion are considered fig 6 confirms that the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line during different years as computed using the generally applied method is a constant however it increases with an increase in the years of operation under the effect of wave climate change and marine corrosion and their combined effect it can be concluded that the increase in annual fatigue damage caused by marine corrosion which leads to a reduction in the minimum breaking strength of the mooring chain is more severe than that caused by wave climate change for the fatigue damage of the mooring line in consideration of the combined effect of the wave climate change and marine corrosion the degree of damage is undoubtedly the largest as presented in table 5 the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line without considering the effects of the gradually varying factors can be respectively underestimated by 26 and 37 during the last year of the design life in comparison with the result under the conditions of wave climate change and marine corrosion specifically in comparison with the estimated results considering the combined effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion the underestimation of the annual fatigue damage can be over 53 during the 25th year of operation fig 7 depicts the cumulative fatigue damage of the mooring line during the entire design life 25 years under four working conditions i e without considering the gradually varying environment factors general condition in fig 7 considering the effects of wave climate change marine corrosion and their combination in the form of a histogram the results demonstrate that the cumulative fatigue damage under the last three conditions is 1 17 1 28 and 1 53 times the fatigue damage under the general conditions respectively in other words the total fatigue damage of the mooring line is underestimated by 34 when the gradually varying environmental factors are ignored and such a design poses significant security risks additionally the contribution of marine corrosion to the increase in the mooring line fatigue damage is greater than that of wave climate change 6 concluding remarks this study investigated the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion on the mooring line tension response and fatigue damage during the numerical simulation two simplified models were chosen to describe the significant changes in the wave climate and marine corrosion the significant wave height increased obviously by up to 0 022 m each year and the diameter reduction of the mooring chain was determined to be 0 4 mm year coupled dynamic analyses of the semi submersible production platform and its mooring system were conducted using the commercial software sesam and the fatigue damage of the mooring line was assessed using the time domain analysis method the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the distribution of the relative tension ranges which directly determines the mooring line fatigue damage is affected by wave climate change and marine corrosion the peak position of the distribution of the relative tension ranges shifts to the right more quickly under the effect of wave climate change than that under marine corrosion although the peak value of the distribution decreases faster under the effect of marine corrosion than that under wave climate change additionally the distribution curves change faster when both the gradually varying factors are considered than that when only one factor is considered 2 the effects of the gradually varying environmental factors such as wave climate change and marine corrosion on the mooring line fatigue damage are significant and marine corrosion leads to a larger increase in the annual fatigue damage than in the growth of the significant wave heights in the last year of the design life the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line under the general conditions is underestimated by 26 38 and 54 in comparison with the results considering the effects of wave climate change marine corrosion and their combination respectively for the cumulative fatigue damage of the mooring line the result under general conditions is underestimated by 35 in comparison with that under the condition that both the wave climate change and marine corrosion are considered implying that a design without considering the effects of wave climate change and marine corrosion poses significant security risks credit authorship contribution statement junfeng du conceptualization methodology writing review editing

21867,the performance of api 5l x56 submarine pipes subjected to transverse impact is investigated through both drop weight impact tests and finite element simulations to study the improvement of resistance to transverse impact for pipe in pipe specimens corresponding single layer pipe specimens under impacting load were also tested for comparison from the experimental tests the failure mode the impact force time history curve the displacement time history curve the strain time history curve and the impact force displacement curve of all specimens were obtained the pipe in pipe specimens are found to have superior performance to resist impacting loading compared to single layer specimens because smaller global bending deformation and local indentation were observed in them in addition the cross section deformation rate r was proposed and the local indentation length of the specimen was divided into three zones based on experimental observation and numerical simulation a comprehensive comparison of the length and the depth of local indentation in the pipe in pipe specimens shows that the local indentation decreases and the impact resistance increases due to the presence of the inner tube finally the post peak mean force p m and the energy absorption capacity eac were used to evaluate the energy dissipation mechanism of different specimens the results also

observed frequently due to the scouring of sea water pilkey et al 1995 aljaroudi et al 2015 during service period the hanging pipelines may suffer from accidental impact loads such as the ship collision anchoring and falling objects serious damage was found in the pipelines after experiencing impacting load it is necessary to further understand the impact characteristics of submarine pipelines and study the actual reinforcement methods zeinoddini et al 2013 pipe in pipe systems are being used extensively in the design of high pressure and high temperature streamlines due to its excellent thermal insulation performance karampour et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 compared with single layer pipes pipe in pipes have an interaction between the inner tube and the outer tube during a collision event besides having all the characteristics of single layer pipes therefore it is of vital significance to study the dynamic characteristics of submarine pipelines under impact loading for design and evaluation purposes circular steel tubes are the most common component in ocean steel structures many researchers have studied the transverse impact resistance of circular steel tubes in recent years soares and søreide 1983 firstly studied the impact resistance of circular steel tubes and proposed a rigid plastic analytical formulation applicable to steel tube components under transverse impact loading subsequently jones et al conducted transverse impact tests and theoretical research on fully clamped circular steel tubes they presented a theoretical rigid plastic procedure which allows the local or denting deformation to continue during the global deformation phase jones et al 1992 to study further the failure mode of steel pipes jones and shen 1992 carried out drop hammer impact tests on 130 steel pipes and studied the influence of different impact positions on the impact resistance of pipes however the ideal condition of full clamping was not acquired in their tests and an overestimation of the input energy required for the failure may be produced to solve this problem jones and birch 1997 designed a special structure to achieve full clamping at pipe ends and they used such structure to study the effect of different impact locations on the impact performance the critical values for the two failure energies were also obtained for a range of internal gas pressures in addition chen and shen 1998 studied systematically the impact failure of fully clamped steel tubes taking into account the influences of different tube shapes impact positions and boundary conditions on the performance of steel tubes subjected to transverse mass impact apart from clamped boundary conditions ong and lu 1996 studied experimentally the collapse load of steel tubes under different support conditions and a test program was carried out to determine the collapse load and energy absorbing capacity li et al 2019 conducted experiments and parametric study through finite element analysis on the performance of ultra high strength steel uhss hollow tubes under low velocity transverse impact loading the parametric study showed that uhss hollow steel pipes have similar failure pattern with that of normal strength steel tubes however the deflection at mid span and the residual deformation decrease significantly when subjected to transverse impact loading steel tubes in service may be also subjected to other loading cases such as axial load or internal pressure extensive studies on the performance to transverse impact for circular steel tubes under pre loading have also been conducted in literature zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2002 2008a 2008b conducted both experimental and numerical investigations on the impact resistance performance of circular steel tubes under pre loading in axial direction in these studies they considered the effect of different boundary conditions at the ends of the steel tubes zeinoddini et al 1998 the results demonstrated that the axial pre loading has a great influence on the lateral load level which the members can sustain and more dramatically on the level of the energy which the members can absorb before collapse it was found that axial pre loading has a significant impact on the dynamic characteristics of cylindrical components than quasi static ones zeinoddini et al 1999 experimental study on the transverse impact performance of the axial pre loaded tubes indicated that the axial pre loading has a significant effect on the transverse compressive resistance through numerical simulations the effects of some parameters such as structural damping variations in the pre loading and so on on the response of steel tubes under transverse impact were also investigated zeinoddini et al 2008a in recent years zhi et al 2018 conducted an experimental study on the mechanical properties of axially pre loading circular steel pipes under transverse impact by using a bladder accumulator to compensate the axial compression load it was found that the axial tension can improve the bending resistance and the lateral compressive resistance of steel pipes while the axial compressive stress can reduce the lateral compressive resistance significantly zhang et al 2017 carried out drop weight tests to study the plastic behavior of circular steel tubes subjected to transverse impact the influences of geometrical parameters indenter types and local indentation on the magnitude of the dent zone length and the transverse load were investigated and discussed in addition the relationship between transverse force and the deflection of circular steel tubes under transverse load has also been analyzed in literature in the case of transverse impact loading the local indentation and the global bending interact and researchers initially treated these two modes separately due to the complexity of this interaction wierzbicki and suh 1988 wierzbicki and suh 1988 established the relationship between transverse force and local indentation depth of purely dented steel pipes soares and søreide 1983 proposed a static rigid plastic method for the analysis of global deflection taking into account the influence of finite deflection reid 1985 proposed a definition of specific energy absorbing capacity to evaluate the energy absorption capacity of a pipe under impact load for a component under axial compression some researchers reddy and wall 1988 güden and kavi 2006 also used the concept of specific energy absorption sea to study the energy absorption capacity of ultra light weight cement composite filled pipe in pipe composite structures wang et al 2014 proposed the concept of energy absorption capacity eac based on previous studies in recent years more researchers have concerned with the performance of complicated tubular members or joints under impact loading odina et al 2018 discussed finite element modelling undertaken to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline subjected to external impact loads and confirmed that liner separation is of minor importance qu et al 2015 and qu et al 2014 conducted drop weight tests and numerical simulations on tubular t and k joints and the failure mode and energy conversion relationship were also analyzed comprehensively yang et al 2009 found in their study of pipe on pipe impact in nuclear power and chemical plants that the impact at a specific location at the same speed produced most serious damage to the target pipeline based on previous investigations on the hollow steel pipes wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 studied the lateral impact behavior of cement filled pipe in pipe structures through both experimental test and numerical simulation and they also built a theoretical method for predicting the impact response of the cement composite filled pipes compared with single layer pipelines very few studies on full scale pipe in pipes under transverse impact have been conducted experimentally zheng et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 conducted both experimental and numerical investigations on the overtrawlability of the pipe in pipes it starts with the quasi static indentation tests and the impact tests which reveal the mechanical behavior of pipe in pipes under indentation in addition the author demonstrated that quasi static analysis can replace dynamic analysis to some extent and quasi static process is similar to impact response results sun et al 2019 based on the virtual working principle proposed a purely theoretical model for predicting the indentation of pipe in pipe structures and they further studied the behavior of pipe in pipes at the same time parametric analyses on effects of yield strength ratio wall thickness ratio and outside diameter ratio are conducted therefore impact tests on full scale api 5l x56 submarine pipe in pipes are carried out in this study for comparison single layer submarine pipes with same dimensions and same materials of the outer pipe in pipe in pipes are tested the contribution of the inner pipe in pipe in pipes to the impact resistance is analyzed from the aspects of the impact force time history curve the displacement time history curve the strain time history curve the impact displacement curve and energy dissipation relation additionally a cross section deformation rate r is proposed and the local indentation length of the specimen is divided into three zones based on experimental observation and numerical simulation through such tests the response and failure mechanism of pipe in pipes under impact load can be understood thoroughly 2 impact test 2 1 specimens in the impact tests both pipe in pipe and single layer pipe specimens are fabricated from api 5l x56 submarine pipelines which are used widely in bohai sea of china a total of 8 specimens were prepared and tested by referring to api spec 5l 2012 the specimens are classified into three groups according to their nominal outer diameters d i the detailed information of the specimens is presented in table 1 it is worth pointing out that the specimen number is composed of letters and numbers p denotes pipeline the second letter denotes the section size of the outer tube the third letter denotes the section size of the inner tube and this letter does not exist in a single layer pipe specimen the first number after the last letter represents the type of pipeline 1 stands for single layer pipe 2 stands for pipe in pipe the second letter represents different section sizes as follows a 219 12 b 114 9 c 273 12 7 d 273 11 e 168 3 11 f 273 13 g 325 14 unit mm impact tests were performed on two identical specimens for pha2 to verify the stability of the results the specimens were made of api 5l x56 seamless steel pipe with a length of 2000 mm and two end plates a length of 2000 mm is designed for the specimens because of the space limitation of the test rig the configuration of a pipe in pipe specimen is illustrated in fig 1 tensile tests were conducted on coupons to measure the mechanical properties of api 5l x56 steel material the coupons were cut from the same pipes of the specimens and the fabrication of the coupons satisfied the requirements of api spec 5l 2012 some mechanical properties measured from the experimental tests including young s modulus e poisson s ratio μ yield stress σ y and corresponding yield strain ε y are listed in table 2 the filler of the pipe in pipe is polyurethane elastomer guo 2014 has conducted an experimental study on the compression properties of polyurethane elastomer its mechanical properties young s modulus e p poisson s ratio μ p yield stress σ p and density ρ are shown in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 2 2 2 drop hammer impact tests the drop hammer impact tests were carried out in a specially designed device mainly including guide rails indenter weight blocks lifting device control system and data acquisition system as shown in fig 3 a meanwhile the device is equipped with a data acquisition system produced by ni national instruments to collect high speed analog voltage signal acceleration signal and strain signal synchronously and the voltage signal measured in this test is 5v the impact force time history curves displacement time history curves and strain time history curves of the pipelines were monitored and obtained from the captured signals in the impact tests a wedge shaped indenter was employed to avoid suspension between indenter and pipe wall during impact the size of indenter is shown in fig 3 b the drop hammer is composed of indenter and weight blocks and the impact energy is changed by adjusting the number of weight blocks in the drop hammer impact tests the maximum weight of the drop hammer is 950 kg a total of 11 wt blocks and the drop height is 10m the test parameters are given in table 1 a force sensor is installed inside the hammer head and the signal of the force sensor is input to the ni instrument for signal collection through a dynamic strainometer and the dynamic force time history curve of the whole impact process is obtained through the conversion of electric signal force relationship photron sa x2 high speed camera was used to record the dynamic impact process and the shooting frame rate was 10000fps a special device as shown in fig 3 b is designed to meet the requirements of drop hammer impact tests three point bending scheme is used to clamp the specimen considering the realistic pipe length on the seabed is much longer than 2000 mm the two ends of the pipe specimens are designed to be free in rotation so as to eliminate the boundary constraints to the specimens to implement such idea the clamping of the tested pipe is designed as follows one end of the forceps is pressed against the specimen with a nut so that only rotation is allowed at the other end a gap of 1 mm between the collet and the tube wall is designed to release the constraint to axial slide through such design the lateral displacement of the pipeline can be simulated consistently with actual situation as far as possible the displacement at the point p mid was monitored using high precision resistive displacement transducer due to the high impact speed displacement transducers were arranged at points p left and p right on both sides of the pipeline at the mid span as shown in fig 4 the magnitude of the displacement transducers at points p left and p right is 300 mm and the magnitude of the displacement transducer at point p mid is 250 mm bfh120 3aa strain gauges were used to measure the dynamic strain curves during the tests a total of 10 strain gauges were arranged along the axial direction of the pipe the placement and the directions of the strain gauges are illustrated in fig 4 the locations of the placed strain gauges are selected on the bottom surface of the pipe at the mid span d m w and d m e and at a distance of 400 mm from the mid span u w m l w d w m r w u e m l e m r e and d e 3 test results and discussion 3 1 failure modes a total of 8 specimens subjected to transverse impact were tested by using drop hammer machine during the test the weight the impact speed and the height of the drop hammer were kept unchanged for different specimens the test results reveal that all specimens experience similar deformation process and a coupling of local indentation and overall bending deformation occurs in the tubes forming the failure mechanism of plastic hinge with the increase of pipe diameter and wall thickness the degree of local indentation and global bending decreases for brevity pc1 is selected to analyze the deformation process in details before the drop hammer impact test the high speed camera was in the state to be triggered at the beginning of the impact test the drop hammer fell freely and the laser probe measured two velocity signals at the distance of 100 mm and 50 mm from the sample from which the impact velocity and acceleration were calculated at the same time the speed signal conditioner gives a signal to trigger high speed camera shooting fig 5 demonstrates the deformation process of pc1 specimen under transverse impact load taken by high speed camera at the initial contact of the indenter with the pipeline specimen 0 12 5 ms local indentation appears at the contact location simultaneously the central axis of the steel tube remains horizontal and the bottom of the specimen pmid has almost no deflection as shown in fig 5 a with the increase of local indentation plastic hinge 12 5 16 4 ms formed at the impact position axial sliding began to occur and a coupling of local indentation and global bending deformation is observed as shown in fig 5 b at this stage local indentation is still the main failure mode of the pipeline the displacement transducer at point pmid at the bottom started to monitor displacement value at 12 5 ms and the center axis was offset subsequently 16 4 33 1 ms the size of the plastic dent zones was further enlarged and the local sunken deformation deepened gradually at this stage both the deflection of the specimen and the local sunken deformation reached maximum value as shown in fig 5 c the drop hammer rebounded reversely from the pipe after the global bending deformation reached the maximum as shown in fig 5 d at 37 8 ms the indenter separated from the specimen and the elastic deformation was further recovered the first impact process was completed and the failure mechanism of plastic hinge with a coupling of local indentation and global bending deformation was finally formed as shown in fig 5 e 5 f fig 5 g is the shape of local indentation of the specimen after test it is consistent with the shape of wedge shaped indenter therefore the shape of the dent in the pipe is closely related to the shape of the indenter this observation is also consistent with the conclusion presented by zhang et al 2017 3 2 time history of impact force for single layer pipe specimen the impact force time history curve of pc1 as shown in fig 6 is selected for analysis three stages are classified in the curves in stage i the impact force rises sharply to a certain value in a very short time as soon as the indenter contacts the upper surface of the specimen the axial sliding of the pipe gives rise to a sudden drop in impact force due to boundary conditions after sliding to a certain extent the impact force continues to increase the peak impact force stage i is referred to a vibration stage after the impact force experiences a short period of rapid fluctuations it begins to keep stable and it is now in stage ii a stable stage in reality there will be frictional damping due to contact between the pipe and the seabed and added mass by the presence of water in the pipeline exterior environment therefore the pipeline in service may not experiences a short period of rapid fluctuations when subjected to lateral impact load however such actual situation can not be simulated accurately because of laboratory limitation at present if the water in the pipe is not in a high pressure and the distance from the sea level to the pipe is not large i e shallow sea the effect of the added mass produced by the water both inside the pipe and the exterior environment is relatively slight more comprehensive studies in both experimental tests and finite element simulations by considering the two factors are necessary to be carried out in future study at this stage the impact force decreases very gradually the impact time history curve tends to be flat after stage ii the impact force begins to drop rapidly till to zero and this period is referred to stage iii an unloading stage in stage iii the indenter separates from the specimen because the separation is in a short time the contact between the indenter and the specimen disappears very quickly to cause a sharply decrease of the impact force the above three stages of the impact force with time history were also found by other researchers yousuf et al 2013 remennikov et al 2011 the impact force time history curves of pipe in pipe specimens under transverse impact although they can be still classified into three similar stages like single layer pipe specimen are different in peak impact force and impact duration as shown in fig 7 pha2 1 and pha2 2 are two identical pipe in pipe specimens the impact time history curves of the two specimens are consistent to indicate that accurate results can be obtained from the drop hammer impact test for specimens with same dimensions and materials interestingly the impact force time history curves of the pipe in pipe specimens exhibit a short term stable fluctuation at a certain value of impact force before the end of stage i similar to the curves of corresponding curves of single layer pipe specimens and then increase to a higher peak impact force due to the contribution of the inner pipe the single layer pipe specimen pa1 and the outer diameter of the pipe in pipe specimen pab2 are same from the comparison of the impact force time history curve for the two specimens it is found that pab2 has larger impact peak value higher platform segment and shorter impact time compared to pa1 in another word the resistance to impact for the pipe in pipe is much better such improvement of resistance to impact is definitely attributed to the inner pipe in providing additional stiffness it is noted here that the pipe in pipe specimens were designed without centralizers when centralizers are placed between the inner and the outer pipes they may also provide contributions to the impact resistance if the indenter position is just on the centralizers or very close to the locations of the centralizers because the contributions of centralizers are not considered in the pipe in pipe specimens the resistance performance is underestimated and the evaluation is relatively conservative and safer compared to those of the pipe in pipes with centralizers for single layer pipes including specimens pa1 pc1 and ph1 with different diameters and wall thicknesses such values increase in such list order the impact force time history curves are also different as seen from fig 7 the peak impact force is increased the phase ii is shortened and the impact resistance is improved sequentially in the order of pa1 pc1 and ph1 because the thickness and diameter increase the stiffness is improved and the global bending of the single layer specimen under the transverse impact is reduced and produces smaller deflection a smaller deflection reduces axial sliding of the pipe eventually leading to the shortening of the phase ii for pipe in pipe specimens pfg2 pha2 1 and pha2 2 similar conclusion can be drawn compared with single layer pipe specimens the peak impact force of the pipe in pipe specimens is obviously increased similarly it is also found that the fluctuation section is shortened due to the contribution of the inner tube to the flexural stiffness of the pipes in both global bending of the tube and local bending of the tube wall 3 3 time history of global displacement deflection fig 8 illustrates the global displacement time history curves of different specimens under same transverse impact energy the global displacement includes the deflection of the bottom surface of the pipe at the mid span displacement at point p mid as shown in fig 8 a and the transverse displacement at sides of the pipe at the mid span the average displacement at p left and p right as shown in fig 8 b it is noted here that the instantaneous impact force during the drop hammer test caused the displacement transducers at the point pmid of pde2 and ph1 to fall off therefore the maximum deflections at the bottom surface of the two specimens at the mid span are not detected the global displacement time history curves of the 8 specimens at both the bottom surface and the two sides of the pipe have similar trends including steeply rising phase elastic recovery stage and final deformation stage for brevity the deflection as shown in fig 8 a is selected for analysis all the curves increase steadily to a maximum value impacting process and then they experience a drop stage separating process and elastic recovery stage a stable value when the deflection drops to a minimum value absolute separation time it experiences several fluctuations vibration process and finally it tends to be an unchanged value residual deflection the global displacement time history curves of pa1 single layer pipe and pab2 corresponding pipe in pipe are used to compare the difference of resistance to impact the maximum deflection of pab2 is much smaller than that of pa1 to assume a higher capacity to resist impact loading the separation between the indenter and the pipe of pab2 is faster to show that the stiffness of the pipe in pipe is larger due to the contribution of the inner pipe 3 4 local indentation in the impact test the global deformation at the bottom surface of the specimens at the mid span s g and the transverse local displacement at the impacting location s t were both measured by displacement transducers as shown in fig 9 a after the drop hammer impact tests some cross section parameters of the impact specimen were characterized by the ideal deformation section proposed by zhang et al 2017 fig 9 shows the definitions of the cross section parameters of a pipe after impact test and the parameters include s g and s t as well the maximum diameter d max and minimum diameter d min of the deformed cross section the local dent s l is calculated from the following equation 1 s l s t s g table 3 summarizes the cross section parameters of the specimens after impact tests eq 1 defines the change of the outer diameter of the cross section at the mid span the length of the local dent is defined as the straight line distance between the nearest two points that does not change along the axial curvature of the pipeline rinehart 2003 to reflect the extent of the local deformation wang et al 2014 defined the length of the indentation zone as the position where the indentation exceeds 1 of the pipe diameter s l r 0 0 01 however in the actual test there is a slight deformation at a distance from the dent the lengths identified from the test data are sometimes large and the calculated film strain is small shuai 2010 in this study the local dent is divided into three areas i ii and iii i e the indenter contact area the transition area and the impact area as shown in fig 9 b the film strain of the region i is large and therefore the length of the indentation corresponding to s l 2 half of the maximum depth of the indentation as the boundary between region i and region ii shuai 2010 in this study the cross section deformation rate r is proposed to define region ii and region iii the cross section deformation rate is defined as 2 r s l p 2 s l p 1 y 2 y 1 where s lp1 and s lp2 denote the local indentation depth at point p1 and point p2 respectively and y 1 and y 2 represent the distance from point p1 and point p2 to the middle section of the specimen respectively as shown in fig 9 b r refers to the cross section deformation rate and it represents the change of local dent per unit length the pipe specimen is assumed to have a significant local dent at r 0 01 it is noted that the length of the indentation zone needs to measure the data within a certain length due to the limitation of experimental conditions numerical simulation will be used to determine such length in the following sections it is found from table 3 that the single layer pipe specimens pa1 pc1 ph1 form a deeper indentation profile under transverse impact compared with the pipe in pipe specimens with the same external diameter pab2 pde2 pfg2 pha2 1 pha2 2 and d max and d min change greatly for pa1 d o 219 t 12 pc1 d o 273 t 12 7 and ph1 d o 325 t 14 with different diameters and wall thickness the global deformation and the local indentation of single layer pipelines decrease gradually with the increase of pipe diameter and wall thickness from fig 7 and table 3 it is also found that pc1 d o 273 t 12 7 has a much higher impact force during the only action of the outer tube compared to pde2 d o 273 t 11 which indicates that the wall thickness has a great influence on the impact resistance 3 5 strain response the strain time history curves at different positions on the surface of the specimens under transverse impact tensile strain has positive value and compressive strain has negative value are plotted in fig 10 due to large deformation of the specimens under transverse impact load some strain gauges are damaged m r w d m w and d m e on specimen pa1 d m e and d m w on specimen pab2 d m e on specimen pc1 strain gauges d m e and m r w on specimen pa1 peeled off from the tube surface due to violent vibration of the specimen during the impacting process as shown in fig 10 the strain of the characteristic points on the surface of most specimens exceeds the yield strain additionally the following summaries can be obtained 1 except for local dent areas the bottom surface of the specimen at the mid span d m e d m w d w and d e deforms firstly and the strain at this location has largest value the strains at d m e and d m w show compressive deformation at the initial impact stage and then they change to positive value assumed as tensile deformation till the tensile strains reach maximum value this phenomenon is analyzed with the help of the impact process of the steel pipe in the tests at the initial contact of the indenter with the pipe at 12 5 ms local indentation appears at the contact location simultaneously the central axis of the steel tube remains horizontal there is no large global bending deformation at this time the appearance of the local dent causes a transient elastic compressive deformation at the bottom of the pipe in the following process the global bending deformation increases gradually and the tensile deformation produced by the global bending exceeds the elastic compressive deformation finally showing as tensile strain at this location 2 the strain at a distance of 400 mm from the mid span is analyzed as shown in fig 5 b the deformation at this position appears as local dent and global bending at 12 5 16 4 ms due to the occurrence of local dent deformation strain gauges at u w and u e begin to monitor tensile strain at 14 2 ms the strains at those points increase gradually to a maximum value 3 with further development of local dent and global bending deformation the deformation of the cross section causes both sides of the pipe m l w m l e m r w and m r e to exhibit compressive deformation table 4 summarizes the maximum strain and the corresponding average strain rate to evaluate the effect of impact load on the deformation rate at different locations the strain time history curves show that the deformation of the tube is symmetrical about the mid span section in length direction m l w and m l e are symmetric positions so are m r e and m r w d m e and d m w table 4 shows that measuring point d m w the bottom surface of the specimen at mid span has the largest average strain rate followed by point d w then points m l w and u w it indicates that the bottom of the specimen at the mid span reaches the final failure state firstly due to maximum bending moment is located at this cross section the strain rate decreases gradually from the mid span to the endplates 3 6 impact force deflection curves the impact force versus deflection mean value of displacements at pleft and pright curves of the specimens under transverse impact are plotted in fig 11 it is noted here that the displacements at the bottom mid span of specimens pde2 and ph1 were not measured completely in the whole impacting process so the deflection in the curves is represented by an average of the displacements on both sides of the specimens at the mid span the impact force deflection curves have similar changing process at the initial stage of the collision the impact force increases rapidly to a local peak value at this stage the deflection is very tiny which implies that the deformation is mainly dominated by local indentation as shown in fig 5 a after that the axial sliding of the specimens causes the impact force to have a drop the impact force continues to increase to the peak impact force after the sliding of the specimens stops after the impact force reaches the peak value the deflection approaches gradually to the maximum value with the absorption of the impact energy till the drop hammer stops moving downward when the specimens start to rebound due to elastic recovery the deflection begins to decrease and the impact force decreases to zero rapidly due to the separation between the indenter and the pipe at the zero value of the impact force i e complete separation between the indenter and the pipe a residual deflection is found and it is mainly the global residual deformation comparative analysis was performed on single layer and pipe in pipe specimens with same outer diameter of 219 mm as shown in fig 11 a for pipe in pipe specimen pab2 the indenter acts on the outer pipe firstly in the impact process and the initial impact force of pab2 is almost same as that of pa1 after the deflection is greater than 5 mm contact between the outer pipe and the inner pipe occurs and the inner pipe begins to resist the impact together with the outer pipe due to such collaboration of the two pipes pab2 sustains a higher peak impact force than pa1 simultaneously the collaboration between the outer and the inner pipes also improves the stiffness and reduces the deformation of the specimens and it can be observed from fig 11 a that the residual deflection of pab2 after impact is much smaller than the corresponding result of pa1 the three specimens as shown in fig 11 b pc1 pde2 and pfg2 have same outer diameter of 273 mm and different values of thickness the thickness values of pc1 and pfg2 are much close 12 7 mm and 13 mm respectively while pde2 has a smaller thickness of 11 mm it is found from fig 11 b that the initial impact forces of pc1 and pfg2 are basically the same while the initial impact force of pde2 is significantly smaller before a deflection of 5 mm at this stage the outer pipe of the pipe in pipe specimens pde2 and pfg2 does not contact with the inner pipe and all the impacting load is sustained by the outer pipe the performance of the specimens is only determined by the stiffness of the outer pipe because the diameter and thickness of the single layer pipe pc1 are almost same to those of the outer pipe for the pipe in pipe specimen pfg2 the performance of the two specimens is quite similar however pde2 has a smaller thickness and the outer pipe has a much lower stiffness compared to the other two specimens and hence its performance to impact is weaker when the outer pipe contacts with the inner pipe the contribution of the inner pipe in resisting the impact load works and the collaboration between the outer and the inner pipes produce a much higher resistance to impact for specimen pfg2 for pipe in pipe specimen pde2 its performance of resistance to the impact load is very close to that of the single layer specimen pc1 although the wall thickness of the outer pipe is smaller than the wall thickness of pc1 pde2 can achieve an almost equivalent performance through the collaboration of the outer and the inner pipes in resisting impact load in fig 11 c three specimens ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 have same diameter of 325 mm between the outer pipe of the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 and the single layer pipe specimen ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 have identical geometry and material and they experienced same impacting action to verify the consistency of the tested results the impact force deflection curves of the two specimens in fig 11 c are almost coincident which indicates that the impact test can produce stable results for same specimens similarly it can be also observed from the comparison of the curves that the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 have much higher resistance to impact compared to the single layer pipe specimen ph1 because they can sustain a much higher impact force and have a much smaller residual deflection after impact in addition as mentioned previously a stable phase stage ii can be found in the impact force deflection curves for the three specimens under transverse impact wang et al 2013 used the impact force corresponding to the platform segment stable phase in the impact time history curves as the impact bearing capacity wang et al 2014 introduced a post peak mean force p m as defined in the following equation 3 p m s o s g p d s s g s o where s o denotes the global displacement when the impact force reaches its maximum value p max p is the impact force and p m represents the equivalent impact force s o is defined as the displacement at the beginning of the stable phase from eq 3 the post peak mean forces of all specimens are calculated and listed in table 3 for details 3 7 energy dissipation in the analysis of failure mode and strain time history curves of the specimens under transverse impact it is found that all the specimens have similar failure mechanism with a failure mode of coupled local dent and global bending deformation plastic hinge is found to be distributed around the local dent such failure mechanism indicates that the total impact energy is dissipated in two forms i e the energy absorbed by global bending deformation and the energy consumed by local dent in calculating the energy dissipation the current study ignores the energy dissipated in the following mechanisms 1 the energy dissipated by the frictions including the friction between the specimens and the clamps and the friction between the specimens and the indenter during the impact process 2 the rebound of the drop weight 3 the energy dissipated due to heat and noise during the impact process based on the above assumptions the total impact energy e i is calculated easily from the kinetic energy of the drop weight as follow 4 e i m d v 0 2 2 where m d is the mass of the drop hammer and v 0 is the velocity when the drop hammer contacts the pipe specimen the energy dissipated by global bending e g is calculated by integrating the impact force displacement at the bottom of the specimen at the mid span deflection curve table 5 summarizes the impact energy e i of different specimens and the energy dissipated by global deformation e g in addition since the displacements at bottom surface of some of the specimens at the mid span were not collected during the impact process the dissipated energy e s calculated by integrating the impact force displacement at pleft is also calculated and it is illustrated in fig 12 a together with e g fig 12 b shows the ratio of the total impact energy e i to the energy dissipated by global deformation e g or e s e g e i e s e i it is found from fig 12 a and table 5 that pipe in pipe specimens have a lower value of e g due to the presence of the inner tube in reducing the global deformation compared to single layer pipelines based on the above assumptions with the reduction of e g the energy dissipated by local dents e i increases and more energy during the impact is consumed by local dent deformation fig 12 b demonstrates that compared to single layer pipes pipe in pipe specimens have a lower value of the ratio of e g e i and e s e i and such result also indicates that more energy is dissipated by local dent in pipe in pipe specimens this conclusion is also verified from the results of s g for single layer pipe and pipe in pipe specimens in table 5 in which it is easily found that s g of pipe in pipe specimens is lower than the corresponding one of single layer pipe specimens eac is a dimensionless parameter used to reflect the intrinsic energy absorption capacity of a pipe specimen under transverse impact load its definition is listed as follow and it is used in this study to evaluate the inherent energy absorption capacity of the pipe specimens 5 e a c e i m p s t where e i refers to the total energy during the total impact process m p denotes the total weight of the specimen and s t represents the displacement of the contact position between the indenter and the specimen table 5 lists the energy absorption properties eac for all specimens the data of the first five specimens pa1 pab2 pc1 pde2 pfg2 show that the energy absorption performance of the pipe in pipes is higher than that of the single layer pipelines indicating that the pipe in pipes structure has good impact performance comparing the eacs of the last three specimens it is found that the eac of the single layer pipe ph1 is larger than the eac of the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 the main reason for this phenomenon is that both the local indentation and the global bending deformation of ph1 are small compared with the single layer pipe the weight of the pipe in pipe specimens play a leading role in the eac 4 numerical investigation 4 1 finite element modelling to investigate the impact resistance of pipe specimens under lateral impact load in a more comprehensive understanding finite element fe models of both single layer pipe and pipe in pipe specimens are established using the abaqus explicit module abaqus 2014 a schematic view of the fe model is shown in fig 13 in the fe modelling the stress strain curves of x56 steel obtained from the tensile tests for the coupons are used to define the material properties richardson and wisheart 1996 proved that the strain rate effect is negligible if the initial impact velocity v o 10 m s during impact loading the yield strength and the ultimate strength of steel material increase with increasing strain rate jones 1997 in this study cowper symonds model is used to determine the yield strength of steel material at different strain rates and it is calculated in the following equation 6 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 p where σ dy refers to the dynamic yield stress of the steel σ y denotes the static yield stress of the steel ε represents the strain rate for steel and d and p are the material constants in this study d and p adopted the empirical values proposed by abramowicz and jones 1984 which were 6844 s 1 and 3 91 respectively the establishment of the fe model is as consistent as possible with the actual situations in the impact tests including the main parts such as the drop hammer the clamping system and the spindle the crushable foam and crushable foam hardening options in the property module of abaqus is used to define the plastic behavior of polyurethane elastomer the specific material parameters are shown in table 2 the contact between the polyurethane elastomer and the steel pipe in the finite element modelling is simulated through tie constraint in which it is assumed that no separation occurs between the two interfaces during the impacting process such assumption was verified by hang 2012 through experimental study no peeling was found between the polyurethane layer and the steel pipe through observation to the cut section of the specimens after tests the feasibility of using tie constraint in the finite element modelling can be also proved from the observations to the deformed section of the tested specimens in this study as a typical view in fig 14 b clearly no separation between the polyurethane elastomer and the steel pipe was observed in fig 14 b and the tie constraint is also proved to be suitable in the meshing scheme all the parts are discretized into mesh by using 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r the deformation of the drop hammer during the test is negligible and hence the indenter and the weight blocks are defined as rigid bodies to improve the computing efficiency to improve the calculation accuracy and to consider the computing efficiency transitional grid technique is used to refine the contact area between the indenter and the specimen during the drop hammer impact experiment one end of the clamp uses a nut to press the specimen so that it can only rotate the other end clamp has a gap of 1 mm to the pipe wall the pipeline can slide axially during the impact process therefore tie constraints were used to define one end of pipeline and clamp in the fe model and the other end clamp has a gap of 1 mm to the pipe wall both the friction between the indenter and the pipe and the friction between the pipe and the clamp are considered in the fe analysis the contact surface properties are defined as follows hard contact is defined in normal direction coulomb friction is adopted in tangential direction and the friction coefficient is 0 15 because the spindle between the supporting frame and the clamping system is lubricated with oil the friction between them is negligible during the impact process the pipe specimens undergo bending deformation due to the transverse impact which may result in hourglass energy the hourglass can be controlled to be within 5 by refining the grid during the calculation 4 2 verification of fe model to verify the accuracy of the fe models the numerical results are benchmarked with the experimental results presented and the comparison is illustrated in fig 14 for brevity single layer pipe specimen ph1 and pipe in pipe specimen pha2 1 are selected for analysis the failure modes of the two specimens obtained both from experimental tests and fe simulations are shown in fig 14 a and b the fe simulations on the final residual deformations of both single layer pipe and pipe in pipe agree very well with experimental observations even for the pipe in pipe specimen pha2 1 the contact between the outer pipe and the inner pipe is also simulated accurately as shown in fig 14 b the time history curves of displacement and impact force and the impact force displacement curves of specimens ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 are also compared between fe simulations and experimental tests as shown in fig 15 a 15 i because pha2 1 and pha2 2 are identical pipes the fe model is named with pha2 comparing the impact force time history curves of ph1 and pha2 1 the fe results of the two pipeline specimens have reasonable consistency with the experimental results it is found from a partial enlarged view in fig 15 a that the impact force time history curves of the fe model have no obvious descent stage in the initial stage of the impact while the experimental results have significant descent stage the main reason is that the violent fluctuations in the actual test cause the impact force to decrease instantaneously whereas the boundary conditions in the fe simulation are idealized so that the fluctuation is reduced and there is no obvious descent stage the fe model predicts accurately the displacement time history curves of ph1 and pha2 1 because the fe results are basically consistent with the experimental results as shown in fig 15 b and c during the rebound phase the fe results deviate from the experimental results which may be caused by the deviation between the fe model and the experimental results during the vibration phase the predicted impact force displacement curves and strain time history curves by fe simulations are very close to the corresponding experimental results as shown in fig 15 d 15 i table 6 summarizes the fe results and the comparison between fe and test results in manner of a ratio between them although the loads in the tests are not representative of actual subsea impact due to laboratory limitations the fe predictions agree with the experimental results reasonably well the accuracy of the presented fe modelling technique is hence verified to be reliable in assessing the behavior of pipelines under impact load 4 3 analysis of the length of local indentation since the accuracy of the fe model is verified it is used to analyze the length of the local indentation for the specimens under transverse impact the local indentation of the pipe specimen is divided into three stages as mentioned previously and the local indentation area of the different impact specimens is shown in fig 16 the results in fig 16 a show that the pipe in pipe specimen pab2 has a much smaller value of both depth and length of the local indentation compared to the single layer pipe pa1 similar conclusions can be drawn for the specimens pc1 pde2 and pfg2 in fig 16 b and for the specimens ph1 pha2 in fig 16 c additionally it is also found from fig 16 that pa1 and pab2 begin to show significant local indentation at a distance of 477 mm and 400 mm from the mid span and pc1 pcd2 and pfg2 begin to show significant local indentation at 625 mm 562 mm and 500 mm from the mid span whereas for ph1 and pha2 such distance is about 740 mm and 598 mm from the mid span the boundary of regions ii r 0 01 and iii r 0 01 is classified according to a critical value of local deformation rate i e r 0 01 as seen in fig 16 the value of s l r 0 is very close to be 0 when r 0 01 region iii and it represents a very slight local indentation when r 0 01 the value of s l r 0 increases quickly which indicates the local indentation has a significant increase therefore r 0 01 is used to classify regions ii and iii and it represents an index of local deformation rate both the diameter and the wall thickness increase from the specimens in fig 16 a to the specimens in fig 16 c such phenomenon may be due to the following reason with increase of the radius and wall thickness of the pipes the global bending deformation of the specimens decreases gradually and local indentation becomes larger and its area expands 5 conclusions the impact resistance of the pipe in pipe specimens under transverse impact load is studied through both experimental tests and numerical simulations from the obtained results the following conclusions are drawn 1 for both single layer pipes and pipe in pipe specimens under impact load similar failure mechanism is found in them which includes a coupling residual deformation of both local indentation and global bending plastic hinges around the local indentation are all observed in the two types of pipes after impact 2 due to the contribution of the inner pipe a pipe in pipe specimen has an efficient improvement in resistance to impact compared to a corresponding single layer pipe such improvement assumes a higher value of peak impact force a shorter impacting time and a smaller residual deformation 3 a cross sectional deformation rate r is proposed in this study the local indentation is divided into three stages evaluated from two parameters of r and s l 2 the indenter contact area the transition area and the local dent impact area comparing the length and the depth of the local indentation area the local indentation range of the pipe in pipe specimen is reduced and hence the impact resistance is increased due to the existence of the inner tube 4 the post peak mean force p m and the energy absorption capacity eac parameters are also used to evaluate the impact resistance the results show that the energy absorption performance of the pipe in pipe specimen is higher than that of the single layer pipe specimen indicating that the pipe in pipe system has better impact performance credit authorship

21867,the performance of api 5l x56 submarine pipes subjected to transverse impact is investigated through both drop weight impact tests and finite element simulations to study the improvement of resistance to transverse impact for pipe in pipe specimens corresponding single layer pipe specimens under impacting load were also tested for comparison from the experimental tests the failure mode the impact force time history curve the displacement time history curve the strain time history curve and the impact force displacement curve of all specimens were obtained the pipe in pipe specimens are found to have superior performance to resist impacting loading compared to single layer specimens because smaller global bending deformation and local indentation were observed in them in addition the cross section deformation rate r was proposed and the local indentation length of the specimen was divided into three zones based on experimental observation and numerical simulation a comprehensive comparison of the length and the depth of local indentation in the pipe in pipe specimens shows that the local indentation decreases and the impact resistance increases due to the presence of the inner tube finally the post peak mean force p m and the energy absorption capacity eac were used to evaluate the energy dissipation mechanism of different specimens the results also

observed frequently due to the scouring of sea water pilkey et al 1995 aljaroudi et al 2015 during service period the hanging pipelines may suffer from accidental impact loads such as the ship collision anchoring and falling objects serious damage was found in the pipelines after experiencing impacting load it is necessary to further understand the impact characteristics of submarine pipelines and study the actual reinforcement methods zeinoddini et al 2013 pipe in pipe systems are being used extensively in the design of high pressure and high temperature streamlines due to its excellent thermal insulation performance karampour et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 compared with single layer pipes pipe in pipes have an interaction between the inner tube and the outer tube during a collision event besides having all the characteristics of single layer pipes therefore it is of vital significance to study the dynamic characteristics of submarine pipelines under impact loading for design and evaluation purposes circular steel tubes are the most common component in ocean steel structures many researchers have studied the transverse impact resistance of circular steel tubes in recent years soares and søreide 1983 firstly studied the impact resistance of circular steel tubes and proposed a rigid plastic analytical formulation applicable to steel tube components under transverse impact loading subsequently jones et al conducted transverse impact tests and theoretical research on fully clamped circular steel tubes they presented a theoretical rigid plastic procedure which allows the local or denting deformation to continue during the global deformation phase jones et al 1992 to study further the failure mode of steel pipes jones and shen 1992 carried out drop hammer impact tests on 130 steel pipes and studied the influence of different impact positions on the impact resistance of pipes however the ideal condition of full clamping was not acquired in their tests and an overestimation of the input energy required for the failure may be produced to solve this problem jones and birch 1997 designed a special structure to achieve full clamping at pipe ends and they used such structure to study the effect of different impact locations on the impact performance the critical values for the two failure energies were also obtained for a range of internal gas pressures in addition chen and shen 1998 studied systematically the impact failure of fully clamped steel tubes taking into account the influences of different tube shapes impact positions and boundary conditions on the performance of steel tubes subjected to transverse mass impact apart from clamped boundary conditions ong and lu 1996 studied experimentally the collapse load of steel tubes under different support conditions and a test program was carried out to determine the collapse load and energy absorbing capacity li et al 2019 conducted experiments and parametric study through finite element analysis on the performance of ultra high strength steel uhss hollow tubes under low velocity transverse impact loading the parametric study showed that uhss hollow steel pipes have similar failure pattern with that of normal strength steel tubes however the deflection at mid span and the residual deformation decrease significantly when subjected to transverse impact loading steel tubes in service may be also subjected to other loading cases such as axial load or internal pressure extensive studies on the performance to transverse impact for circular steel tubes under pre loading have also been conducted in literature zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2002 2008a 2008b conducted both experimental and numerical investigations on the impact resistance performance of circular steel tubes under pre loading in axial direction in these studies they considered the effect of different boundary conditions at the ends of the steel tubes zeinoddini et al 1998 the results demonstrated that the axial pre loading has a great influence on the lateral load level which the members can sustain and more dramatically on the level of the energy which the members can absorb before collapse it was found that axial pre loading has a significant impact on the dynamic characteristics of cylindrical components than quasi static ones zeinoddini et al 1999 experimental study on the transverse impact performance of the axial pre loaded tubes indicated that the axial pre loading has a significant effect on the transverse compressive resistance through numerical simulations the effects of some parameters such as structural damping variations in the pre loading and so on on the response of steel tubes under transverse impact were also investigated zeinoddini et al 2008a in recent years zhi et al 2018 conducted an experimental study on the mechanical properties of axially pre loading circular steel pipes under transverse impact by using a bladder accumulator to compensate the axial compression load it was found that the axial tension can improve the bending resistance and the lateral compressive resistance of steel pipes while the axial compressive stress can reduce the lateral compressive resistance significantly zhang et al 2017 carried out drop weight tests to study the plastic behavior of circular steel tubes subjected to transverse impact the influences of geometrical parameters indenter types and local indentation on the magnitude of the dent zone length and the transverse load were investigated and discussed in addition the relationship between transverse force and the deflection of circular steel tubes under transverse load has also been analyzed in literature in the case of transverse impact loading the local indentation and the global bending interact and researchers initially treated these two modes separately due to the complexity of this interaction wierzbicki and suh 1988 wierzbicki and suh 1988 established the relationship between transverse force and local indentation depth of purely dented steel pipes soares and søreide 1983 proposed a static rigid plastic method for the analysis of global deflection taking into account the influence of finite deflection reid 1985 proposed a definition of specific energy absorbing capacity to evaluate the energy absorption capacity of a pipe under impact load for a component under axial compression some researchers reddy and wall 1988 güden and kavi 2006 also used the concept of specific energy absorption sea to study the energy absorption capacity of ultra light weight cement composite filled pipe in pipe composite structures wang et al 2014 proposed the concept of energy absorption capacity eac based on previous studies in recent years more researchers have concerned with the performance of complicated tubular members or joints under impact loading odina et al 2018 discussed finite element modelling undertaken to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline subjected to external impact loads and confirmed that liner separation is of minor importance qu et al 2015 and qu et al 2014 conducted drop weight tests and numerical simulations on tubular t and k joints and the failure mode and energy conversion relationship were also analyzed comprehensively yang et al 2009 found in their study of pipe on pipe impact in nuclear power and chemical plants that the impact at a specific location at the same speed produced most serious damage to the target pipeline based on previous investigations on the hollow steel pipes wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 studied the lateral impact behavior of cement filled pipe in pipe structures through both experimental test and numerical simulation and they also built a theoretical method for predicting the impact response of the cement composite filled pipes compared with single layer pipelines very few studies on full scale pipe in pipes under transverse impact have been conducted experimentally zheng et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 conducted both experimental and numerical investigations on the overtrawlability of the pipe in pipes it starts with the quasi static indentation tests and the impact tests which reveal the mechanical behavior of pipe in pipes under indentation in addition the author demonstrated that quasi static analysis can replace dynamic analysis to some extent and quasi static process is similar to impact response results sun et al 2019 based on the virtual working principle proposed a purely theoretical model for predicting the indentation of pipe in pipe structures and they further studied the behavior of pipe in pipes at the same time parametric analyses on effects of yield strength ratio wall thickness ratio and outside diameter ratio are conducted therefore impact tests on full scale api 5l x56 submarine pipe in pipes are carried out in this study for comparison single layer submarine pipes with same dimensions and same materials of the outer pipe in pipe in pipes are tested the contribution of the inner pipe in pipe in pipes to the impact resistance is analyzed from the aspects of the impact force time history curve the displacement time history curve the strain time history curve the impact displacement curve and energy dissipation relation additionally a cross section deformation rate r is proposed and the local indentation length of the specimen is divided into three zones based on experimental observation and numerical simulation through such tests the response and failure mechanism of pipe in pipes under impact load can be understood thoroughly 2 impact test 2 1 specimens in the impact tests both pipe in pipe and single layer pipe specimens are fabricated from api 5l x56 submarine pipelines which are used widely in bohai sea of china a total of 8 specimens were prepared and tested by referring to api spec 5l 2012 the specimens are classified into three groups according to their nominal outer diameters d i the detailed information of the specimens is presented in table 1 it is worth pointing out that the specimen number is composed of letters and numbers p denotes pipeline the second letter denotes the section size of the outer tube the third letter denotes the section size of the inner tube and this letter does not exist in a single layer pipe specimen the first number after the last letter represents the type of pipeline 1 stands for single layer pipe 2 stands for pipe in pipe the second letter represents different section sizes as follows a 219 12 b 114 9 c 273 12 7 d 273 11 e 168 3 11 f 273 13 g 325 14 unit mm impact tests were performed on two identical specimens for pha2 to verify the stability of the results the specimens were made of api 5l x56 seamless steel pipe with a length of 2000 mm and two end plates a length of 2000 mm is designed for the specimens because of the space limitation of the test rig the configuration of a pipe in pipe specimen is illustrated in fig 1 tensile tests were conducted on coupons to measure the mechanical properties of api 5l x56 steel material the coupons were cut from the same pipes of the specimens and the fabrication of the coupons satisfied the requirements of api spec 5l 2012 some mechanical properties measured from the experimental tests including young s modulus e poisson s ratio μ yield stress σ y and corresponding yield strain ε y are listed in table 2 the filler of the pipe in pipe is polyurethane elastomer guo 2014 has conducted an experimental study on the compression properties of polyurethane elastomer its mechanical properties young s modulus e p poisson s ratio μ p yield stress σ p and density ρ are shown in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 2 2 2 drop hammer impact tests the drop hammer impact tests were carried out in a specially designed device mainly including guide rails indenter weight blocks lifting device control system and data acquisition system as shown in fig 3 a meanwhile the device is equipped with a data acquisition system produced by ni national instruments to collect high speed analog voltage signal acceleration signal and strain signal synchronously and the voltage signal measured in this test is 5v the impact force time history curves displacement time history curves and strain time history curves of the pipelines were monitored and obtained from the captured signals in the impact tests a wedge shaped indenter was employed to avoid suspension between indenter and pipe wall during impact the size of indenter is shown in fig 3 b the drop hammer is composed of indenter and weight blocks and the impact energy is changed by adjusting the number of weight blocks in the drop hammer impact tests the maximum weight of the drop hammer is 950 kg a total of 11 wt blocks and the drop height is 10m the test parameters are given in table 1 a force sensor is installed inside the hammer head and the signal of the force sensor is input to the ni instrument for signal collection through a dynamic strainometer and the dynamic force time history curve of the whole impact process is obtained through the conversion of electric signal force relationship photron sa x2 high speed camera was used to record the dynamic impact process and the shooting frame rate was 10000fps a special device as shown in fig 3 b is designed to meet the requirements of drop hammer impact tests three point bending scheme is used to clamp the specimen considering the realistic pipe length on the seabed is much longer than 2000 mm the two ends of the pipe specimens are designed to be free in rotation so as to eliminate the boundary constraints to the specimens to implement such idea the clamping of the tested pipe is designed as follows one end of the forceps is pressed against the specimen with a nut so that only rotation is allowed at the other end a gap of 1 mm between the collet and the tube wall is designed to release the constraint to axial slide through such design the lateral displacement of the pipeline can be simulated consistently with actual situation as far as possible the displacement at the point p mid was monitored using high precision resistive displacement transducer due to the high impact speed displacement transducers were arranged at points p left and p right on both sides of the pipeline at the mid span as shown in fig 4 the magnitude of the displacement transducers at points p left and p right is 300 mm and the magnitude of the displacement transducer at point p mid is 250 mm bfh120 3aa strain gauges were used to measure the dynamic strain curves during the tests a total of 10 strain gauges were arranged along the axial direction of the pipe the placement and the directions of the strain gauges are illustrated in fig 4 the locations of the placed strain gauges are selected on the bottom surface of the pipe at the mid span d m w and d m e and at a distance of 400 mm from the mid span u w m l w d w m r w u e m l e m r e and d e 3 test results and discussion 3 1 failure modes a total of 8 specimens subjected to transverse impact were tested by using drop hammer machine during the test the weight the impact speed and the height of the drop hammer were kept unchanged for different specimens the test results reveal that all specimens experience similar deformation process and a coupling of local indentation and overall bending deformation occurs in the tubes forming the failure mechanism of plastic hinge with the increase of pipe diameter and wall thickness the degree of local indentation and global bending decreases for brevity pc1 is selected to analyze the deformation process in details before the drop hammer impact test the high speed camera was in the state to be triggered at the beginning of the impact test the drop hammer fell freely and the laser probe measured two velocity signals at the distance of 100 mm and 50 mm from the sample from which the impact velocity and acceleration were calculated at the same time the speed signal conditioner gives a signal to trigger high speed camera shooting fig 5 demonstrates the deformation process of pc1 specimen under transverse impact load taken by high speed camera at the initial contact of the indenter with the pipeline specimen 0 12 5 ms local indentation appears at the contact location simultaneously the central axis of the steel tube remains horizontal and the bottom of the specimen pmid has almost no deflection as shown in fig 5 a with the increase of local indentation plastic hinge 12 5 16 4 ms formed at the impact position axial sliding began to occur and a coupling of local indentation and global bending deformation is observed as shown in fig 5 b at this stage local indentation is still the main failure mode of the pipeline the displacement transducer at point pmid at the bottom started to monitor displacement value at 12 5 ms and the center axis was offset subsequently 16 4 33 1 ms the size of the plastic dent zones was further enlarged and the local sunken deformation deepened gradually at this stage both the deflection of the specimen and the local sunken deformation reached maximum value as shown in fig 5 c the drop hammer rebounded reversely from the pipe after the global bending deformation reached the maximum as shown in fig 5 d at 37 8 ms the indenter separated from the specimen and the elastic deformation was further recovered the first impact process was completed and the failure mechanism of plastic hinge with a coupling of local indentation and global bending deformation was finally formed as shown in fig 5 e 5 f fig 5 g is the shape of local indentation of the specimen after test it is consistent with the shape of wedge shaped indenter therefore the shape of the dent in the pipe is closely related to the shape of the indenter this observation is also consistent with the conclusion presented by zhang et al 2017 3 2 time history of impact force for single layer pipe specimen the impact force time history curve of pc1 as shown in fig 6 is selected for analysis three stages are classified in the curves in stage i the impact force rises sharply to a certain value in a very short time as soon as the indenter contacts the upper surface of the specimen the axial sliding of the pipe gives rise to a sudden drop in impact force due to boundary conditions after sliding to a certain extent the impact force continues to increase the peak impact force stage i is referred to a vibration stage after the impact force experiences a short period of rapid fluctuations it begins to keep stable and it is now in stage ii a stable stage in reality there will be frictional damping due to contact between the pipe and the seabed and added mass by the presence of water in the pipeline exterior environment therefore the pipeline in service may not experiences a short period of rapid fluctuations when subjected to lateral impact load however such actual situation can not be simulated accurately because of laboratory limitation at present if the water in the pipe is not in a high pressure and the distance from the sea level to the pipe is not large i e shallow sea the effect of the added mass produced by the water both inside the pipe and the exterior environment is relatively slight more comprehensive studies in both experimental tests and finite element simulations by considering the two factors are necessary to be carried out in future study at this stage the impact force decreases very gradually the impact time history curve tends to be flat after stage ii the impact force begins to drop rapidly till to zero and this period is referred to stage iii an unloading stage in stage iii the indenter separates from the specimen because the separation is in a short time the contact between the indenter and the specimen disappears very quickly to cause a sharply decrease of the impact force the above three stages of the impact force with time history were also found by other researchers yousuf et al 2013 remennikov et al 2011 the impact force time history curves of pipe in pipe specimens under transverse impact although they can be still classified into three similar stages like single layer pipe specimen are different in peak impact force and impact duration as shown in fig 7 pha2 1 and pha2 2 are two identical pipe in pipe specimens the impact time history curves of the two specimens are consistent to indicate that accurate results can be obtained from the drop hammer impact test for specimens with same dimensions and materials interestingly the impact force time history curves of the pipe in pipe specimens exhibit a short term stable fluctuation at a certain value of impact force before the end of stage i similar to the curves of corresponding curves of single layer pipe specimens and then increase to a higher peak impact force due to the contribution of the inner pipe the single layer pipe specimen pa1 and the outer diameter of the pipe in pipe specimen pab2 are same from the comparison of the impact force time history curve for the two specimens it is found that pab2 has larger impact peak value higher platform segment and shorter impact time compared to pa1 in another word the resistance to impact for the pipe in pipe is much better such improvement of resistance to impact is definitely attributed to the inner pipe in providing additional stiffness it is noted here that the pipe in pipe specimens were designed without centralizers when centralizers are placed between the inner and the outer pipes they may also provide contributions to the impact resistance if the indenter position is just on the centralizers or very close to the locations of the centralizers because the contributions of centralizers are not considered in the pipe in pipe specimens the resistance performance is underestimated and the evaluation is relatively conservative and safer compared to those of the pipe in pipes with centralizers for single layer pipes including specimens pa1 pc1 and ph1 with different diameters and wall thicknesses such values increase in such list order the impact force time history curves are also different as seen from fig 7 the peak impact force is increased the phase ii is shortened and the impact resistance is improved sequentially in the order of pa1 pc1 and ph1 because the thickness and diameter increase the stiffness is improved and the global bending of the single layer specimen under the transverse impact is reduced and produces smaller deflection a smaller deflection reduces axial sliding of the pipe eventually leading to the shortening of the phase ii for pipe in pipe specimens pfg2 pha2 1 and pha2 2 similar conclusion can be drawn compared with single layer pipe specimens the peak impact force of the pipe in pipe specimens is obviously increased similarly it is also found that the fluctuation section is shortened due to the contribution of the inner tube to the flexural stiffness of the pipes in both global bending of the tube and local bending of the tube wall 3 3 time history of global displacement deflection fig 8 illustrates the global displacement time history curves of different specimens under same transverse impact energy the global displacement includes the deflection of the bottom surface of the pipe at the mid span displacement at point p mid as shown in fig 8 a and the transverse displacement at sides of the pipe at the mid span the average displacement at p left and p right as shown in fig 8 b it is noted here that the instantaneous impact force during the drop hammer test caused the displacement transducers at the point pmid of pde2 and ph1 to fall off therefore the maximum deflections at the bottom surface of the two specimens at the mid span are not detected the global displacement time history curves of the 8 specimens at both the bottom surface and the two sides of the pipe have similar trends including steeply rising phase elastic recovery stage and final deformation stage for brevity the deflection as shown in fig 8 a is selected for analysis all the curves increase steadily to a maximum value impacting process and then they experience a drop stage separating process and elastic recovery stage a stable value when the deflection drops to a minimum value absolute separation time it experiences several fluctuations vibration process and finally it tends to be an unchanged value residual deflection the global displacement time history curves of pa1 single layer pipe and pab2 corresponding pipe in pipe are used to compare the difference of resistance to impact the maximum deflection of pab2 is much smaller than that of pa1 to assume a higher capacity to resist impact loading the separation between the indenter and the pipe of pab2 is faster to show that the stiffness of the pipe in pipe is larger due to the contribution of the inner pipe 3 4 local indentation in the impact test the global deformation at the bottom surface of the specimens at the mid span s g and the transverse local displacement at the impacting location s t were both measured by displacement transducers as shown in fig 9 a after the drop hammer impact tests some cross section parameters of the impact specimen were characterized by the ideal deformation section proposed by zhang et al 2017 fig 9 shows the definitions of the cross section parameters of a pipe after impact test and the parameters include s g and s t as well the maximum diameter d max and minimum diameter d min of the deformed cross section the local dent s l is calculated from the following equation 1 s l s t s g table 3 summarizes the cross section parameters of the specimens after impact tests eq 1 defines the change of the outer diameter of the cross section at the mid span the length of the local dent is defined as the straight line distance between the nearest two points that does not change along the axial curvature of the pipeline rinehart 2003 to reflect the extent of the local deformation wang et al 2014 defined the length of the indentation zone as the position where the indentation exceeds 1 of the pipe diameter s l r 0 0 01 however in the actual test there is a slight deformation at a distance from the dent the lengths identified from the test data are sometimes large and the calculated film strain is small shuai 2010 in this study the local dent is divided into three areas i ii and iii i e the indenter contact area the transition area and the impact area as shown in fig 9 b the film strain of the region i is large and therefore the length of the indentation corresponding to s l 2 half of the maximum depth of the indentation as the boundary between region i and region ii shuai 2010 in this study the cross section deformation rate r is proposed to define region ii and region iii the cross section deformation rate is defined as 2 r s l p 2 s l p 1 y 2 y 1 where s lp1 and s lp2 denote the local indentation depth at point p1 and point p2 respectively and y 1 and y 2 represent the distance from point p1 and point p2 to the middle section of the specimen respectively as shown in fig 9 b r refers to the cross section deformation rate and it represents the change of local dent per unit length the pipe specimen is assumed to have a significant local dent at r 0 01 it is noted that the length of the indentation zone needs to measure the data within a certain length due to the limitation of experimental conditions numerical simulation will be used to determine such length in the following sections it is found from table 3 that the single layer pipe specimens pa1 pc1 ph1 form a deeper indentation profile under transverse impact compared with the pipe in pipe specimens with the same external diameter pab2 pde2 pfg2 pha2 1 pha2 2 and d max and d min change greatly for pa1 d o 219 t 12 pc1 d o 273 t 12 7 and ph1 d o 325 t 14 with different diameters and wall thickness the global deformation and the local indentation of single layer pipelines decrease gradually with the increase of pipe diameter and wall thickness from fig 7 and table 3 it is also found that pc1 d o 273 t 12 7 has a much higher impact force during the only action of the outer tube compared to pde2 d o 273 t 11 which indicates that the wall thickness has a great influence on the impact resistance 3 5 strain response the strain time history curves at different positions on the surface of the specimens under transverse impact tensile strain has positive value and compressive strain has negative value are plotted in fig 10 due to large deformation of the specimens under transverse impact load some strain gauges are damaged m r w d m w and d m e on specimen pa1 d m e and d m w on specimen pab2 d m e on specimen pc1 strain gauges d m e and m r w on specimen pa1 peeled off from the tube surface due to violent vibration of the specimen during the impacting process as shown in fig 10 the strain of the characteristic points on the surface of most specimens exceeds the yield strain additionally the following summaries can be obtained 1 except for local dent areas the bottom surface of the specimen at the mid span d m e d m w d w and d e deforms firstly and the strain at this location has largest value the strains at d m e and d m w show compressive deformation at the initial impact stage and then they change to positive value assumed as tensile deformation till the tensile strains reach maximum value this phenomenon is analyzed with the help of the impact process of the steel pipe in the tests at the initial contact of the indenter with the pipe at 12 5 ms local indentation appears at the contact location simultaneously the central axis of the steel tube remains horizontal there is no large global bending deformation at this time the appearance of the local dent causes a transient elastic compressive deformation at the bottom of the pipe in the following process the global bending deformation increases gradually and the tensile deformation produced by the global bending exceeds the elastic compressive deformation finally showing as tensile strain at this location 2 the strain at a distance of 400 mm from the mid span is analyzed as shown in fig 5 b the deformation at this position appears as local dent and global bending at 12 5 16 4 ms due to the occurrence of local dent deformation strain gauges at u w and u e begin to monitor tensile strain at 14 2 ms the strains at those points increase gradually to a maximum value 3 with further development of local dent and global bending deformation the deformation of the cross section causes both sides of the pipe m l w m l e m r w and m r e to exhibit compressive deformation table 4 summarizes the maximum strain and the corresponding average strain rate to evaluate the effect of impact load on the deformation rate at different locations the strain time history curves show that the deformation of the tube is symmetrical about the mid span section in length direction m l w and m l e are symmetric positions so are m r e and m r w d m e and d m w table 4 shows that measuring point d m w the bottom surface of the specimen at mid span has the largest average strain rate followed by point d w then points m l w and u w it indicates that the bottom of the specimen at the mid span reaches the final failure state firstly due to maximum bending moment is located at this cross section the strain rate decreases gradually from the mid span to the endplates 3 6 impact force deflection curves the impact force versus deflection mean value of displacements at pleft and pright curves of the specimens under transverse impact are plotted in fig 11 it is noted here that the displacements at the bottom mid span of specimens pde2 and ph1 were not measured completely in the whole impacting process so the deflection in the curves is represented by an average of the displacements on both sides of the specimens at the mid span the impact force deflection curves have similar changing process at the initial stage of the collision the impact force increases rapidly to a local peak value at this stage the deflection is very tiny which implies that the deformation is mainly dominated by local indentation as shown in fig 5 a after that the axial sliding of the specimens causes the impact force to have a drop the impact force continues to increase to the peak impact force after the sliding of the specimens stops after the impact force reaches the peak value the deflection approaches gradually to the maximum value with the absorption of the impact energy till the drop hammer stops moving downward when the specimens start to rebound due to elastic recovery the deflection begins to decrease and the impact force decreases to zero rapidly due to the separation between the indenter and the pipe at the zero value of the impact force i e complete separation between the indenter and the pipe a residual deflection is found and it is mainly the global residual deformation comparative analysis was performed on single layer and pipe in pipe specimens with same outer diameter of 219 mm as shown in fig 11 a for pipe in pipe specimen pab2 the indenter acts on the outer pipe firstly in the impact process and the initial impact force of pab2 is almost same as that of pa1 after the deflection is greater than 5 mm contact between the outer pipe and the inner pipe occurs and the inner pipe begins to resist the impact together with the outer pipe due to such collaboration of the two pipes pab2 sustains a higher peak impact force than pa1 simultaneously the collaboration between the outer and the inner pipes also improves the stiffness and reduces the deformation of the specimens and it can be observed from fig 11 a that the residual deflection of pab2 after impact is much smaller than the corresponding result of pa1 the three specimens as shown in fig 11 b pc1 pde2 and pfg2 have same outer diameter of 273 mm and different values of thickness the thickness values of pc1 and pfg2 are much close 12 7 mm and 13 mm respectively while pde2 has a smaller thickness of 11 mm it is found from fig 11 b that the initial impact forces of pc1 and pfg2 are basically the same while the initial impact force of pde2 is significantly smaller before a deflection of 5 mm at this stage the outer pipe of the pipe in pipe specimens pde2 and pfg2 does not contact with the inner pipe and all the impacting load is sustained by the outer pipe the performance of the specimens is only determined by the stiffness of the outer pipe because the diameter and thickness of the single layer pipe pc1 are almost same to those of the outer pipe for the pipe in pipe specimen pfg2 the performance of the two specimens is quite similar however pde2 has a smaller thickness and the outer pipe has a much lower stiffness compared to the other two specimens and hence its performance to impact is weaker when the outer pipe contacts with the inner pipe the contribution of the inner pipe in resisting the impact load works and the collaboration between the outer and the inner pipes produce a much higher resistance to impact for specimen pfg2 for pipe in pipe specimen pde2 its performance of resistance to the impact load is very close to that of the single layer specimen pc1 although the wall thickness of the outer pipe is smaller than the wall thickness of pc1 pde2 can achieve an almost equivalent performance through the collaboration of the outer and the inner pipes in resisting impact load in fig 11 c three specimens ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 have same diameter of 325 mm between the outer pipe of the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 and the single layer pipe specimen ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 have identical geometry and material and they experienced same impacting action to verify the consistency of the tested results the impact force deflection curves of the two specimens in fig 11 c are almost coincident which indicates that the impact test can produce stable results for same specimens similarly it can be also observed from the comparison of the curves that the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 have much higher resistance to impact compared to the single layer pipe specimen ph1 because they can sustain a much higher impact force and have a much smaller residual deflection after impact in addition as mentioned previously a stable phase stage ii can be found in the impact force deflection curves for the three specimens under transverse impact wang et al 2013 used the impact force corresponding to the platform segment stable phase in the impact time history curves as the impact bearing capacity wang et al 2014 introduced a post peak mean force p m as defined in the following equation 3 p m s o s g p d s s g s o where s o denotes the global displacement when the impact force reaches its maximum value p max p is the impact force and p m represents the equivalent impact force s o is defined as the displacement at the beginning of the stable phase from eq 3 the post peak mean forces of all specimens are calculated and listed in table 3 for details 3 7 energy dissipation in the analysis of failure mode and strain time history curves of the specimens under transverse impact it is found that all the specimens have similar failure mechanism with a failure mode of coupled local dent and global bending deformation plastic hinge is found to be distributed around the local dent such failure mechanism indicates that the total impact energy is dissipated in two forms i e the energy absorbed by global bending deformation and the energy consumed by local dent in calculating the energy dissipation the current study ignores the energy dissipated in the following mechanisms 1 the energy dissipated by the frictions including the friction between the specimens and the clamps and the friction between the specimens and the indenter during the impact process 2 the rebound of the drop weight 3 the energy dissipated due to heat and noise during the impact process based on the above assumptions the total impact energy e i is calculated easily from the kinetic energy of the drop weight as follow 4 e i m d v 0 2 2 where m d is the mass of the drop hammer and v 0 is the velocity when the drop hammer contacts the pipe specimen the energy dissipated by global bending e g is calculated by integrating the impact force displacement at the bottom of the specimen at the mid span deflection curve table 5 summarizes the impact energy e i of different specimens and the energy dissipated by global deformation e g in addition since the displacements at bottom surface of some of the specimens at the mid span were not collected during the impact process the dissipated energy e s calculated by integrating the impact force displacement at pleft is also calculated and it is illustrated in fig 12 a together with e g fig 12 b shows the ratio of the total impact energy e i to the energy dissipated by global deformation e g or e s e g e i e s e i it is found from fig 12 a and table 5 that pipe in pipe specimens have a lower value of e g due to the presence of the inner tube in reducing the global deformation compared to single layer pipelines based on the above assumptions with the reduction of e g the energy dissipated by local dents e i increases and more energy during the impact is consumed by local dent deformation fig 12 b demonstrates that compared to single layer pipes pipe in pipe specimens have a lower value of the ratio of e g e i and e s e i and such result also indicates that more energy is dissipated by local dent in pipe in pipe specimens this conclusion is also verified from the results of s g for single layer pipe and pipe in pipe specimens in table 5 in which it is easily found that s g of pipe in pipe specimens is lower than the corresponding one of single layer pipe specimens eac is a dimensionless parameter used to reflect the intrinsic energy absorption capacity of a pipe specimen under transverse impact load its definition is listed as follow and it is used in this study to evaluate the inherent energy absorption capacity of the pipe specimens 5 e a c e i m p s t where e i refers to the total energy during the total impact process m p denotes the total weight of the specimen and s t represents the displacement of the contact position between the indenter and the specimen table 5 lists the energy absorption properties eac for all specimens the data of the first five specimens pa1 pab2 pc1 pde2 pfg2 show that the energy absorption performance of the pipe in pipes is higher than that of the single layer pipelines indicating that the pipe in pipes structure has good impact performance comparing the eacs of the last three specimens it is found that the eac of the single layer pipe ph1 is larger than the eac of the pipe in pipe specimens pha2 1 and pha2 2 the main reason for this phenomenon is that both the local indentation and the global bending deformation of ph1 are small compared with the single layer pipe the weight of the pipe in pipe specimens play a leading role in the eac 4 numerical investigation 4 1 finite element modelling to investigate the impact resistance of pipe specimens under lateral impact load in a more comprehensive understanding finite element fe models of both single layer pipe and pipe in pipe specimens are established using the abaqus explicit module abaqus 2014 a schematic view of the fe model is shown in fig 13 in the fe modelling the stress strain curves of x56 steel obtained from the tensile tests for the coupons are used to define the material properties richardson and wisheart 1996 proved that the strain rate effect is negligible if the initial impact velocity v o 10 m s during impact loading the yield strength and the ultimate strength of steel material increase with increasing strain rate jones 1997 in this study cowper symonds model is used to determine the yield strength of steel material at different strain rates and it is calculated in the following equation 6 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 p where σ dy refers to the dynamic yield stress of the steel σ y denotes the static yield stress of the steel ε represents the strain rate for steel and d and p are the material constants in this study d and p adopted the empirical values proposed by abramowicz and jones 1984 which were 6844 s 1 and 3 91 respectively the establishment of the fe model is as consistent as possible with the actual situations in the impact tests including the main parts such as the drop hammer the clamping system and the spindle the crushable foam and crushable foam hardening options in the property module of abaqus is used to define the plastic behavior of polyurethane elastomer the specific material parameters are shown in table 2 the contact between the polyurethane elastomer and the steel pipe in the finite element modelling is simulated through tie constraint in which it is assumed that no separation occurs between the two interfaces during the impacting process such assumption was verified by hang 2012 through experimental study no peeling was found between the polyurethane layer and the steel pipe through observation to the cut section of the specimens after tests the feasibility of using tie constraint in the finite element modelling can be also proved from the observations to the deformed section of the tested specimens in this study as a typical view in fig 14 b clearly no separation between the polyurethane elastomer and the steel pipe was observed in fig 14 b and the tie constraint is also proved to be suitable in the meshing scheme all the parts are discretized into mesh by using 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r the deformation of the drop hammer during the test is negligible and hence the indenter and the weight blocks are defined as rigid bodies to improve the computing efficiency to improve the calculation accuracy and to consider the computing efficiency transitional grid technique is used to refine the contact area between the indenter and the specimen during the drop hammer impact experiment one end of the clamp uses a nut to press the specimen so that it can only rotate the other end clamp has a gap of 1 mm to the pipe wall the pipeline can slide axially during the impact process therefore tie constraints were used to define one end of pipeline and clamp in the fe model and the other end clamp has a gap of 1 mm to the pipe wall both the friction between the indenter and the pipe and the friction between the pipe and the clamp are considered in the fe analysis the contact surface properties are defined as follows hard contact is defined in normal direction coulomb friction is adopted in tangential direction and the friction coefficient is 0 15 because the spindle between the supporting frame and the clamping system is lubricated with oil the friction between them is negligible during the impact process the pipe specimens undergo bending deformation due to the transverse impact which may result in hourglass energy the hourglass can be controlled to be within 5 by refining the grid during the calculation 4 2 verification of fe model to verify the accuracy of the fe models the numerical results are benchmarked with the experimental results presented and the comparison is illustrated in fig 14 for brevity single layer pipe specimen ph1 and pipe in pipe specimen pha2 1 are selected for analysis the failure modes of the two specimens obtained both from experimental tests and fe simulations are shown in fig 14 a and b the fe simulations on the final residual deformations of both single layer pipe and pipe in pipe agree very well with experimental observations even for the pipe in pipe specimen pha2 1 the contact between the outer pipe and the inner pipe is also simulated accurately as shown in fig 14 b the time history curves of displacement and impact force and the impact force displacement curves of specimens ph1 pha2 1 and pha2 2 are also compared between fe simulations and experimental tests as shown in fig 15 a 15 i because pha2 1 and pha2 2 are identical pipes the fe model is named with pha2 comparing the impact force time history curves of ph1 and pha2 1 the fe results of the two pipeline specimens have reasonable consistency with the experimental results it is found from a partial enlarged view in fig 15 a that the impact force time history curves of the fe model have no obvious descent stage in the initial stage of the impact while the experimental results have significant descent stage the main reason is that the violent fluctuations in the actual test cause the impact force to decrease instantaneously whereas the boundary conditions in the fe simulation are idealized so that the fluctuation is reduced and there is no obvious descent stage the fe model predicts accurately the displacement time history curves of ph1 and pha2 1 because the fe results are basically consistent with the experimental results as shown in fig 15 b and c during the rebound phase the fe results deviate from the experimental results which may be caused by the deviation between the fe model and the experimental results during the vibration phase the predicted impact force displacement curves and strain time history curves by fe simulations are very close to the corresponding experimental results as shown in fig 15 d 15 i table 6 summarizes the fe results and the comparison between fe and test results in manner of a ratio between them although the loads in the tests are not representative of actual subsea impact due to laboratory limitations the fe predictions agree with the experimental results reasonably well the accuracy of the presented fe modelling technique is hence verified to be reliable in assessing the behavior of pipelines under impact load 4 3 analysis of the length of local indentation since the accuracy of the fe model is verified it is used to analyze the length of the local indentation for the specimens under transverse impact the local indentation of the pipe specimen is divided into three stages as mentioned previously and the local indentation area of the different impact specimens is shown in fig 16 the results in fig 16 a show that the pipe in pipe specimen pab2 has a much smaller value of both depth and length of the local indentation compared to the single layer pipe pa1 similar conclusions can be drawn for the specimens pc1 pde2 and pfg2 in fig 16 b and for the specimens ph1 pha2 in fig 16 c additionally it is also found from fig 16 that pa1 and pab2 begin to show significant local indentation at a distance of 477 mm and 400 mm from the mid span and pc1 pcd2 and pfg2 begin to show significant local indentation at 625 mm 562 mm and 500 mm from the mid span whereas for ph1 and pha2 such distance is about 740 mm and 598 mm from the mid span the boundary of regions ii r 0 01 and iii r 0 01 is classified according to a critical value of local deformation rate i e r 0 01 as seen in fig 16 the value of s l r 0 is very close to be 0 when r 0 01 region iii and it represents a very slight local indentation when r 0 01 the value of s l r 0 increases quickly which indicates the local indentation has a significant increase therefore r 0 01 is used to classify regions ii and iii and it represents an index of local deformation rate both the diameter and the wall thickness increase from the specimens in fig 16 a to the specimens in fig 16 c such phenomenon may be due to the following reason with increase of the radius and wall thickness of the pipes the global bending deformation of the specimens decreases gradually and local indentation becomes larger and its area expands 5 conclusions the impact resistance of the pipe in pipe specimens under transverse impact load is studied through both experimental tests and numerical simulations from the obtained results the following conclusions are drawn 1 for both single layer pipes and pipe in pipe specimens under impact load similar failure mechanism is found in them which includes a coupling residual deformation of both local indentation and global bending plastic hinges around the local indentation are all observed in the two types of pipes after impact 2 due to the contribution of the inner pipe a pipe in pipe specimen has an efficient improvement in resistance to impact compared to a corresponding single layer pipe such improvement assumes a higher value of peak impact force a shorter impacting time and a smaller residual deformation 3 a cross sectional deformation rate r is proposed in this study the local indentation is divided into three stages evaluated from two parameters of r and s l 2 the indenter contact area the transition area and the local dent impact area comparing the length and the depth of the local indentation area the local indentation range of the pipe in pipe specimen is reduced and hence the impact resistance is increased due to the existence of the inner tube 4 the post peak mean force p m and the energy absorption capacity eac parameters are also used to evaluate the impact resistance the results show that the energy absorption performance of the pipe in pipe specimen is higher than that of the single layer pipe specimen indicating that the pipe in pipe system has better impact performance credit authorship

flow on hydrodynamic of a pipeline over a fully scoured seabed is numerically investigated by residual based large eddy simulations a generalized α method is applied to solving variational multiscale formulations of the navier stokes equations with a residual based turbulence model flows with the same parameters as the experiment are considered in the study the hydrodynamic forces computed by the in house codes of the residual based large eddy simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results characteristics of the flow distorted by the scour hole and its effect on hydrodynamic forces are examined by comparisons with the flow past a circular cylinder over a flat seabed the results show that the scour hole causes lower velocity through the gap weaker vortex shedding smaller drag force smaller rms of lift force and smaller hydrodynamic forces along the seabed in particular the flows with different boundary layer thicknesses are considered in the study it is found that the boundary layer thickness has evident effect on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamics of the cylinder the size of the vortices downstream the cylinder become large and their vorticities become small as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the mean drag lift rms of lift and strouhal number clearly decreases with the boundary layer thickness additionally the variation of the vorticity contours downstream the cylinder and rms of lift indicate that the vortex shedding become weak as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the boundary layer thickness has little effect on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed keywords pipeline over a fully scoured seabed residual based large eddy simulation boundary shear flow distorted by a scour hole vortex shedding hydrodynamic force 1 introduction pipelines at the sea bed are commonly exposed to currents and or waves when they lie on seabed its transverse motion may not be significant however when the seabed is erodible after a duration of scour underneath the pipelines the pipelines may become suspended over a scour hole as a result vortex induced vibration of the pipeline in the transverse direction becomes significant this is in fact one of the major problems encountered in pipeline engineering practice with a scour hole underneath the pipeline flow past the pipeline which involves interactions between the pipeline wake and the boundary layer flow near the scour hole is different from the flow past a pipeline on or close to a flat seabed there have been some work on the flow past a pipeline close to a flat seabed in the past few decades bearman and zdravkovich 1978 have carried out experimental studies on the influence of g g is the gap spacing between the cylinder bottom and the wall boundary which is nondimensionalized by the diameter of the circular cylinder d on the vortex shedding for reynolds number from 2 5 1 0 4 to 4 8 1 0 4 they noticed that the vortex shedding motion in the wake of the cylinder near the wall is suppressed when g 0 3 zdravkovich 1985 further investigated the variation of drag and lift forces on circular cylinders close to a wall with the boundary layer thickness δ 0 12 δ 0 97 nondimensionalized by d and adjusted by giving different inlet flows it was found in the study that the drag coefficient was affected by δ however its effect on the lift coefficient was less significant than that by g lei et al 1999 measured the drag and lift forces on the circular cylinder immersed in different boundary layer thickness 0 14 δ 2 89 they noted that the drag coefficient in the thinner boundary layers is slightly larger than that in the thicker boundary layers at small gap ratios for a cylinder fully or partly immersed in a boundary layer the drag coefficient increases with the ratio of the gap to the boundary layer thickness numerical studies on the flow past the circular cylinder close to a wall have also been undertaken brors 1999 and ong et al 2009 2010 2012 applied a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the standard k ϵ model to flows at r e 1 4 1 0 4 r e 1 31 1 0 4 r e 3 6 1 0 6 respectively prsic et al 2016 performed large eddy simulations les of flow around a circular cylinder close to a flat seabed at r e 1 31 1 0 4 the influence of the incoming boundary layer profile was investigated with logarithmic boundary layer inlet profile of thickness of 0 48 d and 1 6 d in their study they found that the flow characteristics are not only influenced by the presence of the plane wall but also dependent on the boundary layer thickness the different boundary layer thickness results in different velocities past the circular cylinder which leads to variations of c d and c l r m s in contrast to the flows past a pipeline close to a flat seabed a fewer studies on flow characteristics past a circular cylinder over a scoured seabed have been carried out li et al 2018 conducted a numerical study on flow past a circular cylinder placed in the vicinity of a fully scoured seabed to examine how differently fully scoured seabed profiles affect the hydrodynamic quantities of a freely vibrating circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers there are also some related studies focusing more on the development of the scour process mao 1986 and sumer et al 1988 undertook experimental investigations on the interaction between pipeline vibration and an erodible seabed scouring they observed that the pipeline vibration might induce extra erosion resulting in relatively larger scour depths and scour widths their results also showed that the effect of the scour hole on the amplitude and frequency of cylinder vibration was significant jensen et al 1990 did a study on flow around and forces on a pipeline near a scoured seabed with a steady inlet by experiment they compared the results between the cases of a cylinder over a scoured and a flat seabed the comparison indicated that the actual seabed forms should be taken into consideration when more accurate predictions are requested brors 1999 adopted a numerical method to consider both turbulent flow and seabed change by using rans and solving bed load sediment transport equation the study showed that the predicted seabed profile formed by scouring was in good agreement with laboratory measurements zhao and cheng 2010 performed a numerical investigation on the interaction between pipeline vibration and the scouring process of the seabed with a steady inlet their study confirmed experimental results of mao and summer et al that pipeline vibrations would increase the scour depth to investigate self burial efficiency of the pipeline yang et al 2012a b conducted experimental studies on the effect of a rubber plate and a rigid spoiler on the seabed scour in wave and current conditions their results revealed that the rigid spoiler can enhance the scour depth and extent in both wave and current conditions and that the scour depth increases with the spoiler height it may be noticed that much of work mentioned above has been focusing on the scouring process and its effect on the pipeline when the scour hole is formed the pipeline will remain suspended for long term period in such a case the pipeline will experience a different hydrodynamic loading continuously and its motion characters will be very much affected by the hole it is the purpose of the present study to undertake in depth study through numerical simulation on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic behavior of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed a residual based turbulence model through the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation is adopted in the present study the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation was derived by hughes et al 2000 as a method that utilizes a priori scale separation in lieu of spatial filtering as commonly done in traditional les by the priori scale separation the governing equations are split into two systems of equations large and small scale equations in numerical simulation only the large scale equations are expected to be computed the small scales which are associated with the infinite dimensional complement of the large scales are about to be modeled approximately by the residual of the equations for large scales consequently the terms involving small scales in the equation for large scale equations are then replaced by this approximation the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation has been validated in decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence hughes et al 2001a and channel turbulent flow hughes et al 2001b subsequently it has also been used in variety of problems since calo 2005 and bazilevs et al 2007 proposed variational multiscale residual based turbulence modeling for large eddy simulation of incompressible flows bazilevs and hughes 2007 presented a modification of weakly imposed dirichlet boundary conditions incorporating the well known law of the wall to circumvent inaccurate mean flow quantities for coarse boundary layer meshes bazilevs et al 2010 continued carrying out a study on isogeometric variational multiscale modeling with weakly enforced boundary conditions on unstreched meshes and formed a basis of a possible practical strategy for computing engineering flows somewhere between rans and les in complexity with its development extensions to engineering application have been increasingly done in the past decade such as les of compressible separated flows by koobus and farhat 2004 and rajasekharan and farhat 2009 flame vortex interaction by gravemeier and wall 2011 multi ion transport in dilute electrolyte solutions by bauer et al 2013 nonequilibrium thermal plasma flow by trelles and modirkhazeni 2014 multiphase flows by khalloufi et al 2016 riber et al 2016 and rasthofer et al 2018 and incompressible stratified flows by yan et al 2016 these applications verified a high potential of the approach in engineering problems considering the fact that the cylinder is in a non uniform ambient flow which can be severely distorted by the scour hole the present study aims to investigate in depth how this kind of flow affects the wake and hydrodynamic forces of the circular cylinder in particular shear flows with different boundary layer thicknesses are considered and the effect of boundary layer thickness on the wake and hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder are taken into consideration in the present study the paper is organized as follows variational multiscale formulations for large eddy simulation in a finite element framework temporal integration method and problem setup are provided in section 2 validation results and discussion on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces are given in section 3 finally conclusions are presented in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 governing equation the two dimensional 2d continuity equation and navier stokes equations for the incompressible viscous flows are used the non dimensional forms of these equations based on the incoming velocity u c of the flow body dimension l and kinetic viscosity ν of the fluid can be written as 1 u 0 2 l u p u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 0 where u denotes the velocity p denotes the pressure r e u c l ν is reynolds number 2 2 discrete formulation the numerical method used in the study is based on a finite element method multiplying eqs 1 and 2 by the weighting function w w q which corresponds to the solution u u p and integrating the results over the fluid domain we have their standard galerkin formulations 3 b w u w u t ω w u u ω w p ω w 1 r e 2 u ω q u ω 0 where ω denotes the fluid domain ω represents an integration in the space domain decomposing the solution u u p into a large scale component u and a small scale component u 4 u u u accordingly 5 w w w eq 3 is split into two coupled nonlinear subsystems 6 b w u u 0 7 b w u u 0 where eqs 6 and 7 are designated as large u and small scale u equations respectively the large scale equations are defined in a finite dimensional space where we undertake practical computation the small scale equation is associated with the infinite dimensional complement of the large scale space in the whole solution space with which an approximation to the fine scales driven by the residual of the large scale equation is inverted employing the definition of b into eq 6 yields 8 b w u u b w u w u t ω w 1 r e 2 u ω w p ω w u u ω w u u ω w u u ω q u ω 0 supposing that u t 0 and 1 r e 2 u 0 the first two terms of the third to last line vanish to avoid the presence of the derivative of u and p as well as the second derivative of u the terms involved with u p and 2 u are integrated by parts ignoring the effects of u and p on the boundary eq 9 become 9 b w u u w u t ω w u u ω w p ω w 1 r e u ω q u ω w p ω w u u ω w u u ω w u u ω q u ω w u n u 1 r e u n γ 0 where denotes the tensor product or u u u i u j γ represents the fluid domain boundary and n denotes the outward normal vector to the fluid domain boundary eq 9 may be thought of playing a similar role in the variational multiscale theory as the filtered equations play in the traditional large eddy simulation in eq 9 the second fourth lines on the right hand side represent consistent small scale representations in which the first two terms of the third line correspond to the cross stress in the traditional subgrid scale stress w u u ω corresponds to the reynolds stress if the equations only partially include the nonlinear advection term the first term of the third line the method then reduces to a supg method chen and wu 2019 given the small scales u p eq 9 enables solution for the large scales on the other hand the small scales are driven by the large scales through eq 7 as solving eq 7 is as tricky as solving the original navier stokes equations the effort will focus on obtaining approximate analytical expressions for the fine scales by means of eq 7 then substituting them into the large scale equations in this study residual based expressions for u and p proposed by hughes 1995 and are used 10 u τ m l u p 11 p τ c u where l u p is the residual of eq 2 associated with u p in the above two equations τ m and τ c are defined as follows shakib 1989 taylor et al 1998 12 τ m c 1 u g u c 2

taken as c 1 1 c 2 36 and c 3 4 g is a covariant metric tensor of the gradient of local element spatial coordinates ξ with respect to the global coordinates x for the same point 14 g ξ x t ξ x and ξ x is the jacobian matrix t r g in eq 13 represents a summation of the diagonal elements of g 2 3 time discretization in the present study we employ a generalized α method which was applied to fluid dynamics in jansen et al 2000 bazilevs et al 2010 and chen and hu 2017 to solve eq 9 define a as the nodal values of u p t a are the temporal derivative of a at the same nodes performing integrations in eq 9 results in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations 15 a a b a introducing the generalized α method for the above system yields 16 r a n α m a n α f a a n α m b a n α f 0 17 a n 1 a n δ t a n γ δ t a n 1 a n 18 a n α m a n α m a n 1 a n 19 a n α f a n α f a n 1 a n where δ t t n 1 t n is the time step size which is taken as a constant in the present work α m and α f are parametric constants with 20 α m 1 2 3 ζ 1 ζ α f 1 1 ζ ζ is set to 0 5 to retain unconditional stability and a second order accuracy jansen et al 2000 and γ 0 5 α m α f here a prediction multicorrection procedure is used to handle the above generalized α method algorithms the procedure starts with a prediction of the solution and its temporal derivative at t n 1 21 a n 1 0 a n 22 a n 1 0 γ 1 γ a n substituting these predictions into eqs 18 and 19 and the results into eq 16 we can force r 0 by correction of a n α f i through δ a n α f i utilizing a newton s iteration procedure we have 23 r a n α m i a n α f i r a n α m i a n α f i a n α f i δ a n α f i 0 once δ a n α f i is obtained a n α f i and a n α m i are updated via 24 a n α f i 1 a n α f i δ a n α f i 25 a n α m i 1 1 α

f i and a n α m i the solutions at t n 1 are determined using eqs 18 and 19 and computation moves to the next time step 2 4 problem setup simulations through the above described procedure are performed for a circular cylinder of diameter d in a computational domain with a fully scoured seabed the profile of which refers to the measured seabed profile of the scour hole by an actual scour test performed by mao 1986 the bottom edge of the circular cylinder is at y 0 where the cylinder originally laid on the seabed the lowest position of the scour hole is at y 0 74 the cylinder longitudinally locates at x 0 which is 10 d downstream the flow inlet and the flow outlet is located 20 d downstream the center of the cylinder these distances are sufficient to neglect the effects of the boundary truncation far upstream and downstream of the cylinder the top boundary is located at a height of 10 d from the bottom of the cylinder this ensures that it has negligible effect on the flow past the cylinder in the simulations the characteristic length l d and no slip boundary conditions are applied to the cylinder surface as well as the bottom wall at the flow inlet an equilibrium layer with a logarithmic velocity profile is specified below a chosen boundary layer thickness δ above this height a constant free stream velocity is specified the velocity profile is given by u y m i n u κ l n y z w u c 1 if y z w u y 0 otherwise v y 0 where y is perpendicular to the flat seabed where y 0 the friction velocity is evaluated as u κ u c l n δ z w κ 0 41 is the von karman constant δ represents the boundary layer thickness and z w is the seabed roughness coefficient for the top side of the domain a boundary condition of u y 0 v 0 is used thus on the boundary either the dirichlet condition dc in which the velocity is prescribed or the neumann condition nc in which the normal derivative of the velocity is prescribed is imposed in the former dc is used explicitly on the boundary in the finite element formation in eq 9 and those w corresponding to the nodes on the boundary are not included in the weight process of galerkin method in the latter nc is applied directly in the finite element formulation in eq 9 at the flow outlet the following outflow boundary conditions bazilevs et al 2010 is employed 26 u n u 1 r e u n 0 where the term u n denotes the negative part of u n that is 27 u n u n if u n 0 u n 0 otherwise the first term on the left hand side in eq 26 is non zero only in the case of reverse flow through the outlet substituting eq 26 into eq 9 on the outlet boundary the contribution from this boundary will then contain only 28 γ o u t l e t w u n u d γ o u t l e t where 29 u n u n if u n 0 u n 0 otherwise in the present study a body fitted structured multi block mesh of quadrilateral elements is used which is generated by icem cfd a sketch of the mesh for the case e 1 is illustrated in fig 1 for all the simulations the size of the elements near the cylinder and the wall boundary is set such that η u τ η r e 1 where u τ denotes the friction velocity at the wall and η denotes the element thickness in the normal direction to the wall 3 results and discussion considering that the shear flow through a scour hole may be different from that through a flat seabed and varies with the boundary layer thickness discussions in this section involve two concerns one is about the ambient flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities of the cylinder over the fully scoured seabed with a comparison to those of the cylinder over a flat seabed the other concern is analysis of the effect of the boundary layer thickness on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities numerical simulations for the flow past the cylinder over a scoured and flat seabed are performed with the same parameters as jensen et al s experiments the reynolds number r e u d ν based on the cylinder diameter is 6000 a logarithmic velocity profile with two cylinder diameters of boundary layer thickness is set at ten cylinder diameters upstream as the incident shear flow 3 1 convergence study to ensure the correction of numerical simulations in the present study both time step and mesh convergence study have been performed for numerical simulations of the flow past a cylinder over a fully scoured seabed three time steps δ t 0 0025 0 002 and 0 001 for a mesh with 42042 elements and three meshes containing approximately 32000 42000 and 50000 elements with δ t 0 002 are used to compute the drag c d and lift c l coefficients which are based on the definition of f d 0 5 ρ c d u c 2 d and f l 0 5 ρ c l u c 2 d where f d and f l are drag and lift forces consisting of both pressure and viscous components around the cylinder ρ represents the fluid density profiles of the mean drag c d and lift c l against the number of elements and time step δ t are shown in fig 2 according to the variation of c d and c l with δ t and the element number δ t 0 002 is proved to be convergent and a mesh with 42042 elements is considered to give a sufficient grid resolution therefore a mesh with 42042 elements and δ t 0 002 are adopted in the present study 3 2 flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities to better understand the effect of the scour hole on the ambient flow of the cylinder flow past a cylinder locating 0 74d high the same height as that in the scour hole case over the flat seabed is presented here for a comparison fig 3 illustrates mean flow velocity magnitude contours streamline patterns of the mean flow fig 3a longitudinal mean velocity profiles fig 3b along the transverse axes at x d 1 0 5 0 0 5 and 1 it can be seen from the mean flow that the upper vortices downstream the cylinder are similar between two cases however the lower vortex in the scoured hole case has the larger size than that in the flat seabed case and its center in the scoured hole case is lower than that in the flat seabed case in the flow with the scour hole a vortex can be observed near the seabed upstream the cylinder since there is a smaller inlet upstream the gap with the scour hole than the gap with the flat seabed the velocity beneath the cylinder over the scour hole is smaller than that beneath the cylinder over the flat seabed which is observed through the velocity profiles along the transverse axes particularly the velocity close to the seabed is negative at x d 1 since a vortex takes place at this location the small velocity beneath the cylinder causes that the lower separation point of the wake in the scoured hole case moves forward and the lower vortex in the wake moves downward fig 4 shows vorticity contours of instantaneous flow past the cylinders over the flat and scoured seabed in one period at the beginning in the period the vortices shed in a lower right direction and start to move upwards at this moment the vortices downstream the cylinder over the scour hole appear to be threadlike and in the wake of the cylinder over the flat seabed normal vortices shed downstream at t t 2 the vortices shedding from the upper right side have the similar vorticities between two cases differently no strong vortices shed downstream from the lower right side of the cylinder compared to the wake of the cylinder over the flat seabed as t turns to 3 t 4 the vortices shed in a upper right direction the vorticities of the vortices from the lower right side of the cylinder grow up in the scoured hole case and a few vortices appear near the flat seabed downstream the cylinder when the vortices shed upwards at the end of the period the vortices move downwards again a few vortices can be clearly observed near the flat seabed downstream the cylinder and no vortex appears near the scoured seabed in practical the hydrodynamic forces are very significant for analysis of the pipeline vortex induced vibration firstly the mean pressure coefficient c p p 0 5 ρ u c 2 d fig 5 around the cylinder from the two cases are concerned here p is the pressure at the peripheral angle of the cylinder θ measured anti clockwise from the front point on the longitudinal axis of the cylinder it can be seen that the pressure around the cylinder over the scoured seabed is larger than that over the flat seabed except the pressure at 180 θ 225 where it is smaller than that over the flat seabed as shown in the flow configuration for the cylinder over the scoured seabed the flow near the seabed upstream the cylinder moves downwards to travel through the scour hole with a small compression when the flow comes to the cylinder which may result in low pressure at the lower left side of the cylinder therefore the mean pressure coefficient profile around the cylinder appears to be asymmetric fig 6 shows temporal evolution of the force drag and lift coefficients acting on the cylinders over the flat and scoured seabed it can be seen that when the flow is fully developed the drag of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is smaller than that over the flat seabed for the lift the peak of the lift curve of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is smaller than that over the flat seabed the troughs of the lift curve are comparable between the two cases as the pressure component takes a high percentage of the hydrodynamic forces the lower pressure at the lower left side of the cylinder over the scoured seabed mentioned above may leads to smaller drag and lift forces table 1 presents mean drag c d mean lift c l root mean square of lift force 30 c l r m s 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 c l c l 2 d t and strouhal number 31 s t f v d u c where f v represents vortex shedding frequency to validate the present numerical method experimental results obtained by flow visualizations of jensen et al are listed in the table as well clearly the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number by the present numerical simulation are in good agreement with experimental results the mean lift coefficient is slightly overpredicted between the cases with the flat and scoured seabed the c d c l and c l r m s of the cylinder over the scoured seabed are lower than those over the flat seabed particularly the mean lift of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is downward negative however it appears reversely positive in the case of the flat seabed which indicates that the cylinder over the scoured seabed is dominated by the downward force and the positive lift dominates in the case of the flat seabed for the vortex shedding in the wake the two flows have similar strouhal numbers the lift forces are further examined through their power spectrum calculating by a fourier transformation the power spectrums of the lift at low dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the high power spectrum is present at low frequencies and there appear peaks at f 1 83 in the two cases which means that the vortex shedding in the two flows are dominated by the same frequency differently the vortex shedding at f 0 183 in the scoured hole case takes less power than that in the flat seabed case the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed are important for the sediment transportation of the erodible seabed here the mean pressure coefficient c p w m p w p 0 5 ρ u c 2 profiles fig 8 along the flat and scoured seabed are also examined where p w represents the pressure along the seabed it is interesting to find that the pressure along the flat seabed drops sharply beneath the cylinder while the pressure along the scoured seabed varies slightly and stay stable along the seabed which agreeably confirms that the seabed is fully scoured the shear stress τ w μ u n along the seabed is a key physical quantity that drives the sediment transportation at the seabed where n denotes the outward normal vector to the seabed here the friction velocity at the seabed is analyzed instead of the shear stress which is defined as u w τ w τ w τ w ρ in fig 9 the mean friction velocity profiles along the flat and scoured seabed are shown it is observed that in the case of the flat seabed the mean friction velocity profile rapidly increases from x 1 to 0 and reaches a maximum around x 0 it falls down quickly as x 0 in practical the high mean friction velocity equivalent to high shear stress underneath the cylinder in the case of the flat seabed may result in sediment transportation if the seabed is erodible since the scour underneath the pipeline has been fully developed the mean friction velocity are comparably small along the seabed as shown in the mean flow that a vortex appear around x d 1 1 it can be particularly seen in the mean friction velocity profile that the magnitude of the mean friction velocity is negative around x d 1 1 3 3 effect of boundary layer thickness in this subsection simulations with different boundary layer thicknesses are undertaken to consider the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamics of the cylinder in the simulations different shear flow profiles are given at the flow inlet and the logarithmic velocity profiles with six different boundary layer thicknesses δ 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 which have been dimensionalized by the cylinder diameter d are used as the incident velocity profiles fig 10 shows the velocity magnitude contours streamlines velocity profiles along the transverse axis at different longitudinal location x 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 of the mean flows with different boundary layer thicknesses as the boundary layer thickness increases the velocity of the flow past the cylinder decreases which can be confirmed by the velocity profiles fig 10e along the transverse axis through the velocity magnitude contours and streamline patterns it can be seen that the vortex structures in the wake of the flow with δ 0 5 1 and 2 are still very similar although the velocity profiles show that the longitudinal velocity past the cylinder decreases as δ increases from 0 5 to 2 when δ increases to 3 the wake is very different from those in other cases large vortices take place in the wake and the center of the vortices move backward in this case additionally a vortex takes place at the scour hole downstream the cylinder in the flow with δ 3 the velocity profiles along the transverse axis confirm that the velocity of the flow past the cylinder decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing although the flow is interfered by the cylinder vorticity contours of instantaneous snapshot with different boundary layer thicknesses are plotted to account for the vortex evolution during one period of the flow to have a compact comparison only the flows with δ 0 5 and 3 are shown in the present paper see fig 11 at the beginning of the flow period the vortices start to shed downwards it is noted that the vortices downstream the cylinder at δ 0 5 has smaller size and higher vorticity than those at δ 3 for the flow with δ 3 it is observed that there appear a vortex at the seabed downstream the cylinder at t t 2 the vortices in the wake start to move upwards strong vortices continue to shed from the lower right side of the cylinder at δ 0 5 for the flow with δ 3 the vortex downstream the cylinder interact with the boundary shear flow near the seabed which makes the vortex size at the seabed larger when t comes to 3 t 4 the vortices shed right backwards a pair of vortices can be clearly seen in the two flows the lower vortex with the positive vorticity is in front of the upper vortex in the flow with δ 0 5 differently the situation is opposite in the flow with δ 3 at the end of the flow period the vortices shed upwards clearly a few new vortices grow up at the lower right side of the cylinder at δ 0 5 while the old vortex continue to shed backward in the flow at δ 3 the lower vortex downstream the cylinder continuously interact with the vortex at the seabed as a result the vortices downstream the cylinder at δ 0 5 have the smaller size and higher vorticities than those at δ 3 the interaction between the lower vortex and the shear flow downstream the cylinder makes a vortex occur downstream at the seabed the mean pressure coefficient profiles around the cylinder in the flows with δ 0 5 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 12 through the figure it is noted that the pressure profiles at the top side 22 5 θ 157 5 of the cylinder almost overlap which indicates that the effect of the boundary layer thickness on the pressure is weak at the frontal edge 157 5 θ 202 5 it can be seen that the mean pressure slightly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases the boundary layer thickness has a relatively clear effect on the pressure at the lower right side of the cylinder where the mean pressure increases with the boundary layer thickness increasing to make a further understanding of the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder the temporal evolution of the drag and lift force coefficients and power spectrum of lift force at different boundary layer thicknesses only the cases at δ 0 5 1 5 and 3 are shown in the present paper are compared in fig 13 as δ 0 5 increases to 3 the drag force clearly decreases in the meanwhile the amplitude of the fluctuating drag force slightly decreases for the lift force it can be observed that its amplitude clearly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases for the three flows power peaks of lift force can be clearly observed the prominent frequency corresponding to the power peak varies among all the flows from δ 0 5 to 3 the prominent frequency decreases from 0 2135 to 0 1678 the mean drag c d and lift c l force coefficients are shown in fig 14 and the variational of the coefficients with the boundary layer thickness are considered as discussed above the pressure at the frontal edge of the cylinder decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing therefore it can be confirmed in the mean drag profile versus δ that the mean drag force decreases as δ increases in particular the mean lift force in all the flows are negative since the flow past the scour hole has decreasing velocity when the boundary layer thickness increases the mean lift force increases due to the higher pressure at the lower right side of the cylinder as δ increases it seems that the mean lift force has a trend to approach zero as the boundary layer thickness is high fig 15 shows the root mean square of the lift force coefficients and strouhal number for considered δ it can be seen that the root mean square of the lift force coefficients monotonously decreases as δ increases from 0 5 to 3 this implies that the fluctuation intensity of the lift force becomes low as the shear flow has a large boundary layer thickness or that the lift force coefficient curve has a small amplitude as the boundary layer thickness is large the decreasing of the c l r m s also implies the vortex shedding declines as the boundary layer thickness increases for the strouhal number it can be found that it roughly decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing this means that the vortex shedding slightly become slow when the flow has a high boundary layer thickness likewise it is interesting to know the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed in fig 16 the mean pressure coefficients along the scoured seabed figure are plotted for the flow with different boundary layer thicknesses the profiles show the boundary shear flow has little effect on the mean pressure upstream of the cylinder the mean pressure at 0 x d 2 slightly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases when x d 2 the mean pressure in the flows with δ 0 5 1 and 2 continues to decrease however it starts to increase due to the vortex at x d 2 in the flow with δ 3 fig 17 shows the mean friction velocity profiles along the seabed in 2 x d 4 similar to the mean pressure the boundary layer thickness has almost no effect on the friction velocity upstream the cylinder there exists a little difference downstream the cylinder but there is no trend to observe noticeably in the flow with δ 3 the mean friction velocity remains negative due to the presence of the vortex around x d 2 4 conclusion an investigation on the effect of the boundary shear flow on hydrodynamics of a pipeline over a scoured seabed has been numerically performed a residual based turbulence model through variational multiscale method for large eddy simulations was adopted in the study the discrete variational formulations of the incompressible navier stokes equations by finite element method were solved by a generalized α temporal integration method flows with the same parameters as the experiment are considered the in house codes of the residual based large eddy simulation was validated with the experimental results the flow characteristics and hydrodynamics of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed were then analyzed by a comparison with the results over a flat seabed the study further performed simulations for the flows with different boundary layer thicknesses the variation of the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces with the boundary layer thickness were analyzed through the obtained results the following conclusions can be provided 1 the results by the inhouse codes of the residual based large eddy simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results by jensen et al 1990 2 the flow through the gap with the scoured seabed has lower velocity than the flow through the gap with the flat seabed it turns out the separation point of the flow past the scour hole at the lower right side of the cylinder moves forward and that the vortex shedding become weaker in the meanwhile the drag lift rms of lift of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed are smaller than those over a flat seabed 3 with the effect of the boundary shear flow through the gap over the scour hole the size of the vortices downstream the cylinder become large and their vorticities become small as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the mean drag lift rms of lift and strouhal number clearly decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing additionally the variation of the vorticity contours downstream the cylinder and rms of lift indicate that the vortex shedding become weak as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the boundary layer thickness has little effect on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed it turns out that the boundary shear flow distorted by the scour hole causes different flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces from the flow past a circular cylinder over a flat seabed additionally the boundary layer thickness has evident effect on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamics of the cylinder the study may provide fundamental hydrodynamic theory for the use of the pipeline when the pipeline remain suspended over a fully scoured seabed for long term period for further study motion properties of the cylinder over the fully scoured seabed are expected to pursue in the future work credit authorship contribution statement linfeng chen methodology validation

flow on hydrodynamic of a pipeline over a fully scoured seabed is numerically investigated by residual based large eddy simulations a generalized α method is applied to solving variational multiscale formulations of the navier stokes equations with a residual based turbulence model flows with the same parameters as the experiment are considered in the study the hydrodynamic forces computed by the in house codes of the residual based large eddy simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results characteristics of the flow distorted by the scour hole and its effect on hydrodynamic forces are examined by comparisons with the flow past a circular cylinder over a flat seabed the results show that the scour hole causes lower velocity through the gap weaker vortex shedding smaller

effect on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed keywords pipeline over a fully scoured seabed residual based large eddy simulation boundary shear flow distorted by a scour hole vortex shedding hydrodynamic force 1 introduction pipelines at the sea bed are commonly exposed to currents and or waves when they lie on seabed its transverse motion may not be significant however when the seabed is erodible after a duration of scour underneath the pipelines the pipelines may become suspended over a scour hole as a result vortex induced vibration of the pipeline in the transverse direction becomes significant this is in fact one of the major problems encountered in pipeline engineering practice with a scour hole underneath the pipeline flow past the pipeline which involves interactions between the pipeline wake and the boundary layer flow near the scour hole is different from the flow past a pipeline on or close to a flat seabed there have been some work on the flow past a pipeline close to a flat seabed in the past few decades bearman and zdravkovich 1978 have carried out experimental studies on the influence of g g is the gap spacing between the cylinder bottom and the wall boundary which is nondimensionalized by the diameter of the circular cylinder d on the vortex shedding for reynolds number from 2 5 1 0 4 to 4 8 1 0 4 they noticed that the vortex shedding motion in the wake of the cylinder near the wall is suppressed when g 0 3 zdravkovich 1985 further investigated the variation of drag and lift forces on circular cylinders close to a wall with the boundary layer thickness δ 0 12 δ 0 97 nondimensionalized by d and adjusted by giving different inlet flows it was found in the study that the drag coefficient was affected by δ however its effect on the lift coefficient was less significant than that by g lei et al 1999 measured the drag and lift forces on the circular cylinder immersed in different boundary layer thickness 0 14 δ 2 89 they noted that the drag coefficient in the thinner boundary layers is slightly larger than that in the thicker boundary layers at small gap ratios for a cylinder fully or partly immersed in a boundary layer the drag coefficient increases with the ratio of the gap to the boundary layer thickness numerical studies on the flow past the circular cylinder close to a wall have also been undertaken brors 1999 and ong et al 2009 2010 2012 applied a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the standard k ϵ model to flows at r e 1 4 1 0 4 r e 1 31 1 0 4 r e 3 6 1 0 6 respectively prsic et al 2016 performed large eddy simulations les of flow around a circular cylinder close to a flat seabed at r e 1 31 1 0 4 the influence of the incoming boundary layer profile was investigated with logarithmic boundary layer inlet profile of thickness of 0 48 d and 1 6 d in their study they found that the flow characteristics are not only influenced by the presence of the plane wall but also dependent on the boundary layer thickness the different boundary layer thickness results in different velocities past the circular cylinder which leads to variations of c d and c l r m s in contrast to the flows past a pipeline close to a flat seabed a fewer studies on flow characteristics past a circular cylinder over a scoured seabed have been carried out li et al 2018 conducted a numerical study on flow past a circular cylinder placed in the vicinity of a fully scoured seabed to examine how differently fully scoured seabed profiles affect the hydrodynamic quantities of a freely vibrating circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers there are also some related studies focusing more on the development of the scour process mao 1986 and sumer et al 1988 undertook experimental investigations on the interaction between pipeline vibration and an erodible seabed scouring they observed that the pipeline vibration might induce extra erosion resulting in relatively larger scour depths and scour widths their results also showed that the effect of the scour hole on the amplitude and frequency of cylinder vibration was significant jensen et al 1990 did a study on flow around and forces on a pipeline near a scoured seabed with a steady inlet by experiment they compared the results between the cases of a cylinder over a scoured and a flat seabed the comparison indicated that the actual seabed forms should be taken into consideration when more accurate predictions are requested brors 1999 adopted a numerical method to consider both turbulent flow and seabed change by using rans and solving bed load sediment transport equation the study showed that the predicted seabed profile formed by scouring was in good agreement with laboratory measurements zhao and cheng 2010 performed a numerical investigation on the interaction between pipeline vibration and the scouring process of the seabed with a steady inlet their study confirmed experimental results of mao and summer et al that pipeline vibrations would increase the scour depth to investigate self burial efficiency of the pipeline yang et al 2012a b conducted experimental studies on the effect of a rubber plate and a rigid spoiler on the seabed scour in wave and current conditions their results revealed that the rigid spoiler can enhance the scour depth and extent in both wave and current conditions and that the scour depth increases with the spoiler height it may be noticed that much of work mentioned above has been focusing on the scouring process and its effect on the pipeline when the scour hole is formed the pipeline will remain suspended for long term period in such a case the pipeline will experience a different hydrodynamic loading continuously and its motion characters will be very much affected by the hole it is the purpose of the present study to undertake in depth study through numerical simulation on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic behavior of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed a residual based turbulence model through the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation is adopted in the present study the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation was derived by hughes et al 2000 as a method that utilizes a priori scale separation in lieu of spatial filtering as commonly done in traditional les by the priori scale separation the governing equations are split into two systems of equations large and small scale equations in numerical simulation only the large scale equations are expected to be computed the small scales which are associated with the infinite dimensional complement of the large scales are about to be modeled approximately by the residual of the equations for large scales consequently the terms involving small scales in the equation for large scale equations are then replaced by this approximation the variational multiscale method for large eddy simulation has been validated in decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence hughes et al 2001a and channel turbulent flow hughes et al 2001b subsequently it has also been used in variety of problems since calo 2005 and bazilevs et al 2007 proposed variational multiscale residual based turbulence modeling for large eddy simulation of incompressible flows bazilevs and hughes 2007 presented a modification of weakly imposed dirichlet boundary conditions incorporating the well known law of the wall to circumvent inaccurate mean flow quantities for coarse boundary layer meshes bazilevs et al 2010 continued carrying out a study on isogeometric variational multiscale modeling with weakly enforced boundary conditions on unstreched meshes and formed a basis of a possible practical strategy for computing engineering flows somewhere between rans and les in complexity with its development extensions to engineering application have been increasingly done in the past decade such as les of compressible separated flows by koobus and farhat 2004 and rajasekharan and farhat 2009 flame vortex interaction by gravemeier and wall 2011 multi ion transport in dilute electrolyte solutions by bauer et al 2013 nonequilibrium thermal plasma flow by trelles and modirkhazeni 2014 multiphase flows by khalloufi et al 2016 riber et al 2016 and rasthofer et al 2018 and incompressible stratified flows by yan et al 2016 these applications verified a high potential of the approach in engineering problems considering the fact that the cylinder is in a non uniform ambient flow which can be severely distorted by the scour hole the present study aims to investigate in depth how this kind of flow affects the wake and hydrodynamic forces of the circular cylinder in particular shear flows with different boundary layer thicknesses are considered and the effect of boundary layer thickness on the wake and hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder are taken into consideration in the present study the paper is organized as follows variational multiscale formulations for large eddy simulation in a finite element framework temporal integration method and problem setup are provided in section 2 validation results and discussion on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces are given in section 3 finally conclusions are presented in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 governing equation the two dimensional 2d continuity equation and navier stokes equations for the incompressible viscous flows are used the non dimensional forms of these equations based on the incoming velocity u c of the flow body dimension l and kinetic viscosity ν of the fluid can be written as 1 u 0 2 l u p u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 0 where u denotes the velocity p denotes the pressure r e u c l ν is reynolds number 2 2 discrete formulation the numerical method used in the study is based on a finite element method multiplying eqs 1 and 2 by the weighting function w w q which corresponds to the solution u u p and integrating the results over the fluid domain we have their standard galerkin formulations 3 b w u w u t ω w u u ω w p ω w 1 r e 2 u ω q u ω 0 where ω denotes the fluid domain ω represents an integration in the space domain decomposing the solution u u p into a large scale component u and a small scale component u 4 u u u accordingly 5 w w w eq 3 is split into two coupled nonlinear subsystems 6 b w u u 0 7 b w u u 0 where eqs 6 and 7 are designated as large u and small scale u equations respectively the large scale equations are defined in a finite dimensional space where we undertake practical computation the small scale equation is associated with the infinite dimensional complement of the large scale space in the whole solution space with which an approximation to the fine scales driven by the residual of the large scale equation is inverted employing the definition of b into eq 6 yields 8 b w u u b w u w u t ω w 1 r e 2 u ω w p ω w u u ω w u u ω w u u ω q u ω 0 supposing that u t 0 and 1 r e 2 u 0 the first two terms of the third to last line vanish to avoid the presence of the derivative of u and p as well as the second derivative of u the terms involved with u p and 2 u are integrated by parts ignoring the effects of u and p on the boundary eq 9 become 9 b w u u w u t ω w u u ω w p ω w 1 r e u ω q u ω w p ω w u u ω w u u ω w u u ω q u ω w u n u 1 r e u n γ 0 where denotes the tensor product or u u u i u j γ represents the fluid domain boundary and n denotes the outward normal vector to the fluid domain boundary eq 9 may be thought of playing a similar role in the variational multiscale theory as the filtered equations play in the traditional large eddy simulation in eq 9 the second fourth lines on the right hand side represent consistent small scale representations in which the first two terms of the third line correspond to the cross stress in the traditional subgrid scale stress w u u ω corresponds to the reynolds stress if the equations only partially include the nonlinear advection term the first term of the third line the method then reduces to a supg method chen and wu 2019 given the small scales u p eq 9 enables solution for the large scales on the other hand the small scales are driven by the large scales through eq 7 as solving eq 7 is as tricky as solving the original navier stokes equations the effort will focus on obtaining approximate analytical expressions for the fine scales by means of eq 7 then substituting them into the large scale equations in this study residual based expressions for u and p proposed by hughes 1995 and are used 10 u τ m l u p 11 p τ c u where l u p is the residual of eq 2 associated with u p in the above two equations τ m and τ c are defined as follows shakib 1989 taylor et al 1998 12 τ m c 1 u g u c 2

taken as c 1 1 c 2 36 and c 3 4 g is a covariant metric tensor of the gradient of local element spatial coordinates ξ with respect to the global coordinates x for the same point 14 g ξ x t ξ x and ξ x is the jacobian matrix t r g in eq 13 represents a summation of the diagonal elements of g 2 3 time discretization in the present study we employ a generalized α method which was applied to fluid dynamics in jansen et al 2000 bazilevs et al 2010 and chen and hu 2017 to solve eq 9 define a as the nodal values of u p t a are the temporal derivative of a at the same nodes performing integrations in eq 9 results in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations 15 a a b a introducing the generalized α method for the above system yields 16 r a n α m a n α f a a n α m b a n α f 0 17 a n 1

f i and a n α m i the solutions at t n 1 are determined using eqs 18 and 19 and computation moves to the next time step 2 4 problem setup simulations through the above described procedure are performed for a circular cylinder of diameter d in a computational domain with a fully scoured seabed the profile of which refers to the measured seabed profile of the scour hole by an actual scour test performed by mao 1986 the bottom edge of the circular cylinder is at y 0 where the cylinder originally laid on the seabed the lowest position of the scour hole is at y 0 74 the cylinder longitudinally locates at x 0 which is 10 d downstream the flow inlet and the flow outlet is located 20 d downstream the center of the cylinder these distances are sufficient to neglect the effects of the boundary truncation far upstream and downstream of the cylinder the top boundary is located at a height of 10 d from the bottom of the cylinder this ensures that it has negligible effect on the flow past the cylinder in the simulations the characteristic length l d and no slip boundary conditions are applied to the cylinder surface as well as the bottom wall at the flow inlet an equilibrium layer with a logarithmic velocity profile is specified below a chosen boundary layer thickness δ above this height a constant free stream velocity is specified the velocity profile is given by u y m i n u κ l n y z w u c 1 if y z w u y 0 otherwise v y 0 where y is perpendicular to the flat seabed where y 0 the friction velocity is evaluated as u κ u c l n δ z w κ 0 41 is the von karman constant δ represents the boundary layer thickness and z w is the seabed roughness coefficient for the top side of the domain a boundary condition of u y 0 v 0 is used thus on the boundary either the dirichlet condition dc in which the velocity is prescribed or the neumann condition nc in which the normal derivative of the velocity is prescribed is imposed in the former dc is used explicitly on the boundary in the finite element formation in eq 9 and those w corresponding to the nodes on the boundary are not included in the weight process of galerkin method in the latter nc is applied directly in the finite element formulation in eq 9 at the flow outlet the following outflow boundary conditions bazilevs et al 2010 is employed 26 u n u 1 r e u n 0 where the term u n denotes the negative part of u n that is 27 u n u n if u n 0 u n 0 otherwise the first term on the left hand side in eq 26 is non zero only in the case of reverse flow through the outlet substituting eq 26 into eq 9 on the outlet boundary the contribution from this boundary will then contain only 28 γ o u t l e t w u n u d γ o u t l e t where 29 u n u n if u n 0 u n 0 otherwise in the present study a body fitted structured multi block mesh of quadrilateral elements is used which is generated by icem cfd a sketch of the mesh for the case e 1 is illustrated in fig 1 for all the simulations the size of the elements near the cylinder and the wall boundary is set such that η u τ η r e 1 where u τ denotes the friction velocity at the wall and η denotes the element thickness in the normal direction to the wall 3 results and discussion considering that the shear flow through a scour hole may be different from that through a flat seabed and varies with the boundary layer thickness discussions in this section involve two concerns one is about the ambient flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities of the cylinder over the fully scoured seabed with a comparison to those of the cylinder over a flat seabed the other concern is analysis of the effect of the boundary layer thickness on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities numerical simulations for the flow past the cylinder over a scoured and flat seabed are performed with the same parameters as jensen et al s experiments the reynolds number r e u d ν based on the cylinder diameter is 6000 a logarithmic velocity profile with two cylinder diameters of boundary layer thickness is set at ten cylinder diameters upstream as the incident shear flow 3 1 convergence study to ensure the correction of numerical simulations in the present study both time step and mesh convergence study have been performed for numerical simulations of the flow past a cylinder over a fully scoured seabed three time steps δ t 0 0025 0 002 and 0 001 for a mesh with 42042 elements and three meshes containing approximately 32000 42000 and 50000 elements with δ t 0 002 are used to compute the drag c d and lift c l coefficients which are based on the definition of f d 0 5 ρ c d u c 2 d and f l 0 5 ρ c l u c 2 d where f d and f l are drag and lift forces consisting of both pressure and viscous components around the cylinder ρ represents the fluid density profiles of the mean drag c d and lift c l against the number of elements and time step δ t are shown in fig 2 according to the variation of c d and c l with δ t and the element number δ t 0 002 is proved to be convergent and a mesh with 42042 elements is considered to give a sufficient grid resolution therefore a mesh with 42042 elements and δ t 0 002 are adopted in the present study 3 2 flow characteristics and hydrodynamic quantities to better understand the effect of the scour hole on the ambient flow of the cylinder flow past a cylinder locating 0 74d high the same height as that in the scour hole case over the flat seabed is presented here for a comparison fig 3 illustrates mean flow velocity magnitude contours streamline patterns of the mean flow fig 3a longitudinal mean velocity profiles fig 3b along the transverse axes at x d 1 0 5 0 0 5 and 1 it can be seen from the mean flow that the upper vortices downstream the cylinder are similar between two cases however the lower vortex in the scoured hole case has the larger size than that in the flat seabed case and its center in the scoured hole case is lower than that in the flat seabed case in the flow with the scour hole a vortex can be observed near the seabed upstream the cylinder since there is a smaller inlet upstream the gap with the scour hole than the gap with the flat seabed the velocity beneath the cylinder over the scour hole is smaller than that beneath the cylinder over the flat seabed which is observed through the velocity profiles along the transverse axes particularly the velocity close to the seabed is negative at x d 1 since a vortex takes place at this location the small velocity beneath the cylinder causes that the lower separation point of the wake in the scoured hole case moves forward and the lower vortex in the wake moves downward fig 4 shows vorticity contours of instantaneous flow past the cylinders over the flat and scoured seabed in one period at the beginning in the period the vortices shed in a lower right direction and start to move upwards at this moment the vortices downstream the cylinder over the scour hole appear to be threadlike and in the wake of the cylinder over the flat seabed normal vortices shed downstream at t t 2 the vortices shedding from the upper right side have the similar vorticities between two cases differently no strong vortices shed downstream from the lower right side of the cylinder compared to the wake of the cylinder over the flat seabed as t turns to 3 t 4 the vortices shed in a upper right direction the vorticities of the vortices from the lower right side of the cylinder grow up in the scoured hole case and a few vortices appear near the flat seabed downstream the cylinder when the vortices shed upwards at the end of the period the vortices move downwards again a few vortices can be clearly observed near the flat seabed downstream the cylinder and no vortex appears near the scoured seabed in practical the hydrodynamic forces are very significant for analysis of the pipeline vortex induced vibration firstly the mean pressure coefficient c p p 0 5 ρ u c 2 d fig 5 around the cylinder from the two cases are concerned here p is the pressure at the peripheral angle of the cylinder θ measured anti clockwise from the front point on the longitudinal axis of the cylinder it can be seen that the pressure around the cylinder over the scoured seabed is larger than that over the flat seabed except the pressure at 180 θ 225 where it is smaller than that over the flat seabed as shown in the flow configuration for the cylinder over the scoured seabed the flow near the seabed upstream the cylinder moves downwards to travel through the scour hole with a small compression when the flow comes to the cylinder which may result in low pressure at the lower left side of the cylinder therefore the mean pressure coefficient profile around the cylinder appears to be asymmetric fig 6 shows temporal evolution of the force drag and lift coefficients acting on the cylinders over the flat and scoured seabed it can be seen that when the flow is fully developed the drag of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is smaller than that over the flat seabed for the lift the peak of the lift curve of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is smaller than that over the flat seabed the troughs of the lift curve are comparable between the two cases as the pressure component takes a high percentage of the hydrodynamic forces the lower pressure at the lower left side of the cylinder over the scoured seabed mentioned above may leads to smaller drag and lift forces table 1 presents mean drag c d mean lift c l root mean square of lift force 30 c l r m s 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 c l c l 2 d t and strouhal number 31 s t f v d u c where f v represents vortex shedding frequency to validate the present numerical method experimental results obtained by flow visualizations of jensen et al are listed in the table as well clearly the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number by the present numerical simulation are in good agreement with experimental results the mean lift coefficient is slightly overpredicted between the cases with the flat and scoured seabed the c d c l and c l r m s of the cylinder over the scoured seabed are lower than those over the flat seabed particularly the mean lift of the cylinder over the scoured seabed is downward negative however it appears reversely positive in the case of the flat seabed which indicates that the cylinder over the scoured seabed is dominated by the downward force and the positive lift dominates in the case of the flat seabed for the vortex shedding in the wake the two flows have similar strouhal numbers the lift forces are further examined through their power spectrum calculating by a fourier transformation the power spectrums of the lift at low dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the high power spectrum is present at low frequencies and there appear peaks at f 1 83 in the two cases which means that the vortex shedding in the two flows are dominated by the same frequency differently the vortex shedding at f 0 183 in the scoured hole case takes less power than that in the flat seabed case the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed are important for the sediment transportation of the erodible seabed here the mean pressure coefficient c p w m p w p 0 5 ρ u c 2 profiles fig 8 along the flat and scoured seabed are also examined where p w represents the pressure along the seabed it is interesting to find that the pressure along the flat seabed drops sharply beneath the cylinder while the pressure along the scoured seabed varies slightly and stay stable along the seabed which agreeably confirms that the seabed is fully scoured the shear stress τ w μ u n along the seabed is a key physical quantity that drives the sediment transportation at the seabed where n denotes the outward normal vector to the seabed here the friction velocity at the seabed is analyzed instead of the shear stress which is defined as u w τ w τ w τ w ρ in fig 9 the mean friction velocity profiles along the flat and scoured seabed are shown it is observed that in the case of the flat seabed the mean friction velocity profile rapidly increases from x 1 to 0 and reaches a maximum around x 0 it falls down quickly as x 0 in practical the high mean friction velocity equivalent to high shear stress underneath the cylinder in the case of the flat seabed may result in sediment transportation if the seabed is erodible since the scour underneath the pipeline has been fully developed the mean friction velocity are comparably small along the seabed as shown in the mean flow that a vortex appear around x d 1 1 it can be particularly seen in the mean friction velocity profile that the magnitude of the mean friction velocity is negative around x d 1 1 3 3 effect of boundary layer thickness in this subsection simulations with different boundary layer thicknesses are undertaken to consider the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamics of the cylinder in the simulations different shear flow profiles are given at the flow inlet and the logarithmic velocity profiles with six different boundary layer thicknesses δ 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 which have been dimensionalized by the cylinder diameter d are used as the incident velocity profiles fig 10 shows the velocity magnitude contours streamlines velocity profiles along the transverse axis at different longitudinal location x 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 of the mean flows with different boundary layer thicknesses as the boundary layer thickness increases the velocity of the flow past the cylinder decreases which can be confirmed by the velocity profiles fig 10e along the transverse axis through the velocity magnitude contours and streamline patterns it can be seen that the vortex structures in the wake of the flow with δ 0 5 1 and 2 are still very similar although the velocity profiles show that the longitudinal velocity past the cylinder decreases as δ increases from 0 5 to 2 when δ increases to 3 the wake is very different from those in other cases large vortices take place in the wake and the center of the vortices move backward in this case additionally a vortex takes place at the scour hole downstream the cylinder in the flow with δ 3 the velocity profiles along the transverse axis confirm that the velocity of the flow past the cylinder decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing although the flow is interfered by the cylinder vorticity contours of instantaneous snapshot with different boundary layer thicknesses are plotted to account for the vortex evolution during one period of the flow to have a compact comparison only the flows with δ 0 5 and 3 are shown in the present paper see fig 11 at the beginning of the flow period the vortices start to shed downwards it is noted that the vortices downstream the cylinder at δ 0 5 has smaller size and higher vorticity than those at δ 3 for the flow with δ 3 it is observed that there appear a vortex at the seabed downstream the cylinder at t t 2 the vortices in the wake start to move upwards strong vortices continue to shed from the lower right side of the cylinder at δ 0 5 for the flow with δ 3 the vortex downstream the cylinder interact with the boundary shear flow near the seabed which makes the vortex size at the seabed larger when t comes to 3 t 4 the vortices shed right backwards a pair of vortices can be clearly seen in the two flows the lower vortex with the positive vorticity is in front of the upper vortex in the flow with δ 0 5 differently the situation is opposite in the flow with δ 3 at the end of the flow period the vortices shed upwards clearly a few new vortices grow up at the lower right side of the cylinder at δ 0 5 while the old vortex continue to shed backward in the flow at δ 3 the lower vortex downstream the cylinder continuously interact with the vortex at the seabed as a result the vortices downstream the cylinder at δ 0 5 have the smaller size and higher vorticities than those at δ 3 the interaction between the lower vortex and the shear flow downstream the cylinder makes a vortex occur downstream at the seabed the mean pressure coefficient profiles around the cylinder in the flows with δ 0 5 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 12 through the figure it is noted that the pressure profiles at the top side 22 5 θ 157 5 of the cylinder almost overlap which indicates that the effect of the boundary layer thickness on the pressure is weak at the frontal edge 157 5 θ 202 5 it can be seen that the mean pressure slightly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases the boundary layer thickness has a relatively clear effect on the pressure at the lower right side of the cylinder where the mean pressure increases with the boundary layer thickness increasing to make a further understanding of the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder the temporal evolution of the drag and lift force coefficients and power spectrum of lift force at different boundary layer thicknesses only the cases at δ 0 5 1 5 and 3 are shown in the present paper are compared in fig 13 as δ 0 5 increases to 3 the drag force clearly decreases in the meanwhile the amplitude of the fluctuating drag force slightly decreases for the lift force it can be observed that its amplitude clearly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases for the three flows power peaks of lift force can be clearly observed the prominent frequency corresponding to the power peak varies among all the flows from δ 0 5 to 3 the prominent frequency decreases from 0 2135 to 0 1678 the mean drag c d and lift c l force coefficients are shown in fig 14 and the variational of the coefficients with the boundary layer thickness are considered as discussed above the pressure at the frontal edge of the cylinder decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing therefore it can be confirmed in the mean drag profile versus δ that the mean drag force decreases as δ increases in particular the mean lift force in all the flows are negative since the flow past the scour hole has decreasing velocity when the boundary layer thickness increases the mean lift force increases due to the higher pressure at the lower right side of the cylinder as δ increases it seems that the mean lift force has a trend to approach zero as the boundary layer thickness is high fig 15 shows the root mean square of the lift force coefficients and strouhal number for considered δ it can be seen that the root mean square of the lift force coefficients monotonously decreases as δ increases from 0 5 to 3 this implies that the fluctuation intensity of the lift force becomes low as the shear flow has a large boundary layer thickness or that the lift force coefficient curve has a small amplitude as the boundary layer thickness is large the decreasing of the c l r m s also implies the vortex shedding declines as the boundary layer thickness increases for the strouhal number it can be found that it roughly decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing this means that the vortex shedding slightly become slow when the flow has a high boundary layer thickness likewise it is interesting to know the effect of the boundary shear flow on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed in fig 16 the mean pressure coefficients along the scoured seabed figure are plotted for the flow with different boundary layer thicknesses the profiles show the boundary shear flow has little effect on the mean pressure upstream of the cylinder the mean pressure at 0 x d 2 slightly decreases as the boundary layer thickness increases when x d 2 the mean pressure in the flows with δ 0 5 1 and 2 continues to decrease however it starts to increase due to the vortex at x d 2 in the flow with δ 3 fig 17 shows the mean friction velocity profiles along the seabed in 2 x d 4 similar to the mean pressure the boundary layer thickness has almost no effect on the friction velocity upstream the cylinder there exists a little difference downstream the cylinder but there is no trend to observe noticeably in the flow with δ 3 the mean friction velocity remains negative due to the presence of the vortex around x d 2 4 conclusion an investigation on the effect of the boundary shear flow on hydrodynamics of a pipeline over a scoured seabed has been numerically performed a residual based turbulence model through variational multiscale method for large eddy simulations was adopted in the study the discrete variational formulations of the incompressible navier stokes equations by finite element method were solved by a generalized α temporal integration method flows with the same parameters as the experiment are considered the in house codes of the residual based large eddy simulation was validated with the experimental results the flow characteristics and hydrodynamics of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed were then analyzed by a comparison with the results over a flat seabed the study further performed simulations for the flows with different boundary layer thicknesses the variation of the flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces with the boundary layer thickness were analyzed through the obtained results the following conclusions can be provided 1 the results by the inhouse codes of the residual based large eddy simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results by jensen et al 1990 2 the flow through the gap with the scoured seabed has lower velocity than the flow through the gap with the flat seabed it turns out the separation point of the flow past the scour hole at the lower right side of the cylinder moves forward and that the vortex shedding become weaker in the meanwhile the drag lift rms of lift of the cylinder over a fully scoured seabed are smaller than those over a flat seabed 3 with the effect of the boundary shear flow through the gap over the scour hole the size of the vortices downstream the cylinder become large and their vorticities become small as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the mean drag lift rms of lift and strouhal number clearly decreases with the boundary layer thickness increasing additionally the variation of the vorticity contours downstream the cylinder and rms of lift indicate that the vortex shedding become weak as the boundary layer thickness of the flow increases the boundary layer thickness has little effect on the hydrodynamic forces along the seabed it turns out that the boundary shear flow distorted by the scour hole causes different flow characteristics and hydrodynamic forces from the flow past a circular cylinder over a flat seabed additionally the boundary layer thickness has evident effect on the flow characteristics and hydrodynamics of the cylinder the study may provide fundamental hydrodynamic theory for the use of the pipeline when the pipeline remain suspended over a fully scoured seabed for long term period for further study motion properties of the cylinder over the fully scoured seabed are expected to pursue in the future work credit authorship contribution statement linfeng chen methodology validation

21869,in this paper the cavitating flow around a three dimension clark y hydrofoil is investigated by the large eddy simulation les method coupled with the volume of fluid vof model in openfoam the simulated results are compared with the experimental data and a reasonable agreement is obtained the cavitation vortex interaction is studied with the vorticity transport equation and much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed the adaptive mesh refinement amr method is adopted for improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulation comparing with the results presented by the mesh with fine resolution even the coarse resolution mesh with amr method can precisely characterize identical complex cavity structures and flow details the local high pressure induced by the reverse flow and small residual vortex structures are obtained by the coarse resolution mesh with the amr method further analyzes of the variation trend of total grid numbers using the amr in one typical cycle show that the rates of the cloud cavitation shedding and collapse are faster than that of the attached cavity growth this research illustrates that the amr is a potential approach to accurately model multi scale cavitating flows and to better understand cavitation mechanism on the premise of limited computational costs keywords cavitation cavitation vortex interaction adaptive mesh refinement amr openfoam 1 introduction cavitation leads to a very complicated vapor liquid two phase flow structure involving turbulence phase change and severe pressure fluctuations chen et al 2019 li et al 2019c unsteady cavitating flow is responsible for undesirable effects or even damages in hydraulic machinery such as turbines pumps and marine propeller blades luo et al 2016 therefore much attention has been paid to the mechanism of periodic development of attached cavity sheet shedding and collapse of vapor cloud in the past decades and numerous investigations for the evolution of both sheet and cloud cavitation on the hydrofoil have been conducted the cavity shedding process is often related to complex vortex evolution therefore the cavitation vortex interaction has always been one of the most important problems in the investigations of cavitation gopalan and katz 2000 used piv and high speed photography to demonstrate that the collapse of vapor cavities in the closure region resulted in the generation of vortices huang and wang 2011 investigated the vorticity distributions by means of the piv technique which showed that the large scale vortex dynamics was the reason for the instability of cavitating flow recently arabnejad et al 2019 studied the leading edge cavitation on a naca0009 hydrofoil using the high speed visualization hsv they observed a second shedding of small scale cavity structures transformed into horse shoe vortices for the first time which illustrated that there was a strong relationship between the cavitation and vortex in spite of experiments can capture many of the phenomena occurring it suffers from the limitations in measuring techniques especially in unsteady and high speed system which limits its wide application in investigating cavitation on the other hand with the development of the computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulation has been an effective and reliable approach to investigate the complex flow problems huang et al 2019 li et al 2019b liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 and most simulations have been adopted in investigating cavitation vortex structures in recent years ji et al 2013 applied the partially average navier stokes pans method to simulate shedding horse shoe vortex structures around a twisted hydrofoil long et al 2017 studied the evolution of the vortex by vorticity transport equation in attached cavitation shedding progress around a clark y hydrofoil with the fbdcm and an integral method wang et al 2018 attempted to solve the compressible governing equations to investigate cavitation vortex dynamics in unsteady cavitating flow sun et al 2019 studied unsteady cavitation shedding dynamics around a naca0015 hydrofoil in thermo sensitive fluid which illustrated that thermal effects showed an important influence on cavitation and complex multi scale vortex structures liu and wang 2019 employed a non linear k ε turbulence model to simulate cavity shedding process and the results showed cavitation was an inducement of vortex generation nevertheless some researchers suggested that the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation could not predicted the characteristics of unsteady sheet cloud cavitation and cavitation vortex interaction in some conditions dahm 2007 shyy et al 2007 on the other side large eddy simulation les is attracting more and more interest with noticeable success in predicting smaller scale eddies and unsteady phenomena of cavitating flows in recent years li and li 2016 ji et al 2015 indicated the re entrant jet induced the cavitation shedding and it was rolled up into vortex structures they found that the vortex stretching and dilatation were responsible for the mechanism of transition cloud cavitation from 2d to 3d in the process of shedding vapor cloud ji et al 2017 simulated large scale cavity vortex structures in the hydrofoil wake based on a clark y hydrofoil bai et al 2018 conducted a cartesian cut cell mesh method to study the cavitation vortex interaction in tip leakage cavitating flow the results revealed that the dilatation term played a much more important role in the evolution of tip leakage vortex cavitation cheng et al 2019 investigated the flow characteristics in tip leakage cavitating flow and observed more complex induced vortices in non cavitation region cheng et al 2020 conducted eulerian and lagrangian viewpoints to study the evolution of different types of vortices and systematically analyzed the mechanism of how cavitation influenced vorticity and turbulence except predicting small scale vortex structures in cavitation the les model can also capture the characteristics of cavitating flows accurately and many researchers used the les method to study the evolution of both sheet and cloud cavitation li et al 2016 applied the les method and the volume of fluid vof model to reproduce the quasi periodic phenomenon roohi et al 2016 investigated the transient cavitating flows over different configurations and cavity patterns by the implicit les model and the vof method kim and lee 2015 simulated cloud cavitation around a hydrophobic hydrofoil with les vof model they confirmed that cloud cavitation instability was alleviated as the hydrophobicity increased recently compressible vof method coupled with the les model have been conducted to simulate unsteady cavitation pendar and roohi 2015 roohi et al 2013 conducted a compressible vof method to track the cavity interface with the results indicating that the combination of vof and les could present cloud cavitation dynamics precisely movahedian et al 2019 successfully captured the cavitating turbulent flow around a twisted naca 16012 hydrofoil by the compressive velocity vof technique besides these fundamental studies of the sheet cloud cavitation various kinds of cavitation were also investigated with compressible les vof method including the cavitating flows around a sphere pendar and roohi 2018 behind a 3d disk roohi et al 2016 a 3d hemispherical head form body pendar and roohi 2016 wang et al 2016 and also for liquid injection cailloux et al 2015 meanwhile these works also indicated that selection of a suitable turbulence model les was a crucial issue to capture flow details and study the internal flow principle however in order to capture important flow phenomena high resolution grids were usually necessary for les in most cases which resulted in high requirement in computational resources to solve this problem a new mesh refinement technique called adaptive mesh refinement amr was proposed berger and colella 1989 by allocating high resolution grids only to the region of the greatest concern the adaptive mesh refinement amr method was believed to be a promising technique for improving calculation efficiency in the simulation of cavitating flow the amr was initially proposed for investigating shock hydrodynamics berger and colella 1989 and successfully applied on both structured popinet 2009 and unstructured meshes zheng et al 2005 furthermore it was widely used in vapor liquid two phase flows by coupling with the vof model such as thermal inkjet tan 2016 primary atomization fuster et al 2009 bubble dynamics zhang et al 2018 and also cavitation li et al 2019a however the investigations on the unsteady cloud cavitating flow around a hydrofoil with amr method were still rarely reported inspired by the precious works in the present paper the unsteady cavitating flow is numerically studied with amr using the les vof combined method the evolution of vortex distribution in the process of cloud cavitation especially the role of baroclinic torque term is discussed in detail moreover a set of coarse mesh with amr is applied to simulate the unsteady cavitating flow in order to check its applicability and advantages in the prediction of cavitation the local high pressure induced by the reversed flow and the variation of total grid numbers using amr are also addressed 2 adaptive mesh refinement to address the challenging issue that the traditional simulation methods base on the static grids face the amr approach is used to concentrate the computational cost dynamically in the region where it is mostly needed and refine the details of flow at a minimum computation resource in the present paper the method discussed here can be implemented on general quadrilateral grids for 2d cases and hexahedral grids for 3d cases the amr applies a patch oriented refinement method and the domain is consisted of non overlapping rectangular grids g l k 1 g l m g l k where l 0 1 l max denotes a sequence of refinement levels in the framework of openfoam the amr depends upon three key portions jasak 1996 li et al 2019a namely refinement engine mesh cutter refinement tree and they play different roles in the process of computation the refinement engine saves the permanent mesh data and it is used to create the connectivity structures of the mesh the mesh cutter plays an important role in splitting quadrilateral grids or hexahedral grids the history of refinement is saved in the refinement tree all three parts cooperate with each other smoothly fig 1 presents the collaboration diagram of the three key portions in the amr method when the calculation reaches the refine interval the system reads the refinement criteria in this paper we set the α v vapor volume fraction as the refined field and the grids are refined when the value of α v varies from 0 01 to 0 99 which illustrates the application only refines the grids located at the interface the refinement engine holds all grids and selects the specific grids for refinement in order to split the grids accurately as shown in fig 2 a a uniform way of indexing the corner points is introduced to guide the mesh cutter to add computational nodes at the mid point of each edge of the grid therefore in three spatial dimensions the mesh cutter is able to split hexahedral grids into eight subgrids for 3d sequentially afterwards those subgrids which comply with the refinement criteria are subdivided recursively until a user defined refine level is reached finally refinement tree records the history of the refinement done so far the refinement tree can be described by mitchell 2007 2 t g ω c v i which contains a set of nodes ω v i i 0 m and each v i ω contains a set of children c v i ω where g is the grid fig 2 b depicts the schematic diagram of an oct tree grid decomposition of the domain in 3d where the level 0 denotes the original mesh it should be noted that child grids receive the cell centered value of the parent grid in the grid refinement stage as a consequence although the location and shape of the liquid vapor interface change continuously in the computational process this method can still accurately simulate turbulent cavitating flows 3 mathematical formulations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations and les model in the framework of homogeneous equilibrium flow model the multiphase components in the mixture model are assumed to possess the same velocity and pressure the set of governing equations for vapor liquid two phase flows are shown as follows 3 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j 5 μ γ μ v 1 γ μ l 6 ρ γ ρ v 1 γ ρ l where u i is the velocity component in the i direction and p is the mixture pressure ρ and μ are the mixture density and the mixture dynamic viscosity the subscripts l and v represent the liquid and vapor respectively γ represents the vapor volume fraction as shown in fig 3 in les the large energy containing eddy structures are resolved on the grids whereas the smaller subgrid structures are modeled different scales are separated by applying a low pass in frequency filter to the exact solution the general low pass filtering operation of the variable u x t is defined by pope 2000 sagaut 2006 7 u x t ϕ r x u x r t d r where x is the space vector r is the error between the actually flow spatial coordinates and the filtered large scale flow spatial coordinates t is the time and ϕ r x is the specified filter function so the low pass filter operation decomposes the velocity field u x t into the sum of a filtered or resolved component u x t and a residual or subgrid scale sgs component u x t 8 u x t u x t u x t by means of this operation the les equations are theoretically derived from the navier stokes equations 9 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where the over bars denote the filtered quantities and τ i j is the subgrid scale stresses which can be defined as 11 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j one widely used subgrid scale model is the eddy viscosity model with assumptions that the subgrid scale stresses are proportional to the modulus of the strain rate tensor s i j of the filtered large scale flow 12 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ s g s s i j where s i j is the rate of the strain tensor for the resolved scale which can be written as 13 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity μ s g s is closed by the wall adopting local eddy viscosity wale model in the current paper the wale model takes into account the shear stress tensor as well as the rotation tensor and it follows the near wall distance y 3 law nicoud and ducros 1999 weickert et al 2010 long et al 2018 reported the wale model could reproduce the laminar to turbulence transition correctly and successfully simulated the transient cavitating turbulent flow in the wale model μ s g s is modeled as 14 μ s g s c w δ 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 15 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 16 g i j u i x j s i j ω i j where s i j d is the traceless symmetric part of the square of the velocity gradient tensor and c w is the default wale constant which is set as 0 325 opencfd 2018 3 2 vof model according to previous studies the vof method is an effective tool in the simulations of multiphase flow and has been widely used to simulate the free surface flow passandiden fard and roohi 2006 nowadays many vof methods for tracking vapor liquid interface have been developed and the most known are simple line interface calculation slic noh and woodward 1976 hirt nichols hirt and nichols 1981 piecewise linear interface construction plic youngs 1982 and compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 among them the cicsam scheme is characterized by high resolution differencing schemes to calculate volume fluxes its implementation is quite flexible and straightforward on arbitrary mesh in openfoam and it is applied in the current paper the cicsam scheme defines a supplementary interface compression velocity u c in the vicinity of the interface which the local flow could steepen the gradient of volume fraction and improve the interface resolution the conservation equation for the γ are shown as follows 17 γ t γ u u c γ 1 γ m c ρ v where m c is the source term which controls the mass transport rate u c γ 1 γ is the artificial compression term and it is non zero only at the interface the compressible term represents the role of shrinking the phase interphase towards a sharper one and it only induces the flow in the direction normal to the interface the compression velocity is computed by weller 2008 18 u c min c γ u max u γ γ where the c γ is a constant which controls the intensity of compression it yields no compression if it is zero or a conservation compression if it sets to 1 for highly compressible cavitating flow the value of c γ is 1 and the surface tension f s in the two phase system is evaluated using the csf model brackbill et al 1992 19 f s σ κ γ where σ is surface tension coefficient and the curvature κ of the free surface is defined as 20 κ γ γ 3 3 physical cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 cavitation model is adopted in this paper in order to simulate the water vapor mass transfer this cavitation model is written as 21 ρ v γ t ρ v γ u j x j m m where the source terms m and m are derived from the rayleigh plesset equation which denote the evaporation and condensation rates they are defined as follows 22 m ρ v ρ l ρ γ 1 γ 3 r b 2 3 max p v p 0 ρ l 23 m ρ v ρ l ρ γ 1 γ 3 r b 2 3 max p p v 0 ρ l where r b is the bubble radius which is described as 24 r b γ 1 γ 3 4 π 1 n b 1 3 where n b represents the bubble number density which is set as 1013 according to the study by schnerr and sauer 2001 3 4 numerical setup the numerical simulation is conducted through the open source cfd toolbox openfoam jasak 1996 which is based on finite volume method the simulation presented in this paper follows the piso algorithm which is a pressure velocity coupling algorithm to solve unsteady problems interphasechangedymfoam is adopted to simulate cavitation the time discretization and spatial discretization choose euler scheme and gauss upwind scheme respectively the time step δ t is computed automatically during the simulation to specify the courant number over the domain less than 0 9 the procedure of refining the grids is implemented on the field of vapor volume fraction which ranges from 0 01 to 0 99 therefore only the grids on the interface are refined to get more accurate results the simulation is performed under the normal temperature and pressure t 293 k p v 2300 pa a clark y hydrofoil with a chord length of c 0 07 m and a span length of 0 3c is placed horizontally at an angle of attack equal to 8 as shown in fig 4 the adopted length and height in the computational section are 10c and 2 7c all the settings are the same as the experiment huang et al 2013 the velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are adopted the inlet velocity is set as u 10 m s and the outlet pressure is set as 42 300 pa to maintain the cavitation number is σ p o u t p v 0 5 ρ u 2 0 8 an o h type grid is generated around the foil surface to improve the mesh quality it should be noted that the values of y at the first grid point away from the hydrofoil surface are within 2 three meshes with coarse medium and fine resolutions are presented and the only difference of each set of mesh is in the spanwise direction as shown in fig 5 the mesh independence can be demonstrated by the lift and drag coefficients and the dimensionless cavitation shedding frequency which are defined as follows 25 c l lift 0 5 ρ u 2 span c 26 c d drag 0 5 ρ u 2 span c 27 s t f c u the results are shown in table 1 one can observe that with the coarse mesh the relative error base on the exp wang et al 2001 of average lift coefficient and st are much larger than that of two other set of meshes additionally the differences between the medium and fine resolution meshes results can be neglected further fig 6 is the averaged values of hydrofoil surface pressure coefficient at mid section for all three meshes it is observed that the pressure distribution predictions from these three meshes are quite close as the number of surface cells increases expect for the slight deviation of mesh 1 near the front of the hydrofoil pressure side thus considering the computational cost the medium resolution mesh which is with 3 974 760 nodes is used for the following analysis on the other hand the power spectrum density psd of pressure fluctuations with a distance x c 0 5 from the leading edge of the hydrofoil pressure surface is shown in fig 7 and the result predicts the 7 3 power law of pressure spectrum which indicates that the present resolved scale with mesh 2 may be asymptotic to a turbulent inertial subrange 4 results and discussion 4 1 periodic behaviors of cloud cavitation fig 8 is the variation of lift and drag coefficients against several periods of time as can be observed both the curves show generally periodic behaviors for the first half of every typical cycle as shown in blue dotted circle the c l and c d vary dramatically because of attached cavity is cut off and gradually diminished in unsteady cloud cavitating flows when the residual cavity collapsed there will cause a sudden increase in pressure field which results in creating peaks in both two coefficients curves and more detailed cloud cavitation behaviors will discuss in the following part fig 9 presents the numerical total cavity volume in three typical periods with the experimental data huang et al 2013 as comparison the reference time is t ref 40 ms based on huang et al 2013 it is observed that the variation of the cavity volume is a distinctly quasi periodic process with the cavity shedding and the picture shows even though there are some differences in the area of minimum cavity volume the overall evolution for the numerical total cavity volume agrees well with the experimental data the evolution of cavitation is shown by six snapshots of classic instants in a typical cycle in fig 10 with the experimental pictures huang et al 2014 at each instant given for comparison the three dimensional structure of cavity shape which is displayed by the iso surfaces of α v with the value of 0 1 is shown on the right side of the picture the black arrows on the experimental pictures and the velocity streamlines in fig 10 both perform the flow direction in the cavities during a quasi periodic unsteady cavitation clearly it is apparent that the simulated cavitation evolution patterns are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental pictures the numerical results successfully depict the inception growth shedding convection and collapse of the cavities at t 1 0 125t cycle a thin attached cavity at the leading edge is constantly growing the cloud cavity caused by the breakup of the last sheet cavity still exits near the trailing edge which leads to streamline distribution very irregular and unsteady during t 1 0 125t cycle t 3 0 475t cycle the length of the attached cavity grows to its maximum and its behaviors seem relative steady at t 3 0 475t cycle an anti clockwise cavitation vortex appears at the leading edge and induces a re entrant jet the streamline distribution indicates that the re entrant jet affects the head of the attached cavity shape noticeably as shown in middle picture of fig 10 d and e the velocity streamline vividly depicts the trace of the re entrant jet the re entrant jet develops towards the leading edge along the hydrofoil destroys the cavity interface and finally cuts off the attached cavity which makes the structures of cavity very complex and unsteady during this stage the transition between vapor and liquid is very frequent resulting in the high velocity gradient near the foil surface and a high turbulent flow in the field at t 1 000t cycle the shed cavitation cloud is advected downstream with the main flow and finally dissipates and at the same time a new attached cavity at the leading edge grows towards the trailing edge periodically overall the simulation results performed by les vof model in openfoam accurately predict the characteristics of the unsteady cavitation behaviors 4 2 cavitation vortex interaction according to previous investigations the highly unsteady cavitating flow may be result in very complicated vortex structures in order to better understand the cavitation vortex interaction a vorticity transport equation is employed to study the vorticity distribution in z direction 28 d ω z d t ω v z ω v z ρ m p ρ m 2 z ν m ν t 2 ω z in this equation the term on the left hand side lhs denotes the rate of the vorticity change and the first three terms on the right hand side rhs are the vortex stretching the vortex dilatation and the baroclinic torque respectively the last term on the rhs is the viscous diffusion of vorticity the vortex stretching term reflects the stretching and the tilting of a vortex due to the velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term represents the expansion and contraction of a fluid particle and the baroclinic torque term indicates the generation of vorticity produced by the misaligned pressure and density gradients it should be noted that the effect of the viscous diffusion term on the vorticity transportation can be ignored in a high reynolds number flow dittakavi et al 2010 fig 11 presents the predicted evolution of vapor volume fraction vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term along the mid plane of the foil in one typical cycle in the process of cavitation inception in fig 11 a although the three terms seem to have the same configuration but the vortex stretching term distribution is more extensive than two other terms especially in the foil wake region at this moment the contour of vortex dilatation term indicates that the evaporation process is dominant near the foil leading edge which shows that the process of cavity growth seems very steady at t 2 0 250t cycle the length of the attached cavity is increasing and the local boundary layer is considerable thicker than that at t 1 0 125t cycle it is obvious that the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term distribute inside the attached cavity messily the vortex baroclinic term distributes along the cavity surface which indicates that the change of vorticity in attached cavity is very drastic besides it also should be note that the vorticity transport is very frequent along the cavity surface at t 3 0 475t cycle a re entrant jet appears at the foil leading edge different from that at t 2 0 250t cycle the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term are significant along the liquid vapor interface but negligible inside the cavity meanwhile all three terms become much more complex at the trailing edge due to the cavitation vortex shown in fig 10 c during t 4 0 625t cycle t 5 0 875t cycle the re entrant jet develops and finally results in the cavity shedding then the shedding cavity is rolled up into the vortex structures which is usually called cloud cavitation these figures illustrate that the cloud cavitation makes the dramatic change of vortex along the vapor liquid interface and the process of evaporation and condensation also merges with each other along the surface and causes the mass transfer frequently for the vortex baroclinic term it becomes much more significant than that in other moments these simulated results demonstrate that there are strong vortex cavitation interaction during the cloud shedding stage at t 6 1 000t cycle the shedding vapor cloud transports and collapses downstream and the distributions of three terms of the vorticity transport equation are performed in fig 11 f with the shrink of the residual attached cavity some regions become non cavitation and all the three terms equal to zero at the trailing edge the vortex baroclinic term seems also very important which indicates the process of cloud collapse may be product the vortex in a word fig 11 shows the close correlation between the cavitation and vortex meanwhile it is noticeable that comparing with previous predictions much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed in this paper the results illustrates that the previous publications may be underestimate the role of baroclinic torque term in the vorticity transport process laberteaux and ceccio 2001 and more attention should be paid to it in the future research 4 3 the effect of adaptive mesh refinement for cavitation as mentioned above the amr method allocates high resolution grids only to the region of the greatest concern within limited computational resources to check the effect of the amr method and investigate the sensibility of refinement level on capturing the details of cavitaing flows another set of coarse mesh is set as the original parent mesh and it has 324 210 nodes with 36 nodes uniformly distributed along the spanwise as shown in fig 12 two refinement levels called level 1 and level 2 are implemented based on the original parent mesh to better understand how the grid is refined using the amr in simulations fig 13 displays the detailed principle of the amr with different refinement levels in fig 13 a an original grid is marked by the red dotted circle and it is on the vapor liquid interface the amr checks each grid in the computational field and finds this grid on the interface then splits it into 8 child grids as drawn in fig 13 b and splits it into 64 child grids at level 2 as drawn in fig 13 c by means of this method the high resolution grids are used to improve the precision of the cavity interfacial structure and the region without cavitation is calculated with low resolution grids to save computational resources the time evolution of the cavitation structures with the amr using different levels are shown in fig 14 it s should be note that we set the amr technique refine the filed every 10 time steps to ensure the accuracy of calculation and avoid calculation times too long as illustrated in these figures comparing to the cavitation structures presented by original parent mesh the result simulated by amr has representative three dimension structures and the cavity structures are much more complicated especially with two level refinement specifically during t 1 0 125t cycle t 3 0 475t cycle the cavity grows towards the downstream the two level refinement performs more complicated structures inside the cavity at t 0 625t cycle the re entrant jet develops towards the upstream and results in the continual phase change between vapor and liquid inside the attached cavity comparing to the two other results the two level refinement vividly depicts this progress which reflects the high unstable characteristics of the cloud cavitation during the shedding vapor cloud collapses in fig 14 e and f the simulation with two level refinement describes many small residual vapor clouds which demonstrate that the attached cavity breaks and forms a large cavitation cloud and several small residual clouds nevertheless the original simulation and one level refinement simulation fail to capture this phenomenon moreover fig 14 indicates that the calculated results by amr with two level refinement and mesh 2 have no obvious differences on the cavitation structures however the total grid level of two level refinement is less than mesh 2 which illustrates that the amr method is a useful tool to simulate the multi scale unsteady cavitating flows and it significantly enhances the computational efficiency as the amr method is adopted only for tracing and refining the cavitation regions and the non cavitation field is calculated by original coarse mesh it regards as an effective way to saving the computational resources and enhancing computational efficiency the turbulent cavitating flow details by the simulations with two level refinement are also evaluated in the present work fig 15 presents the local high pressure and some residual small cavities during cloud cavitation using amr with two level refinement in fig 15 b it should be noted that the vortex often exists near the residual small cavities which indicates that there is strong correlation between cloud cavitation and vortex structures meanwhile the vortex also generates the reverse flow as shown in the picture when the reverse flow flows towards the foil upstream and meets the main flow which will lead to the velocity in the front of the reverse flow becomes zero according to the bernoulli equation there will create a local high pressure region at the leading edge as shown in fig 15 a however the original parent mesh and one level refinement mesh can t capture this phenomenon which shows that the cavitaing flow details can be significantly simulated by increasing the refinement level without a great increase in computational cost fig 16 performs the evolutions of total cell numbers in one typical cycle with different refinement levels it is indicated that the number of total grids of one level refinement changes from about 394 000 to 706 000 corresponding to the change from about 1 110 000 to 4 060 000 with two level refinement the development of total grid number presents a little fluctuation in the stage of growth both at level 1 and level 2 as shown in red dotted circle in fig 16 it s should be note that the little fluctuation may be caused by the shedding and collapsing of the small cavitation bubbles at the head of the cavity during the cavity growth process which was also reported by and the trend of the curve illustrates the rate of the decrease of total grids number is faster than that of growth the reason of this phenomenon is that the process of the shedding vapor cloud collapse and the shrink of the residual attached cavity are more quick and drastic we can also find that the total grid number with two level refinement is below that of mesh 2 all the time and the results they predicted seem to have no much differences which indicates that the amr saves the computational resources meanwhile it seems a workable way to enhance the simulation precision using a coarse mesh with high refinement level without continuously increasing the number of total cells 5 conclusions in this paper the les vof model coupled with the amr method is carried out for the unsteady cavitating flow around a clark y hydrofoil in openfoam the quasi periodic behaviors of the cavity volume the evolution of the unsteady cavitation and the cavitation vortex interaction are examined the main conclusions are as follows 1 the predicted cavity volume shows a distinct quasi periodic process which agrees well with the experimental values the les vof method based on the openfoam platform can accurately capture the typical features of unsteady cavitation behaviors including the development of attached cavity the sheet cloud cavitation transition and the cloud cavitation collapse 2 analysis of the cavitation vortex interaction by the vorticity transport equation shows that the vortex stretching term distribution is more extensive than two other terms during the process of the vapor cloud shedding the distribution of all three terms illustrates that there are strong cavitation vortex interaction especially near the liquid vapor interface the baroclinic torque term is very important for the production of vortex moreover much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed in this paper which illustrates that the previous publications may be underestimate the magnitude of baroclinic torque term in the vorticity transport process and more attention should be paid to it in the future 3 the amr method is proved to be a useful and promising tool to investigate the multi scale unsteady cavitating flows for the coarse mesh a high level mesh refinement can capture the complicated cavitation structures and much more flow details without greatly increasing the computational cost the number of total grids of one level refinement in amr changes from about 394 000 to 706 000 corresponding to the change from about 1 110 000 to 4 048 000 with two level refinement in amr in this paper and the rate of the decrease of the total grids number with amr is faster than that of growth which may be caused by the process of the shedding vapor cloud collapse and the shrink of the residual attached cavity more quickly credit authorship contribution statement ziyang wang software validation investigation data curation writing original draft linmin li conceptualization

21869,in this paper the cavitating flow around a three dimension clark y hydrofoil is investigated by the large eddy simulation les method coupled with the volume of fluid vof model in openfoam the simulated results are compared with the experimental data and a reasonable agreement is obtained the cavitation vortex interaction is studied with the vorticity transport equation and much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed the adaptive mesh refinement amr method is adopted for improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulation comparing with the results presented by the mesh with fine resolution even the coarse resolution mesh with amr method can precisely characterize identical complex cavity structures and flow details the local high pressure induced by the reverse flow and small residual vortex structures are obtained by the coarse resolution mesh with the amr method further analyzes of the variation trend of total grid numbers using the amr in one typical cycle show that the rates of the cloud cavitation shedding and collapse are faster than that of the attached cavity growth this research illustrates that the amr is a potential approach to accurately model multi scale cavitating flows and to better understand cavitation mechanism on the premise of limited computational costs keywords cavitation cavitation vortex interaction adaptive mesh refinement amr openfoam 1 introduction cavitation leads to a very complicated vapor liquid two phase flow structure involving turbulence phase change and severe pressure fluctuations chen et al 2019 li et al 2019c unsteady cavitating flow is responsible for undesirable effects or even damages in hydraulic machinery such as turbines pumps and marine propeller blades luo et al 2016 therefore much attention has been paid to the mechanism of periodic development of attached cavity sheet shedding and collapse of vapor cloud in the past decades and numerous investigations for the evolution of both sheet and cloud cavitation on the hydrofoil have been conducted the cavity shedding process is often related to complex vortex evolution therefore the cavitation vortex interaction has always been one of the most important problems in the investigations of cavitation gopalan and katz 2000 used piv and high speed photography to demonstrate that the collapse of vapor cavities in the closure region resulted in the generation of vortices huang and wang 2011 investigated the vorticity distributions by means of the piv technique which showed that the large scale vortex dynamics was the reason for the instability of cavitating flow recently arabnejad et al 2019 studied the leading edge cavitation on a naca0009 hydrofoil using the high speed visualization hsv they observed a second shedding of small scale cavity structures transformed into horse shoe vortices for the first time which illustrated that there was a strong relationship between the cavitation and vortex in spite of experiments can capture many of the phenomena occurring it suffers from the limitations in measuring techniques especially in unsteady and high speed system which limits its wide application in investigating cavitation on the other hand with the development of the computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulation has been an effective and reliable approach to investigate the complex flow problems huang et al 2019 li et al 2019b liu et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 and most simulations have been adopted in investigating cavitation vortex structures in recent years ji et al 2013 applied the partially average navier stokes pans method to simulate shedding horse shoe vortex structures around a twisted hydrofoil long et al 2017 studied the evolution of the vortex by vorticity transport equation in attached cavitation shedding progress around a clark y hydrofoil with the fbdcm and an integral method wang et al 2018 attempted to solve the compressible governing equations to investigate cavitation vortex dynamics in unsteady cavitating flow sun et al 2019 studied unsteady cavitation shedding dynamics around a naca0015 hydrofoil in thermo sensitive fluid which illustrated that thermal effects showed an important influence on cavitation and complex multi scale vortex structures liu and wang 2019 employed a non linear k ε turbulence model to simulate cavity shedding process and the results showed cavitation was an inducement of vortex generation nevertheless some researchers suggested that the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation could not predicted the characteristics of unsteady sheet cloud cavitation and cavitation vortex interaction in some conditions dahm 2007 shyy et al 2007 on the other side large eddy simulation les is attracting more and more interest with noticeable success in predicting smaller scale eddies and unsteady phenomena of cavitating flows in recent years li and li 2016 ji et al 2015 indicated the re entrant jet induced the cavitation shedding and it was rolled up into vortex structures they found that the vortex stretching and dilatation were responsible for the mechanism of transition cloud cavitation from 2d to 3d in the process of shedding vapor cloud ji et al 2017 simulated large scale cavity vortex structures in the hydrofoil wake based on a clark y hydrofoil bai et al 2018 conducted a cartesian cut cell mesh method to study the cavitation vortex interaction in tip leakage cavitating flow the results revealed that the dilatation term played a much more important role in the evolution of tip leakage vortex cavitation cheng et al 2019 investigated the flow characteristics in tip leakage cavitating flow and observed more complex induced vortices in non cavitation region cheng et al 2020 conducted eulerian and lagrangian viewpoints to study the evolution of different types of vortices and systematically analyzed the mechanism of how cavitation influenced vorticity and turbulence except predicting small scale vortex structures in cavitation the les model can also capture the characteristics of cavitating flows accurately and many researchers used the les method to study the evolution of both sheet and cloud cavitation li et al 2016 applied the les method and the volume of fluid vof model to reproduce the quasi periodic phenomenon roohi et al 2016 investigated the transient cavitating flows over different configurations and cavity patterns by the implicit les model and the vof method kim and lee 2015 simulated cloud cavitation around a hydrophobic hydrofoil with les vof model they confirmed that cloud cavitation instability was alleviated as the hydrophobicity increased recently compressible vof method coupled with the les model have been conducted to simulate unsteady cavitation pendar and roohi 2015 roohi et al 2013 conducted a compressible vof method to track the cavity interface with the results indicating that the combination of vof and les could present cloud cavitation dynamics precisely movahedian et al 2019 successfully captured the cavitating turbulent flow around a twisted naca 16012 hydrofoil by the compressive velocity vof technique besides these fundamental studies of the sheet cloud cavitation various kinds of cavitation were also investigated with compressible les vof method including the cavitating flows around a sphere pendar and roohi 2018 behind a 3d disk roohi et al 2016 a 3d hemispherical head form body pendar and roohi 2016 wang et al 2016 and also for liquid injection cailloux et al 2015 meanwhile these works also indicated that selection of a suitable turbulence model les was a crucial issue to capture flow details and study the internal flow principle however in order to capture important flow phenomena high resolution grids were usually necessary for les in most cases which resulted in high requirement in computational resources to solve this problem a new mesh refinement technique called adaptive mesh refinement amr was proposed berger and colella 1989 by allocating high resolution grids only to the region of the greatest concern the adaptive mesh refinement amr method was believed to be a promising technique for improving calculation efficiency in the simulation of cavitating flow the amr was initially proposed for investigating shock hydrodynamics berger and colella 1989 and successfully applied on both structured popinet 2009 and unstructured meshes zheng et al 2005 furthermore it was widely used in vapor liquid two phase flows by coupling with the vof model such as thermal inkjet tan 2016 primary atomization fuster et al 2009 bubble dynamics zhang et al 2018 and also cavitation li et al 2019a however the investigations on the unsteady cloud cavitating flow around a hydrofoil with amr method were still rarely reported inspired by the precious works in the present paper the unsteady cavitating flow is numerically studied with amr using the les vof combined method the evolution of vortex distribution in the process of cloud cavitation especially the role of baroclinic torque term is discussed in detail moreover a set of coarse mesh with amr is applied to simulate the unsteady cavitating flow in order to check its applicability and advantages in the prediction of cavitation the local high pressure induced by the reversed flow and the variation of total grid numbers using amr are also addressed 2 adaptive mesh refinement to address the challenging issue that the traditional simulation methods base on the static grids face the amr approach is used to concentrate the computational cost dynamically in the region where it is mostly needed and refine the details of flow at a minimum computation resource in the present paper the method discussed here can be implemented on general quadrilateral grids for 2d cases and hexahedral grids for 3d cases the amr applies a patch oriented refinement method and the domain is consisted of non overlapping rectangular grids g l k 1 g l m g l k where l 0 1 l max denotes a sequence of refinement levels in the framework of openfoam the amr depends upon three key portions jasak 1996 li et al 2019a namely refinement engine mesh cutter refinement tree and they play different roles in the process of computation the refinement engine saves the permanent mesh data and it is used to create the connectivity structures of the mesh the mesh cutter plays an important role in splitting quadrilateral grids or hexahedral grids the history of refinement is saved in the refinement tree all three parts cooperate with each other smoothly fig 1 presents the collaboration diagram of the three key portions in the amr method when the calculation reaches the refine interval the system reads the refinement criteria in this paper we set the α v vapor volume fraction as the refined field and the grids are refined when the value of α v varies from 0 01 to 0 99 which illustrates the application only refines the grids located at the interface the refinement engine holds all grids and selects the specific grids for refinement in order to split the grids accurately as shown in fig 2 a a uniform way of indexing the corner points is introduced to guide the mesh cutter to add computational nodes at the mid point of each edge of the grid therefore in three spatial dimensions the mesh cutter is able to split hexahedral grids into eight subgrids for 3d sequentially afterwards those subgrids which comply with the refinement criteria are subdivided recursively until a user defined refine level is reached finally refinement tree records the history of the refinement done so far the refinement tree can be described by mitchell 2007 2 t g ω c v i which contains a set of nodes ω v i i 0 m and each v i ω contains a set of children c v i ω where g is the grid fig 2 b depicts the schematic diagram of an oct tree grid decomposition of the domain in 3d where the level 0 denotes the original mesh it should be noted that child grids receive the cell centered value of the parent grid in the grid refinement stage as a consequence although the location and shape of the liquid vapor interface change continuously in the computational process this method can still accurately simulate turbulent cavitating flows 3 mathematical formulations and numerical method 3 1 governing equations and les model in the framework of homogeneous equilibrium flow model the multiphase components in the mixture model are assumed to possess the same velocity and pressure the set of governing equations for vapor liquid two phase flows are shown as follows 3 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j 5 μ γ μ v 1 γ μ l 6 ρ γ ρ v 1 γ ρ l where u i is the velocity component in the i direction and p is the mixture pressure ρ and μ are the mixture density and the mixture dynamic viscosity the subscripts l and v represent the liquid and vapor respectively γ represents the vapor volume fraction as shown in fig 3 in les the large energy containing eddy structures are resolved on the grids whereas the smaller subgrid structures are modeled different scales are separated by applying a low pass in frequency filter to the exact solution the general low pass filtering operation of the variable u x t is defined by pope 2000 sagaut 2006 7 u x t ϕ r x u x r t d r where x is the space vector r is the error between the actually flow spatial coordinates and the filtered large scale flow spatial coordinates t is the time and ϕ r x is the specified filter function so the low pass filter operation decomposes the velocity field u x t into the sum of a filtered or resolved component u x t and a residual or subgrid scale sgs component u x t 8 u x t u x t u x t by means of this operation the les equations are theoretically derived from the navier stokes equations 9 ρ t ρ u j x j 0 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where the over bars denote the filtered quantities and τ i j is the subgrid scale stresses which can be defined as 11 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j one widely used subgrid scale model is the eddy viscosity model with assumptions that the subgrid scale stresses are proportional to the modulus of the strain rate tensor s i j of the filtered large scale flow 12 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ s g s s i j where s i j is the rate of the strain tensor for the resolved scale which can be written as 13 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity μ s g s is closed by the wall adopting local eddy viscosity wale model in the current paper the wale model takes into account the shear stress tensor as well as the rotation tensor and it follows the near wall distance y 3 law nicoud and ducros 1999 weickert et al 2010 long et al 2018 reported the wale model could reproduce the laminar to turbulence transition correctly and successfully simulated the transient cavitating turbulent flow in the wale model μ s g s is modeled as 14 μ s g s c w δ 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 15 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 16 g i j u i x j s i j ω i j where s i j d is the traceless symmetric part of the square of the velocity gradient tensor and c w is the default wale constant which is set as 0 325 opencfd 2018 3 2 vof model according to previous studies the vof method is an effective tool in the simulations of multiphase flow and has been widely used to simulate the free surface flow passandiden fard and roohi 2006 nowadays many vof methods for tracking vapor liquid interface have been developed and the most known are simple line interface calculation slic noh and woodward 1976 hirt nichols hirt and nichols 1981 piecewise linear interface construction plic youngs 1982 and compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 among them the cicsam scheme is characterized by high resolution differencing schemes to calculate volume fluxes its implementation is quite flexible and straightforward on arbitrary mesh in openfoam and it is applied in the current paper the cicsam scheme defines a supplementary interface compression velocity u c in the vicinity of the interface which the local flow could steepen the gradient of volume fraction and improve the interface resolution the conservation equation for the γ are shown as follows 17 γ t γ u u c γ 1 γ m c ρ v where m c is the source term which controls the mass transport rate u c γ 1 γ is the artificial compression term and it is non zero only at the interface the compressible term represents the role of shrinking the phase interphase towards a sharper one and it only induces the flow in the direction normal to the interface the compression velocity is computed by weller 2008 18 u c min c γ u max u γ γ where the c γ is a constant which controls the intensity of compression it yields no compression if it is zero or a conservation compression if it sets to 1 for highly compressible cavitating flow the value of c γ is 1 and the surface tension f s in the two phase system is evaluated using the csf model brackbill et al 1992 19 f s σ κ γ where σ is surface tension coefficient and the curvature κ of the free surface is defined as 20 κ γ γ 3 3 physical cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 cavitation model is adopted in this paper in order to simulate the water vapor mass transfer this cavitation model is written as 21 ρ v γ t ρ v γ u j x j m m where the source terms m and m are derived from the rayleigh plesset equation which denote the evaporation and condensation rates they are defined as follows 22 m ρ v ρ l ρ γ 1 γ 3 r b 2 3 max p v p 0 ρ l 23 m ρ v ρ l ρ γ 1 γ 3 r b 2 3 max p p v 0 ρ l where r b is the bubble radius which is described as 24 r b γ 1 γ 3 4 π 1 n b 1 3 where n b represents the bubble number density which is set as 1013 according to the study by schnerr and sauer 2001 3 4 numerical setup the numerical simulation is conducted through the open source cfd toolbox openfoam jasak 1996 which is based on finite volume method the simulation presented in this paper follows the piso algorithm which is a pressure velocity coupling algorithm to solve unsteady problems interphasechangedymfoam is adopted to simulate cavitation the time discretization and spatial discretization choose euler scheme and gauss upwind scheme respectively the time step δ t is computed automatically during the simulation to specify the courant number over the domain less than 0 9 the procedure of refining the grids is implemented on the field of vapor volume fraction which ranges from 0 01 to 0 99 therefore only the grids on the interface are refined to get more accurate results the simulation is performed under the normal temperature and pressure t 293 k p v 2300 pa a clark y hydrofoil with a chord length of c 0 07 m and a span length of 0 3c is placed horizontally at an angle of attack equal to 8 as shown in fig 4 the adopted length and height in the computational section are 10c and 2 7c all the settings are the same as the experiment huang et al 2013 the velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are adopted the inlet velocity is set as u 10 m s and the outlet pressure is set as 42 300 pa to maintain the cavitation number is σ p o u t p v 0 5 ρ u 2 0 8 an o h type grid is generated around the foil surface to improve the mesh quality it should be noted that the values of y at the first grid point away from the hydrofoil surface are within 2 three meshes with coarse medium and fine resolutions are presented and the only difference of each set of mesh is in the spanwise direction as shown in fig 5 the mesh independence can be demonstrated by the lift and drag coefficients and the dimensionless cavitation shedding frequency which are defined as follows 25 c l lift 0 5 ρ u 2 span c 26 c d drag 0 5 ρ u 2 span c 27 s t f c u the results are shown in table 1 one can observe that with the coarse mesh the relative error base on the exp wang et al 2001 of average lift coefficient and st are much larger than that of two other set of meshes additionally the differences between the medium and fine resolution meshes results can be neglected further fig 6 is the averaged values of hydrofoil surface pressure coefficient at mid section for all three meshes it is observed that the pressure distribution predictions from these three meshes are quite close as the number of surface cells increases expect for the slight deviation of mesh 1 near the front of the hydrofoil pressure side thus considering the computational cost the medium resolution mesh which is with 3 974 760 nodes is used for the following analysis on the other hand the power spectrum density psd of pressure fluctuations with a distance x c 0 5 from the leading edge of the hydrofoil pressure surface is shown in fig 7 and the result predicts the 7 3 power law of pressure spectrum which indicates that the present resolved scale with mesh 2 may be asymptotic to a turbulent inertial subrange 4 results and discussion 4 1 periodic behaviors of cloud cavitation fig 8 is the variation of lift and drag coefficients against several periods of time as can be observed both the curves show generally periodic behaviors for the first half of every typical cycle as shown in blue dotted circle the c l and c d vary dramatically because of attached cavity is cut off and gradually diminished in unsteady cloud cavitating flows when the residual cavity collapsed there will cause a sudden increase in pressure field which results in creating peaks in both two coefficients curves and more detailed cloud cavitation behaviors will discuss in the following part fig 9 presents the numerical total cavity volume in three typical periods with the experimental data huang et al 2013 as comparison the reference time is t ref 40 ms based on huang et al 2013 it is observed that the variation of the cavity volume is a distinctly quasi periodic process with the cavity shedding and the picture shows even though there are some differences in the area of minimum cavity volume the overall evolution for the numerical total cavity volume agrees well with the experimental data the evolution of cavitation is shown by six snapshots of classic instants in a typical cycle in fig 10 with the experimental pictures huang et al 2014 at each instant given for comparison the three dimensional structure of cavity shape which is displayed by the iso surfaces of α v with the value of 0 1 is shown on the right side of the picture the black arrows on the experimental pictures and the velocity streamlines in fig 10 both perform the flow direction in the cavities during a quasi periodic unsteady cavitation clearly it is apparent that the simulated cavitation evolution patterns are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental pictures the numerical results successfully depict the inception growth shedding convection and collapse of the cavities at t 1 0 125t cycle a thin attached cavity at the leading edge is constantly growing the cloud cavity caused by the breakup of the last sheet cavity still exits near the trailing edge which leads to streamline distribution very irregular and unsteady during t 1 0 125t cycle t 3 0 475t cycle the length of the attached cavity grows to its maximum and its behaviors seem relative steady at t 3 0 475t cycle an anti clockwise cavitation vortex appears at the leading edge and induces a re entrant jet the streamline distribution indicates that the re entrant jet affects the head of the attached cavity shape noticeably as shown in middle picture of fig 10 d and e the velocity streamline vividly depicts the trace of the re entrant jet the re entrant jet develops towards the leading edge along the hydrofoil destroys the cavity interface and finally cuts off the attached cavity which makes the structures of cavity very complex and unsteady during this stage the transition between vapor and liquid is very frequent resulting in the high velocity gradient near the foil surface and a high turbulent flow in the field at t 1 000t cycle the shed cavitation cloud is advected downstream with the main flow and finally dissipates and at the same time a new attached cavity at the leading edge grows towards the trailing edge periodically overall the simulation results performed by les vof model in openfoam accurately predict the characteristics of the unsteady cavitation behaviors 4 2 cavitation vortex interaction according to previous investigations the highly unsteady cavitating flow may be result in very complicated vortex structures in order to better understand the cavitation vortex interaction a vorticity transport equation is employed to study the vorticity distribution in z direction 28 d ω z d t ω v z ω v z ρ m p ρ m 2 z ν m ν t 2 ω z in this equation the term on the left hand side lhs denotes the rate of the vorticity change and the first three terms on the right hand side rhs are the vortex stretching the vortex dilatation and the baroclinic torque respectively the last term on the rhs is the viscous diffusion of vorticity the vortex stretching term reflects the stretching and the tilting of a vortex due to the velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term represents the expansion and contraction of a fluid particle and the baroclinic torque term indicates the generation of vorticity produced by the misaligned pressure and density gradients it should be noted that the effect of the viscous diffusion term on the vorticity transportation can be ignored in a high reynolds number flow dittakavi et al 2010 fig 11 presents the predicted evolution of vapor volume fraction vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term along the mid plane of the foil in one typical cycle in the process of cavitation inception in fig 11 a although the three terms seem to have the same configuration but the vortex stretching term distribution is more extensive than two other terms especially in the foil wake region at this moment the contour of vortex dilatation term indicates that the evaporation process is dominant near the foil leading edge which shows that the process of cavity growth seems very steady at t 2 0 250t cycle the length of the attached cavity is increasing and the local boundary layer is considerable thicker than that at t 1 0 125t cycle it is obvious that the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term distribute inside the attached cavity messily the vortex baroclinic term distributes along the cavity surface which indicates that the change of vorticity in attached cavity is very drastic besides it also should be note that the vorticity transport is very frequent along the cavity surface at t 3 0 475t cycle a re entrant jet appears at the foil leading edge different from that at t 2 0 250t cycle the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term are significant along the liquid vapor interface but negligible inside the cavity meanwhile all three terms become much more complex at the trailing edge due to the cavitation vortex shown in fig 10 c during t 4 0 625t cycle t 5 0 875t cycle the re entrant jet develops and finally results in the cavity shedding then the shedding cavity is rolled up into the vortex structures which is usually called cloud cavitation these figures illustrate that the cloud cavitation makes the dramatic change of vortex along the vapor liquid interface and the process of evaporation and condensation also merges with each other along the surface and causes the mass transfer frequently for the vortex baroclinic term it becomes much more significant than that in other moments these simulated results demonstrate that there are strong vortex cavitation interaction during the cloud shedding stage at t 6 1 000t cycle the shedding vapor cloud transports and collapses downstream and the distributions of three terms of the vorticity transport equation are performed in fig 11 f with the shrink of the residual attached cavity some regions become non cavitation and all the three terms equal to zero at the trailing edge the vortex baroclinic term seems also very important which indicates the process of cloud collapse may be product the vortex in a word fig 11 shows the close correlation between the cavitation and vortex meanwhile it is noticeable that comparing with previous predictions much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed in this paper the results illustrates that the previous publications may be underestimate the role of baroclinic torque term in the vorticity transport process laberteaux and ceccio 2001 and more attention should be paid to it in the future research 4 3 the effect of adaptive mesh refinement for cavitation as mentioned above the amr method allocates high resolution grids only to the region of the greatest concern within limited computational resources to check the effect of the amr method and investigate the sensibility of refinement level on capturing the details of cavitaing flows another set of coarse mesh is set as the original parent mesh and it has 324 210 nodes with 36 nodes uniformly distributed along the spanwise as shown in fig 12 two refinement levels called level 1 and level 2 are implemented based on the original parent mesh to better understand how the grid is refined using the amr in simulations fig 13 displays the detailed principle of the amr with different refinement levels in fig 13 a an original grid is marked by the red dotted circle and it is on the vapor liquid interface the amr checks each grid in the computational field and finds this grid on the interface then splits it into 8 child grids as drawn in fig 13 b and splits it into 64 child grids at level 2 as drawn in fig 13 c by means of this method the high resolution grids are used to improve the precision of the cavity interfacial structure and the region without cavitation is calculated with low resolution grids to save computational resources the time evolution of the cavitation structures with the amr using different levels are shown in fig 14 it s should be note that we set the amr technique refine the filed every 10 time steps to ensure the accuracy of calculation and avoid calculation times too long as illustrated in these figures comparing to the cavitation structures presented by original parent mesh the result simulated by amr has representative three dimension structures and the cavity structures are much more complicated especially with two level refinement specifically during t 1 0 125t cycle t 3 0 475t cycle the cavity grows towards the downstream the two level refinement performs more complicated structures inside the cavity at t 0 625t cycle the re entrant jet develops towards the upstream and results in the continual phase change between vapor and liquid inside the attached cavity comparing to the two other results the two level refinement vividly depicts this progress which reflects the high unstable characteristics of the cloud cavitation during the shedding vapor cloud collapses in fig 14 e and f the simulation with two level refinement describes many small residual vapor clouds which demonstrate that the attached cavity breaks and forms a large cavitation cloud and several small residual clouds nevertheless the original simulation and one level refinement simulation fail to capture this phenomenon moreover fig 14 indicates that the calculated results by amr with two level refinement and mesh 2 have no obvious differences on the cavitation structures however the total grid level of two level refinement is less than mesh 2 which illustrates that the amr method is a useful tool to simulate the multi scale unsteady cavitating flows and it significantly enhances the computational efficiency as the amr method is adopted only for tracing and refining the cavitation regions and the non cavitation field is calculated by original coarse mesh it regards as an effective way to saving the computational resources and enhancing computational efficiency the turbulent cavitating flow details by the simulations with two level refinement are also evaluated in the present work fig 15 presents the local high pressure and some residual small cavities during cloud cavitation using amr with two level refinement in fig 15 b it should be noted that the vortex often exists near the residual small cavities which indicates that there is strong correlation between cloud cavitation and vortex structures meanwhile the vortex also generates the reverse flow as shown in the picture when the reverse flow flows towards the foil upstream and meets the main flow which will lead to the velocity in the front of the reverse flow becomes zero according to the bernoulli equation there will create a local high pressure region at the leading edge as shown in fig 15 a however the original parent mesh and one level refinement mesh can t capture this phenomenon which shows that the cavitaing flow details can be significantly simulated by increasing the refinement level without a great increase in computational cost fig 16 performs the evolutions of total cell numbers in one typical cycle with different refinement levels it is indicated that the number of total grids of one level refinement changes from about 394 000 to 706 000 corresponding to the change from about 1 110 000 to 4 060 000 with two level refinement the development of total grid number presents a little fluctuation in the stage of growth both at level 1 and level 2 as shown in red dotted circle in fig 16 it s should be note that the little fluctuation may be caused by the shedding and collapsing of the small cavitation bubbles at the head of the cavity during the cavity growth process which was also reported by and the trend of the curve illustrates the rate of the decrease of total grids number is faster than that of growth the reason of this phenomenon is that the process of the shedding vapor cloud collapse and the shrink of the residual attached cavity are more quick and drastic we can also find that the total grid number with two level refinement is below that of mesh 2 all the time and the results they predicted seem to have no much differences which indicates that the amr saves the computational resources meanwhile it seems a workable way to enhance the simulation precision using a coarse mesh with high refinement level without continuously increasing the number of total cells 5 conclusions in this paper the les vof model coupled with the amr method is carried out for the unsteady cavitating flow around a clark y hydrofoil in openfoam the quasi periodic behaviors of the cavity volume the evolution of the unsteady cavitation and the cavitation vortex interaction are examined the main conclusions are as follows 1 the predicted cavity volume shows a distinct quasi periodic process which agrees well with the experimental values the les vof method based on the openfoam platform can accurately capture the typical features of unsteady cavitation behaviors including the development of attached cavity the sheet cloud cavitation transition and the cloud cavitation collapse 2 analysis of the cavitation vortex interaction by the vorticity transport equation shows that the vortex stretching term distribution is more extensive than two other terms during the process of the vapor cloud shedding the distribution of all three terms illustrates that there are strong cavitation vortex interaction especially near the liquid vapor interface the baroclinic torque term is very important for the production of vortex moreover much stronger baroclinic torque term is observed in this paper which illustrates that the previous publications may be underestimate the magnitude of baroclinic torque term in the vorticity transport process and more attention should be paid to it in the future 3 the amr method is proved to be a useful and promising tool to investigate the multi scale unsteady cavitating flows for the coarse mesh a high level mesh refinement can capture the complicated cavitation structures and much more flow details without greatly increasing the computational cost the number of total grids of one level refinement in amr changes from about 394 000 to 706 000 corresponding to the change from about 1 110 000 to 4 048 000 with two level refinement in amr in this paper and the rate of the decrease of the total grids number with amr is faster than that of growth which may be caused by the process of the shedding vapor cloud collapse and the shrink of the residual attached cavity more quickly credit authorship contribution statement ziyang wang software validation investigation data curation writing original draft linmin li conceptualization
