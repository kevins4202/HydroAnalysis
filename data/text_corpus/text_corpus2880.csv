polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membrane with a pore size of 0 2 μm was used to perform the experiments the effect of circulation velocity temperature and channel spacer effect on permeate flux were investigated results indicated that the permeate flux increased with feed temperature and velocity spacers enhanced permeate flux up to 35 and the sequence of spacer design in terms of flux was diamond design ladder design without spacer dcmd process was also applied during long period for re concentration of draw solution of two organic ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 and three inorganic salts nacl mgcl2 cacl2 under the optimal operating conditions the optimal dcmd condition was achieved using aqueous nacl solution mg ch3coo 2 gave prolong operational period in osmbr md and required more md membrane flushing md membrane flushing followed the order as mg ch3coo 2 ch3coona cacl2 mgcl2 nacl for all organic and inorganic ds the dcmd system was able to achieve ds recovery as per os mbr requirement and also produced good quality product water due to high tds and contaminant rejection 99 keywords membrane distillation draw solution re concentration channel spacer feed temperature 1 introduction the exponential and continuous world population growth has raised extensive concerns of water sustainability 1 according to world wildlife fund wwf two third of the world s population may face water shortage by 2025 2 therefore a sustainable solution is needed for clean water production membrane technology has become an attractive solution to overcome water scarcity problems 3 the most effective membrane separation methods to produce clean water are microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to pressurize the water through the membrane they all require an external source of energy 4 forward osmosis fo is an emerging green membrane technology that can be used for desalination water treatment and wastewater treatment because of many reasons such as less membrane fouling low energy consumption and high rejection in comparison to other membrane separation processes 5 the driving force of forward osmosis is osmotic pressure difference between draw solution ds and feed solution fs to extract water from fs using a semi permeable membrane 6 in forward osmosis water flows from the fs by osmosis through a semi permeable membrane into the ds and dilutes the higher concentration of ds on the permeate side and lower the osmotic pressure gradient diluted ds requires a further treatment process to maintain osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane 7 therefore fo process requires further integration with re concentration process to recover the water from the ds forward osmosis generally has been coupled with other membrane separation processes like electrodylasis ed reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and membrane distillation md to separate the ds from the permeate water ed may not be suitable for recovery of highly saline water and not economical due to high cost of ion exchange membrane and electrode ro recovery process may be discouraged due to its high operating pressure nf membrane has low operating pressure than ro and suitable for the recovery of multivalent salt solution due to large pore size of uf membrane small draw solutes may not be effectively rejected by it 8 11 membrane distillation however can be an attractive option for recovery of ds because of its advantages such as less capital cost high permeate quality and less affected by feed salinity 11 md is a thermally driven water separation process which allow water vapor not liquid to pass through the micro porous hydrophobic membrane 12 we can further increase hydrophobicity i e wetting resistance of membrane by coating of different chemicals zhao et al 13 increased wetting resistance of membrane over time by fluorographite coating on dcmd membrane and consequently direct water leakage towards permeate reduced significantly after the coating while the permeate flux was almost similar to the condition without coating the main driving force of md is vapor pressure difference generated by the temperature difference between feed and permeate surface of the membrane which is different from other membrane separation processes md separation process takes place in three steps from feed side of membrane evaporation take places the water vapor moves through the membrane from hot to cold side due to pressure difference across the membrane and finally the condensation take places on permeate side which depend on the module configuration 14 md has four major configurations that have been utilized to separate water from feed solution direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in which both feed and permeate water is in direct contact with the surface of membrane and vapor condense inside the membrane module air gap membrane distillation agmd where air is introduced between the cold permeate and membrane surface water vapor crosses that air gap and condensed over the cold surface inside the membrane module sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd where an inert gas is introduced to sweep the water vapor at permeate side and condensation taken place outside the membrane module and vacuum membrane distillation vmd in which vacuum is created in the permeate side and condensation take place outside the module 15 among these configurations dcmd is the most widely used and simplest form of md configuration mostly used in desalination and concentration process and proven to be more effective in terms of permeate flux 16 yen et al 17 utilized md process to recycle a compound of 2 methylimidazole based compounds for forward osmosis and observed flux across the md membrane at 8 lmh wang et al 18 examined md to circulate nacl solution in a hybrid fo md process for concentration of protein solution and showed that the fo md system was stable when production rates of both were equal ge et al 19 used md to recover the fo draw solution poly sodium acrylate psa at temperature of 50 70 c due to viscosity lowering characteristics of draw solute psa at high temperature results exhibited the complete rejection of psa by md the best performance could be achieved with psa concentration of 0 48 g ml in draw tank and md feed temperature of 66 c where water transfer of fo matched that of md zhang et al 20 effectively re concentrated diluted draw solution nacl after fo for water recovery from oily wastewater husnain et al 4 studied integrated fo md hybrid system for reuse of wastewater results showed that the md process successfully recovered the ds for fo process and high rejection of substances 99 9 enabled fo md hybrid system to produce good quality of product water nguyen et al 5 investigated md for recovery of highly charged organic compound naedta3 and hedta3 as ds after attached growth biofilm osmotic membrane bioreactor agb osmbr md was able to successfully re concentrate the diluted ds to its initial status of 56 1 ms cm in 6 h of batch operation results showed the rejection of na and conductivity by md membrane was above 99 7 zhao et al 21 also applied dcmd for production of desalinated water and regeneration of diluted draw solution of poly amidoamine with sodium carboxyl group pamam coona to its original osmotic pressure however in these previous studies 4 5 17 21 long term performance of md in recovery of ds from continuous osmotic membrane bioreactor os mbr operation has not been investigated so far the type of salts utilized for ds in integrated dcmd osmbr studies are limited to few organic and inorganic salts selection of ds is the important consideration in fo studies due to change in physical and chemical properties of ds each ds has its own behavior and characteristics in previous studies different ds has been studied to select the ideal ds for different applications of fo system some of the ds generates high osmotic pressure even at low molar concentration some ds have high rejection through fo membrane and some have high reverse solute flux ge et al 22 used oxalic acid complex na cr oa as a ds in fo for effective removal of as iii from water due to high permeate flux and low reverse solute flux ge et al 23 used hydroacids magnetic nanoparticles mnps as a draw solution of fo hydroacid mnps produced fo water flux comparable to other ds with less reverse solute flux nematzadeh et al 24 studied the performance of fo by using sodium bicarbonate nahco3 as a ds and at the same osmotic pressure compared their performance with commonly used sodium chloride nacl the aim of this work was to observe the performance of dcmd process for the re concentration of different draw solutions for osmotically driven membrane bioreactor process the impact of operating parameters on permeate flux and salt rejections were studied dcmd was applied for continuous recovery of diluted draw solutions in which two organic ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 and three inorganic salts nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the process flow diagram of dcmd experimental setup coupled with os mbr is shown in fig 1 the flat sheet module made of acrylic constituted two channels each channel was 0 3 4 5 10 6 cm depth width and length with 48 cm2 of total membrane effective area for mass transfer for all the experimental runs module was placed in a horizontal position feed and permeate solutions were circulated by using two peristaltic pumps masterflex 7524 45 cole parmer usa in a countercurrent direction through each channel similar circulation velocities of feed and permeate sides were maintained a heat exchanging coil of stainless steel submerged into a hot water tank was used to heat the feed solution connected with temperature control unit to control the temperature of feed two temperature sensors tpm 900 sanhng china were used to measure the inlet and outlet temperatures of feed water feed or draw solution tds was checked by tds meter sension hach usa a chiller was used to control the distillate temperature two in line tds meters komatsu japan with temperature sensors were used to measure the inlet and outlet temperature and tds of the permeate water a digital balance ux 6200h shimadzu japan connected with a computer was used to measure the increase in distillate volume draw solution used for regeneration purpose was obtained from an os mbr which was coupled with dcmd for a continuous supply of diluted ds 2 2 microporous membrane characteristics for os mbr a flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta membrane from hydration technology innovations hti albany usa was used while flat sheet hydrophobic microporous membrane from ningbo changqi porous membrane technology co ltd was used for dcmd process md membrane constituted a thin polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe active layer on top of polypropylene pp supported layer the active layer thickness porosity and average pore size of md membrane were 12 μm 70 and 0 2 μm respectively 25 a new dcmd membrane sample was used for each experimental run 2 3 feed solution characteristics synthetic draw solution with initial concentration of 0 25 m was prepared by using two organic and three inorganic salts nawaz et al found that 26 the microbial growth of os mbr was more supportive by divalent salts as compared to monovalent salts for this study commonly used divalent salts magnesium chloride mgcl2 calcium chloride cacl2 were selected to represent inorganic divalent draw solutes and sodium chloride nacl for monovalent draw solute as control ds similarly sodium acetate ch3coona and magnesium acetate mg ch3coo 2 were selected as organic draw solutes due to their high degradability lower reverse salt flux of acetate salts and their wide use in os mbr to control salinity 27 28 the draw solutions were prepared by dissolving a suitable amount of salt into the distilled water initial membrane performance tests were conducted using aqueous solution of nacl 2 4 operating conditions to investigate the circulation velocity and feed water temperature effect on flux feed water temperature at inlet varied from 30 to 80 c with an increment of 10 c and circulation velocity was in the range of 2 8 14 cm s in the permeate tank the cooling water temperature was fixed at 20 c in all other experiments the velocity was maintained at 14 cm s two separator designs ladder and diamond were used on both sides of the membrane having 1 08 mm thickness with a mesh length of 4 2 mm and strand diameter of 0 7 mm for flux enhancement before the regeneration of draw solution dcmd was run with 0 25 m nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 to investigate the temperature effect on flux of these salts for regeneration of draw solutions the temperature of cooling water and circulation flow rate of dcmd were maintained at 10 c and 14 cm s respectively to match os mbr ds concentration requirements the water transfer rate of md membrane was adjusted to match that to os mbr by changing circulation velocity and water flushing of md membrane in previous studies luo et al 29 adjusted ro flux daily to match with fo by changing hydraulic pressure and xie et al 30 flushed fo membrane with deionized water and reduced distilled temperature of md to balance water fluxes of fo and md ds concentration was measured continuously to ensure that a constant concentration was maintained in the ds tank md circulation velocity was reduced when salt concentration increased in ds tank and md membrane was flushed with distilled water when salt concentration decreased in ds tank during membrane cleaning through the feed side of module distilled water was circulated at cross flow velocity of 20 cm s for one hour at temperature of 25 c distilled water was also circulated through the permeate side at the same temperature and circulation rate to avoid any pressure difference across the membrane 2 5 permeate water flux and salt rejection measurement permeate water flux was measured by weight change of permeate over a selected time period as the water transferred by vapor pressure across the membrane from feed side into the permeate side the weight of permeate in tank increased the rate at which volume increased over the membrane effective area yielded the water flux water flux across the membrane in lm 2 h 1 was calculated by using eq 1 1 j δ v δ t a where δv is the change in permeate volume l over a sampling time δt h and a is the effective membrane area m2 for determining tds rejection the concentrations of tds in feed water cf and permeate water cp were determined the salt rejection was calculated by using following equation eq 2 2 rejection c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the feed and permeate concentration mg l respectively 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of circulation velocity and temperature on dcmd performance fig 2 illustrates the effect of circulation velocity under different feed inlet temperatures on permeate flux feed velocity and temperature were varied from 2 8 to 14 cm s and 30 80 c respectively feed inlet concentration and permeate temperature were kept constant at 0 25 m nacl and 20 c respectively it can be observed that the permeate flux increased with increase in feed water temperature and circulation velocity of feed and permeate initially permeate water flux increased noticeably with increase in velocity and asymptotic trends were observed at higher velocity fig 2 shows that at feed water temperature of 30 c increase in velocity enhanced the permeate flux from 3 7 to 16 l m2 h similarly at 80 c increase in velocity lead to enhanced flux from 35 to 71 lmh the increase in velocity led to increase in permeate flux but the improvement in flux was relatively less when velocity increased to a certain level yun et al 31 also found that with increase in circulation velocity permeate flux enhanced due to increase in heat transfer coefficient and reduction in temperature polarization tp where tp is the temperature difference between bulk and membrane surface on both hot and cold side that affects the driving force of mass transport in dcmd it was noted that there was relatively less incremental increase in flux when the velocity reached to certain limit because at higher flow rate mass transfer resistance of membrane becomes predominant 15 32 difference of vapor pressure across the membrane is the main driving force in membrane distillation and vapor pressure is the exponential function of the temperature 32 33 when the temperature increases the thermal efficiency and the driving force of mass transfer also increases accordingly fig 2 shows the effect of feed inlet temperatures on flux where higher the temperature resulted in higher permeate water flux for all the curves permeate flux increases exponentially with increase in feed water temperature at high temperature temperature influence on permeate flux was more significant as compared to low temperature 3 2 flux enhancement using spacer filled channel to maximize flux it was necessary to reduce temperature polarization effect or to increase vapor pressure difference on both sides of membrane to reduce temperature polarization or to increase vapor pressure difference it was necessary to decrease the resistance of thermal boundary layer across the membrane by enhancing stream turbulence the thickness of thermal boundary layer can be reduced 34 in this context spacer promotes turbulence and improves hydrodynamics condition in the channel effect of spacer ladder diamond design on flux was studied under different feed inlet temperatures salt concentration circulation velocity on both sides of membrane and permeate temperature were kept constant at 0 25 m nacl 14 cm s and 20 c respectively system was run with ladder design diamond design and without spacer fig 3 shows that when spacer was placed in the module the permeate flux increased for the same operating conditions velocity feed and permeate temperature flux was higher when a diamond design separator was used as compared to ladder separator and empty channel by using spacer a 35 increase in flux with diamond design and 26 increase in flux with ladder design were observed at 80 c of feed water temperature as compared to empty channel the enhanced flux proved the appearance of turbulence and formation of eddies when the water passed via spacer strands similar findings were observed in previous studies 35 38 martínez díez et al 35 found that permeate flux in md was higher when screen separator was used as compared to open flow separator according to yun et al 36 flux enhancement using spacer to increase flow regime was better option as compare to increasing flow velocity phattaranawik et al 37 noticed flux enhancement in dcmd when spacer was used in the membrane channel due to improvement of heat transfer phattaranawik et al 38 achieved 31 41 higher flux in spacer filled channel than empty channel 3 3 temperature effect on flux for different salt solutions the effect of temperatures on the three inorganic salts nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 and two organic salts ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 having the same molar concentration were studied fig 4 shows that at same temperature nacl produced highest flux than all other salts due to its lower tds concentration the concentration of salt solution affects flux which declined by increasing the feed water salinity lower flux was due to reduced water vapor pressure over the salt solution and as a result reduction of the driving force for mass transfer was observed by increasing feed tds concentration boubakri et al 16 also found that with increasing salt concentration results in increasing viscosity temperature and concentration polarization cp that reduced the driving force of dcmd and consequently the flux cp is the ratio between salt concentrations at hot feed side of the membrane surface to the feed bulk solution that reduces the driving force of evaporation under the same operating conditions organic salts exhibited less flux as compared to inorganic salts and higher flux followed the order of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 the remarkable difference between permeate flux of these salts were probably due to water activity nacl exhibited maximum flux as compared to other salts at all the temperatures as the water activity of nacl is higher than all other salts water activity of any solution is the ratio between vapor of salty water to that of pure water at given temperature the water activity magnitude reflects the free water run away from the salt solution when it is evaporated 32 it has been reported that water activity for inorganic and organic salts follow the order of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 39 similar findings have been reported in previous study 32 for the salts kcl nacl and mgcl2 where the water activity was the leading factors for influencing flux fig 4 reveals that at temperature of 50 c there was less difference in permeate flux between mgcl2 and cacl2 and it become significant at 80 c on the contrary difference between the permeate flux of ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 was reduced with increasing temperature the main difference among permeate fluxes was due to temperature dependence of their solubility solubility plays an important role on membrane distillation flux where the salt having relatively less solubility variation with increase in temperature exhibits higher flux 40 in comparison to cacl2 and ch3coona solubility increase of mgcl2 and mg ch3coo 2 varies little with increase in temperature resulting in higher flux of mgcl2 and mg ch3coo 2 41 3 4 re concentration of draw solution in os mbr draw solution ds concentration is the main driving force of os mbr to extract the clean water across the semi permeable membrane the ds concentration was diluted as a function of operating time and md recovery process was optimized accordingly for draw solution it was necessary to match water transfer rate in md to that in os mbr process water transfer rates of both os mbr and md systems at different salts solutions are shown in fig 5 based upon optimized circulation velocity of 14 cm s with diamond spacer in module and feed temperatures of 70 65 70 80 and 85 c for nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 for re concentration of draw solutions long term experiments of hybrid os mbr and md system were conducted for each ds dcmd was operated with temperature ranging from 50 to 85 c and optimal temperature was selected based upon the water transfer rate requirement of os mbr temperature of distilled water was fixed at 10 c in continuous operation of md with os mbr both os mbr and md water flux declined as a function of operating time concentration of draw solution was constant by maintaining stable equilibrium condition which was obtained by matching the water transfer of both systems fig 5 shows that water transfer rate of md and os mbr process for different salt solutions the permeate flux of md membrane was adjusted to match that to os mbr by changing the circulation velocity and the flushing of md membrane md circulation velocity was reduced when salt concentration increased in draw tank and md membrane was flushed with distilled water when salt concentration decreased in draw tank due to crystal deposition crystal deposition on md membrane leads to pore blocking that restricts the active surface area of membrane for transport of water vapor 42 dcmd was run with os mbr process until fouling of osmotic membrane fig 5 represents the recovery of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 nacl shows better performance than all other salts in recovery by md as it did not require membrane flushing throughout the system run while mg ch3coo 2 required four times forward flushing because of 0 25 m mg ch3coo 2 having high tds concentration than 0 25 m nacl and all other salts rapid flux decline was found to be significantly dependent on density viscosity salt concentration flow rate and operating temperature 43 rapid flux decline in the md process with mg ch3coo 2 was due to high temperature for obtaining high flux salt concentration was another factor affecting permeate flux where flux decline rate raised proportionally with salinity and mg ch3coo 2 reflected highest salinity at 0 25 m for all other salts similar trends of flux decline indicate that above mentioned parameters are leading factors influencing flux membrane flushing frequency followed the order of mg ch3coo 2 ch3coona cacl2 mgcl2 nacl for forward flushing md membrane was flushed with distilled water with same temperature and circulated on both sides of membrane mostly reversible fouling was observed in this study as shown in fig 5 where membrane flushing restored more than 87 of the initial water flux that was lost due to salts deposition on the membrane similar finding of membrane washing was reported in literature in which 90 of initial water flux was restored when membrane was cleaned with 0 5 hcl solution while cleaning the scaled membrane with tap water 85 flux restoration was achieved 25 fig 5 also shows that the organic and inorganic salts rejection with md membrane were above 99 for all organic and inorganic solutes the md system was able to achieve ds recovery as per requirement of os mbr since the surface area of md membrane was 24 times smaller than that of fo membrane the dcmd system was consequently operated at higher temperature to match the water transfer rate of os mbr system in future studies the feed temperature can be reduced by operating at relatively similar membrane surface areas of md and fo modules 3 5 production of purified water and removal of contaminants the purpose of combining dcmd with os mbr was to successfully recover the draw solution of os mbr and the production of good quality product water in the case of os mbr retention rate of contaminants decline with increase of salinity in bio tank and contaminants accumulate in draw tank 29 44 45 any solute or contaminant passing through the fo membrane even in very small quantity was completely removed with the md membrane fig 6 shows that nh4 n and po4 3 p slowly diffused through the os mbr membrane into the draw solution tank however they were moderately rejected by md membrane and accumulated in draw solution tank cod was not possible to measure in draw tank due to its high salinity 46 however md permeate contained negligible concentration of cod md membrane is capable of completely rejecting non volatile solutes of feed water as well 47 48 in this study the dcmd permeate contained very less concentration of tds cod and nutrients illustrating the excellent ability of md to produce good quality product water 4 conclusion in this study dcmd was operated to re concentrate aqueous salt solutions in a os mbr md system the effects of operating parameters including feed temperature circulation rate effect of spacer and feed salt type were studied to analyze the performance of dcmd for all draw solutes organic inorganic dcmd system was able to achieve high ds recovery as per os mbr requirement permeate flux increased exponentially with temperature at higher temperature the flux was more significant as compare to that at lower temperature permeate flux was also affected by circulation velocity but the flux improvement was relatively less when velocity increased to a certain level moreover diamond spacer was able to produce turbulence and enhanced the water flux up to 35 as compared to without spacer it was observed that the acetate draw solute mg ch3coo 2 gave prolong operational period followed by ch3coona while requiring more md membrane flushing lastly high quality of product water was produced by dcmd due to its high tds and nutrients

degradability lower reverse salt flux of acetate salts and their wide use in os mbr to control salinity 27 28 the draw solutions were prepared by dissolving a suitable amount of salt into the distilled water initial membrane performance tests were conducted using aqueous solution of nacl 2 4 operating conditions to investigate the circulation velocity and feed water temperature effect on flux feed water temperature at inlet varied from 30 to 80 c with an increment of 10 c and circulation velocity was in the range of 2 8 14 cm s in the permeate tank the cooling water temperature was fixed at 20 c in all other experiments the velocity was maintained at 14 cm s two separator designs ladder and diamond were used on both sides of the membrane having 1 08 mm thickness with a mesh length of 4 2 mm and strand diameter of 0 7 mm for flux enhancement before the regeneration of draw solution dcmd was run with 0 25 m nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 to investigate the temperature effect on flux of these salts for regeneration of draw solutions the temperature of cooling water and circulation flow rate of dcmd were maintained at 10 c and 14 cm s respectively to match os mbr ds concentration requirements the water transfer rate of md membrane was adjusted to match that to os mbr by changing circulation velocity and water flushing of md membrane in previous studies luo et al 29 adjusted ro flux daily to match with fo by changing hydraulic pressure and xie et al 30 flushed fo membrane with deionized water and reduced distilled temperature of md to balance water fluxes of fo and md ds concentration was measured continuously to ensure that a constant concentration was maintained in the ds tank md circulation velocity was reduced when salt concentration increased in ds tank and md membrane was flushed with distilled water when salt concentration decreased in ds tank during membrane cleaning through the feed side of module distilled water was circulated at cross flow velocity of 20 cm s for one hour at temperature of 25 c distilled water was also circulated through the permeate side at the same temperature and circulation rate to avoid any pressure difference across the membrane 2 5 permeate water flux and salt rejection measurement permeate water flux was measured by weight change of permeate over a selected time period as the water transferred by vapor pressure across the membrane from feed side into the permeate side the weight of permeate in tank increased the rate at which volume increased over the membrane effective area yielded the water flux water flux across the membrane in lm 2 h 1 was calculated by using eq 1 1 j δ v δ t a where δv is the change in permeate volume l over a sampling time δt h and a is the effective membrane area m2 for determining tds rejection the concentrations of tds in feed water cf and permeate water cp were determined the salt rejection was calculated by using following equation eq 2 2 rejection c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the feed and permeate concentration mg l respectively 3 results discussion 3 1 effect of circulation velocity and temperature on dcmd performance fig 2 illustrates the effect of circulation velocity under different feed inlet temperatures on permeate flux feed velocity and temperature were varied from 2 8 to 14 cm s and 30 80 c respectively feed inlet concentration and permeate temperature were kept constant at 0 25 m nacl and 20 c respectively it can be observed that the permeate flux increased with increase in feed water temperature and circulation velocity of feed and permeate initially permeate water flux increased noticeably with increase in velocity and asymptotic trends were observed at higher velocity fig 2 shows that at feed water temperature of 30 c increase in velocity enhanced the permeate flux from 3 7 to 16 l m2 h similarly at 80 c increase in velocity lead to enhanced flux from 35 to 71 lmh the increase in velocity led to increase in permeate flux but the improvement in flux was relatively less when velocity increased to a certain level yun et al 31 also found that with increase in circulation velocity permeate flux enhanced due to increase in heat transfer coefficient and reduction in temperature polarization tp where tp is the temperature difference between bulk and membrane surface on both hot and cold side that affects the driving force of mass transport in dcmd it was noted that there was relatively less incremental increase in flux when the velocity reached to certain limit because at higher flow rate mass transfer resistance of membrane becomes predominant 15 32 difference of vapor pressure across the membrane is the main driving force in membrane distillation and vapor pressure is the exponential function of the temperature 32 33 when the temperature increases the thermal efficiency and the driving force of mass transfer also increases accordingly fig 2 shows the effect of feed inlet temperatures on flux where higher the temperature resulted in higher permeate water flux for all the curves permeate flux increases exponentially with increase in feed water temperature at high temperature temperature influence on permeate flux was more significant as compared to low temperature 3 2 flux enhancement using spacer filled channel to maximize flux it was necessary to reduce temperature polarization effect or to increase vapor pressure difference on both sides of membrane to reduce temperature polarization or to increase vapor pressure difference it was necessary to decrease the resistance of thermal boundary layer across the membrane by enhancing stream turbulence the thickness of thermal boundary layer can be reduced 34 in this context spacer promotes turbulence and improves hydrodynamics condition in the channel effect of spacer ladder diamond design on flux was studied under different feed inlet temperatures salt concentration circulation velocity on both sides of membrane and permeate temperature were kept constant at 0 25 m nacl 14 cm s and 20 c respectively system was run with ladder design diamond design and without spacer fig 3 shows that when spacer was placed in the module the permeate flux increased for the same operating conditions velocity feed and permeate temperature flux was higher when a diamond design separator was used as compared to ladder separator and empty channel by using spacer a 35 increase in flux with diamond design and 26 increase in flux with ladder design were observed at 80 c of feed water temperature as compared to empty channel the enhanced flux proved the appearance of turbulence and formation of eddies when the water passed via spacer strands similar findings were observed in previous studies 35 38 martínez díez et al 35 found that permeate flux in md was higher when screen separator was used as compared to open flow separator according to yun et al 36 flux enhancement using spacer to increase flow regime was better option as compare to increasing flow velocity phattaranawik et al 37 noticed flux enhancement in dcmd when spacer was used in the membrane channel due to improvement of heat transfer phattaranawik et al 38 achieved 31 41 higher flux in spacer filled channel than empty channel 3 3 temperature effect on flux for different salt solutions the effect of temperatures on the three inorganic salts nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 and two organic salts ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 having the same molar concentration were studied fig 4 shows that at same temperature nacl produced highest flux than all other salts due to its lower tds concentration the concentration of salt solution affects flux which declined by increasing the feed water salinity lower flux was due to reduced water vapor pressure over the salt solution and as a result reduction of the driving force for mass transfer was observed by increasing feed tds concentration boubakri et al 16 also found that with increasing salt concentration results in increasing viscosity temperature and concentration polarization cp that reduced the driving force of dcmd and consequently the flux cp is the ratio between salt concentrations at hot feed side of the membrane surface to the feed bulk solution that reduces the driving force of evaporation under the same operating conditions organic salts exhibited less flux as compared to inorganic salts and higher flux followed the order of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 the remarkable difference between permeate flux of these salts were probably due to water activity nacl exhibited maximum flux as compared to other salts at all the temperatures as the water activity of nacl is higher than all other salts water activity of any solution is the ratio between vapor of salty water to that of pure water at given temperature the water activity magnitude reflects the free water run away from the salt solution when it is evaporated 32 it has been reported that water activity for inorganic and organic salts follow the order of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 39 similar findings have been reported in previous study 32 for the salts kcl nacl and mgcl2 where the water activity was the leading factors for influencing flux fig 4 reveals that at temperature of 50 c there was less difference in permeate flux between mgcl2 and cacl2 and it become significant at 80 c on the contrary difference between the permeate flux of ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 was reduced with increasing temperature the main difference among permeate fluxes was due to temperature dependence of their solubility solubility plays an important role on membrane distillation flux where the salt having relatively less solubility variation with increase in temperature exhibits higher flux 40 in comparison to cacl2 and ch3coona solubility increase of mgcl2 and mg ch3coo 2 varies little with increase in temperature resulting in higher flux of mgcl2 and mg ch3coo 2 41 3 4 re concentration of draw solution in os mbr draw solution ds concentration is the main driving force of os mbr to extract the clean water across the semi permeable membrane the ds concentration was diluted as a function of operating time and md recovery process was optimized accordingly for draw solution it was necessary to match water transfer rate in md to that in os mbr process water transfer rates of both os mbr and md systems at different salts solutions are shown in fig 5 based upon optimized circulation velocity of 14 cm s with diamond spacer in module and feed temperatures of 70 65 70 80 and 85 c for nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 for re concentration of draw solutions long term experiments of hybrid os mbr and md system were conducted for each ds dcmd was operated with temperature ranging from 50 to 85 c and optimal temperature was selected based upon the water transfer rate requirement of os mbr temperature of distilled water was fixed at 10 c in continuous operation of md with os mbr both os mbr and md water flux declined as a function of operating time concentration of draw solution was constant by maintaining stable equilibrium condition which was obtained by matching the water transfer of both systems fig 5 shows that water transfer rate of md and os mbr process for different salt solutions the permeate flux of md membrane was adjusted to match that to os mbr by changing the circulation velocity and the flushing of md membrane md circulation velocity was reduced when salt concentration increased in draw tank and md membrane was flushed with distilled water when salt concentration decreased in draw tank due to crystal deposition crystal deposition on md membrane leads to pore blocking that restricts the active surface area of membrane for transport of water vapor 42 dcmd was run with os mbr process until fouling of osmotic membrane fig 5 represents the recovery of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 ch3coona and mg ch3coo 2 nacl shows better performance than all other salts in recovery by md as it did not require membrane flushing throughout the system run while mg ch3coo 2 required four times forward flushing because of 0 25 m mg ch3coo 2 having high tds concentration than 0 25 m nacl and all other salts rapid flux decline was found to be significantly dependent on density viscosity salt concentration flow rate and operating temperature 43 rapid flux decline in the md process with mg ch3coo 2 was due to high temperature for obtaining high flux salt concentration was another factor affecting permeate flux where flux decline rate raised proportionally with salinity and mg ch3coo 2 reflected highest salinity at 0 25 m for all other salts similar trends of flux decline indicate that above mentioned parameters are leading factors influencing flux membrane flushing frequency followed the order of mg ch3coo 2 ch3coona cacl2 mgcl2 nacl for forward flushing md membrane was flushed with distilled water with same temperature and circulated on both sides of membrane mostly reversible fouling was observed in this study as shown in fig 5 where membrane flushing restored more than 87 of the initial water flux that was lost due to salts deposition on the membrane similar finding of membrane washing was reported in literature in which 90 of initial water flux was restored when membrane was cleaned with 0 5 hcl solution while cleaning the scaled membrane with tap water 85 flux restoration was achieved 25 fig 5 also shows that the organic and inorganic salts rejection with md membrane were above 99 for all organic and inorganic solutes the md system was able to achieve ds recovery as per requirement of os mbr since the surface area of md membrane was 24 times smaller than that of fo membrane the dcmd system was consequently operated at higher temperature to match the water transfer rate of os mbr system in future studies the feed temperature can be reduced by operating at relatively similar membrane surface areas of md and fo modules 3 5 production of purified water and removal of contaminants the purpose of combining dcmd with os mbr was to successfully recover the draw solution of os mbr and the production of good quality product water in the case of os mbr retention rate of contaminants decline with increase of salinity in bio tank and contaminants accumulate in draw tank 29 44 45 any solute or contaminant passing through the fo membrane even in very small quantity was completely removed with the md membrane fig 6 shows that nh4 n and po4 3 p slowly diffused through the os mbr membrane into the draw solution tank however they were moderately rejected by md membrane and accumulated in draw solution tank cod was not possible to measure in draw tank due to its high salinity 46 however md permeate contained negligible concentration of cod md membrane is capable of completely rejecting non volatile solutes of feed water as well 47 48 in this study the dcmd permeate contained very less concentration of tds cod and nutrients illustrating the excellent ability of md to produce good quality product water 4 conclusion in this study dcmd was operated to re concentrate aqueous salt solutions in a os mbr md system the effects of operating parameters including feed temperature circulation rate effect of spacer and feed salt type were studied to analyze the performance of dcmd for all draw solutes organic inorganic dcmd system was able to achieve high ds recovery as per os mbr requirement permeate flux increased exponentially with temperature at higher temperature the flux was more significant as compare to that at lower temperature permeate flux was also affected by circulation velocity but the flux improvement was relatively less when velocity increased to a certain level moreover diamond spacer was able to produce turbulence and enhanced the water flux up to 35 as compared to without spacer it was observed that the acetate draw solute mg ch3coo 2 gave prolong operational period followed by ch3coona while requiring more md membrane flushing lastly high quality of product water was produced by dcmd due to its high tds and nutrients

14401,novel tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for the control the dissolved oxygen do in aquaculture denitrification process the fabricated hollow fibers are characterized in terms of morphology porosity hydrophobicity and mechanical strength two membrane modules each including 200 pieces of hollow fibers are connected in series or parallel in order to determine the optimum operation mode the deoxygenation test is firstly conducted for di water and then for aquaculture water various methods including water flushing air blowing or chemical cleaning have been applied to assure the cleaning efficiency after membrane fouling a mathematical model has been developed by using the resistance in series concept by taking into account boundary layer and membrane characteristics overall mass transfer coefficient radial and axial concentration profiles and molar flux of oxygen at different water flow rates are calculated this work has demonstrated that the developed tri bore hollow fiber membranes are applicable for the control of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water the observations have provided solid evidence for the development of membrane based denitrification system for recirculating aquaculture system ras keywords tri bore hollow fiber dissolved oxygen mass transfer aquaculture deoxygenation 1 introduction there is growing interest in recirculating aquaculture system ras in recent years due to the worsening pollution of the sea lakes and rivers and the expectation on more intensified production to feed the growing population ras enables minimum water consumption offers improved control of culture conditions and allows accurate quantification of culturing conditions and their effects on physiological rates such as aeration feeding fresh water and waste accumulation and disposal 1 3 ras makes it possible to place the farms in locations where water resources are limited and offers the flexibility of switching the culturing species to follow the market demand or preference for seafood products 4 5 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate in ras facilities as the end product of nitrification affects the growth of culturing species and it is more serious in the systems where nitrifying biofilters are used 6 water consumption and environmental impact are also driving forces for nitrate control in ras 7 to control the nitrate level in ras two methods have been commonly practiced one method is to exchange a fraction of water in the culturing system each day with water low in nitrate 8 easy to be implemented water replacement is being used in many ras facilities except for the consumption of a large quantity of water the same amount of wastewater containing dissolved solids and dissolved nutrients is discharged everyday discharge of nitrate into receiving water courses would adversely affect the existing aqueous ecosystems and incur unexpected situations such as algal booming 7 9 another method is to convert nitrate through a biological process named as denitrificaiton denitrification depends on facultative heterotrophic bacteria which reduces nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o before eventually converted to n2 2 7 9 12 though relatively expensive compared with water replacement biological denitrification attracts more attention recently because it offers high rate of nitrate removal and minimizes the discharge of wastewater and consumption of new water constructed wetland algal pond and aquaponics have also been used for nitrate removal but they are mainly for other culturing systems 13 14 facultative bacteria need a carbon source as food to live while facultative bacteria get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen do from water or taking it off nitrate molecules if both do and nitrate are present facultative bacteria tend to prefer oxygen it is commonly perceived that do acts as an inhibitory and toxic agent to anaerobic treatment because the invasion of oxygen influences the activity of denitrifying bacteria 15 17 in the study of tan et al the optimum do level for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was 0 5 1 0 ppm and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was observed at 70 6 17 the nitrogen removal efficiency was compromised when the do concentration was beyond 1 0 ppm it was reported that denitrification could occur at the do level of 3 5 ppm but the increase in do levels could cause severe drop of the denitrification performance and the consumption rate of the carbon source was increased 18 20 as disclosed by gutieerez wing et al the denitrification rate dropped from 5 5 to 0 5 no3 n l 1 d 1 when the do level increased from 0 5 to 4 0 ppm xu et al observed a denitrification efficiency of 50 at do levels higher than 4 ppm 21 therefore anaerobic environment with proper do control is essential to the efficiency and stability of denitrification it is hard to completely avoid the invasion of oxygen into the anaerobic denitrification system because most reactors are operated within an aerobic open environment however proper control of do level favors the denitrification process and is thus preferable oxygen scavenging agents such as sodium sulfite and iron sulfide were effective to deplete do from anaerobic bioreactors 22 the reaction of reducing agents and do generates solid products that are contaminants and it brings environmental and safety hazards due to storing and handling chemicals 23 more seriously the reducing agents and the products of reduction reaction would have adverse influences on the aquatic species membrane contactors packed with slim hollow fibers have been developed and used for effective control of do level in semiconductor ultrapure water 24 however no suitable membrane contactors are available for anaerobic denitrification systems which contains various foulants dual layer membrane formation using different polymers was reported by xia et al 25 this might be an option to improve the antifouling property of deoxygenation membranes if the fabrication is scalable the objective of this study was to develop robust tri bore hollow fiber hf membranes for the removal of do from aquaculture water the hf membranes were characterized in terms of morphology hydrophobicity porosity and mechanical strength the performance of the fabricated membranes were evaluated for the deoxygenation of deionized di water and aquaculture water various cleaning methods were applied to clean the membranes after fouled by aquaculture water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kynar hsv 900 pvdf supplied by arkema inc was used for the fabrication of tri bore hf membranes n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 5 and polyethylene glycol 200 peg200 99 0 used in membrane fabrication were supplied by merck di water from milli q millipore system was used in all experiments the aquaculture water was supplied by a fish farming company in singapore whatman grade 1 filter paper with pore size of 11 μm was used for the pretreatment of the aquaculture water 2 2 preparation and characterization of tri bore hf membranes tri bore hf membranes were fabricated via a dry jet wet phase inversion spinning process as documented elsewhere 26 28 briefly the dope solution and bore fluid were supplied at specified flow rates by isco syringe pumps teledyne 1000d after entering the coagulation bath the nascent fibers precipitated and were collected by a take up roller detailed spinning conditions are summarized in table 1 after spinning the as spun tri bore hf membranes were immersed in tap water for 2 days to completely remove the residual solvent and additives the fibers were then frozen in a refrigerator and dried overnight in a freeze drier s61 modulyo d thermo electron membrane morphology was inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600f for fesem inspection membrane samples were fractured cryogenically in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a sputtering coater jeol jfc 1600 dynamic contact angle of the outer surface of the fibers was measured using a dataphysics dcat21 tensiometer five measurements were made and the results were averaged for report the membrane porosity was measured by following the protocol described in 26 porosity ε is calculated from 1 ε 1 m f i b e r ρ f i b e r v f i b e r v c h a n n e l 100 where m fiber is the mass of the fiber ρ fiber is the density of the fiber material 1 78 g cm 3 v fiber is the fiber volume calculated from the fiber outer diameter and fiber length and v channel is estimated from the fiber inner diameter and fiber length the mean pore radius and the probability density function curve of the pore radius distribution were obtained from the rejections to the neutral solutes a detailed description of the pore structural characterization and corresponding calculation was given elsewhere 29 the tri bore hollow fibers were soaked with ethanol so that they became permeable for liquid water the liquid entry pressure lep value was calculated using the cantor laplace equation 2 l

is the maximum radius of the membrane 2 3 deoxygenation experiments the deoxygenation performance of the freeze dried tri bore hf membranes was evaluated through a pilot scale degassing system as shown in fig 1 prior to the tests two membrane modules were prepared by bundling the fibers into 1 5 inch pvc casing with the two ends sealed using epoxy resin every membrane module contained 200 pieces of fibers with an effective area of 0 3 m2 for the deoxygenation tests di water was pumped to the lumen side of the hollow fibers while vacuum was applied in the shell side circulation operation modes was adopted i e 4 l water being used and it flowing back to the water tank after exiting from the membrane module all the experiments were conducted at fixed temperatures controlled by using a water circulator julabo f12 the deoxygenation performance under different operation modes and flow rates was firstly examined using di water feed in order to avoid the possible influence of membrane fouling fish pond water was then used in the deoxygenation experiments the efficiency e of deoxygenation is expressed as 3 e 1 c o u t l c i n l 100 where c i n l and c o u t l are the do concentrations in water at the inlet and outlet of the membrane respectively 2 4 mass transport of oxygen 2 4 1 experimental mass transfer coefficient for deoxygenation experiments the experimental mass transfer coefficient k e x p could be determined by 30 4 l n c c i c 0 c i q v e x p k e x p a m l v 1 t where c 0 c i and c are the initial do concentration the do concentration that equilibrates with the gas phase at the water gas interface and the remaining do concentration at different experiment time respectively q is the water flow rate v is the volume of water in the tank a m is the membrane surface area to volume ratio l is the length of the hf membranes and vis the water velocity the value of c i is estimated by using the henry s law 5 p i h c i where p i is the pressure of oxygen at the water gas interface 2 4 2 concentration profile fig 2 is a schematic diagram of the mass transport of oxygen with water flowing in the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane as well as the concentration profile at different phases the steady state two dimensional flow in the lumen side can be written as 31 33 6 v z c z d l 2 c z 2 d r r r c r where c d l r and v z denote the local concentration of oxygen the diffusivity of oxygen in water the radial distance and the axial velocity of water the velocity profile in z direction can be obtained as 7 v z r 2 v 1 r r 2 where v is the average velocity of water in the lumen and ris the radius of the fiber lumen the boundary conditions for eq 6 are as follows z 0 c r 0 c i n b 8 r 0 c 0 z 0 i s f i n i t e o r c r 0 z

shell side of the hf membranes is under vacuum and the interface is located at the lumen the resistance at the shell side permeate side is negligible the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen could be expressed using the resistance in series concept 34 20 1 k 0 d i 1 k l d i r g t h k p d m where k 0 k l and k p are the mass transfer coefficients of oxygen in water and the membrane pore r g is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and d i and d m are the fiber inner diameter and logarithmic mean diameter respectively k l can be calculated from leveque equation under laminar flow condition 21 k l d i d l 1 62 d i 2 v l d l 1 3 the mass transfer coefficient in the hydrophobic membrane is 34 22 k p d p ε τ b where d p τ and b denote the diffusivity of oxygen in the membrane pore the tortuosity of the pore and the membrane thickness respectively in the membrane pores the transport of oxygen is through knudsen diffusion and the diffusivity can be estimated using the following equation 23 d p d p 3 8 r g t π m w 1 2 where d p is the mean pore diameter and m w is the molecular weight of oxygen 2 4 4 flux analysis water is confined in the cylindrical lumen side so the concentration of do is not constant along aixal position of the fibers the bulk average concentration c b z of do in water could be estimated as follows 33 24 c b z 1 v s 0 r c r z v z r 2 π r d r where s is the cross section area of the fiber lumen the local molar flux of oxygen along at different position of the hollow fiber may be written as 25 n k 0 c j b z p b h where p b is the bulk partial pressure of oxygen 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of tri bore hf membranes as shown in table 2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of the tri bore hollow fibers are 670 and 1600 μm respectively the porosity is about 75 which is beneficial for fast transport of oxygen a water contact angle of 94 indicates necessary hydrophobicity which helps to prevent the entry of liquid water into membrane pores under operating conditions it should be noted that the contact angle is measured for the outer surface because it is very hard to measure it for the inner surface as the contact angle is mainly determined by the material pvdf for this case the measured contact angle may be considered as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane the tri bore hf membranes are strong and stretchable as indicated by the maximum load at break of 4 04 n the tensile stress of 6 77 mpa and the elongation of 52 3 typical morphology of the as developed fibers is shown in fig 3 the fiber wall and the junction at the center have thickness of about 120 and 200 μm respectively the thin fiber wall is favorable for the reduction in the resistance to oxygen transport the relative thicker junction provides strong support to the membrane which could stand the pressure difference under operation and maintain its integrity a layer of finger like macrovoids is present underneath the inner surface probably due to the rapid phase inversion and nonsolvent i e water intrusion 35 37 the middle portion and outer edge of the fiber have sponge like porous structure which might be due to combined effects from pore forming agent delayed demixing and stretching peg200 is the pore forming agent and it helps to generate pores and porosity as a non solvent additive the addition of peg200 also brings the dope closer to gelation points so that the phase inversion is accelerated 27 using water as the external coagulant for spinning the outer surfaces of the tri bore hf membranes is less porous consisting of interconnected globules once the outer skin is formed the solvent nonsolvent exchange is retarded and causes delayed demixing which is favorable for the formation of porous structure 36 38 39 as well an air gap distance of 10 cm was used for the spinning appropriate stretching after the nascent fibers are extruded from the spinneret might also contribute to the porous inner surface structure the inner surface is apparently porous though the bore fluid for spinning is also water during the spinning phase inversion is supposed to occur at the bore side rightly after the pvdf solution is extruded from the spinneret the polymer concentration at the inner surface would increase rapidly and form a relatively dense structure it should be noted that the outflow of nmp solvent changes the bore fluid from pure water a strong coagulant into a dilute aqueous solution of nmp solvent even though the amount of outflowed solvent is very small its impact on the phase inversion of the inner skin layer cannot be neglected as the amount of bore fluid is also very small 2 0 ml min 1 the bore fluid with continuously incoming solvent might make the inner surface not as dense as of the outer surface similar phenomenon was reported in another study 40 as shown in fig 4 the pores within the inner skin layer of the tri bore hollow fiber membrane are in the range of 2 20 nm with the mean pore radius of 6 3 nm the membrane is in the category of ultrafiltration and the lep value for water is determined at 9 9 bar 3 2 performance of water deoxygenation the as prepared membranes were firstly tested for di water deoxygenation in order to understand the influences of flow rate and operation mode with two membrane modules in series or parallel the do concentration drastically drops in the first 2 min and the change slows down subsequently fig 5 under both operation modes the water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 generates much faster drop in the do concentration than 500 ml min 1 further increase in the water flow rate above 500 ml min 1 does not significantly influence the do removal rate as well as the do concentration in the effluent data not shown pressure buildup on the lumen side was observed when the water flow rate was above 700 ml min 1 to avoid the influence of pressure on the transport of oxygen only results at relatively low flow rates i e 100 and 500 ml min 1 are discussed here at the same water flow rate the do removal rate is faster when the membrane modules are operated in series under 100 and 500 ml min 1 water flow rates the do removal efficiency is 97 5 and 82 2 when the two membranes are operated in series and 87 7 and 75 4 when the membranes are operated in parallel the experimental mass transfer coefficients are determined as of 2 03 10 5 and 4 73 10 5 m s 1 for the series mode and 1 17 10 5 and 4 01 10 5 m s 1 for the parallel mode respectively the mass transfer coefficient determined for the deoxygenation of di water is similar to that for ro water deoxygenation observed by peng at al 41 pristine aquaculture water taken from ras system was subjected to deoxygenation test with the two membrane modules in series and under a circulation mode as shown in table 3 the aquaculture water is slightly acidic it shows a turbidity of 1 39 ntu and chemical oxygen demand cod of 43 mg l 1 and contains 3245 mg l 1 total suspended solids tss 800 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds and 45 5 mg l 1 nitrate under the four water flow rates tested the mass transfer coefficient does increase with increasing the water flow rate fig 6 surprisingly a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 results in the highest do removal efficiency of 87 3 which is lower than 97 5 observed in di water deoxygenation test the suspended solids and dissolved organic and biological substances adhered to the membrane inner surface might have fouled the membrane reduced the effective membrane area and increased the resistance for oxygen transport the do removal efficiency is 68 1 and 83 2 at 20 and 50 ml min 1 respectively it might be that the flow is too slow and the foulants stay firmly at the membrane inner surface though the flow is more vigorous by increasing the water flow rate to 500 ml min 1 the influence from fouling still cannot be apparently mitigated and a do removal efficiency of 76 8 is achieved based on these observations a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 was used for the subsequent deoxygenation tests air blowing 1 0 bar 10 min and di water flushing 100 min were firstly applied to clean the membrane after deoxygenation of unfiltered aquaculture water due to the simplicity to implement in the real ras as shown in fig 7 air blowing is applied after the 1st run of deoxygenation followed by di water flushing but it does not completely recover the membrane performance as seen from the 2nd run flushing with di water for 100 min does not show better cleaning efficiency than air blowing and the do concentration in the effluent slightly increases for pristine pond water without any pretreatment either air blowing or di water flushing could not effectively remove the foulants deposited at the membrane inner surface and could not maintain the deoxygenation performance in subsequent experiments the aquaculture water was filtered to remove the suspended solids before deoxygenation performance evaluation using the same membrane modules flushing with di water is tried firstly and used as the reference as seen from fig 8 the do level in the effluent still increases gradually after every experiment and the do removal efficiency slightly drops it seems that the fouling is not apparently mitigated after the suspended solids are removed the fouling might have mainly contributed by dissolved organic substances and microorganisms cleaning with naoh solution ph10 followed by di water flushing works when the flushing time is increased to 60 min but the efficiency is still quite low fig 9 a mixture of naoh ph10 and sds 1 mm is effective to remove the foulants from the membrane surface better recovery of the membrane performance is achieved with lengthening the cleaning time from 20 to 40 and 60 min as well the cleaning with naoh sds solution could help to maintain the performance of the hf membranes i e the exiting aquaculture water not higher than 1 ppm do which is expected for biological denitrification 3 3 mass transport of oxygen 3 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer in vacuum deoxygenation involves the diffusion of oxygen in liquid water membrane pores and surrounding vacuum or gas stream 30 42 using eqs 21 23 the mass transfer coefficients in the liquid phase and membrane pore as well as the overall mass transfer coefficient are determined and shown in fig 10 with the objective of understanding the mass transfer the theoretical study here only considers the case that fresh clean water without foulants enters the membrane module and leaves at the exiting point without circulation i e one pass mode generally the calculated mass transfer coefficient is in line with the experimental results shown in fig 6 clearly the mass transfer coefficient in the membrane pores does not change with increasing the water flow rate and it is much higher than that in the liquid phase the reason is as follows the shell side of the fibers i e the bulk gas phase is under vacuum the pores of the membrane are directly or indirectly connected with the bulk gas phase only gas molecules e g oxygen and water vapor could enter the pores resulted from the hydrophobic nature of the membrane while they are immediately taken away upon continuous suction in the shell side within the membrane pores the resistance to the movement of oxygen only comes from the tortuous or interconnected pore walls the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid water phase lumen side is 15 90 times lower than that in the membrane phase in the lumen side do needs to diffuse in water towards the water gas interface and pass through the interface before entering the membrane pores as gas molecules the slow transport of oxygen is directly resulted from the low oxygen diffusivity in the bulk water and the boundary layer near the fiber wall even at a water flow rate of 1 l min 1 water is still at laminar flow and the influence of mass transfer from the boundary layer is significant as a result the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen is dominated by the liquid water phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient k 0 is determined by the mass transfer coefficient in water k l 3 3 2 concentration profiles at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the concentration profiles of do in radial and axial directions were calculated and are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively showing obviously similar trend only radial concentration profiles at water flow rates of 100 and 500 ml min 1 are presented and discussed here at both water flow rates the do concentration at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 is higher than that at the fiber wall r r while the difference is more significant at a higher water flow rate at 100 ml min 1 water flow rate the radial do concentration varies more significantly near the entrance region of the membrane and the variation becomes less with water flowing through the membrane module it drops slowly in the later stages at the half length point l 2 the do concentration drops by 68 6 and 83 3 at the center and fiber wall respectively around the exit region of the membrane module the do reduction is only 83 2 at the center and 85 3 at the fiber wall it seems that at low water flow rate the existing do concentration at the center almost reaches the same level as that at the fiber wall at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate the do removal rate becomes slow as seen from the small change in the radial do concentration fig 11 even though a higher water flow rate means enhanced mass transfer coefficient fig 10 the significantly shortened residence time within the membrane determines lower the ultimate do removal efficiency for the concentration of do in axial direction for different radial points the influence of flow rate on the deoxygenation performance is more clearly seen from fig 12 at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 the axial do concentration falls slowly for 500 ml min 1 water flow rate but falls rapidly at 100 ml min 1 flow rate apart from the lumen center the axial do concentration at different radial points changes slower at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate near the fiber wall there is a sharp decline in the do concentration for both cases the exiting do concentration corresponding to 500 ml min 1 flow rate has a broad distribution which is very different from what seen from another case fig 12 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the diffusion of do from the bulk to the fiber wall where the water gas interface is located is too slow 3 3 3 molar flux profile the molar flux of do at different axial positions of the membrane module is shown in fig 13 obviously the molar flux of do increases with increasing the water flow rate at low flow rates e g 20 ml min 1 the molar flux is only high in the entrance region z l 0 2 and it is almost constant thereafter for relatively higher water flow rates the molar flux of do gradually decreases with water flowing long the membrane module and reaches the minimum value at the exiting point calculating from the average do concentration the do removal efficiency is about 85 6 84 3 52 4 and 35 1 at water flow rates of 20 100 500 and 1000 ml min 1 respectively consequently slow water flow rate is preferred as it results in better deoxygenation performance it should be noted that these theoretical calculations are based on the assumption that the feed water is clean and there is no membrane fouling if some foulants exist in the feed water they tend to deposit on the membrane surface to form an extra layer which not only reduces the effective membrane surface area for oxygen to transport but also increases the resistance the fouling is more serious if the flow is slow for a real scenario the operation conditions should be optimized by considering the mass transfer rate as well as the membrane fouling propensity simultaneously 4 conclusions novel and robust tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed for water deoxygenation its performance is better when two membranes are connected in series based on di water feed a do removal efficiency of 97 5 is achieved at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 when applied for aquaculture water the deoxygenation performance slightly decreases and a do removal efficiency of 87 3 is obtained membrane fouling is observed whether the aquaculture water is pre treated or not di water flushing air blowing or cleaning with naoh ph solution are not effective to clean the fouled membranes a combination of naoh oh and 1 mm sds shows satisfactory cleaning efficiency and the deoxygenation performance of the membrane could be maintained mathematic modeling has been conducted to investigate the oxygen transport from water to the gas phase through the membrane with water flowing in the lumen the mass transfer coefficient and molar flux of do increase with increasing the water flow rate the do concentrations in radial and axial directions show very different features at low and high water flow rates however the ultimate do removal efficiency would be higher at low water flow rates due to longer residence time which allows the diffusion of do from the fiber lumen to the boundary layer and the water gas interface the do removal efficiency could be reduced from 85 6 to 35 1 with increasing the water flow rate from 20 to 1000 ml min 1 for the deoxygenation of relatively clean water without or with minimum foulants operation of the membrane modules at low flow rate would be preferable acknowledgments we acknowledge ministry of education singapore for

14401,novel tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for the control the dissolved oxygen do in aquaculture denitrification process the fabricated hollow fibers are characterized in terms of morphology porosity hydrophobicity and mechanical strength two membrane modules each including 200 pieces of hollow fibers are connected in series or parallel in order to determine the optimum operation mode the deoxygenation test is firstly conducted for di water and then for aquaculture water various methods including water flushing air blowing or chemical cleaning have been applied to assure the cleaning efficiency after membrane fouling a mathematical model has been developed by using the resistance in series concept by taking into account boundary layer and membrane characteristics overall mass transfer coefficient radial and axial concentration profiles and molar flux of oxygen at different water flow rates are calculated this work has demonstrated that the developed tri bore hollow fiber membranes are applicable for the control of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water the observations have provided solid evidence for the development of membrane based denitrification system for recirculating aquaculture system ras keywords tri bore hollow fiber dissolved oxygen mass transfer aquaculture deoxygenation 1 introduction there is growing interest in recirculating aquaculture system ras in recent years due to the worsening pollution of the sea lakes and rivers and the expectation on more intensified production to feed the growing population ras enables minimum water consumption offers improved control of culture conditions and allows accurate quantification of culturing conditions and their effects on physiological rates such as aeration feeding fresh water and waste accumulation and disposal 1 3 ras makes it possible to place the farms in locations where water resources are limited and offers the flexibility of switching the culturing species to follow the market demand or preference for seafood products 4 5 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate in ras facilities as the end product of nitrification affects the growth of culturing species and it is more serious in the systems where nitrifying biofilters are used 6 water consumption and environmental impact are also driving forces for nitrate control in ras 7 to control the nitrate level in ras two methods have been commonly practiced one method is to exchange a fraction of water in the culturing system each day with water low in nitrate 8 easy to be implemented water replacement is being used in many ras facilities except for the consumption of a large quantity of water the same amount of wastewater containing dissolved solids and dissolved nutrients is discharged everyday discharge of nitrate into receiving water courses would adversely affect the existing aqueous ecosystems and incur unexpected situations such as algal booming 7 9 another method is to convert nitrate through a biological process named as denitrificaiton denitrification depends on facultative heterotrophic bacteria which reduces nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o before eventually converted to n2 2 7 9 12 though relatively expensive compared with water replacement biological denitrification attracts more attention recently because it offers high rate of nitrate removal and minimizes the discharge of wastewater and consumption of new water constructed wetland algal pond and aquaponics have also been used for nitrate removal but they are mainly for other culturing systems 13 14 facultative bacteria need a carbon source as food to live while facultative bacteria get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen do from water or taking it off nitrate molecules if both do and nitrate are present facultative bacteria tend to prefer oxygen it is commonly perceived that do acts as an inhibitory and toxic agent to anaerobic treatment because the invasion of oxygen influences the activity of denitrifying bacteria 15 17 in the study of tan et al the optimum do level for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was 0 5 1 0 ppm and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was observed at 70 6 17 the nitrogen removal efficiency was compromised when the do concentration was beyond 1 0 ppm it was reported that denitrification could occur at the do level of 3 5 ppm but the increase in do levels could cause severe drop of the denitrification performance and the consumption rate of the carbon source was increased 18 20 as disclosed by gutieerez wing et al the denitrification rate dropped from 5 5 to 0 5 no3 n l 1 d 1 when the do level increased from 0 5 to 4 0 ppm xu et al observed a denitrification efficiency of 50 at do levels higher than 4 ppm 21 therefore anaerobic environment with proper do control is essential to the efficiency and stability of denitrification it is hard to completely avoid the invasion of oxygen into the anaerobic denitrification system because most reactors are operated within an aerobic open environment however proper control of do level favors the denitrification process and is thus preferable oxygen scavenging agents such as sodium sulfite and iron sulfide were effective to deplete do from anaerobic bioreactors 22 the reaction of reducing agents and do generates solid products that are contaminants and it brings environmental and safety hazards due to storing and handling chemicals 23 more seriously the reducing agents and the products of reduction reaction would have adverse influences on the aquatic species membrane contactors packed with slim hollow fibers have been developed and used for effective control of do level in semiconductor ultrapure water 24 however no suitable membrane contactors are available for anaerobic denitrification systems which contains various foulants dual layer membrane formation using different polymers was reported by xia et al 25 this might be an option to improve the antifouling property of deoxygenation membranes if the fabrication is scalable the objective of this study was to develop robust tri bore hollow fiber hf membranes for the removal of do from aquaculture water the hf membranes were characterized in terms of morphology hydrophobicity porosity and mechanical strength the performance of the fabricated membranes were evaluated for the deoxygenation of deionized di water and aquaculture water various cleaning methods were applied to clean the membranes after fouled by aquaculture water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kynar hsv 900 pvdf supplied by arkema inc was used for the fabrication of tri bore hf membranes n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 5 and polyethylene glycol 200 peg200 99 0 used in membrane fabrication were supplied by merck di water from milli q millipore system was used in all experiments the aquaculture water was supplied by a fish farming company in singapore whatman grade 1 filter paper with pore size of 11 μm was used for the pretreatment of the aquaculture water 2 2 preparation and characterization of tri bore hf membranes tri bore hf membranes were fabricated via a dry jet wet phase inversion spinning process as documented elsewhere 26 28 briefly the dope solution and bore fluid were supplied at specified flow rates by isco syringe pumps teledyne 1000d after entering the coagulation bath the nascent fibers precipitated and were collected by a take up roller detailed spinning conditions are summarized in table 1 after spinning the as spun tri bore hf membranes were immersed in tap water for 2 days to completely remove the residual solvent and additives the fibers were then frozen in a refrigerator and dried overnight in a freeze drier s61 modulyo d thermo electron membrane morphology was inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600f for fesem inspection membrane samples were fractured cryogenically in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a sputtering coater jeol jfc 1600 dynamic contact angle of the outer surface of the fibers was measured using a dataphysics dcat21 tensiometer five measurements were made and the results were averaged for report the membrane porosity was measured by following the protocol described in 26 porosity ε is calculated from 1 ε 1 m f i b e r ρ f i b e r v f i b e r v c h a n n e l 100 where m fiber is the mass of the fiber ρ fiber is the density of the fiber material 1 78 g cm 3 v fiber is the fiber volume calculated from the fiber outer diameter and fiber length and v channel is estimated from the fiber inner diameter and fiber length the mean pore radius and the probability density function curve of the pore radius distribution were obtained from the rejections to the neutral solutes a detailed description of the pore structural characterization and corresponding calculation was given elsewhere 29 the tri bore hollow fibers were soaked with ethanol so that they became permeable for liquid water the liquid entry pressure lep value was calculated using the cantor laplace equation 2 l

is the maximum radius of the membrane 2 3 deoxygenation experiments the deoxygenation performance of the freeze dried tri bore hf membranes was evaluated through a pilot scale degassing system as shown in fig 1 prior to the tests two membrane modules were prepared by bundling the fibers into 1 5 inch pvc casing with the two ends sealed using epoxy resin every membrane module contained 200 pieces of fibers with an effective area of 0 3 m2 for the deoxygenation tests di water was pumped to the lumen side of the hollow fibers while vacuum was applied in the shell side circulation operation modes was adopted i e 4 l water being used and it flowing back to the water tank after exiting from the membrane module all the experiments were conducted at fixed temperatures controlled by using a water circulator julabo f12 the deoxygenation performance under different operation modes and flow rates was firstly examined using di water feed in order to avoid the possible influence of membrane fouling fish pond water was then used in the deoxygenation experiments the efficiency e of deoxygenation is expressed as 3 e 1 c o u t l c i n l 100 where c i n l and c o u t l are the do concentrations in water at the inlet and outlet of the membrane respectively 2 4 mass transport of oxygen 2 4 1 experimental mass transfer coefficient for deoxygenation experiments the experimental mass transfer coefficient k e x p could be determined by 30 4 l n c c i c 0 c i q v e x p k e x p a m l v 1 t where c 0 c i and c are the initial do concentration the do concentration that equilibrates with the gas phase at the water gas interface and the remaining do concentration at different experiment time respectively q is the water flow rate v is the volume of water in the tank a m is the membrane surface area to volume ratio l is the length of the hf membranes and vis the water velocity the value of c i is estimated by using the henry s law 5 p i h c i where p i is the pressure of oxygen at the water gas interface 2 4 2 concentration profile fig 2 is a schematic diagram of the mass transport of oxygen with water flowing in the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane as well as the concentration profile at different phases the steady state two dimensional flow in the lumen side can be written as 31 33 6 v z c z d l 2 c z 2 d r r r c r where c d l r and v z denote the local concentration of oxygen the diffusivity of oxygen in water the radial distance and the axial velocity of water the velocity profile in z direction can be obtained as 7 v z r 2 v 1 r r 2 where v is the average velocity of water in the lumen and ris the radius of the fiber lumen the boundary conditions for eq 6 are as follows z 0 c r 0 c i n b 8 r 0 c 0 z 0 i s f i n i t e o r c r 0 z

λ y 2 2 w λ y 2 a t φ 1 0 2 4 3 theoretical mass transfer coefficient at the water gas interface henry s law is applicable eq 4 as water containing do can be considered as dilute solution since the shell side of the hf membranes is under vacuum and the interface is located at the lumen the resistance at the shell side permeate side is negligible the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen could be expressed using the resistance in series concept 34 20 1 k 0 d i 1 k l d i r g t h k p d m where k 0 k l and k p are the mass transfer coefficients of oxygen in water and the membrane pore r g is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and d i and d m are the fiber inner diameter and logarithmic mean diameter respectively k l can be calculated from leveque equation under laminar flow condition 21 k l d i d l 1 62 d i 2 v l d l 1 3 the mass transfer coefficient in the hydrophobic membrane is 34 22 k p d p ε τ b where d p τ and b denote the diffusivity of oxygen in the membrane pore the tortuosity of the pore and the membrane thickness respectively in the membrane pores the transport of oxygen is through knudsen diffusion and the diffusivity can be estimated using the following equation 23 d p d p 3 8 r g t π m w 1 2 where d p is the mean pore diameter and m w is the molecular weight of oxygen 2 4 4 flux analysis water is confined in the cylindrical lumen side so the concentration of do is not constant along aixal position of the fibers the bulk average concentration c b z of do in water could be estimated as follows 33 24 c b z 1 v s 0 r c r z v z r 2 π r d r where s is the cross section area of the fiber lumen the local molar flux of oxygen along at different position of the hollow fiber may be written as 25 n k 0 c j b z p b h where p b is the bulk partial pressure of oxygen 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of tri bore hf membranes as shown in table 2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of the tri bore hollow fibers are 670 and 1600 μm respectively the porosity is about 75 which is beneficial for fast transport of oxygen a water contact angle of 94 indicates necessary hydrophobicity which helps to prevent the entry of liquid water into membrane pores under operating conditions it should be noted that the contact angle is measured for the outer surface because it is very hard to measure it for the inner surface as the contact angle is mainly determined by the material pvdf for this case the measured contact angle may be considered as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane the tri bore hf membranes are strong and stretchable as indicated by the maximum load at break of 4 04 n the tensile stress of 6 77 mpa and the elongation of 52 3 typical morphology of the as developed fibers is shown in fig 3 the fiber wall and the junction at the center have thickness of about 120 and 200 μm respectively the thin fiber wall is favorable for the reduction in the resistance to oxygen transport the relative thicker junction provides strong support to the membrane which could stand the pressure difference under operation and maintain its integrity a layer of finger like macrovoids is present underneath the inner surface probably due to the rapid phase inversion and nonsolvent i e water intrusion 35 37 the middle portion and outer edge of the fiber have sponge like porous structure which might be due to combined effects from pore forming agent delayed demixing and stretching peg200 is the pore forming agent and it helps to generate pores and porosity as a non solvent additive the addition of peg200 also brings the dope closer to gelation points so that the phase inversion is accelerated 27 using water as the external coagulant for spinning the outer surfaces of the tri bore hf membranes is less porous consisting of interconnected globules once the outer skin is formed the solvent nonsolvent exchange is retarded and causes delayed demixing which is favorable for the formation of porous structure 36 38 39 as well an air gap distance of 10 cm was used for the spinning appropriate stretching after the nascent fibers are extruded from the spinneret might also contribute to the porous inner surface structure the inner surface is apparently porous though the bore fluid for spinning is also water during the spinning phase inversion is supposed to occur at the bore side rightly after the pvdf solution is extruded from the spinneret the polymer concentration at the inner surface would increase rapidly and form a relatively dense structure it should be noted that the outflow of nmp solvent changes the bore fluid from pure water a strong coagulant into a dilute aqueous solution of nmp solvent even though the amount of outflowed solvent is very small its impact on the phase inversion of the inner skin layer cannot be neglected as the amount of bore fluid is also very small 2 0 ml min 1 the bore fluid with continuously incoming solvent might make the inner surface not as dense as of the outer surface similar phenomenon was reported in another study 40 as shown in fig 4 the pores within the inner skin layer of the tri bore hollow fiber membrane are in the range of 2 20 nm with the mean pore radius of 6 3 nm the membrane is in the category of ultrafiltration and the lep value for water is determined at 9 9 bar 3 2 performance of water deoxygenation the as prepared membranes were firstly tested for di water deoxygenation in order to understand the influences of flow rate and operation mode with two membrane modules in series or parallel the do concentration drastically drops in the first 2 min and the change slows down subsequently fig 5 under both operation modes the water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 generates much faster drop in the do concentration than 500 ml min 1 further increase in the water flow rate above 500 ml min 1 does not significantly influence the do removal rate as well as the do concentration in the effluent data not shown pressure buildup on the lumen side was observed when the water flow rate was above 700 ml min 1 to avoid the influence of pressure on the transport of oxygen only results at relatively low flow rates i e 100 and 500 ml min 1 are discussed here at the same water flow rate the do removal rate is faster when the membrane modules are operated in series under 100 and 500 ml min 1 water flow rates the do removal efficiency is 97 5 and 82 2 when the two membranes are operated in series and 87 7 and 75 4 when the membranes are operated in parallel the experimental mass transfer coefficients are determined as of 2 03 10 5 and 4 73 10 5 m s 1 for the series mode and 1 17 10 5 and 4 01 10 5 m s 1 for the parallel mode respectively the mass transfer coefficient determined for the deoxygenation of di water is similar to that for ro water deoxygenation observed by peng at al 41 pristine aquaculture water taken from ras system was subjected to deoxygenation test with the two membrane modules in series and under a circulation mode as shown in table 3 the aquaculture water is slightly acidic it shows a turbidity of 1 39 ntu and chemical oxygen demand cod of 43 mg l 1 and contains 3245 mg l 1 total suspended solids tss 800 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds and 45 5 mg l 1 nitrate under the four water flow rates tested the mass transfer coefficient does increase with increasing the water flow rate fig 6 surprisingly a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 results in the highest do removal efficiency of 87 3 which is lower than 97 5 observed in di water deoxygenation test the suspended solids and dissolved organic and biological substances adhered to the membrane inner surface might have fouled the membrane reduced the effective membrane area and increased the resistance for oxygen transport the do removal efficiency is 68 1 and 83 2 at 20 and 50 ml min 1 respectively it might be that the flow is too slow and the foulants stay firmly at the membrane inner surface though the flow is more vigorous by increasing the water flow rate to 500 ml min 1 the influence from fouling still cannot be apparently mitigated and a do removal efficiency of 76 8 is achieved based on these observations a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 was used for the subsequent deoxygenation tests air blowing 1 0 bar 10 min and di water flushing 100 min were firstly applied to clean the membrane after deoxygenation of unfiltered aquaculture water due to the simplicity to implement in the real ras as shown in fig 7 air blowing is applied after the 1st run of deoxygenation followed by di water flushing but it does not completely recover the membrane performance as seen from the 2nd run flushing with di water for 100 min does not show better cleaning efficiency than air blowing and the do concentration in the effluent slightly increases for pristine pond water without any pretreatment either air blowing or di water flushing could not effectively remove the foulants deposited at the membrane inner surface and could not maintain the deoxygenation performance in subsequent experiments the aquaculture water was filtered to remove the suspended solids before deoxygenation performance evaluation using the same membrane modules flushing with di water is tried firstly and used as the reference as seen from fig 8 the do level in the effluent still increases gradually after every experiment and the do removal efficiency slightly drops it seems that the fouling is not apparently mitigated after the suspended solids are removed the fouling might have mainly contributed by dissolved organic substances and microorganisms cleaning with naoh solution ph10 followed by di water flushing works when the flushing time is increased to 60 min but the efficiency is still quite low fig 9 a mixture of naoh ph10 and sds 1 mm is effective to remove the foulants from the membrane surface better recovery of the membrane performance is achieved with lengthening the cleaning time from 20 to 40 and 60 min as well the cleaning with naoh sds solution could help to maintain the performance of the hf membranes i e the exiting aquaculture water not higher than 1 ppm do which is expected for biological denitrification 3 3 mass transport of oxygen 3 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer in vacuum deoxygenation involves the diffusion of oxygen in liquid water membrane pores and surrounding vacuum or gas stream 30 42 using eqs 21 23 the mass transfer coefficients in the liquid phase and membrane pore as well as the overall mass transfer coefficient are determined and shown in fig 10 with the objective of understanding the mass transfer the theoretical study here only considers the case that fresh clean water without foulants enters the membrane module and leaves at the exiting point without circulation i e one pass mode generally the calculated mass transfer coefficient is in line with the experimental results shown in fig 6 clearly the mass transfer coefficient in the membrane pores does not change with increasing the water flow rate and it is much higher than that in the liquid phase the reason is as follows the shell side of the fibers i e the bulk gas phase is under vacuum the pores of the membrane are directly or indirectly connected with the bulk gas phase only gas molecules e g oxygen and water vapor could enter the pores resulted from the hydrophobic nature of the membrane while they are immediately taken away upon continuous suction in the shell side within the membrane pores the resistance to the movement of oxygen only comes from the tortuous or interconnected pore walls the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid water phase lumen side is 15 90 times lower than that in the membrane phase in the lumen side do needs to diffuse in water towards the water gas interface and pass through the interface before entering the membrane pores as gas molecules the slow transport of oxygen is directly resulted from the low oxygen diffusivity in the bulk water and the boundary layer near the fiber wall even at a water flow rate of 1 l min 1 water is still at laminar flow and the influence of mass transfer from the boundary layer is significant as a result the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen is dominated by the liquid water phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient k 0 is determined by the mass transfer coefficient in water k l 3 3 2 concentration profiles at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the concentration profiles of do in radial and axial directions were calculated and are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively showing obviously similar trend only radial concentration profiles at water flow rates of 100 and 500 ml min 1 are presented and discussed here at both water flow rates the do concentration at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 is higher than that at the fiber wall r r while the difference is more significant at a higher water flow rate at 100 ml min 1 water flow rate the radial do concentration varies more significantly near the entrance region of the membrane and the variation becomes less with water flowing through the membrane module it drops slowly in the later stages at the half length point l 2 the do concentration drops by 68 6 and 83 3 at the center and fiber wall respectively around the exit region of the membrane module the do reduction is only 83 2 at the center and 85 3 at the fiber wall it seems that at low water flow rate the existing do concentration at the center almost reaches the same level as that at the fiber wall at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate the do removal rate becomes slow as seen from the small change in the radial do concentration fig 11 even though a higher water flow rate means enhanced mass transfer coefficient fig 10 the significantly shortened residence time within the membrane determines lower the ultimate do removal efficiency for the concentration of do in axial direction for different radial points the influence of flow rate on the deoxygenation performance is more clearly seen from fig 12 at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 the axial do concentration falls slowly for 500 ml min 1 water flow rate but falls rapidly at 100 ml min 1 flow rate apart from the lumen center the axial do concentration at different radial points changes slower at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate near the fiber wall there is a sharp decline in the do concentration for both cases the exiting do concentration corresponding to 500 ml min 1 flow rate has a broad distribution which is very different from what seen from another case fig 12 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the diffusion of do from the bulk to the fiber wall where the water gas interface is located is too slow 3 3 3 molar flux profile the molar flux of do at different axial positions of the membrane module is shown in fig 13 obviously the molar flux of do increases with increasing the water flow rate at low flow rates e g 20 ml min 1 the molar flux is only high in the entrance region z l 0 2 and it is almost constant thereafter for relatively higher water flow rates the molar flux of do gradually decreases with water flowing long the membrane module and reaches the minimum value at the exiting point calculating from the average do concentration the do removal efficiency is about 85 6 84 3 52 4 and 35 1 at water flow rates of 20 100 500 and 1000 ml min 1 respectively consequently slow water flow rate is preferred as it results in better deoxygenation performance it should be noted that these theoretical calculations are based on the assumption that the feed water is clean and there is no membrane fouling if some foulants exist in the feed water they tend to deposit on the membrane surface to form an extra layer which not only reduces the effective membrane surface area for oxygen to transport but also increases the resistance the fouling is more serious if the flow is slow for a real scenario the operation conditions should be optimized by considering the mass transfer rate as well as the membrane fouling propensity simultaneously 4 conclusions novel and robust tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed for water deoxygenation its performance is better when two membranes are connected in series based on di water feed a do removal efficiency of 97 5 is achieved at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 when applied for aquaculture water the deoxygenation performance slightly decreases and a do removal efficiency of 87 3 is obtained membrane fouling is observed whether the aquaculture water is pre treated or not di water flushing air blowing or cleaning with naoh ph solution are not effective to clean the fouled membranes a combination of naoh oh and 1 mm sds shows satisfactory cleaning efficiency and the deoxygenation performance of the membrane could be maintained mathematic modeling has been conducted to investigate the oxygen transport from water to the gas phase through the membrane with water flowing in the lumen the mass transfer coefficient and molar flux of do increase with increasing the water flow rate the do concentrations in radial and axial directions show very different features at low and high water flow rates however the ultimate do removal efficiency would be higher at low water flow rates due to longer residence time which allows the diffusion of do from the fiber lumen to the boundary layer and the water gas interface the do removal efficiency could be reduced from 85 6 to 35 1 with increasing the water flow rate from 20 to 1000 ml min 1 for the deoxygenation of relatively clean water without or with minimum foulants operation of the membrane modules at low flow rate would be preferable acknowledgments we acknowledge ministry of education singapore for

eliminated heavy metal ions keywords phthalocyanine hyperbranched poly amidoamine multi functional membrane heavy metal ions diels alder reaction 1 introduction as the demand for clean water increases water shortages are becoming serious concerns because of climate change and water pollution therefore water treatment technologies that purify sewage are becoming more important 1 3 even small amounts of heavy metals can have considerably adverse effects on health and the environment 4 6 most heavy metals in water are in an ionic state and are therefore difficult to detect or remove in particular cadmium lead and chromium cause gastrointestinal bleeding renal failure and necrosis to avoid harmful effects to ecosystems standards of very low concentrations must be maintained and continuous water quality monitoring is required 7 8 to remove heavy metals methods of adsorbing and precipitating them have been used 9 11 however this has a risk of secondary contamination because of large amounts of generated sludge thus membrane technology has been examined for purifying contaminated water resources it is eco friendly with low energy consumption and does not cause secondary pollution 12 16 to remove heavy metal ions in water reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane systems with small pore sizes have been used 17 19 however these membranes require high pressure and have very low water permeability here a multi functional membrane was investigated that detected and removed heavy metals while exhibiting excellent water permeability with relatively large pore ultrafiltration microfiltration membranes phthalocyanine pc was incorporated on the surface of the membrane because it can be used to detect heavy metals it is a large aromatic molecule with eighteen delocalized π electrons 20 22 hence ground state electrons can be excited to many various energy levels and fluorescence energy is emitted when they return to the ground state however when pc forms a chelate with a specific heavy metal ion fluorescence quenching occurs because of the reduced energy band gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 23 24 this fluorescence quenching can be utilized as a sensor for heavy metals in raw water 25 28 to prevent the detected heavy metals from permeating through the membrane a hyperbranched type poly amidoamine pamam has been used to adsorb them it has many primary and tertiary amine groups and can have a high order dendritic branch structure that can adsorb heavy metals by forming chelates in a large number of hollows 12 29 33 in addition amine groups impart hydrophilicity to the surface of hydrophobic poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes greatly improving water permeability 13 34 35 here multi functional membranes were made that can detect heavy metals via pc fluorescence quenching and also use hyperbranched pamam hpamam to prevent membrane permeation of the detected heavy metals the diels alder da reaction between a furan and a maleimide was used to couple the two functional materials onto the ptfe membrane surface regeneration property was thus imparted to the membrane surface functionality for this da reaction the ptfe membrane surface was modified into a furan group and the terminal groups of pc and hpamam were modified into maleimides the da reaction exhibited less side reactions and was reversible by heat 36 39 maleimide modified pc and hpamam were thus introduced sequentially onto the furan modified ptfe membrane surface by the da reaction at the same temperature during the water purification process the functional materials deteriorated from the polluted water they can then be removed from the membrane by a retro da reaction and be replaced with new functional material 40 41 this regeneration reduces the maintenance costs by re using the same membrane and can be easily used to change the functionality of the membrane according to specific needs in this study the ptfe membrane modified with two functional materials was able to simultaneously detect and eliminate heavy metals furthermore the thermo reversible da reaction enabled regeneration

phthalocyanine was synthesized using 4 nitrophthalonitrile and acetone oxime and its nitro groups were then converted into amine groups 22 42 subsequently maleimide modified phthalocyanine pc mi was prepared from the reaction of amino phthalocyanine and maleimide derivatives n 4 carboxylphenyl maleimide chloride p cpmic see fig s3 and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr spectroscopy fig s4 hpamam was prepared as described previously 12 13 by one pot polymerization of methyl acrylate and ethylene diamine over the reaction time the mixed solution turned yellow then p cpmic was added and stirred at room temperature to produce maleimide modified hpamam hpamam mi as shown in fig s6 and 1h nmr fig s7 in order to introduce the functional materials modified with maleimide by the da reaction the surface modification process of the ptfe membrane is required for the amine surface modification of the ptfe membrane it was irradiated with uv light 200 w λmax 254 nm for 48 h under hydrazine vapor conditions as shown in fig 1 the furfuryl glycidyl ether was then dropped on both sides of the membrane which was then stored in a 60 oven overnight to convert the surface amine groups into furan groups the furan modified ptfe membrane was immersed in a 5 wt pc mi tetrahydrofuran thf solution sealed and stored in a 60 oven for 4 h then the membrane was immersed in a 5 wt hpamam mi water solution sealed and kept in a 60 oven for 24 h the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane was washed with ethanol and thf and vacuum dried at room temperature 2 3 thermally reversible peel and stick of hpamam and pc to membrane maleimide modified hpamam and pc coupled through a da reaction exhibited thermally reversible characteristics the hpamam pc modified membrane was immersed in a one neck round bottom flask containing 100 ml of toluene and heated at 150 for 24 h to remove pc and hpamam by the retro da rda reaction after the rda reaction was complete the membrane was washed several times with deionized water ethanol thf and vacuum dried at room temperature pc and hpamam were again sequentially bonded to the membrane surface via the da reaction this process was repeated three times 2 4 characterization the hpamam pc and their maleimide derivatives were analyzed by ft ir maldi tof ms 1h nmr spectroscopy ft ir spectra were acquired with a thermo scientific nicolet 6700 ft ir

pti quantamaster 8075 11 over the wavelength range 350 600 nm heavy metal ion adsorption was measured with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes perkin elmer optima 8300 the water flux was examined for 12 h using a 10 ml dead end stirred cell amicon 8010 millipore corp connected to a stainless steel pressure vessel millipore corp filled with deionized water at a

of the permeate l a was the effective area of the membrane m2 and t was the filtration time h the permeation volume js of the 25 ppm cr6 aqueous solution was measured by the same procedure as that for the water flux 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane ft ir spectra of the aminated ptfe membrane fig 2 d showed a broad nh stretch at around 3400 cm 1 and a nh2 scissoring band at 1670 cm 1 while the furan modified ptfe membrane fig 2e had a cc stretching band at 1577 cm 1 in addition the pc modified ptfe membrane fig 2f revealed a co stretch at 1719 cm 1 a nh bend at 1610 cm 1 and a cn stretch at 1020 cm 1 all of which appear in pc mi powder fig 2a indicating that pc was on the ptfe membrane surface hpamam pc membranes fig 2g clearly showed a broad nh stretch at around 3400 cm 1 a co stretch at 1765 cm 1 a ch2 bend at 1465 cm 1 and a c h para substitute out of plane at 850 cm 1 all of which coincided with the peaks of pc mi fig 2a and hpamam mi fig 2b hence the ft ir analysis indicated the presence of hpamam and pc on the same membrane surface the chemical composition of the membranes was analyzed with xps fig 3 a b have xps spectra of hpamam mi and pc mi respectively in both cases there was intense cc bond emission at 284 5 ev for pc mi the c n intensity was noticeably stronger than the co signal because of its nitrogen rich structure whereas the hpamam mi has similar c n and co intensities after modifying the membrane surface with hpamam and pc via the da reaction the cc signal at 284 5 ev and the c n signal at 287 ev significantly increased fig 3c additionally the n 1 s signals at 399 2 ev assigned to nh were present confirming that the ptfe membrane was functionalized with hpamam and pc furthermore the atomic carbon concentration increased 33 58 at 36 09 at while the atomic fluorine concentration decreased 66 41 at 61 28 at relative to the neat ptfe membrane in addition an atomic oxygen concentration of 1 84 at and an atomic nitrogen concentration of 0 80 at were newly observed these results also confirmed the presence of hpamam and pc on the ptfe membrane surface the change in surface morphology attributed to the modification step of the ptfe membrane was imaged with fe sem as shown in fig 4 the ptfe membrane surface morphologies did not indicate significant changes relative to the neat ptfe surface during the amine and furan modifications hence the membrane pore structure was not affected by the uv hydrazine treatment and the furan modification however the surface pore structure modified by the da bonds of hpamam and pc was partially filled with a thick polymer layer the size of the membrane pore was directly measured according to the modification step of the membrane fig s8 as a result it was confirmed that the average pore size of the membrane which remained at the level of 2 3 was remarkably reduced to 1 3 after the modification of hpamam pc on the other hand the 145 2 0 17 contact angle of the extremely hydrophobic neat ptfe membrane was decreased to 57 7 0 80 by the hydrophilic polymer hpamam as noted above the membrane surface pore size was slightly decreased by the polymer layer following hpamam pc modification but its decreased hydrophobicity improved water permeation all the results thus indicate that hpamam and pc moieties modified the ptfe membrane surface 3 2 performance evaluation of the hpamam pc modified membrane as noted above the membrane hydrophilicity was greatly increased by hpamam pc modification in addition data in table 1 shows that water did not permeate the hydrophobic neat ptfe membrane at pressures as high as 30 lb in2 whereas the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane had a water permeability of 48 78 l m2h at a pressure of 10 lb in2 in addition an aqueous solution containing 25 ppm concentrations each of cd ii pb ii and cr vi ions was allowed to permeate through the hpamam pc modified membrane to evaluate the heavy metal adsorption performance of the membrane table 2 indicates that the hpamam pc modified membrane excluded up to 97 1 of the pb ii ions and removed about 77 6 of the cr vi ions as noted above the pc fluorescence may decrease or disappear during adsorption of specific heavy metal ions we have planned accelerated experiments as a strategy to more clearly and economically observe the performance changes of functional membranes that is the concentration of heavy metals in the raw water used in this study is higher than the expected concentration of raw water used in the actual water treatment process an aqueous solution containing 25 ppm of chromium was allowed to permeate through the hpamam pc modified membrane and the membrane fluorescence over the range 300 600 nm was analyzed fig 5 the pc fluorescence decreased as it adsorbed chromium ions during the passage of the aqueous solution through the membrane hence the hpamam pc modified membrane could be used to eliminate heavy metal ions as well as detect specific ones 3 3 thermally reversible regeneration of hpamam pc on the ptfe membrane surface the maleimide modified hpamam and pc bind to the furan modified ptfe membrane via a da reaction between 20 and 80 reversibility was observed at temperatures above 100 via the rda reaction to confirm the regeneration of the membrane functionality by da and rda reactions the membranes were immersed in toluene and heated to 150 the membrane that had functional materials removed by the rda reaction was washed with distilled water and ethanol the functional materials were then reintroduced via the da reaction at 60 this process was repeated three times fig 6 shows atr ft ir spectra after repeated regeneration the characteristic co stretch at 1712 cm 1 for ketone and 1664 cm 1 for amide the nh bend at 1606 cm 1 and the c n stretch at 1507 cm 1 observed for the hpamam pc modified membrane disappeared following hpamam pc removal via the rda reaction at 150 the peaks reappeared after regeneration of hpamam and pc via the da reaction at 60 in addition the xps analysis fig 7 discussed above revealed that the n 1s signals at 399 1 ev attributed to hpamam and pc disappeared after removal by the rda reaction and were then recovered when the hpamam and pc were regenerated by the da reaction in contrast the f 1s signal at 688 8 ev which was reduced in the hpamam pc modified membrane was restored to its original intensity in the neat ptfe membrane by the rda reaction and decreased again when the hpamam and pc were regenerated these results were confirmed by imaging the membrane surface morphology with fe sem fig 8 shows that the thick polymer layer seen in the hpamam pc modified membrane disappeared in the rda reaction and was regenerated in the da reaction in addition the contact angle which was lowered to 57 7 0 80 by hpamam increased to 118 8 0 15 as hpamam and pc disappeared in the rda reaction and then decreased again to 79 4 0 35 after the da reaction all of these results were confirmed by three repeated experiments as shown in fig 9 fluorescence from the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane weakened as the pc adsorbed chromium ions removal of the hpamam pc with adsorbed chromium via rda reaction followed by regeneration of new hpamam and pc on the membrane surface restored chromium detection via fluorescence the hpamam pc modified membranes prevented permeation of heavy metal ions including chromium via adsorption by hpamam however the removal efficiency of the heavy metal ions decreased over time with passage through the membrane the removal efficiency of chromium ions was also recovered in the regenerated hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane table 3 when the hpamam and pc reached their performance limit the regeneration of new hpamam and pc by the rda da reaction normalized detection and removal of the heavy metal ions 4 conclusion a multi functional ptfe membrane capable of detecting and removing heavy metals was prepared by thermally reversible da coupling of hpamam and pc the pc fluorescence was selectively quenched by reaction with chromium ions while the hpamam excluded chromium and other heavy metal permeation through the membrane furthermore water permeation through the membrane was improved by the hydrophilic hpamam when the efficiency of the heavy metal detection and removal deteriorated over time the hpamam pc functionality could be regenerated by a thermally reversible da reaction the multi functional membrane enabled regeneration and conversion of the functionalities for both detecting heavy metals and inhibiting their permeation thus the efficiency of the membrane process was maximized the incorporation of two or more functional materials into a single membrane may be significant in terms of enabling synergistic effects for a variety of applications acknowledgements this research was supported by basic science research program through the national research

mi fig 2a and hpamam mi fig 2b hence the ft ir analysis indicated the presence of hpamam and pc on the same membrane surface the chemical composition of the membranes was analyzed with xps fig 3 a b have xps spectra of hpamam mi and pc mi respectively in both cases there was intense cc bond emission at 284 5 ev for pc mi the c n intensity was noticeably stronger than the co signal because of its nitrogen rich structure whereas the hpamam mi has similar c n and co intensities after modifying the membrane surface with hpamam and pc via the da reaction the cc signal at 284 5 ev and the c n signal at 287 ev significantly increased fig 3c additionally the n 1 s signals at 399 2 ev assigned to nh were present confirming that the ptfe membrane was functionalized with hpamam and pc furthermore the atomic carbon concentration increased 33 58 at 36 09 at while the atomic fluorine concentration decreased 66 41 at 61 28 at relative to the neat ptfe membrane in addition an atomic oxygen concentration of 1 84 at and an atomic nitrogen concentration of 0 80 at were newly observed these results also confirmed the presence of hpamam and pc on the ptfe membrane surface the change in surface morphology attributed to the modification step of the ptfe membrane was imaged with fe sem as shown in fig 4 the ptfe membrane surface morphologies did not indicate significant changes relative to the neat ptfe surface during the amine and furan modifications hence the membrane pore structure was not affected by the uv hydrazine treatment and the furan modification however the surface pore structure modified by the da bonds of hpamam and pc was partially filled with a thick polymer layer the size of the membrane pore was directly measured according to the modification step of the membrane fig s8 as a result it was confirmed that the average pore size of the membrane which remained at the level of 2 3 was remarkably reduced to 1 3 after the modification of hpamam pc on the other hand the 145 2 0 17 contact angle of the extremely hydrophobic neat ptfe membrane was decreased to 57 7 0 80 by the hydrophilic polymer hpamam as noted above the membrane surface pore size was slightly decreased by the polymer layer following hpamam pc modification but its decreased hydrophobicity improved water permeation all the results thus indicate that hpamam and pc moieties modified the ptfe membrane surface 3 2 performance evaluation of the hpamam pc modified membrane as noted above the membrane hydrophilicity was greatly increased by hpamam pc modification in addition data in table 1 shows that water did not permeate the hydrophobic neat ptfe membrane at pressures as high as 30 lb in2 whereas the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane had a water permeability of 48 78 l m2h at a pressure of 10 lb in2 in addition an aqueous solution containing 25 ppm concentrations each of cd ii pb ii and cr vi ions was allowed to permeate through the hpamam pc modified membrane to evaluate the heavy metal adsorption performance of the membrane table 2 indicates that the hpamam pc modified membrane excluded up to 97 1 of the pb ii ions and removed about 77 6 of the cr vi ions as noted above the pc fluorescence may decrease or disappear during adsorption of specific heavy metal ions we have planned accelerated experiments as a strategy to more clearly and economically observe the performance changes of functional membranes that is the concentration of heavy metals in the raw water used in this study is higher than the expected concentration of raw water used in the actual water treatment process an aqueous solution containing 25 ppm of chromium was allowed to permeate through the hpamam pc modified membrane and the membrane fluorescence over the range 300 600 nm was analyzed fig 5 the pc fluorescence decreased as it adsorbed chromium ions during the passage of the aqueous solution through the membrane hence the hpamam pc modified membrane could be used to eliminate heavy metal ions as well as detect specific ones 3 3 thermally reversible regeneration of hpamam pc on the ptfe membrane surface the maleimide modified hpamam and pc bind to the furan modified ptfe membrane via a da reaction between 20 and 80 reversibility was observed at temperatures above 100 via the rda reaction to confirm the regeneration of the membrane functionality by da and rda reactions the membranes were immersed in toluene and heated to 150 the membrane that had functional materials removed by the rda reaction was washed with distilled water and ethanol the functional materials were then reintroduced via the da reaction at 60 this process was repeated three times fig 6 shows atr ft ir spectra after repeated regeneration the characteristic co stretch at 1712 cm 1 for ketone and 1664 cm 1 for amide the nh bend at 1606 cm 1 and the c n stretch at 1507 cm 1 observed for the hpamam pc modified membrane disappeared following hpamam pc removal via the rda reaction at 150 the peaks reappeared after regeneration of hpamam and pc via the da reaction at 60 in addition the xps analysis fig 7 discussed above revealed that the n 1s signals at 399 1 ev attributed to hpamam and pc disappeared after removal by the rda reaction and were then recovered when the hpamam and pc were regenerated by the da reaction in contrast the f 1s signal at 688 8 ev which was reduced in the hpamam pc modified membrane was restored to its original intensity in the neat ptfe membrane by the rda reaction and decreased again when the hpamam and pc were regenerated these results were confirmed by imaging the membrane surface morphology with fe sem fig 8 shows that the thick polymer layer seen in the hpamam pc modified membrane disappeared in the rda reaction and was regenerated in the da reaction in addition the contact angle which was lowered to 57 7 0 80 by hpamam increased to 118 8 0 15 as hpamam and pc disappeared in the rda reaction and then decreased again to 79 4 0 35 after the da reaction all of these results were confirmed by three repeated experiments as shown in fig 9 fluorescence from the hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane weakened as the pc adsorbed chromium ions removal of the hpamam pc with adsorbed chromium via rda reaction followed by regeneration of new hpamam and pc on the membrane surface restored chromium detection via fluorescence the hpamam pc modified membranes prevented permeation of heavy metal ions including chromium via adsorption by hpamam however the removal efficiency of the heavy metal ions decreased over time with passage through the membrane the removal efficiency of chromium ions was also recovered in the regenerated hpamam pc modified ptfe membrane table 3 when the hpamam and pc reached their performance limit the regeneration of new hpamam and pc by the rda da reaction normalized detection and removal of the heavy metal ions 4 conclusion a multi functional ptfe membrane capable of detecting and removing heavy metals was prepared by thermally reversible da coupling of hpamam and pc the pc fluorescence was selectively quenched by reaction with chromium ions while the hpamam excluded chromium and other heavy metal permeation through the membrane furthermore water permeation through the membrane was improved by the hydrophilic hpamam when the efficiency of the heavy metal detection and removal deteriorated over time the hpamam pc functionality could be regenerated by a thermally reversible da reaction the multi functional membrane enabled regeneration and conversion of the functionalities for both detecting heavy metals and inhibiting their permeation thus the efficiency of the membrane process was maximized the incorporation of two or more functional materials into a single membrane may be significant in terms of enabling synergistic effects for a variety of applications acknowledgements this research was supported by basic science research program through the national research

consumption in sa has steadily increased due to the products being inexpensive and therefore the preferred source of protein for the majority of the population 1 the south african poultry industry utilises a large quantity of potable water for slaughtering and production processes 2 an average of 15 20 l of water is utilized per processed bird of which approximately 80 90 of this process water is discharged as psw 3 the psw generated is typically classified as medium strength wastewater due to the high concentration of organic matter i e cod and bod5 inorganic matter suspended solids fats

treatment systems are required to abide by the municipal by laws within each municipality as prescribed by the water services act of 1997 although monitoring is limited 8 9 on site wastewater treatment systems employed by poultry slaughterhouses generally consist of screening followed by an equalisation tank and a dissolved air flotation daf system 3 10 in addition to these treatment processes several other processes have been reported for psw treatment with high rate anaerobic processes being the most commonly used due to their high overall treatment efficiency up to 90 and suitability for treating wastewater with a high organic load 4 11 these high rate anaerobic reactors which include the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb bioreactor expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactor and sgbr operate at long hrts and short solids retention times srts which facilitates the treatment of a large quantity of wastewater using highly active biomass in the form of anaerobic sludge or granules 12 14 the sgbr was developed with the purpose of simplifying the design operation and maintenance of high rate anaerobic reactors whilst still maintaining high quality influent treatment 15 16 the design of the sgbr is based on the uasb reactor design however the distinguishing feature of the sgbr is its down flow configuration which eases the separation of the wastewater solids and biogas 17 the sgbr has proven to be successful in the treatment of various low to medium strength wastewaters including psw however further treatment of sgbr effluents is usually required 4 7 9 14 18 due to increasingly stringent environmental regulations with regard to high nutrient levels as well as growing interest in water re use and reclamation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd which combines heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification processes can be considered as an attractive post treatment for anaerobic effluents the oxidation of organic matter and the snd process can occur under aerobic conditions within a single bioreactor i e single stage nitrification denitrification snd seifi fazaelipoor 2012 furthermore uf membranes have proven to be efficient in the removal of particulate matter pathogens and environmentally hazardous nutrients from psw 3 19 20 and has demonstrated its suitability as a post treatment system for anaerobically treated psw 10 the use of the sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmm systems have proven to be successful in the treatment of various industrial wastewaters however no study has reported on the performance and efficiency of the combined use of these processes for the treatment of psw the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of treating psw from a poultry slaughterhouse to a water quality standard compliant with industrial wastewater discharge standards and to evaluate the performance of sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmm systems and the overall psw treatment system 2 material and methods 2 1 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater psw characterisation the psw used in this study was obtained from a poultry slaughterhouse located in the western cape province sa psw samples were collected as grab samples from the sump of the poultry slaughterhouse s existing wastewater treatment facility stored in 25 l polyvinyl chloride pvc containers and refrigerated at 4 c the characteristics of the untreated unfiltered psw used in this study are listed in table 1 2 2 lab scale psw treatment system in this study the lab scale psw treatment system consisted of 1 an anaerobic sgbr for organic matter and suspended solids removal 2 a snd aerobic bioreactor for total nitrogen tn removal and 3 an ufmm system as a final treatment stage for residual organic matter and suspended solids removal fig 1 2 3 sgbr set up and inoculation the down flow sgbr was made from a cylindrical glass column with a working volume of 2 l height and inner diameter of 0 62 m and 0 065 m respectively pumice stones average diameter of 5 20 mm were used as the underdrain bed to prevent the washout of anaerobic granules a stainless steel sieve 2 mm pore size was fixed to the bottom of the sgbr to retain the pumice stones and granules a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa was used for feeding the psw into the sgbr and a circulating water bath was used to supply the water jacket the sgbr was inoculated with 0 4 l of anaerobic granules obtained from a full scale mesophilic uasb reactor operated at a local brewery plant newlands south africa and fed with 1 6 l of untreated unfiltered psw 2 4 sgbr start up and operating conditions the sgbr was operated continuously at mesophilic temperature i e 35 37 c for 138 days the psw was filtered through a mesh screen 2 mm pore size to remove large floating solids and particulate matter prior to feeding the sgbr the filtered psw was diluted with potable water to prevent overloading the sgbr the sgbr was fed with 50 v v and 25 v v psw for a period of 43 and 8 days respectively after the 48 hour acclimatization period the hrt was set to 55 h and the sgbr was fed with 50 v v psw to initiate the start up period olr of 1 18 g cod l day a second start up was implemented due to the washout of fine granules via the effluent stream during the first start up period in order to restore the granular bed to its original volume granule re supplementation into the sgbr was implemented allowing for a further 24 h for acclimatization the hrt was increased step wise from 55 h 1st start up to 96 h 2nd start up to enable the biomass to restabilize whilst preventing further washout of granules the hrts at which the sgbr operated was based on conditions reported in debik and coskun 4 and basitere rinquest 9 the sgbr operating conditions are summarised in table 2 2 5 snd bioreactor set up and inoculation the snd aerobic bioreactor used in this study had a total volume of 19 l height and inner diameter of 2 m and 0 11 m respectively and a working volume of 10 l fig 1 the bioreactor was made from a cylindrical pvc column packing material in the form of gravel average diameter of 20 30 mm and gravel integrated with sponge average diameter of 25 35 mm were used as filter and supporting media for the nitrifiers and dentrifiers which are known to perform better when immobilised than in free floating form 21 the total packed bed height was 1 m a perforated pvc cylinder height and inner diameter of 0 52 m and 0 09 m respectively holding 20 mm sponge cubes for microbial attachment was positioned at the top of the bioreactor the hrt was controlled by a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa during the aeration stage a resun ac 9906 air pump resun china was used to supply air via an air stone positioned at a height of 0 85 m from the top of the bioreactor the snd bioreactor was inoculated with 10 l of untreated unfiltered psw and fed with 100 ml of basal medium periodically at 24 intervals for 7 days a quantity of 100 ml of psw was removed prior to adding the basal medium the basal medium comprised per 1 l 1 5 g l kh2po4 7 9 g l na2hpo4 0 5 g l mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml trace element 50 g l

which was filter sterilised 0 22 μm pore size and adjusted to a ph of 7 using sodium hydroxide the sgbr effluent was fed into the bioreactor after the acclimatization period of 7 days 2 6 snd operation and operating conditions the snd bioreactor was continuously operated at ambient temperature i e 23 25 c for 87 days two operating strategies were tested during stage 1 the bioreactor was operated in a down flow configuration without aeration during stage 2 the configuration was changed to up flow mode and air was continuously supplied into the bioreactor the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the aerobic zone was maintained between 1 8 3 2 mg l the hrt was varied stepwise as shown in table 3 2 7 ufmm system set up and operation hollow fibre hf ceramic uf membranes were used in this study the membranes were enclosed in glass cylindrical modules each with a volume of 45 ml fig 1 the uf membrane specifications are presented in table 4 the ufmms were operated under dead end filtration mode the feed i e a weekly composite sample of the snd bioreactor effluent was pumped into the bottom of the module into the lumen side of the membrane at constant feed flow rate using a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa the permeate was collected from the shell side of the ufmm the ufmms were operated at ambient temperature i e 23 25 c the operating conditions of the uf membrane are summarised in table 5 2 8 sampling and analytical methods the performance of the sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmms were monitored and evaluated using the analyses of the feed and effluent samples the temperature ph conductivity tds and salinity were measured using a pcstestr 35 multiparameter and the turbidity using a tn 100 turbidimeter the cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and po4 p were determined using merck cod solutions solution a cat no 1 14538 0065 and 1 14679 049 solution b cat no 1 14539 0495 and 1 14680 1495 and merck spectroquant test kits nh4 n test kit cat no 1 00683 0001

were completed in triplicate and an average for each parameter was calculated from the measurements recorded a weekly composite sample of the sgbr feed and effluent was sent to a south african national accreditation system sanas accredited lab scientific services sa for alkalinity bod5 o g and vfa analyses 3 results and discussion the findings of this study represent the operation of the sgbr snd bioreactor ufmms and overall psw treatment system under varying conditions the sgbr effluent was used as feed for the snd bioreactor and a composite sample of the snd bioreactor effluent was used as feed for the ufmms the hrts of the sgbr operated for 138 days in this study were specifically maintained kept constant for 26 min to 30 max days based on bioreactor performances as indicated in previous studies i e basitere et al and debik coskun which was within a range suitable to attain an appropriate anaerobic biomass response the change of hrts and olrs was motivated by the necessity to assess the performance of the sgbr as the wastewater quality characteristics of the psw varied depending on the slaughterhouse operations at a specific time furthermore the active anaerobic biomass used in the sgbr was procured from an operational uasb treating wastewater with characteristics similar to those observed for the psw which rendered an ability to withstand olr fluctuations at hrts of 24 to 96 h hrts maintained for 26 min to 30 max an operational strategy deemed sufficient for the biomass to acclimatize to the psw being treated 3 1 sgbr efficiency at varying hrts and olrs the cod tss fog and bod5 removal efficiencies in relation to the varying hrts and average olrs are represented in fig 2 fluctuations in the olr were due to the organic matter concentrations in the feed varying according to the operation in the poultry slaughterhouse at the time of sampling the feed cod concentrations ranged between 2195 and 12 490 mg l and averaged at 4344 2312 mg l with corresponding average olrs of 0 96 12 5 and 2 75 2 11 g cod lday respectively the effluent cod was consistently low throughout this study which was attributed to the high activity the granular bed and the downflow configuration which enabled pneumatic mixing within the sgbr furthermore the gravel underdrain system helps to retain the granules within the reactor which ensures that there is sufficient microbial activity for the degradation of the organic matter present in the feed wastewater the cod tss and bod5 removal efficiencies were consistently above 70 80 and 90 respectively throughout this study with the intermittent performance reduction on several days attributed to backwashing operations the fog removal efficiencies however were relatively low during the start up period due to the insoluble nature of fog and the inept biodegradable proficiency of the granular bed during the initialization of the sgbr operation the fog removal efficiency increased to above 80 on average after the start up period fig 2 removal efficiencies reached a maximum of 86 for cod 95 for tss 94 for fog and 99 for bod5 respectively at an olr of 4 10 g cod lday and hrt of 36 h similarly basitere rinquest 9 reported cod tss and fog removal efficiencies of 93 95 and 90 respectively when operating a sgbr for psw treatment at hrts of 55 and 40 h with average olrs of 1 01 and 3 14 g cod lday the lowest removal efficiencies were observed during the start up period during which the washout of granules occurred from the sgbr which created the need for granules re supplementation and subsequently an additional 24 h for acclimatization the cod tss and bod5 removal efficiencies increased as the olr increased whereas the fog removal efficiencies were not a function of the olr fig 2 a similar trend was reported by lim and fox 12 in the treatment of swine wastewater using a lab scale sgbr operated at 24 c the increase in the removal efficiencies at higher olrs was as a result of the sgbrs ability to effectively tolerate increasing olrs as the biomass matured as well as due the biological degradation and the physical filtration and retention of the organic matter and suspended solids fats and proteins within the sgbr 22 however the combination of a 48 h hrt and an average olr of 1 96 g cod l day significantly contributed to the quantity of accumulated suspended solids in the sgbr this ultimately led to clogging of the granular bed which impacted on the operability of the sgbr 3 2 sgbr performance in relation to discharge standards the characteristics of the sgbr feed and effluent are summarized in table 6 the variation in the feed characteristics can be attributed to the wastewater samples being collected from the poultry slaughterhouse at irregular intervals the effluent ph ranged between 6 29 to 8 59 which was within the acceptable range for discharge i e 5 9 7 the sgbr successfully reduced the cod of the psw to a maximum of 974 mg l which is less than the permitted discharge limit of 5000 mg l despite the cod averaging at 4344 mg l further reduction to a value below 1000 mg l eliminates the penalties imposed on industries including poultry slaughterhouses similarly the effluent tss and fog of 160 and 100 mg l were well below their respective limits of 1000 and 400 mg l respectively however further treatment of the sgbr effluent was required for the po4 3 nh4 n no3 n and tds which exceeded the maximum limits for permitted discharge as expected with anaerobic effluents 3 3 performance of the snd bioreactor fig 3 shows the tn removal efficiencies achieved by the snd bioreactor for 87 days under do limiting conditions and the down flow configuration stage 1 the snd bioreactor achieved average nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn removal efficiencies of 25 96 93 and 33 respectively the relatively low tn removal efficiencies observed during the first week was due to the system lacking a readily available biodegradable carbon source and the slow growth of ammonium oxidising bacteria aob 23 the bioreactor was therefore inoculated with untreated psw on day 17 which resulted in an increase in both the tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies the nh4 n remained significantly low indicating that nitrification was inhibited due to the aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob competing for do seifi fazaelipoor the high nh4 n and relatively low effluent no3 n and no2 n effluent concentrations 1 mg l suggested that the initial oxidation of nh4 n was the rate limiting step in the nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal increased significantly to satisfactory levels after the reconfiguration of the bioreactor from down flow to up flow operation and the addition of a sparging system stage 2 as a result of the up flow configuration the nitrification was followed by denitrification and the hrt was therefore increased to 11 days to minimise the washout of the nitrifying microorganisms via the effluent stream exiting the top of the bioreactor and to provide sufficient conversion time for the adjustment of the biofilm to the new operating configuration the snd bioreactor achieved nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn removal efficiencies of 90 87 78 and 79 respectively the high nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies indicated that nitrification was the dominant process occurring within the snd bioreactor and verified that the oxygen supply was an important factor for efficient nh4 n oxidation and a successful snd process furthermore the low nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent and high tn removal efficiency suggested that a significant nitrification denitrification process occurred during this stage however the snd bioreactor setup was not yet optimized with respect to the do transfer although complete nitrogen removal was not achieved the aim was to assess the possibility of a snd process occurring within a single stage bioreactor without the addition of external carbon sources and activated sludge a strategy required to mitigate operational costs at an industrial scale in a study performed by mpongwana ntwampe 24 it was proven that bacterial isolates i e enterobacter sp yersinia sp and serratia sp from psw obtained from the same source as the psw used in this study are capable of carrying out simultaneous nitrification and aerobic denitrification snd therefore the biological potential exists for snd without supplemental organic carbon sources the nitrogen removal due to snd was 97 8 and 97 9 during stage 1 and 2 respectively furthermore the bioreactor was not designed as an activated sludge process for simultaneous cod and po4 p removal hence there was no significant cod and po4 p removal observed 3 4 performance of the ufmm system the ufmm system was initiated on day 27 of the snd bioreactor operation during stage 1 of the combined snd ufmm system operation the ufmms achieved rejection efficiencies of 59 for cod 61 for tss 88 for turbidity with an average effluent tds concentration of 1198 mg l the permeate produced during stage 2 was characterized by an average tds of 785 mg l and rejection efficiencies of 78 for cod 50 for tss and 92 for turbidity the marginal reduction in the tss rejection efficiency from stage 1 to 2 was attributed to fouling of the uf membranes since the permeate flux observed during stage 2 4 77 l m2h was lower than stage 1 5 l m2h in spite of the constant feed flow rate applied during both stages although the complete removal of the residual cod and tss was not achieved the ufmms performed more efficiently during stage 2 due to the superior quality of the snd bioreactor effluent as a result of the upflow configuration and air supply implemented during stage 2 similarly basitere rinquest 9 reported an average rejection efficiency of 64 for cod and 88 for tss for uf membranes used as a post primary treatment for psw which was pre treated by a sgbr 3 5 performance of the psw treatment system table 7 shows the performance of the sgbr snd ufmm and overall psw systems for a period of 87 days the psw system was evaluated at hrts of 6 and 11 days olrs of 0 08 to 0 12 g cod lday and an average nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 04 g tn lday the psw system achieved higher cod and tss removal efficiencies in comparison to the individual sgbr and snd ufmm systems thus demonstrating the efficacy of coupling biological and physical treatment processes for psw treatment the final effluent produced was compliant with the industrial wastewater discharge standards with the exception of the po4 3 and nh4 n 4 conclusions the sgbr was able to consistently reduce the organic matter suspended solids and fats content of the pre filtered psw throughout its 138 days of operation with removal efficiencies exceeding 80 on average however periodic backwashing was required to mitigate clogging and further treatment of the sgbr effluent was required with regard to the nutrient and tds levels the snd bioreactor performed satisfactorily with regard to the tn removal in the sgbr effluent even without the addition of carbon sources and the use of activated sludge the snd bioreactor achieved optimum results when operated in up flow mode with a continuous air supply achieving a tn removal of 79 the ufmms were able to further reduce the residual cod and tss by 65 and 54 respectively the final effluent produced by the psw treatment system was compliant with the industrial wastewater discharge standards with the exclusion of the po4 3 and nh4 n thus indicating refinement of the designed system is required in order to optimize the treatment of the psw acknowledgments the authors of this study would like to acknowledge funding received from the national

treatment systems employed by poultry slaughterhouses generally consist of screening followed by an equalisation tank and a dissolved air flotation daf system 3 10 in addition to these treatment processes several other processes have been reported for psw treatment with high rate anaerobic processes being the most commonly used due to their high overall treatment efficiency up to 90 and suitability for treating wastewater with a high organic load 4 11 these high rate anaerobic reactors which include the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb bioreactor expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactor and sgbr operate at long hrts and short solids retention times srts which facilitates the treatment of a large quantity of wastewater using highly active biomass in the form of anaerobic sludge or granules 12 14 the sgbr was developed with the purpose of simplifying the design operation and maintenance of high rate anaerobic reactors whilst still maintaining high quality influent treatment 15 16 the design of the sgbr is based on the uasb reactor design however the distinguishing feature of the sgbr is its down flow configuration which eases the separation of the wastewater solids and biogas 17 the sgbr has proven to be successful in the treatment of various low to medium strength wastewaters including psw however further treatment of sgbr effluents is usually required 4 7 9 14 18 due to increasingly stringent environmental regulations with regard to high nutrient levels as well as growing interest in water re use and reclamation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd which combines heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification processes can be considered as an attractive post treatment for anaerobic effluents the oxidation of organic matter and the snd process can occur under aerobic conditions within a single bioreactor i e single stage nitrification denitrification snd seifi fazaelipoor 2012 furthermore uf membranes have proven to be efficient in the removal of particulate matter pathogens and environmentally hazardous nutrients from psw 3 19 20 and has demonstrated its suitability as a post treatment system for anaerobically treated psw 10 the use of the sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmm systems have proven to be successful in the treatment of various industrial wastewaters however no study has reported on the performance and efficiency of the combined use of these processes for the treatment of psw the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of treating psw from a poultry slaughterhouse to a water quality standard compliant with industrial wastewater discharge standards and to evaluate the performance of sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmm systems and the overall psw treatment system 2 material and methods 2 1 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater psw characterisation the psw used in this study was obtained from a poultry slaughterhouse located in the western cape province sa psw samples were collected as grab samples from the sump of the poultry slaughterhouse s existing wastewater treatment facility stored in 25 l polyvinyl chloride pvc containers and refrigerated at 4 c the characteristics of the untreated unfiltered psw used in this study are listed in table 1 2 2 lab scale psw treatment system in this study the lab scale psw treatment system consisted of 1 an anaerobic sgbr for organic matter and suspended solids removal 2 a snd aerobic bioreactor for total nitrogen tn removal and 3 an ufmm system as a final treatment stage for residual organic matter and suspended solids removal fig 1 2 3 sgbr set up and inoculation the down flow sgbr was made from a cylindrical glass column with a working volume of 2 l height and inner diameter of 0 62 m and 0 065 m respectively pumice stones average diameter of 5 20 mm were used as the underdrain bed to prevent the washout of anaerobic granules a stainless steel sieve 2 mm pore size was fixed to the bottom of the sgbr to retain the pumice stones and granules a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa was used for feeding the psw into the sgbr and a circulating water bath was used to supply the water jacket the sgbr was inoculated with 0 4 l of anaerobic granules obtained from a full scale mesophilic uasb reactor operated at a local brewery plant newlands south africa and fed with 1 6 l of untreated unfiltered psw 2 4 sgbr start up and operating conditions the sgbr was operated continuously at mesophilic temperature i e 35 37 c for 138 days the psw was filtered through a mesh screen 2 mm pore size to remove large floating solids and particulate matter prior to feeding the sgbr the filtered psw was diluted with potable water to prevent overloading the sgbr the sgbr was fed with 50 v v and 25 v v psw for a period of 43 and 8 days respectively after the 48 hour acclimatization period the hrt was set to 55 h and the sgbr was fed with 50 v v psw to initiate the start up period olr of 1 18 g cod l day a second start up was implemented due to the washout of fine granules via the effluent stream during the first start up period in order to restore the granular bed to its original volume granule re supplementation into the sgbr was implemented allowing for a further 24 h for acclimatization the hrt was increased step wise from 55 h 1st start up to 96 h 2nd start up to enable the biomass to restabilize whilst preventing further washout of granules the hrts at which the sgbr operated was based on conditions reported in debik and coskun 4 and basitere rinquest 9 the sgbr operating conditions are summarised in table 2 2 5 snd bioreactor set up and inoculation the snd aerobic bioreactor used in this study had a total volume of 19 l height and inner diameter of 2 m and 0 11 m respectively and a working volume of 10 l fig 1 the bioreactor was made from a cylindrical pvc column packing material in the form of gravel average diameter of 20 30 mm and gravel integrated with sponge average diameter of 25 35 mm were used as filter and supporting media for the nitrifiers and dentrifiers which are known to perform better when immobilised than in free floating form 21 the total packed bed height was 1 m a perforated pvc cylinder height and inner diameter of 0 52 m and 0 09 m respectively holding 20 mm sponge cubes for microbial attachment was positioned at the top of the bioreactor the hrt was controlled by a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa during the aeration stage a resun ac 9906 air pump resun china was used to supply air via an air stone positioned at a height of 0 85 m from the top of the bioreactor the snd bioreactor was inoculated with 10 l of untreated unfiltered psw and fed with 100 ml of basal medium periodically at 24 intervals for 7 days a quantity of 100 ml of psw was removed prior to adding the basal medium the basal medium comprised per 1 l 1 5 g l kh2po4 7 9 g l na2hpo4 0 5 g l mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml trace element 50 g l edta 2 2 g l znso4 7h2o 5 5 g l cacl2 5 06 g l mncl2 4h2o 5 0 g l feso4 7h2o 1 1 g l nh4 6mo7o2 4h2o 1 57 g l cuso4 5h2o 1 61 g l cocl2 6h2o yeast extract 7 8 g l was supplemented in the basal medium which was filter sterilised 0 22 μm pore size and adjusted to a ph of 7 using sodium hydroxide the sgbr effluent was fed into the bioreactor after the acclimatization period of 7 days 2 6 snd operation and operating conditions the snd bioreactor was continuously operated at ambient temperature i e 23 25 c for 87 days two operating strategies were tested during stage 1 the bioreactor was operated in a down flow configuration without aeration during stage 2 the configuration was changed to up flow mode and air was continuously supplied into the bioreactor the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the aerobic zone was maintained between 1 8 3 2 mg l the hrt was varied stepwise as shown in table 3 2 7 ufmm system set up and operation hollow fibre hf ceramic uf membranes were used in this study the membranes were enclosed in glass cylindrical modules each with a volume of 45 ml fig 1 the uf membrane specifications are presented in table 4 the ufmms were operated under dead end filtration mode the feed i e a weekly composite sample of the snd bioreactor effluent was pumped into the bottom of the module into the lumen side of the membrane at constant feed flow rate using a minipuls evolution peristaltic pump gilson usa the permeate was collected from the shell side of the ufmm the ufmms were operated at ambient temperature i e 23 25 c the operating conditions of the uf membrane are summarised in table 5 2 8 sampling and analytical methods the performance of the sgbr snd bioreactor and ufmms were monitored and evaluated using the analyses of the feed and effluent samples the temperature ph conductivity tds and salinity were measured using a pcstestr 35 multiparameter and the turbidity using a tn 100 turbidimeter the cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and po4 p were determined using merck cod solutions solution a cat no 1 14538 0065 and 1 14679 049 solution b cat no 1 14539 0495 and 1 14680 1495 and merck spectroquant test kits nh4 n test kit cat no 1 00683 0001

were completed in triplicate and an average for each parameter was calculated from the measurements recorded a weekly composite sample of the sgbr feed and effluent was sent to a south african national accreditation system sanas accredited lab scientific services sa for alkalinity bod5 o g and vfa analyses 3 results and discussion the findings of this study represent the operation of the sgbr snd bioreactor ufmms and overall psw treatment system under varying conditions the sgbr effluent was used as feed for the snd bioreactor and a composite sample of the snd bioreactor effluent was used as feed for the ufmms the hrts of the sgbr operated for 138 days in this study were specifically maintained kept constant for 26 min to 30 max days based on bioreactor performances as indicated in previous studies i e basitere et al and debik coskun which was within a range suitable to attain an appropriate anaerobic biomass response the change of hrts and olrs was motivated by the necessity to assess the performance of the sgbr as the wastewater quality characteristics of the psw varied depending on the slaughterhouse operations at a specific time furthermore the active anaerobic biomass used in the sgbr was procured from an operational uasb treating wastewater with characteristics similar to those observed for the psw which rendered an ability to withstand olr fluctuations at hrts of 24 to 96 h hrts maintained for 26 min to 30 max an operational strategy deemed sufficient for the biomass to acclimatize to the psw being treated 3 1 sgbr efficiency at varying hrts and olrs the cod tss fog and bod5 removal efficiencies in relation to the varying hrts and average olrs are represented in fig 2 fluctuations in the olr were due to the organic matter concentrations in the feed varying according to the operation in the poultry slaughterhouse at the time of sampling the feed cod concentrations ranged between 2195 and 12 490 mg l and averaged at 4344 2312 mg l with corresponding average olrs of 0 96 12 5 and 2 75 2 11 g cod lday respectively the effluent cod was consistently low throughout this study which was attributed to the high activity the granular bed and the downflow configuration which enabled pneumatic mixing within the sgbr furthermore the gravel underdrain system helps to retain the granules within the reactor which ensures that there is sufficient microbial activity for the degradation of the organic matter present in the feed wastewater the cod tss and bod5 removal efficiencies were consistently above 70 80 and 90 respectively throughout this study with the intermittent performance reduction on several days attributed to backwashing operations the fog removal efficiencies however were relatively low during the start up period due to the insoluble nature of fog and the inept biodegradable proficiency of the granular bed during the initialization of the sgbr operation the fog removal efficiency increased to above 80 on average after the start up period fig 2 removal efficiencies reached a maximum of 86 for cod 95 for tss 94 for fog and 99 for bod5 respectively at an olr of 4 10 g cod lday and hrt of 36 h similarly basitere rinquest 9 reported cod tss and fog removal efficiencies of 93 95 and 90 respectively when operating a sgbr for psw treatment at hrts of 55 and 40 h with average olrs of 1 01 and 3 14 g cod lday the lowest removal efficiencies were observed during the start up period during which the washout of granules occurred from the sgbr which created the need for granules re supplementation and subsequently an additional 24 h for acclimatization the cod tss and bod5 removal efficiencies increased as the olr increased whereas the fog removal efficiencies were not a function of the olr fig 2 a similar trend was reported by lim and fox 12 in the treatment of swine wastewater using a lab scale sgbr operated at 24 c the increase in the removal efficiencies at higher olrs was as a result of the sgbrs ability to effectively tolerate increasing olrs as the biomass matured as well as due the biological degradation and the physical filtration and retention of the organic matter and suspended solids fats and proteins within the sgbr 22 however the combination of a 48 h hrt and an average olr of 1 96 g cod l day significantly contributed to the quantity of accumulated suspended solids in the sgbr this ultimately led to clogging of the granular bed which impacted on the operability of the sgbr 3 2 sgbr performance in relation to discharge standards the characteristics of the sgbr feed and effluent are summarized in table 6 the variation in the feed characteristics can be attributed to the wastewater samples being collected from the poultry slaughterhouse at irregular intervals the effluent ph ranged between 6 29 to 8 59 which was within the acceptable range for discharge i e 5 9 7 the sgbr successfully reduced the cod of the psw to a maximum of 974 mg l which is less than the permitted discharge limit of 5000 mg l despite the cod averaging at 4344 mg l further reduction to a value below 1000 mg l eliminates the penalties imposed on industries including poultry slaughterhouses similarly the effluent tss and fog of 160 and 100 mg l were well below their respective limits of 1000 and 400 mg l respectively however further treatment of the sgbr effluent was required for the po4 3 nh4 n no3 n and tds which exceeded the maximum limits for permitted discharge as expected with anaerobic effluents 3 3 performance of the snd bioreactor fig 3 shows the tn removal efficiencies achieved by the snd bioreactor for 87 days under do limiting conditions and the down flow configuration stage 1 the snd bioreactor achieved average nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn removal efficiencies of 25 96 93 and 33 respectively the relatively low tn removal efficiencies observed during the first week was due to the system lacking a readily available biodegradable carbon source and the slow growth of ammonium oxidising bacteria aob 23 the bioreactor was therefore inoculated with untreated psw on day 17 which resulted in an increase in both the tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies the nh4 n remained significantly low indicating that nitrification was inhibited due to the aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob competing for do seifi fazaelipoor the high nh4 n and relatively low effluent no3 n and no2 n effluent concentrations 1 mg l suggested that the initial oxidation of nh4 n was the rate limiting step in the nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal increased significantly to satisfactory levels after the reconfiguration of the bioreactor from down flow to up flow operation and the addition of a sparging system stage 2 as a result of the up flow configuration the nitrification was followed by denitrification and the hrt was therefore increased to 11 days to minimise the washout of the nitrifying microorganisms via the effluent stream exiting the top of the bioreactor and to provide sufficient conversion time for the adjustment of the biofilm to the new operating configuration the snd bioreactor achieved nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn removal efficiencies of 90 87 78 and 79 respectively the high nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies indicated that nitrification was the dominant process occurring within the snd bioreactor and verified that the oxygen supply was an important factor for efficient nh4 n oxidation and a successful snd process furthermore the low nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent and high tn removal efficiency suggested that a significant nitrification denitrification process occurred during this stage however the snd bioreactor setup was not yet optimized with respect to the do transfer although complete nitrogen removal was not achieved the aim was to assess the possibility of a snd process occurring within a single stage bioreactor without the addition of external carbon sources and activated sludge a strategy required to mitigate operational costs at an industrial scale in a study performed by mpongwana ntwampe 24 it was proven that bacterial isolates i e enterobacter sp yersinia sp and serratia sp from psw obtained from the same source as the psw used in this study are capable of carrying out simultaneous nitrification and aerobic denitrification snd therefore the biological potential exists for snd without supplemental organic carbon sources the nitrogen removal due to snd was 97 8 and 97 9 during stage 1 and 2 respectively furthermore the bioreactor was not designed as an activated sludge process for simultaneous cod and po4 p removal hence there was no significant cod and po4 p removal observed 3 4 performance of the ufmm system the ufmm system was initiated on day 27 of the snd bioreactor operation during stage 1 of the combined snd ufmm system operation the ufmms achieved rejection efficiencies of 59 for cod 61 for tss 88 for turbidity with an average effluent tds concentration of 1198 mg l the permeate produced during stage 2 was characterized by an average tds of 785 mg l and rejection efficiencies of 78 for cod 50 for tss and 92 for turbidity the marginal reduction in the tss rejection efficiency from stage 1 to 2 was attributed to fouling of the uf membranes since the permeate flux observed during stage 2 4 77 l m2h was lower than stage 1 5 l m2h in spite of the constant feed flow rate applied during both stages although the complete removal of the residual cod and tss was not achieved the ufmms performed more efficiently during stage 2 due to the superior quality of the snd bioreactor effluent as a result of the upflow configuration and air supply implemented during stage 2 similarly basitere rinquest 9 reported an average rejection efficiency of 64 for cod and 88 for tss for uf membranes used as a post primary treatment for psw which was pre treated by a sgbr 3 5 performance of the psw treatment system table 7 shows the performance of the sgbr snd ufmm and overall psw systems for a period of 87 days the psw system was evaluated at hrts of 6 and 11 days olrs of 0 08 to 0 12 g cod lday and an average nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 04 g tn lday the psw system achieved higher cod and tss removal efficiencies in comparison to the individual sgbr and snd ufmm systems thus demonstrating the efficacy of coupling biological and physical treatment processes for psw treatment the final effluent produced was compliant with the industrial wastewater discharge standards with the exception of the po4 3 and nh4 n 4 conclusions the sgbr was able to consistently reduce the organic matter suspended solids and fats content of the pre filtered psw throughout its 138 days of operation with removal efficiencies exceeding 80 on average however periodic backwashing was required to mitigate clogging and further treatment of the sgbr effluent was required with regard to the nutrient and tds levels the snd bioreactor performed satisfactorily with regard to the tn removal in the sgbr effluent even without the addition of carbon sources and the use of activated sludge the snd bioreactor achieved optimum results when operated in up flow mode with a continuous air supply achieving a tn removal of 79 the ufmms were able to further reduce the residual cod and tss by 65 and 54 respectively the final effluent produced by the psw treatment system was compliant with the industrial wastewater discharge standards with the exclusion of the po4 3 and nh4 n thus indicating refinement of the designed system is required in order to optimize the treatment of the psw acknowledgments the authors of this study would like to acknowledge funding received from the national research foundation nrf thuthuka funding r402 and the freestanding innovation and scarce skills development scholarship grant no 108109 
14404,hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an advanced oxidation process aop which is used in this study for the treatment of wastewater from a petroleum refinery bacterial load as well as chemical oxygen demand cod has been successfully reduced to approved discharge standards for water reuse purpose a cavitating reactor with three different geometric configurations was used for the treatment these reactor configurations include the orifice cn0 and venturi with different throat diameters cn1 and cn5 individual reactor configurations are optimized for processing parameters such as operating pressure and number of passes of the wastewater through the cavitating zone the maximum bacterial disinfection and cod reduction were obtained using cn5 reactor operated at 5 bar pump discharge pressure and the extent of reduction was found to be 59 17 and 52 respectively the energy and cost estimation has also been carried out for this treatment process and approximate values are 1 11 kw h m3of energy usage and 5 54 rs m3 0 078 m3 respectively after 10 pass treatment the disinfection percentage can be further improved by increasing the number of passes and integrating it with other advanced oxidation processes keywords hydrodynamic cavitation advanced oxidation process petroleum wastewater bacterial disinfection chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction although numerous efforts have been made to substitute the fossil fuels crude oil remains an essential first choice the current global demand of crude oil is 99 3 million barrels per day mbpd which clearly indicates its dominance and it is expected to rise upto 107 mbpd by 2030 however it generates an enormous amount of wastewater of about 0 4 1 6 times higher than the quantum of crude oil processed 1 the primary wastewater generating sources in petroleum industries are crude oil refining production of fuels and the waste generated from the intermediates of the lubricants and petrochemicals 2 the major components composed of this wastewater are polycyclic aromatics contents 3 oil and grease 4 nitrogen and sulphur compounds 5 and bacteria 6 the rough estimates of the threatening pollutants present in petroleum refinery effluent pre are illustrated in table 1 these pollutants are serious toxic hazards to the surrounding atmosphere as well as aquatic life 3 7 the rise in demand of fuel is clearly indicating the generation of higher amount of wastewater and likely to be polluting fresh water bodies which will adversely impact the existing water quality therefore the environmental protection agency epa of usa and the central pollution control board cpcb of government of india has set minimum discharge standards for the pre as shown in table 2 typical refinery wastewater treatment plant wwtp uses a defined sequence of processes i e physical 8 9 physio chemical 10 11 chemical 12 and biological treatment 13 15 new technologies have also been reported which include membranes 14 16 and microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation 17 these methods have several limitations including the low elimination of organic compounds low reaction rates generation of solid sludge and they works in limited ph range 18 19 chemical oxidation method also realizes very low reaction rates 20 and requires a large number of oxidants to treat a large volume of pre hence restricts its application the available treatment plant is not able to meet the guidelines for discharge of pre mainly for cod and bacterial count cfu currently activated sludge process asp is being used in the industry to treat the effluent hence the microbial concentration in the treated effluent is high and it becomes a trouble eventually these bacteria form scale or biofouling on the inner side of the pipeline surfaces the aromatic compounds such as phenols cannot be completely treated using common bacteria and traces of these compounds are present in the treated effluent therefore both cfu and cod reductions are necessary for the refinery effluent therefore it was decided to treat this further using viable technique and reuse of it in the same plant advanced oxidation processes aops which are chemically based on a hydroxyl radical oh and have great potential to degrade or mineralize a wide range of organic molecules 21 25 the oxidation potential of oh is higher 2 8 v as compared to other oxidants like ozone 2 07 v h2o2 1 78 v hocl 1 49 v and chlorine 1 36 v 26 among the numerous aop s hydrodynamic cavitation hc has attracted the attention of many researchers considering its unique features such as chemical free operation great potential to degrade a wide range of organic molecules easy to implement on a large scale requires minimum space simple in operation cost effective and less energy intensive 27 hydrodynamic cavitation can be generated by using a constriction in the flow such as an orifice plate venturi or throttling a valve 28 36 according to bernoulli s principle when liquid flows across a constriction the kinetic energy of the liquid increases at the expense of the pressure energy 28 29 if the decrease in pressure is sufficient to cause the pressure around the point of vena contracta to fall below the threshold pressure for cavitation usually vapour pressure of the liquid medium being pumped at the operating temperature vapour cavities are generated 30 31 these cavities expand in the downstream section and eventually collapse as the pressure recovers during the passage of the liquid through the constriction boundary layer separation and turbulence occurs and a substantial amount of energy is lost in the form of a permanent pressure drop due to local fluid turbulence very high intensity fluid turbulence is also generated in the downstream of the constriction its intensity depends on the magnitude of the pressure drop and the rate of pressure recovery which in turn depends on the geometry of the constriction and the downstream flow conditions of the liquid i e the scale of turbulence the intensity of turbulence has a profound effect on cavitation intensity thus by controlling the geometric and operating conditions of the reactor the required intensity of the cavitation for the desired physical or chemical change can be generated with maximum energy efficiency 29 32 33 the collapse pressure generated by the cavity can be of the order of several hundreds of bars which is sufficiently high to rupture the biological constituents of water including the microbial cells causing its death and viability the asymmetric collapse of cavities also results in high speed liquid jet causing cell disruption 34 35 local fluid shear rates around such jets are adequate to destroy several types of microorganisms 32 36 the major causative effects of cavitation can be classified as physical and chemical the physical effects include the generation of shock waves the water hammer effect and radial bubble motion the chemical effects of cavitation during the cell disruption are due to the generation of free radicals 37 their extent depends on the intensity of cavitation and cavity contents which can be varied by the manipulation of the operating parameters such as the cavitation number geometry of the cavitation element the initial concentration of the cell suspension number of passes through the cavitation zone temperature and viscosity 38 39 along with the dissolved gas content of the liquid a cell is likely to get disrupted due to high velocity jet or shock wave produced by a collapsing cavity and the pollutant can get mineralized by the hydroxyl oh radical produced which oxidizes the former 29 33 40 depending on the end use of water the extent of disruption of cells should be controlled by controlling the intensity of cavitation which in turn can be controlled by tuning the operating parameters when one is interested in obtaining periplasmic enzymes low intensity cavitation which is just sufficient to break the outer cell wall should be used 35 41 high intensity cavitation is required when one needs to ensure that viable microbial count is substantially reduced like in water disinfection applications or to recover the cytoplasmic enzymes wastewater from petroleum industries contains mainly phenol sulphides hydrocarbons oil and grease dissolved solids and some organics which are broadly expressed in terms of cod and bod 42 46 the idea is to treat the secondary effluent i e wastewater coming from biological treatment of wastewater using hydrodynamic cavitation up to an approved discharge standard so that the treated water can be reused for the cooling tower as a makeup water in this work the issue of microbial load and cod reduction is targeted using simple economical and maintenance free process called hydrodynamic cavitation this study explores the possibility of the use of hydrodynamic cavitation as a post process to treat the secondary effluent wastewater coming from biological treatment unit to meet the discharge limits of pre without the addition of chemicals and then treated water can be reused for the cooling tower as a makeup water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials wastewater used for the study was the effluent from the petroleum refinery near mumbai india coming out of the secondary treatment the effluents generated from all the units in the refinery are mixed and sent to the wwtp hence the effluent coming to the biological treatment stage has a composition that is average of all the individual effluent streams the effluent stream goes through process of oil water separation equalisation flocculation and air floatation followed by biological treatment the samples used for present study were collected from an activated carbon filter acf connected at the outlet of the biological treatment plant visually the initial collected water sample appeared clear to a certain degree with a light odour plate count agar standard methods agar was procured from hi media ref product code m091 sodium chloride and ethanol were procured from sfcl extra pure sfcl product code 40 123 autoclave osworld autoclave steam sterilizer jric 39 and laminar cabinet imset operating frequency 50 hz were used 2 2 analytical methods analysis of cod was carried out using the standard method the enumeration of the microorganisms present in each sample was done using heterotrophic plate count hpc method 47 2 3 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the hydrodynamic cavitating reactor was procured from hyca technologies pvt ltd mumbai india it includes a holding tank of 20 l volume a positive displacement pump control valves v0 v1 v2 and v3 three main lines accommodating different cavitating reactor configurations and a bypass line a 2 hp reciprocating pump with a variable frequency drive vfd was used in the setup with a max pressure of 15 bar and maximum flow rate of about 1500 lph the initial volume used for the treatment during various trials and respective flowrates are mentioned in table 3 the suction side of the pump is connected to the bottom of the tank and discharge from the pump branches into the main lines and a bypass line the three main lines house the three reactor configurations namely cn0 cn1 and cn5 reactor material of construction for all the cavitating devices was stainless steel 304 cn0 reactor consisted of an orifice plate with throat to pipe diameter ratio between 0 05 0 2 whereas cn1 and cn5 reactors were cavitating venturies with throat to pipe diameter between 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 3 respectively cn1 was designed to produce intense cavitation as compared to the cn5 reactor designs of these devices are proprietary and cannot be disclosed here the flow was allowed to pass through one of the devices at a time using the valves v1 v2 and v3 additional valve is also provided to pass the flow through the bypass line the inlet pressure can either be controlled by using bypass flow controlling valve or by controlling the frequency of the pump however if the system is controlled using bypass valve then water gets partially treated using cavitating reactor and part of the water passes through bypass line and remains untreated as it is bypassed this reduces the effectiveness of the system hence the flow was always controlled using the frequency of the pump to ensure the homogeneous treatment throughout the reactor volume a variable frequency drive vfd was used to adjust the number of piston strokes per unit time of the pump which controls the total flow generated and hence the inlet pressure to the cavitating device it was ensured that both the mainline and bypass line terminate well inside the tank below the liquid level to avoid any induction of air into the liquid due to the plunging liquid jet pressure gauge p1 and p2 are used to monitor the inlet and outlet pressure of the cavitating device 2 4 experimental procedure the samples were collected from the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant in the refinery which is based on biological processes the experiments were conducted in the premises of the petroleum industry near the wwtp using the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor setup described in section 2 3 samples were taken directly from the wwtp without any intermediate storage time these samples were then treated using hydrodynamic cavitation at different conditions inlet pressure and cavitation number using fixed solution volume and for a constant number of circulations passes through the cavitating device the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature approx 30 c without any temperature control the initial solution volume was adjusted so that to get 1 circulation per minute at all the operating pressures three different reactor configurations were used in this study namely cn0 cn1 and cn5 the samples were collected after 0 10 30 and 50 passes and were analysed for cod and total bacterial count cfu ml in the laboratory at institute of chemical technology mumbai energy efficiency of hydrodynamic cavitation process is low when it is operated beyond 50 passes and it is no longer economically viable hence experiments were carried out only till 50 passes 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment using hydrodynamic cavitation reactor based on orifice cn0 reactor the number of cavitating events is controlled using operating pressure hence pressure is the dominating parameter in the phenomena of cavitation the sample water was treated using cn0 reactor at operating pressures of 3 5 and 7 bar respectively the water was continuously circulated for upto 50 passes through the cavitating reactor samples for the analysis were collected after an interval of 10 30 and 50 passes respectively the water samples used in the study were containing initial bacterial count 6 18 105 3 0 105 and 2 92 105 cfu ml and the cod 236 67 141 67 and 150 mgo2 l for 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure batches respectively the maximum bacterial reduction after 50 passes was obtained as 32 04 38 66 and 24 32 at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressures respectively it was observed that bacterial disinfection was initially enhanced with increasing operating pressure from 3 bar to 5 bar and then reduces when the operating pressure is increased to 7 bar fig 2 the main reason behind this observation is the number of cavitating events increases with the increase in operating pressure initially hence it influences the maximum zone in the water body resulting into higher disinfection of bacteria in addition to this the choked cavitation may be taking place at pressures higher than 5 bar due to a higher rate of generation of vapour cavities these cavities then agglomerate and the overall collapsing intensity of the formed cavity cluster reduces significantly 33 the results for cod reduction at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure are shown in fig 3 maximum cod reduction obtained after 50 passes were37 39 29 41 and 1 11 for operating pressure of 3 5 and 7 bar respectively it can be observed that cod reduction was highest at 3 bar and decreased on increasing the operating pressure to 5 bar and 7 bar in fact at 7 bar negligible cod reduction was observed confirming that the flow might be entering in the super cavitation chocked cavitation regime at this pressure at 5 bar operating pressure there is less cod reduction as compared to 3 bar but the colony forming unit cfu removal has increased this can indicate that at this operating condition more cavities might be undergoing asymmetric collapse asymmetric collapse results in energy dissipation in the form of high shear stress which is effective in microbial cell disruption 48 but the extent of cod reduction may be less in this case however when the cavity collapses symmetrically the energy dissipation is in the form of an increase in local temperature and pressure this leads to splitting of water molecules inside the cavity and the formation of a high amount of oh radicals along with other radicals such as h ho2 and o 36 49 these radicals can then react with the pollutant molecules and oxidize them this kind of collapse is favoured to get a reduction in the cod of the wastewater 3 2 performance of cn1 reactor the cn1 reactor was a cavitating venturi experiments using cn1 reactor were also carried out at operating pressures of 3 5 and 7 bar an additional experiment was also carried out using air injection an inlet port was available at the throat of the venturi the air was allowed to get sucked in the water flow due to low pressure zone formed at the throat region hence no external mechanism was required for the addition of air in the venturi air is injected at the throat in such a manner that it helps in increasing physical as well as chemical effects associated with cavitation the cavities produced can consist of air water vapours or a mixture of air and water vapours the air bubbles generated in the flow are capable of generating high shear forces and can act as nuclei for cavity generation this results in the formation of shock waves that can carry out physical transformations additionally the oxygen present in the air helps in the formation of extra oh radicals and also creates a possibility of direct oxidation in the high temperature regions near cavity collapse thus resulting in the higher extent of oxidation of pollutant molecules 28 29 32 33 50 the initial cfu ml is found in various effluent samples as 7 48 106 1 24 106 1 29 106 and 7 84 104 and the cod128 72 104 and 96 mgo2 l for 3 5 7 and 5 bar with air injection respectively figs 4 and 5 shows cod and cfu reduction at different operating conditions 3 5 and 7 bar and with air injection it can be seen that after 50 passes without any air injection reduction in the bacterial count is highest at lower pressure 47 reduction at 3 bar pressure whereas at higher pressure the cod reduction is higher 54 reduction at 7 bar with the air injection bacterial disinfection is 70 and cod reduction was 28 after 30 passes the microbial disinfection and cod reduction at 5 bar after 30 passes without air injection was 13 and 8 33 respectively the injection of gas gives several advantages in terms of physical and chemical effects associated with cavitation 51 53 since air is easily and freely available around us so the trial experiment is carried out with it this is an alternative way to increase the number of cavitation bubbles by injecting gases at the throttling section where suction is generated additionally this suction helps to suck the gases and helps to save the energy required to inject the gas the suction of the gas is controlled using the flow controlled valve the injected gas acts as nuclei for the generation of cavitation bubbles in addition to this the mixture of bubble contents changes according to the injected gases and these forms gaseous vapour and gas vapour mixed cavities these cavities go under several reactions during cavitation and form numerous radicals oh h ho2 o and n the population of oh also increases due to excess availability of oxygen through the trapped air into bubbles resulting in the higher degradation of organic pollutants as well as an increase in the bacterial disinfection rate the several mechanisms of radical formations due to various induced gases have been reported in the literature 36 49 3 3 performance of cn5 reactor the cn5 reactor was also a cavitating venturi with the largercross sectional area as compared to cn1 the experiments were conducted at the same operating conditions as the other two reactors i e at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure for 50 passes through the reactor the initial cfu ml in waste effluent are found 7 5 105 1 09 107 3 17 105 and 6 15 104 and initial cod values 72 64 186 67 and 136 mgo2 l for 3 5 7 and 5 bar with air injection respectively figs 6 and 7 show the results of cfu ml and cod for the experiments it can be observed that this reactor gives optimum results in terms of microbial disinfection as well as cod reduction at operating pressure of 5 bar the maximum microbial disinfection obtained at this pressure was 71 43 and cod reduction is 33 33 after 50 passes the cavitating reactor cn5 operating at a pressure of 5 bar was successful in treating petroleum effluent with higher efficacy hence to ensure its efficacy the trial was repeated at same conditions it was also showing good agreement with the previous results figs 6 and 7 operated under the same conditions bacterial disinfection 70 and cod reduction 30 as cn5 reactor operated at 5 bar pressure was seen to be more effective hence additional experimental runs were carried out with air injection in this study the air was injected at throat using natural suction generated due to the low pressure region formed downstream of the throat this reduces the external energy requirement for air injection since this is a closed loop system the air eventually gets solubilised and the excess undissolved air is released to atmosphere in the holding tank the reduction in cod as well as cfu is found to be higher with air injection operated at 5 bar pressure as compared to without air injection at the same operating conditions fig 7 the addition of air increases the number of gaseous and gas vapour cavities at downstream of cavitating reactor hence cavitation events per unit volume increases resulted in higher efficacy 51 53 still further trials are needed to confirm and optimize the air flowrate to get maximum disinfection as well as cod reduction the feasibility of the process on a commercial scale depends on the cost required for the treatment as operating pressure increases the power utilization and associated cost also increases to run the pump if the number of passes increases then the processing time will also increase hence the optimization of the processing parameters like operating pressure and number of passes is important the ideal processing conditions in terms of feasibility are 5 bar operating pressure and 30 passes for wastewater treatment and the cost of treatment is 16 61 rs m3 0 23 m3 at same processing conditions the expected cost of the treatment for different operating pressures and for different passes is reported in table 4 the estimation of energy as well as costing is briefly elaborated in the appendix i 4 conclusion the amount of energy required to kill the bacteria is lesser compared to the energy required for cod removal hence at lower operating pressure the bacterial disinfection is observed to be higher whereas cod reduction was less the optimum reactor geometry and optimum inlet pressure were chosen based on the maximum removal of cod and the maximum bacterial disinfection of water based on these criteria cn5 reactor operating at 5 bar inlet pressure was found to be the optimum the bacterial disinfection obtained was 70 in this case while cod reduction was about 30 and the estimated cost of the treatment was about 16 61 rs m3 0 23 m3 it can be seen that maximum reduction in the bacterial count takes place in first 10 passes and the cfu destruction rate decreases with subsequent passes hence for most energy efficient process the cavitation reactor can be operated with 10 passes the expected cost of the treatment for 5 bar operating pressures and for 10 passes is 5 54 rs m3 0 078 m3 giving 40 cfu reduction and 22 cod reduction it is observed that the reduction in cod as well as cfu is higher with air injection operated at 5 bar pressure in cn5 reactor still further optimization is needed to confirm and optimize the air flow rate operating pressure and number of cycles to get maximum disinfection as well as cod reduction acknowledgement

14404,hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an advanced oxidation process aop which is used in this study for the treatment of wastewater from a petroleum refinery bacterial load as well as chemical oxygen demand cod has been successfully reduced to approved discharge standards for water reuse purpose a cavitating reactor with three different geometric configurations was used for the treatment these reactor configurations include the orifice cn0 and venturi with different throat diameters cn1 and cn5 individual reactor configurations are optimized for processing parameters such as operating pressure and number of passes of the wastewater through the cavitating zone the maximum bacterial disinfection and cod reduction were obtained using cn5 reactor operated at 5 bar pump discharge pressure and the extent of reduction was found to be 59 17 and 52 respectively the energy and cost estimation has also been carried out for this treatment process and approximate values are 1 11 kw h m3of energy usage and 5 54 rs m3 0 078 m3 respectively after 10 pass treatment the disinfection percentage can be further improved by increasing the number of passes and integrating it with other advanced oxidation processes keywords hydrodynamic cavitation advanced oxidation process petroleum wastewater bacterial disinfection chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction although numerous efforts have been made to substitute the fossil fuels crude oil remains an essential first choice the current global demand of crude oil is 99 3 million barrels per day mbpd which clearly indicates its dominance and it is expected to rise upto 107 mbpd by 2030 however it generates an enormous amount of wastewater of about 0 4 1 6 times higher than the quantum of crude oil processed 1 the primary wastewater generating sources in petroleum industries are crude oil refining production of fuels and the waste generated from the intermediates of the lubricants and petrochemicals 2 the major components composed of this wastewater are polycyclic aromatics contents 3 oil and grease 4 nitrogen and sulphur compounds 5 and bacteria 6 the rough estimates of the threatening pollutants present in petroleum refinery effluent pre are illustrated in table 1 these pollutants are serious toxic hazards to the surrounding atmosphere as well as aquatic life 3 7 the rise in demand of fuel is clearly indicating the generation of higher amount of wastewater and likely to be polluting fresh water bodies which will adversely impact the existing water quality therefore the environmental protection agency epa of usa and the central pollution control board cpcb of government of india has set minimum discharge standards for the pre as shown in table 2 typical refinery wastewater treatment plant wwtp uses a defined sequence of processes i e physical 8 9 physio chemical 10 11 chemical 12 and biological treatment 13 15 new technologies have also been reported which include membranes 14 16 and microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation 17 these methods have several limitations including the low elimination of organic compounds low reaction rates generation of solid sludge and they works in limited ph range 18 19 chemical oxidation method also realizes very low reaction rates 20 and requires a large number of oxidants to treat a large volume of pre hence restricts its application the available treatment plant is not able to meet the guidelines for discharge of pre mainly for cod and bacterial count cfu currently activated sludge process asp is being used in the industry to treat the effluent hence the microbial concentration in the treated effluent is high and it becomes a trouble eventually these bacteria form scale or biofouling on the inner side of the pipeline surfaces the aromatic compounds such as phenols cannot be completely treated using common bacteria and traces of these compounds are present in the treated effluent therefore both cfu and cod reductions are necessary for the refinery effluent therefore it was decided to treat this further using viable technique and reuse of it in the same plant advanced oxidation processes aops which are chemically based on a hydroxyl radical oh and have great potential to degrade or mineralize a wide range of organic molecules 21 25 the oxidation potential of oh is higher 2 8 v as compared to other oxidants like ozone 2 07 v h2o2 1 78 v hocl 1 49 v and chlorine 1 36 v 26 among the numerous aop s hydrodynamic cavitation hc has attracted the attention of many researchers considering its unique features such as chemical free operation great potential to degrade a wide range of organic molecules easy to implement on a large scale requires minimum space simple in operation cost effective and less energy intensive 27 hydrodynamic cavitation can be generated by using a constriction in the flow such as an orifice plate venturi or throttling a valve 28 36 according to bernoulli s principle when liquid flows across a constriction the kinetic energy of the liquid increases at the expense of the pressure energy 28 29 if the decrease in pressure is sufficient to cause the pressure around the point of vena contracta to fall below the threshold pressure for cavitation usually vapour pressure of the liquid medium being pumped at the operating temperature vapour cavities are generated 30 31 these cavities expand in the downstream section and eventually collapse as the pressure recovers during the passage of the liquid through the constriction boundary layer separation and turbulence occurs and a substantial amount of energy is lost in the form of a permanent pressure drop due to local fluid turbulence very high intensity fluid turbulence is also generated in the downstream of the constriction its intensity depends on the magnitude of the pressure drop and the rate of pressure recovery which in turn depends on the geometry of the constriction and the downstream flow conditions of the liquid i e the scale of turbulence the intensity of turbulence has a profound effect on cavitation intensity thus by controlling the geometric and operating conditions of the reactor the required intensity of the cavitation for the desired physical or chemical change can be generated with maximum energy efficiency 29 32 33 the collapse pressure generated by the cavity can be of the order of several hundreds of bars which is sufficiently high to rupture the biological constituents of water including the microbial cells causing its death and viability the asymmetric collapse of cavities also results in high speed liquid jet causing cell disruption 34 35 local fluid shear rates around such jets are adequate to destroy several types of microorganisms 32 36 the major causative effects of cavitation can be classified as physical and chemical the physical effects include the generation of shock waves the water hammer effect and radial bubble motion the chemical effects of cavitation during the cell disruption are due to the generation of free radicals 37 their extent depends on the intensity of cavitation and cavity contents which can be varied by the manipulation of the operating parameters such as the cavitation number geometry of the cavitation element the initial concentration of the cell suspension number of passes through the cavitation zone temperature and viscosity 38 39 along with the dissolved gas content of the liquid a cell is likely to get disrupted due to high velocity jet or shock wave produced by a collapsing cavity and the pollutant can get mineralized by the hydroxyl oh radical produced which oxidizes the former 29 33 40 depending on the end use of water the extent of disruption of cells should be controlled by controlling the intensity of cavitation which in turn can be controlled by tuning the operating parameters when one is interested in obtaining periplasmic enzymes low intensity cavitation which is just sufficient to break the outer cell wall should be used 35 41 high intensity cavitation is required when one needs to ensure that viable microbial count is substantially reduced like in water disinfection applications or to recover the cytoplasmic enzymes wastewater from petroleum industries contains mainly phenol sulphides hydrocarbons oil and grease dissolved solids and some organics which are broadly expressed in terms of cod and bod 42 46 the idea is to treat the secondary effluent i e wastewater coming from biological treatment of wastewater using hydrodynamic cavitation up to an approved discharge standard so that the treated water can be reused for the cooling tower as a makeup water in this work the issue of microbial load and cod reduction is targeted using simple economical and maintenance free process called hydrodynamic cavitation this study explores the possibility of the use of hydrodynamic cavitation as a post process to treat the secondary effluent wastewater coming from biological treatment unit to meet the discharge limits of pre without the addition of chemicals and then treated water can be reused for the cooling tower as a makeup water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials wastewater used for the study was the effluent from the petroleum refinery near mumbai india coming out of the secondary treatment the effluents generated from all the units in the refinery are mixed and sent to the wwtp hence the effluent coming to the biological treatment stage has a composition that is average of all the individual effluent streams the effluent stream goes through process of oil water separation equalisation flocculation and air floatation followed by biological treatment the samples used for present study were collected from an activated carbon filter acf connected at the outlet of the biological treatment plant visually the initial collected water sample appeared clear to a certain degree with a light odour plate count agar standard methods agar was procured from hi media ref product code m091 sodium chloride and ethanol were procured from sfcl extra pure sfcl product code 40 123 autoclave osworld autoclave steam sterilizer jric 39 and laminar cabinet imset operating frequency 50 hz were used 2 2 analytical methods analysis of cod was carried out using the standard method the enumeration of the microorganisms present in each sample was done using heterotrophic plate count hpc method 47 2 3 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the hydrodynamic cavitating reactor was procured from hyca technologies pvt ltd mumbai india it includes a holding tank of 20 l volume a positive displacement pump control valves v0 v1 v2 and v3 three main lines accommodating different cavitating reactor configurations and a bypass line a 2 hp reciprocating pump with a variable frequency drive vfd was used in the setup with a max pressure of 15 bar and maximum flow rate of about 1500 lph the initial volume used for the treatment during various trials and respective flowrates are mentioned in table 3 the suction side of the pump is connected to the bottom of the tank and discharge from the pump branches into the main lines and a bypass line the three main lines house the three reactor configurations namely cn0 cn1 and cn5 reactor material of construction for all the cavitating devices was stainless steel 304 cn0 reactor consisted of an orifice plate with throat to pipe diameter ratio between 0 05 0 2 whereas cn1 and cn5 reactors were cavitating venturies with throat to pipe diameter between 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 3 respectively cn1 was designed to produce intense cavitation as compared to the cn5 reactor designs of these devices are proprietary and cannot be disclosed here the flow was allowed to pass through one of the devices at a time using the valves v1 v2 and v3 additional valve is also provided to pass the flow through the bypass line the inlet pressure can either be controlled by using bypass flow controlling valve or by controlling the frequency of the pump however if the system is controlled using bypass valve then water gets partially treated using cavitating reactor and part of the water passes through bypass line and remains untreated as it is bypassed this reduces the effectiveness of the system hence the flow was always controlled using the frequency of the pump to ensure the homogeneous treatment throughout the reactor volume a variable frequency drive vfd was used to adjust the number of piston strokes per unit time of the pump which controls the total flow generated and hence the inlet pressure to the cavitating device it was ensured that both the mainline and bypass line terminate well inside the tank below the liquid level to avoid any induction of air into the liquid due to the plunging liquid jet pressure gauge p1 and p2 are used to monitor the inlet and outlet pressure of the cavitating device 2 4 experimental procedure the samples were collected from the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant in the refinery which is based on biological processes the experiments were conducted in the premises of the petroleum industry near the wwtp using the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor setup described in section 2 3 samples were taken directly from the wwtp without any intermediate storage time these samples were then treated using hydrodynamic cavitation at different conditions inlet pressure and cavitation number using fixed solution volume and for a constant number of circulations passes through the cavitating device the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature approx 30 c without any temperature control the initial solution volume was adjusted so that to get 1 circulation per minute at all the operating pressures three different reactor configurations were used in this study namely cn0 cn1 and cn5 the samples were collected after 0 10 30 and 50 passes and were analysed for cod and total bacterial count cfu ml in the laboratory at institute of chemical technology mumbai energy efficiency of hydrodynamic cavitation process is low when it is operated beyond 50 passes and it is no longer economically viable hence experiments were carried out only till 50 passes 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment using hydrodynamic cavitation reactor based on orifice cn0 reactor the number of cavitating events is controlled using operating pressure hence pressure is the dominating parameter in the phenomena of cavitation the sample water was treated using cn0 reactor at operating pressures of 3 5 and 7 bar respectively the water was continuously circulated for upto 50 passes through the cavitating reactor samples for the analysis were collected after an interval of 10 30 and 50 passes respectively the water samples used in the study were containing initial bacterial count 6 18 105 3 0 105 and 2 92 105 cfu ml and the cod 236 67 141 67 and 150 mgo2 l for 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure batches respectively the maximum bacterial reduction after 50 passes was obtained as 32 04 38 66 and 24 32 at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressures respectively it was observed that bacterial disinfection was initially enhanced with increasing operating pressure from 3 bar to 5 bar and then reduces when the operating pressure is increased to 7 bar fig 2 the main reason behind this observation is the number of cavitating events increases with the increase in operating pressure initially hence it influences the maximum zone in the water body resulting into higher disinfection of bacteria in addition to this the choked cavitation may be taking place at pressures higher than 5 bar due to a higher rate of generation of vapour cavities these cavities then agglomerate and the overall collapsing intensity of the formed cavity cluster reduces significantly 33 the results for cod reduction at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure are shown in fig 3 maximum cod reduction obtained after 50 passes were37 39 29 41 and 1 11 for operating pressure of 3 5 and 7 bar respectively it can be observed that cod reduction was highest at 3 bar and decreased on increasing the operating pressure to 5 bar and 7 bar in fact at 7 bar negligible cod reduction was observed confirming that the flow might be entering in the super cavitation chocked cavitation regime at this pressure at 5 bar operating pressure there is less cod reduction as compared to 3 bar but the colony forming unit cfu removal has increased this can indicate that at this operating condition more cavities might be undergoing asymmetric collapse asymmetric collapse results in energy dissipation in the form of high shear stress which is effective in microbial cell disruption 48 but the extent of cod reduction may be less in this case however when the cavity collapses symmetrically the energy dissipation is in the form of an increase in local temperature and pressure this leads to splitting of water molecules inside the cavity and the formation of a high amount of oh radicals along with other radicals such as h ho2 and o 36 49 these radicals can then react with the pollutant molecules and oxidize them this kind of collapse is favoured to get a reduction in the cod of the wastewater 3 2 performance of cn1 reactor the cn1 reactor was a cavitating venturi experiments using cn1 reactor were also carried out at operating pressures of 3 5 and 7 bar an additional experiment was also carried out using air injection an inlet port was available at the throat of the venturi the air was allowed to get sucked in the water flow due to low pressure zone formed at the throat region hence no external mechanism was required for the addition of air in the venturi air is injected at the throat in such a manner that it helps in increasing physical as well as chemical effects associated with cavitation the cavities produced can consist of air water vapours or a mixture of air and water vapours the air bubbles generated in the flow are capable of generating high shear forces and can act as nuclei for cavity generation this results in the formation of shock waves that can carry out physical transformations additionally the oxygen present in the air helps in the formation of extra oh radicals and also creates a possibility of direct oxidation in the high temperature regions near cavity collapse thus resulting in the higher extent of oxidation of pollutant molecules 28 29 32 33 50 the initial cfu ml is found in various effluent samples as 7 48 106 1 24 106 1 29 106 and 7 84 104 and the cod128 72 104 and 96 mgo2 l for 3 5 7 and 5 bar with air injection respectively figs 4 and 5 shows cod and cfu reduction at different operating conditions 3 5 and 7 bar and with air injection it can be seen that after 50 passes without any air injection reduction in the bacterial count is highest at lower pressure 47 reduction at 3 bar pressure whereas at higher pressure the cod reduction is higher 54 reduction at 7 bar with the air injection bacterial disinfection is 70 and cod reduction was 28 after 30 passes the microbial disinfection and cod reduction at 5 bar after 30 passes without air injection was 13 and 8 33 respectively the injection of gas gives several advantages in terms of physical and chemical effects associated with cavitation 51 53 since air is easily and freely available around us so the trial experiment is carried out with it this is an alternative way to increase the number of cavitation bubbles by injecting gases at the throttling section where suction is generated additionally this suction helps to suck the gases and helps to save the energy required to inject the gas the suction of the gas is controlled using the flow controlled valve the injected gas acts as nuclei for the generation of cavitation bubbles in addition to this the mixture of bubble contents changes according to the injected gases and these forms gaseous vapour and gas vapour mixed cavities these cavities go under several reactions during cavitation and form numerous radicals oh h ho2 o and n the population of oh also increases due to excess availability of oxygen through the trapped air into bubbles resulting in the higher degradation of organic pollutants as well as an increase in the bacterial disinfection rate the several mechanisms of radical formations due to various induced gases have been reported in the literature 36 49 3 3 performance of cn5 reactor the cn5 reactor was also a cavitating venturi with the largercross sectional area as compared to cn1 the experiments were conducted at the same operating conditions as the other two reactors i e at 3 5 and 7 bar operating pressure for 50 passes through the reactor the initial cfu ml in waste effluent are found 7 5 105 1 09 107 3 17 105 and 6 15 104 and initial cod values 72 64 186 67 and 136 mgo2 l for 3 5 7 and 5 bar with air injection respectively figs 6 and 7 show the results of cfu ml and cod for the experiments it can be observed that this reactor gives optimum results in terms of microbial disinfection as well as cod reduction at operating pressure of 5 bar the maximum microbial disinfection obtained at this pressure was 71 43 and cod reduction is 33 33 after 50 passes the cavitating reactor cn5 operating at a pressure of 5 bar was successful in treating petroleum effluent with higher efficacy hence to ensure its efficacy the trial was repeated at same conditions it was also showing good agreement with the previous results figs 6 and 7 operated under the same conditions bacterial disinfection 70 and cod reduction 30 as cn5 reactor operated at 5 bar pressure was seen to be more effective hence additional experimental runs were carried out with air injection in this study the air was injected at throat using natural suction generated due to the low pressure region formed downstream of the throat this reduces the external energy requirement for air injection since this is a closed loop system the air eventually gets solubilised and the excess undissolved air is released to atmosphere in the holding tank the reduction in cod as well as cfu is found to be higher with air injection operated at 5 bar pressure as compared to without air injection at the same operating conditions fig 7 the addition of air increases the number of gaseous and gas vapour cavities at downstream of cavitating reactor hence cavitation events per unit volume increases resulted in higher efficacy 51 53 still further trials are needed to confirm and optimize the air flowrate to get maximum disinfection as well as cod reduction the feasibility of the process on a commercial scale depends on the cost required for the treatment as operating pressure increases the power utilization and associated cost also increases to run the pump if the number of passes increases then the processing time will also increase hence the optimization of the processing parameters like operating pressure and number of passes is important the ideal processing conditions in terms of feasibility are 5 bar operating pressure and 30 passes for wastewater treatment and the cost of treatment is 16 61 rs m3 0 23 m3 at same processing conditions the expected cost of the treatment for different operating pressures and for different passes is reported in table 4 the estimation of energy as well as costing is briefly elaborated in the appendix i 4 conclusion the amount of energy required to kill the bacteria is lesser compared to the energy required for cod removal hence at lower operating pressure the bacterial disinfection is observed to be higher whereas cod reduction was less the optimum reactor geometry and optimum inlet pressure were chosen based on the maximum removal of cod and the maximum bacterial disinfection of water based on these criteria cn5 reactor operating at 5 bar inlet pressure was found to be the optimum the bacterial disinfection obtained was 70 in this case while cod reduction was about 30 and the estimated cost of the treatment was about 16 61 rs m3 0 23 m3 it can be seen that maximum reduction in the bacterial count takes place in first 10 passes and the cfu destruction rate decreases with subsequent passes hence for most energy efficient process the cavitation reactor can be operated with 10 passes the expected cost of the treatment for 5 bar operating pressures and for 10 passes is 5 54 rs m3 0 078 m3 giving 40 cfu reduction and 22 cod reduction it is observed that the reduction in cod as well as cfu is higher with air injection operated at 5 bar pressure in cn5 reactor still further optimization is needed to confirm and optimize the air flow rate operating pressure and number of cycles to get maximum disinfection as well as cod reduction acknowledgement
