20770,arctic shipping fleet expansion is anticipated in the future however future refinements in the understanding of ice loads on larger ships are needed to achieve a better structural design with reduced steel weight published rules for the strength of ships are derived from semi empirical methods and calibrated with limited full scale measurements on small ships in 2015 the lloyd s register pointed out that for independent navigation of larger ships in heavier ice conditions steel weight increases exponentially with the ice thickness which negatively affects the economy of ships operations motivated by this statement the objective of this paper is to address uncertainty in rule derived ice loads using an ice mechanics point of view the focus is on the local ice crushing loads and the vessel speeds in the unified requirements for polar class ships of the international association of classification societies iacs in this work we attempt to relate the iacs speed dependent ice pressure area relationships to the simplified principles of ice mechanics coupled with structural design considerations this relation enables us to better understand uncertainties in the rule loads for larger ships which is essential to address the economy of arctic ships operations the results of this study showed that the choice of parameters in iacs ice crushing loads for larger vessels with higher ice classes pc1 has high uncertainty and the upper limit values are greater than those predicted by the ice mechanics approach keywords shipping iacs ice loads crushing pressure area speed effects 1 introduction the arctic has experienced an increase in passenger cruise voyages and marine export shipping of nonrenewable natural resources from coastal regions and the interior one of the main engineering challenges is how to design a safe and economically efficient ship structure that is capable of operating in ice covered waters in ship design practices it is common to specify ice loads in the form of pressures which are used to design shell plating and frames it is traditionally assumed johansson 1967 that a larger more powerful ship is more likely to encounter stronger ice as a result the design loads increase exponentially as the ship size increases and higher ice class ships are less efficient to operate and more expensive to build lloyd s register 2015 the classification societies provide guidelines for the strengthening of ice going ships finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr are often accepted as an industry standard for designing ships for first year ice environments riska and kämä 2011 whereas the international association of classification societies iacs polar class rules represent the latest scientific and engineering thinking on how to dimension a ship structure that operates in areas with multiyear ice and glacier ice features when determining ice loads on ice going ships rule developers traditionally rely on semi empirical methods which are calibrated with full scale measurements the data sets that were employed for calibration of the iacs rules are obtained from existing small icebreakers and moderately sized icebreaking cargo ships to account for the uncertainty of larger ships which exceed the calibration range the assumed design ice pressures tend to become conservative in the future as the feedback from ships in operation in the form of ice damage accumulates and as the knowledge about ice loads improves the rule formulations might be updated however collecting full scale data for larger vessels and higher ice classes is a challenge because none of the newly built icebreaking cargo vessels has pc2 and or pc1 classes this lack of pc2 and pc1 icebreaking cargo vessels combined with the recognition that full scale data on ice damage for larger ships are scarce if any data are publicly available lead us to address the uncertainties in rule derived ice loads from an ice mechanics point of view coupled with a structural design perspective the focus of this study is local ice crushing loads in the unified requirements for polar class ships of the international association of classification societies iacs the local ice crushing loads are specified in terms of the pressures in the corresponding areas that are used to design shell plating and frames first we rederive the ice pressure area relationships using simplified principles of ice mechanics reported by schulson and duval 2009 second we relate the derived pressures to those from the iacs rules that account for the associated uncertainties we aim to highlight the iacs underlying assumptions based on some principles of ice mechanics and to achieve a better understanding of the uncertainties and conservatism if any in the modern rule formulations an improved understanding of the uncertainties in the iacs ice loads is essential when the economy of arctic ships operations is addressed 2 pressure area relationships the ice pressure area pa relationships fall into three categories process curves termed by frederking 1998 spatial distribution curves termed by frederking 1999 and characteristic or design curves the latter category of curves is often viewed in the context of local or global ice loads and probabilistic or deterministic approaches to design a process pa curve describes the process of a structure that penetrates an ice feature or the process of an ice feature that hits a structure this curve is a continuous plot of the variation in the average pressure versus the total contact area during an ice structure interaction process a spatial distribution pa curve characterizes the average pressure on subareas of various sizes within a total contact area at an instant in time to establish this curve knowledge of the true contact area and pressure distribution at each time instant is required empirical data reported in timco and sudom 2013 indicate that for stationary structures lighthouses bridge piers offshore caisson structures etc the global and local pressures depend on the loading speed ice failure mode and aspect ratio width of the structure relative to the ice thickness as well as ice properties temperature salinity density and grain structure and orientation the most common way of expressing a local pa relationship is the power law expression p ca q where p is the pressure over a corresponding area a and c and q are empirical constants the exponent q is typically a negative number between 0 and 1 for ships moving structures there have been several experimental studies on how different conditions vessel speed ice thickness and season of operation affect global and local loads and the interpretation of full scale records to identify extreme ice loads during service operations and benchmarking of ice class selection e g glen and blount 1984 kujala and vuorio 1986 st john et al 1990 1995 kotisalo and kujala 1999 frederking 2000 hänninen et al 2001 matsuzawa et al

discrepancy in the interpretation of the data from ships i e the data from nataniel b palmer st john and minnick 1995 araon kim et al 2014 and terry fox ritch et al 2008 do not show a distinct dependency of ice pressure on ship speed whereas data from araon in 2016 indicate that the pressure increases with an increase in ship speed refer to fig 8 in cho and choi 2019 this discrepancy in the interpretation of full scale data reflects the complexity of the ice structure interaction even in controlled ship based tests when the ice parameters mechanical and geometrical have been recorded understanding the pressure area relationships from full scale operational data of a merchant vessel is even more challenging because some ice parameters cannot be measured while the ship is moving and the contact geometry between the ship and the ice is constantly changing which introduces a constant interplay between crushing and bending failure furthermore the operator s perception of ice conditions influences handling of the vessel in ice e g vessel speed angle of attack and thus affects the ice loads despite these difficulties interpretations that are based on full scale data i e semi empirical approaches provide the best estimates of ice pressures on ship and offshore structures probabilistic interpretations of ship ram data with first year ice multiyear ice and bergy bits for local design can be obtained from the international standard for offshore structures iso 19906 sec a8 2 5 3 the sections below briefly review the semi empirical ice crushing load model in iacs ship rules and less known alternative deterministic formulations 3 background to iacs s ice loads this section briefly presents the underlying assumptions behind the design ice crushing loads in the iacs unified requirements iacs ur for polar class ships section i2 3 whereas detailed information on this topic is provided in daley 2000 and iacs 2019 the design scenario is an oblique collision with a large ice floe that has a 150 front angle ice loads on a ship s hull are characterized by an average pressure p that is uniformly distributed over a rectangular load patch of height b and width w and dependent on the ice category hull angles and ship displacement an energy based approach popov et al 1967 combined with empirical pressure area relationships is adopted for the ice load the kinetic energy of the ship is equated to the ice crushing energy which is determined by integrating the ice force over the penetration depth the ice force is calculated by integrating the ice crushing pressure p cr over the nominal contact area a a process pressure area relationship eq 1 is assumed where p 0 is the ice strength factor reference ice pressure which is class dependent and the exponent q ex in daley 2000 is a constant i e average pressure decreases with the nominal projected contact area p 0 and q are estimated from measured data for ice interaction with ship hulls the constant q is set to 0 1 for all ice classes independent of a vessel s speed 1 p c r p 0 a q for an angular ice floe the nominal contact area a is triangular shaped fig 1 to simplify the calculations a rectangular contact area load patch with the same aspect ratio a r and area is utilized the effect of local ice edge fractures spalls is treated by assuming a reduction in the size of the nominal contact area while maintaining a constant aspect ratio and total force this area reduction in size a red is given by the following equation where the spalling parameter ω wex in daley 2000 is set to 0 7 and is independent of the ice class or speed and β is the frame angle from the vertical β in daley 2000 2 a r e d a ω a r 1 ω a r 7 46 sin β 1 3 at the end of the collision i e when all kinetic energy is dissipated by ice deformation the ice crushing pressure height and width of the load patch are calculated the sensitivity analysis presented in kim and amdahl 2016 shows that the values of the exponent in the process pressure area relationship q and spalling characteristic ω are the most influencing parameters for the ice pressure values for each ice class assumptions are made regarding the vessel s speed that underlies the p 0 value in eq 1 and the bending failure furthermore as noted in iacs 2019 the assumption of the triangular shaped area is valid if the vertical projection of the contact area is less than the assumed thickness of the ice and if this thickness has a physical meaning for the crushing impact scenario in the iacs ur for a vertical or nearly vertical structure and not fulfilling the above criteria when the effect of ice bending failure is minimized a r is set to 3 6 and the design ice pressure depends on the location w r t to the bow ice class and vessel s displacement the design pressure formulations are given in iacs ur section i2 3 2 2 and omitted herein 4 alternative deterministic formulations this section presents two less known but alternative deterministic approaches to local ice pressures the first approach is the modified hydrodynamic model of ice impact appolonov et al 2011 2018 and the second approach is the method of the russian maritime register of shipping rmrs for the calculation of ice loads on structures with nonstandard hull shapes rmrs 2017 the following paragraphs briefly outline the approaches whereas additional details are given in the appendix the modified hydrodynamic model mhdm named by appolonov et al 2018 originates from the work of kurdyumov and kheisin 1974 and кurdyumov et al 1980 in an attempt to address criticism of past works see for example riska 2018 the mhdm replaces an earlier assumption that the pressure is proportional to the crushed layer thickness parabolic spatial pressure distribution with a set of additional conditions that yield a conceptually different pressure profile over the loading height at the center of the contact zone x b 0 2 where x is the coordinate with the origin at the center of the loading height b 0 is the width of the high pressure zone the solution of the extrusion model i e infinite pressure is replaced by a constant pressure p m for b 0 2 x b 2 the solution of the viscous ice extrusion applies and is given as follows 3 p x p m 2 a v b b b 0 1 b 2 x 2 1 b b 0 2 1 2 a v b b 2 x 1 in eq 3 p x is the pressure profile over the loading height b equal to the ice thickness v is the normal speed a 3μ k3 μ is the dynamic viscosity of crushed ice in the intermediate layer h and k is the proportionality coefficient between x and the crushing layer thickness h kx for details of the derivation of eq 3 refer to the appendix the resulting pressure profile is illustrated in fig 7 sketch on the right hand side in addition to the mhdm a purely empirical approach exists in the engineering community rmrs 2017 this approach assumes that the contact pressure is a function of the uniaxial compressive strength and depends on ice temperature salinity density ice loading direction ice age first year ice multiyear ice and ice type level ice deformed ice different temperature and salinity profiles through the ice thickness are assumed and depend on the snow depth ice age type and time of the year winter spring navigation summer autumn navigation a hypothetical scenario is provided in the appendix to illustrate the methodology similar to the iacs procedure both the mhdm and rmrs adopt popov s energy based approach which is proposed for the ice load calculation the kinetic energy of the ship is equated to the ice crushing energy which is determined by integrating the ice force over the penetration depth the ice force is calculated by integrating the ice crushing pressure over the nominal contact area the effect of local ice edge fractures spalls is treated by assuming a reduction in the size of the nominal contact area furthermore rmrs eq 4 35 includes an exponential softening of the average contact pressure with an increase in the contact area the latter assumption resembles the pressure area curve eq 1 of the iacs at the end of the collision i e when all kinetic energy is dissipated by ice deformation the ice crushing pressure height and width of the ice load patch are calculated using either the mhdm or the rmrs approach the available literature on the mhdm lacks clear guidance about how to set up the p m nominal contact area a and b 0 values for different ice classes which hinders a quantitative comparison if not impossible further we focus on addressing the uncertainties in the empirical constant q ice strength factor p 0 and ship s speed v 5 reconstruction of pressure area relationships ice mechanics ice is a complex material its response to compressive loading depends on many parameters such as the loading rate loading direction ice type grain size temperature degree of confinement and loading history damage state details on the ice constitutive response are provided in e g schulson and duval 2009 ductile failure is dominant with low loading rates high ice temperatures and high degrees of confinement brittle failure dominates with high loading rates low temperatures and low degrees of confinement this dominance of ductile or brittle failure will influence the spatial pressure distribution over the contact area even when the other parameters of ice structure interaction are constant furthermore the confinement raises the failure stress σ1 with the effect being greater within the regime of brittle behavior the following approach simplified mechanics method attempts to simultaneously account for the effects of ice confinement and the loading rate using a deterministic viewpoint for a reference temperature of 10 c the different loading speed regimes ductile and brittle give presumably different spatial pressure distributions as illustrated in fig 2 the pressure is viewed as the σ1 component of the stress tensor the pressure area curves are reconstructed from spatial pressure distributions shown in fig 2 in the pressure area curve the pressure is treated as an average pressure over the contact area we take a conservative approach and do not consider the softening behavior of ice that was explained in kim and schulson 2015 this section presents a derivation of the pressure area curves as a function of impact speed the derivations are per unit width w of the contact area for contact heights h i larger than 0 1 m at low loading rates v v tr vessel speeds below a certain threshold we assume a transition from fully ductile ice failure where the pressure is uniformly distributed over the contact area to predominantly brittle failure with high pressures zones that are concentrated in the center of the contact area the high pressure zones are zones where confinement is high enough to suppress coulombic faulting and activate instead plastic faulting with the nonzero deviatoric component of the stress tensor at high loading rates vessel speeds over a certain threshold brittle failure dominates and the peak pressure linearly increases with the loading rate and depends on the degree of confinement which is assumed to be the highest in the central zone away from this zone the pressure decreases linearly and reaches zero at the periphery of the contact area fig 2 in addition we consider the universal behavior of brittle materials including the failure parameters given in renshaw and schulson 2001 governing equations 4a p c r σ d u c t v v t r σ p e a k h i s h i 2 v v t r 4b σ p e a k 1 v v r e f σ c o n f σ d u c t σ d u c t

model this study section 4 were related to the iacs ur pressure area relationships i2 3 global pressures or process pressure area curves and local or design pressures were plotted for different vessel speeds or ice classes and sizes fig 3 presents the process pressure area relationship for the ductile regime equation 4a 4d for v v tr and the contact height equal to the ice thickness h i 2 5 m to minimize the effect of bending the interaction between a large ice floe 150 front angle and a vertical structure β 0 has been considered the change in pressure with area in the ductile regime is negligible because the pressure is evenly distributed over the contact area when the velocity approaches zero the mechanics model this study gives a maximum pressure of 3 0 mpa which is the value of the ductile strength used in the model when the velocity increases in the ductile regime the average pressure decreases owing to the uneven character of the pressure distribution over the contact area for 0 v v tr if strain rate hardening is included within the ductile regime the average pressure values in fig 3 are expected to be higher fig 4 presents the pressure area relationship derived using the mechanics model and the process pressure area relationship assumed by iacs for pc1 pc3 and pc7 daley 2000 equation a9 for the purpose of comparison in the mechanics approach the contact pressures which are averaged over the corresponding contact areas were calculated following the procedure presented in annex a equations a5 a9 and a23 a26 by daley 2000 except that a9 equation 1 was replaced by equation 4a 4d with parameters from table 1 the parameter β 10 1 a validity range of the daley formulation has been applied only ice crushing at 10 c was considered as a conservative estimate the highest local pressures were assumed in the middle of the contact height except for pc1 contact areas 0 3 m2 for the considered areas from 0 1 m2 to 3 0 m2 the mechanics model with the parameters in table 1 always gives a higher crushing pressure than that assumed by iacs ur ice crushing loads in section i2 3 2 1 this result is reasonable as the bending effect which is present for frame angles of 10 and is not included in the mechanics model note that the gap between the pressure area curves for two adjacent polar classes increases due to the uncertainty from lower class vessels to higher class vessels pc3 pc1 the corresponding changes according to the simplified mechanics models are considerably milder in order to relate to the local pressures the design local pressure was calculated in accordance with the iacs requirements section i2 3 2 2 hull areas other than the bow to account for scatter in the pressure values along the hull the calculated design pressure value in the nonbow area was scaled by the hull area factor af thus for a ship with a given displacement and polar class a design pressure range is produced in the nonbow areas based on the maximum af and minimum af according to the iacs requirements for the mechanics model the aspect ratio a r was set to 3 6 which is equivalent to that in iacs section i2 3 2 2 from the rectangular load patch of the iacs requirements the contact height corresponds to the contact area was utilized to calculate the average pressure it was assumed that the contact would start from the middle of the contact thickness a conservative estimate fig 5 presents a local pressure area from the iacs requirements for ships with pc1 to pc3 hull areas other than the bow and from the mechanics model in the iacs requirements as the size of the vessel increases the upper limit lower limit and range of design pressure change the same trend was observed with respect to the higher ice classes this finding clearly indicates an increase in uncertainty when the ice class and or vessel class increases fig 6 presents the speed effect on the local design pressure according to iacs section i2 3 2 2 and the mechanics model for two vessels 10 kt and 300 kt for a ship with a given displacement and polar class a design pressure range is produced in the nonbow areas based on the maximum af and the minimum af according to the iacs requirements in the iacs requirements the speed effect is considered a polar class attribute so the relationship is discrete the local pressures from the mechanics model fig 6 comprise the averaged pressure that corresponds to the full thickness at the end of the penetration process the relationship between design pressure and velocity is continuous so the speed effect is milder and more linear than that in iacs furthermore there is a large difference between pressures for higher ice classes factor of 5 for pc1 at 6 0 m s 7 discussion in this paper we have approached the uncertainties in rule derived ice crushing loads from an ice mechanics point of view coupled with structural design considerations in a deterministic way we have rederived the ice pressure area relationships using simplified fundamental principles of ice strength and related them to those in the existing ship rules and recommendations for nearly vertical structures i e nonbow areas where the effect of ice bending is minimized for regions other than nonbow areas where the effect of bending can be significant jordaan 2001 pointed out that the inclusion of flexural failure can improve the agreement between the calculated load data based on random pressure area coefficients and the empirical load data fig 7 presents the conceptual difference between the crushing pressure representation in this study and that in iacs rmrs nonstandard hull shapes and mhdm in the ductile regime the mechanics approach considers a trapezoidal pressure profile with a zone of the constant pressures over a certain region whereas the viscous extrusion approaches by kurdyumov and kheisin 1974 and by kennedy et al 1994 suggest a bell shaped pressure profiles when coupled with the structural design considerations e g for plate thickness design a localized loaded area is needed in the order of stiffener spacing squared deviations from a nonuniform distributions will be less significant over the smaller areas and if the peak pressures are not well pronounced over the loaded area like in the ductile regime the assumption of the uniform pressure profile is reasonable in addition kurdyumov and kheisn 1974 state that the pressure distribution in their model is close to uniform and it is reasonable to replace is with a constant pressure value in this study spalling of ice as a reduction in the contact area was not considered however experimental evidence e g glen and comfort 1983 suggests that the actual contact area reduces as the speed increases if this reduction is included in the mechanics model the average pressure will decrease at a faster rate with an increase in the contact area for higher velocities ductile ice strength depends on confinement and the loading rate the triaxial ductile compressive strength of columnar grained ice which possesses the s2 growth texture i e the across column compressive strength measured under biaxial compressive loading across the columns and compressive loading along the columns of ice whose crystallographic c axes are confined to the horizontal plane of the ice cover but randomly oriented within this plane is not affected by the along column stresses schulson and duval 2009 thus the assumption of a uniform pressure distribution over h i is reasonable the confined pressure value eq 4c incorporates the resistance to fast crack growth k ic which is derived from the assumption of the universal behavior of brittle materials in compression renshaw and schulson 2001 this assumption is not applicable to the region of very high confinement where plastic faulting operates the pressure value corresponds to a central zone of the ice s 0 1 m which is also similar to the minimum stiffener spacing value for smaller highly confined areas where plastic faulting is activated the experimental results jordaan 2001 show a maximum pressure of 50 mpa furthermore as the contact area tends to 0 the ice pressure has a physical limit that is equal to the theoretical ice strength of 0 1e where e is the young s modulus of ice since the theoretical strength of steel is higher than that of ice the latter will always fail first thus on very small contact areas order of mm mm pressures higher than σ peak can occur from a structural design point of view the minimum relevant area for local design is equal to the stiffener spacing squared this result is on the order of the sample size in the laboratory thus the pressure for a contact area of 0 1 0 1 m2 is unlikely to exceed that measured in the laboratory for freshwater granular nearly pure ice samples in fully confined conditions depending on the confinement the ductile to brittle transition of salt water ice at 10 c occurs at a strain rate of approximately 10 3 1 s schulson and duval 2009 which may be less than the assumed transition speed of 2 0 knots a reference strain rate v tr 4b for v tr 2 knots is between 8 10 4 and 5 10 3 depending on the ship s dimension b 300 m 50 m and assuming that it acts as a moving indenter under idealized conditions perfectly vertical structure uniform contact areas etc on the other hand a vessel is generally designed to move continuously at a minimum steady speed of approximately 2 0 knots at speeds less than 2 0 knots the maneuverability of a vessel in ice will be lost and the vessel can become stuck in the ice in the latter case the ice structure interaction is no longer governed by the vessel speed but is governed by the speed of the drifting ice the speed of the latter could be low enough to impart ductile behavior over a design area as the ice starts to build up around the vessel which creates biaxial loading conditions the presented model may be unconservative because it assumes that the ductile pressure is independent of the confinement as noted in schulson and duval 2009 the ductile to brittle transition occurs gradually rather than abruptly i e ductile to brittle transition occurs over a small range of strain rates instead of abruptly at a specific strain rate this occurrence is however not considered in detail furthermore we have assumed that there is no speed effect on σ duct a grain size dependent behavior is not considered the characteristic grain size is chosen to be 10 mm at least 10 grains across the highly confined region arguments for this choice is that grain size effects will be less pronounced at engineering scale m scale because of the imperfections internal cracks brine pockets and brine drainage channels temperature gradients snow cover etc the parameters for the ice mechanics approach except v tr and v ref are based on controlled laboratory and medium scale tests the ice pressure profile given by the mechanics approach represents the limit state of the ice qualitatively the results of this model agree with the experimental results of sodhi et al 1998 i e the local pressure σ peak is higher at higher speeds than at lower speeds whereas the average pressures can be higher in the ductile regime the results of the mechanics model in the ductile regime have been placed in the context of the dnv gl ice compression load amidships dnv gl as 2020 section 6 pt 4 8 refer to fig 8 for each polar class the design line load for vertical side shells was calculated assuming that a ship is trapped between moving ice floes fig 8 plots the load values as a function of the ice thickness factor in the ductile regime the functional dependency resembles that given by the dnv gl as however regarding the load magnitude the comparison is difficult because the pressure from the mechanics model was converted to a line load assuming that the actual load height scales are proportional to the ice thickness factors given in dnv gl section 6 pt 4 8 but the exact relationship is uncertain we evaluated the mechanics approach for different values of ductile to brittle transition speed v tr reference speed v ref and peak pressure σ peak the results are plotted in figs 3 5 and 6 the speed dependency given by the ice mechanics model is milder than that assumed in iacs especially for the higher ice classes pc2 and pc1 even with σ peak of 30 50 mpa which is three to five times greater than the level recorded in the laboratory on freshwater granular nearly pure ice samples in fully confined conditions the pressure values given by iacs section i2 3 2 2 for pc1 are higher refer to fig 6 comparison of pressures in the ductile regime with design pressures fig 6 indicates that smaller vessels with class below pc4 could receive side damage if they are stuck in ice because the slow loading from 0 0 upwards will yield a higher average pressure than assumed in the design to further investigate this scenario the value of the ductile strength would need an additional calibration in the above comparison it should be taken into account that the considered iacs requirements do not explicitly specify ice temperature nor distinguish between summer winter navigational seasons whereas the calculated pressures form the mechanics model was based on 10 c and may not include all the effects as the design formulations regarding the iacs process pressure area curve equation 1 β 10 1 flexural ice failure would have to be included in the mechanics model to further comment on the disparities observed in fig 4 the iacs pressure values for the nonbow areas shown in figs 5 and 6 which correspond to the higher ice classes pc2 and pc1 seems to be very uncertain when the speeds of the larger vessels are considered by imposing clear requirements that regulate the speeds of the vessel in ice the uncertainty that was applied to the ice loads could be reduced however an entire ship hull and flexural failure should be considered instead of focusing on a specific area crushing ice loads nonbow area iacs section i2 3 2 2 in this study 8 concluding remarks currently interpretations based on full scale data i e semi empirical approaches provide the best estimates of ice pressures on ship structures this study lays the foundation for how to address the uncertainty in the rule derived ice loads using the first principles of ice mechanics the focus has been the local ice crushing load in iacs nonbow areas the process pressure area relationship p p 0 a q q 0 1 p 0 depends on ice class and speed effects a pressure model was derived as a function of vessel speed and then plotted on the same figure as the pressure valued from the iacs approach the derived model is based on simplified principles of ice mechanics that are coupled with design considerations the main results of this study are summarized as follows within the dominating brittle and brittle like i e plastic faulting failure domain the mechanics model exhibits trends that are similar to those assumed by iacs i e increase in average pressure with increasing speed if ice failure against an inclined ship side is concerned the choice of q and p 0 appears to be reasonable the choice of the parameters in the iacs section i2 3 2 2 for nonbow areas including the area factors for higher ice classes is however highly uncertain especially for larger pc2 and pc1 vessels conversely the smaller ice class vessels pc4 could be prone to side damage if ductile behavior of ice occurs e g when the vessel is stuck in ice the presented approach could be expanded to other hull areas by accounting for flexural failure the approach is based on observations at loading speeds that are slower when compared to ship ice interactions despite a similar appearance of ice crushing processes in laboratory and in situ the presented approach could be refined in the future furthermore it could be interesting to investigate if a probabilistic approach to ice loads and or viscous extrusion approach could also be employed to address the uncertainty in the rule derived ice loads there is a need for full scale ice data collection programs that not only focus on ice loads and underlying ice parameters but also incorporate human aspects e g captain experience and decisions and seek their risky combinations w r t to vessel damage and the corresponding

over the loading height for the case of ice edge crushing is given in appolonov et al 2018 some underlying assumptions are reported in appolonov et al 2011 however a full derivation is not available in the published literature this section presents a step by step derivation procedure the modified hydrodynamic model first assumes that there is an intermediate layer of crushed ice between the ship side and the solid undamaged ice a basic relationship that relates the pressure p to the crushed layer thickness h is derived refer to eq a1 a1 h 3 2 p x 2 3 h 2 p x h x 3 μ u p n in eq a1 μ is the dynamic viscosity of crushed ice in the intermediate layer h is the thickness of the intermediate layer and u pn is the instantaneous ship speed to this point the basic assumptions of the layer behavior are similar to those of kurdyumov and kheisin 1974 1976 details of the derivation are presented in kim and amdahl 2016 and thus are omitted here next mhdm assumes that the thickness of the intermediate crushed layer is linearly proportional to x a vertical coordinate with the origin at the center of the loading height a2 h k x the following boundary conditions are introduced a3 p x 0 5

following conditions winter spring navigation march in the kara sea first year ice with a maximum thickness h i of 1 45 m and ice edge crushing against a vertical side structure the approach is

20770,arctic shipping fleet expansion is anticipated in the future however future refinements in the understanding of ice loads on larger ships are needed to achieve a better structural design with reduced steel weight published rules for the strength of ships are derived from semi empirical methods and calibrated with limited full scale measurements on small ships in 2015 the lloyd s register pointed out that for independent navigation of larger ships in heavier ice conditions steel weight increases exponentially with the ice thickness which negatively affects the economy of ships operations motivated by this statement the objective of this paper is to address uncertainty in rule derived ice loads using an ice mechanics point of view the focus is on the local ice crushing loads and the vessel speeds in the unified requirements for polar class ships of the international association of classification societies iacs in this work we attempt to relate the iacs speed dependent ice pressure area relationships to the simplified principles of ice mechanics coupled with structural design considerations this relation enables us to better understand uncertainties in the rule loads for larger ships which is essential to address the economy of arctic ships operations the results of this study showed that the choice of parameters in iacs ice crushing loads for larger vessels with higher ice classes pc1 has high uncertainty and the upper limit values are greater than those predicted by the ice mechanics approach keywords shipping iacs ice loads crushing pressure area speed effects 1 introduction the arctic has experienced an increase in passenger cruise voyages and marine export shipping of nonrenewable natural resources from coastal regions and the interior one of the main engineering challenges is how to design a safe and economically efficient ship structure that is capable of operating in ice covered waters in ship design practices it is common to specify ice loads in the form of pressures which are used to design shell plating and frames it is traditionally assumed johansson 1967 that a larger more powerful ship is more likely to encounter stronger ice as a result the design loads increase exponentially as the ship size increases and higher ice class ships are less efficient to operate and more expensive to build lloyd s register 2015 the classification societies provide guidelines for the strengthening of ice going ships finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr are often accepted as an industry standard for designing ships for first year ice environments riska and kämä 2011 whereas the international association of classification societies iacs polar class rules represent the latest scientific and engineering thinking on how to dimension a ship structure that operates in areas with multiyear ice and glacier ice features when determining ice loads on ice going ships rule developers traditionally rely on semi empirical methods which are calibrated with full scale measurements the data sets that were employed for calibration of the iacs rules are obtained from existing small icebreakers and moderately sized icebreaking cargo ships to account for the uncertainty of larger ships which exceed the calibration range the assumed design ice pressures tend to become conservative in the future as the feedback from ships in operation in the form of ice damage accumulates and as the knowledge about ice loads improves the rule formulations might be updated however collecting full scale data for larger vessels and higher ice classes is a challenge because none of the newly built icebreaking cargo vessels has pc2 and or pc1 classes this lack of pc2 and pc1 icebreaking cargo vessels combined with the recognition that full scale data on ice damage for larger ships are scarce if any data are publicly available lead us to address the uncertainties in rule derived ice loads from an ice mechanics point of view coupled with a structural design perspective the focus of this study is local ice crushing loads in the unified requirements for polar class ships of the international association of classification societies iacs the local ice crushing loads are specified in terms of the pressures in the corresponding areas that are used to design shell plating and frames first we rederive the ice pressure area relationships using simplified principles of ice mechanics reported by schulson and duval 2009 second we relate the derived pressures to those from the iacs rules that account for the associated uncertainties we aim to highlight the iacs underlying assumptions based on some principles of ice mechanics and to achieve a better understanding of the uncertainties and conservatism if any in the modern rule formulations an improved understanding of the uncertainties in the iacs ice loads is essential when the economy of arctic ships operations is addressed 2 pressure area relationships the ice pressure area pa relationships fall into three categories process curves termed by frederking 1998 spatial distribution curves termed by frederking 1999 and characteristic or design curves the latter category of curves is often viewed in the context of local or global ice loads and probabilistic or deterministic approaches to design a process pa curve describes the process of a structure that penetrates an ice feature or the process of an ice feature that hits a structure this curve is a continuous plot of the variation in the average pressure versus the total contact area during an ice structure interaction process a spatial distribution pa curve characterizes the average pressure on subareas of various sizes within a total contact area at an instant in time to establish this curve knowledge of the true contact area and pressure distribution at each time instant is required empirical data reported in timco and sudom 2013 indicate that for stationary structures lighthouses bridge piers offshore caisson structures etc the global and local pressures depend on the loading speed ice failure mode and aspect ratio width of the structure relative to the ice thickness as well as ice properties temperature salinity density and grain structure and orientation the most common way of expressing a local pa relationship is the power law expression p ca q where p is the pressure over a corresponding area a and c and q are empirical constants the exponent q is typically a negative number between 0 and 1 for ships moving structures there have been several experimental studies on how different conditions vessel speed ice thickness and season of operation affect global and local loads and the interpretation of full scale records to identify extreme ice loads during service operations and benchmarking of ice class selection e g glen and blount 1984 kujala and vuorio 1986 st john et al 1990 1995 kotisalo and kujala 1999 frederking 2000 hänninen et al 2001 matsuzawa et al

discrepancy in the interpretation of the data from ships i e the data from nataniel b palmer st john and minnick 1995 araon kim et al 2014 and terry fox ritch et al 2008 do not show a distinct dependency of ice pressure on ship speed whereas data from araon in 2016 indicate that the pressure increases with an increase in ship speed refer to fig 8 in cho and choi 2019 this discrepancy in the interpretation of full scale data reflects the complexity of the ice structure interaction even in controlled ship based tests when the ice parameters mechanical and geometrical have been recorded understanding the pressure area relationships from full scale operational data of a merchant vessel is even more challenging because some ice parameters cannot be measured while the ship is moving and the contact geometry between the ship and the ice is constantly changing which introduces a constant interplay between crushing and bending failure furthermore the operator s perception of ice conditions influences handling of the vessel in ice e g vessel speed angle of attack and thus affects the ice loads despite these difficulties interpretations that are based on full scale data i e semi empirical approaches provide the best estimates of ice pressures on ship and offshore structures probabilistic interpretations of ship ram data with first year ice multiyear ice and bergy bits for local design can be obtained from the international standard for offshore structures iso 19906 sec a8 2 5 3 the sections below briefly review the semi empirical ice crushing load model in iacs ship rules and less known alternative deterministic formulations 3 background to iacs s ice loads this section briefly presents the underlying assumptions behind the design ice crushing loads in the iacs unified requirements iacs ur for polar class ships section i2 3 whereas detailed information on this topic is provided in daley 2000 and iacs 2019 the design scenario is an oblique collision with a large ice floe that has a 150 front angle ice loads on a ship s hull are characterized by an average pressure p that is uniformly distributed over a rectangular load patch of height b and width w and dependent on the ice category hull angles and ship displacement an energy based approach popov et al 1967 combined with empirical pressure area relationships is adopted for the ice load the kinetic energy of the ship is equated to the ice crushing energy which is determined by integrating the ice force over the penetration depth the ice force is calculated by integrating the ice crushing pressure p cr over the nominal contact area a a process pressure area relationship eq 1 is assumed where p 0 is the ice strength factor reference ice pressure which is class dependent and the exponent q ex in daley 2000 is a constant i e average pressure decreases with the nominal projected contact area p 0 and q are estimated from measured data for ice interaction with ship hulls the constant q is set to 0 1 for all ice classes independent of a vessel s speed 1 p c r p 0 a q for an angular ice floe the nominal contact area a is triangular shaped fig 1 to simplify the calculations a rectangular contact area load patch with the same aspect ratio a r and area is utilized the effect of local ice edge fractures spalls is treated by assuming a reduction in the size of the nominal contact area while maintaining a constant aspect ratio and total force this area reduction in size a red is given by the following equation where the spalling parameter ω wex in daley 2000 is set to 0 7 and is independent of the ice class or speed and β is the frame angle from the vertical β in daley 2000 2 a r e d a ω a r 1 ω a r 7 46 sin β 1 3 at the end of the collision i e when all kinetic energy is dissipated by ice deformation the ice crushing pressure height and width of the load patch are calculated the sensitivity analysis presented in kim and amdahl 2016 shows that the values of the exponent in the process pressure area relationship q and spalling characteristic ω are the most influencing parameters for the ice pressure values for each ice class assumptions are made regarding the vessel s speed that underlies the p 0 value in eq 1 and the bending failure furthermore as noted in iacs 2019 the assumption of the triangular shaped area is valid if the vertical projection of the contact area is less than the assumed thickness of the ice and if this thickness has a physical meaning for the crushing impact scenario in the iacs ur for a vertical or nearly vertical structure and not fulfilling the above criteria when the effect of ice bending failure is minimized a r is set to 3 6 and the design ice pressure depends on the location w r t to the bow ice class and vessel s displacement the design pressure formulations are given in iacs ur section i2 3 2 2 and omitted herein 4 alternative deterministic formulations this section presents two less known but alternative deterministic approaches to local ice pressures the first approach is the modified hydrodynamic model of ice impact appolonov et al 2011 2018 and the second approach is the method of the russian maritime register of shipping rmrs for the calculation of ice loads on structures with nonstandard hull shapes rmrs 2017 the following paragraphs briefly outline the approaches whereas additional details are given in the appendix the modified hydrodynamic model mhdm named by appolonov et al 2018 originates from the work of kurdyumov and kheisin 1974 and кurdyumov et al 1980 in an attempt to address criticism of past works see for example riska 2018 the mhdm replaces an earlier assumption that the pressure is proportional to the crushed layer thickness parabolic spatial pressure distribution with a set of additional conditions that yield a conceptually different pressure profile over the loading height at the center of the contact zone x b 0 2 where x is the coordinate with the origin at the center of the loading height b 0 is the width of the high pressure zone the solution of the extrusion model i e infinite pressure is replaced by a constant pressure p m for b 0 2 x b 2 the solution of the viscous ice extrusion applies and is given as follows 3 p x p m 2 a v b b b 0 1 b 2 x 2 1 b b 0 2 1 2 a v b b 2 x 1 in eq 3 p x is the pressure profile over the loading height b equal to the ice thickness v is the normal speed a 3μ k3 μ is the dynamic viscosity of crushed ice in the intermediate layer h and k is the proportionality coefficient between x and the crushing layer thickness h kx for details of the derivation of eq 3 refer to the appendix the resulting pressure profile is illustrated in fig 7 sketch on the right hand side in addition to the mhdm a purely empirical approach exists in the engineering community rmrs 2017 this approach assumes that the contact pressure is a function of the uniaxial compressive strength and depends on ice temperature salinity density ice loading direction ice age first year ice multiyear ice and ice type level ice deformed ice different temperature and salinity profiles through the ice thickness are assumed and depend on the snow depth ice age type and time of the year winter spring navigation summer autumn navigation a hypothetical scenario is provided in the appendix to illustrate the methodology similar to the iacs procedure both the mhdm and rmrs adopt popov s energy based approach which is proposed for the ice load calculation the kinetic energy of the ship is equated to the ice crushing energy which is determined by integrating the ice force over the penetration depth the ice force is calculated by integrating the ice crushing pressure over the nominal contact area the effect of local ice edge fractures spalls is treated by assuming a reduction in the size of the nominal contact area furthermore rmrs eq 4 35 includes an exponential softening of the average contact pressure with an increase in the contact area the latter assumption resembles the pressure area curve eq 1 of the iacs at the end of the collision i e when all kinetic energy is dissipated by ice deformation the ice crushing pressure height and width of the ice load patch are calculated using either the mhdm or the rmrs approach the available literature on the mhdm lacks clear guidance about how to set up the p m nominal contact area a and b 0 values for different ice classes which hinders a quantitative comparison if not impossible further we focus on addressing the uncertainties in the empirical constant q ice strength factor p 0 and ship s speed v 5 reconstruction of pressure area relationships ice mechanics ice is a complex material its response to compressive loading depends on many parameters such as the loading rate loading direction ice type grain size temperature degree of confinement and loading history damage state details on the ice constitutive response are provided in e g schulson and duval 2009 ductile failure is dominant with low loading rates high ice temperatures and high degrees of confinement brittle failure dominates with high loading rates low temperatures and low degrees of confinement this dominance of ductile or brittle failure will influence the spatial pressure distribution over the contact area even when the other parameters of ice structure interaction are constant furthermore the confinement raises the failure stress σ1 with the effect being greater within the regime of brittle behavior the following approach simplified mechanics method attempts to simultaneously account for the effects of ice confinement and the loading rate using a deterministic viewpoint for a reference temperature of 10 c the different loading speed regimes ductile and brittle give presumably different spatial pressure distributions as illustrated in fig 2 the pressure is viewed as the σ1 component of the stress tensor the pressure area curves are reconstructed from spatial pressure distributions shown in fig 2 in the pressure area curve the pressure is treated as an average pressure over the contact area we take a conservative approach and do not consider the softening behavior of ice that was explained in kim and schulson 2015 this section presents a derivation of the pressure area curves as a function of impact speed the derivations are per unit width w of the contact area for contact heights h i larger than 0 1 m at low loading rates v v tr vessel speeds below a certain threshold we assume a transition from fully ductile ice failure where the pressure is uniformly distributed over the contact area to predominantly brittle failure with high pressures zones that are concentrated in the center of the contact area the high pressure zones are zones where confinement is high enough to suppress coulombic faulting and activate instead plastic faulting with the nonzero deviatoric component of the stress tensor at high loading rates vessel speeds over a certain threshold brittle failure dominates and the peak pressure linearly increases with the loading rate and depends on the degree of confinement which is assumed to be the highest in the central zone away from this zone the pressure decreases linearly and reaches zero at the periphery of the contact area fig 2 in addition we consider the universal behavior of brittle materials including the failure parameters given in renshaw and schulson 2001 governing equations 4a p c r σ d u c t v v t r σ p e a k h i s h i 2 v v t r 4b σ p e a k 1 v v r e f σ c o n f σ d u c t σ d u c t

model this study section 4 were related to the iacs ur pressure area relationships i2 3 global pressures or process pressure area curves and local or design pressures were plotted for different vessel speeds or ice classes and sizes fig 3 presents the process pressure area relationship for the ductile regime equation 4a 4d for v v tr and the contact height equal to the ice thickness h i 2 5 m to minimize the effect of bending the interaction between a large ice floe 150 front angle and a vertical structure β 0 has been considered the change in pressure with area in the ductile regime is negligible because the pressure is evenly distributed over the contact area when the velocity approaches zero the mechanics model this study gives a maximum pressure of 3 0 mpa which is the value of the ductile strength used in the model when the velocity increases in the ductile regime the average pressure decreases owing to the uneven character of the pressure distribution over the contact area for 0 v v tr if strain rate hardening is included within the ductile regime the average pressure values in fig 3 are expected to be higher fig 4 presents the pressure area relationship derived using the mechanics model and the process pressure area relationship assumed by iacs for pc1 pc3 and pc7 daley 2000 equation a9 for the purpose of comparison in the mechanics approach the contact pressures which are averaged over the corresponding contact areas were calculated following the procedure presented in annex a equations a5 a9 and a23 a26 by daley 2000 except that a9 equation 1 was replaced by equation 4a 4d with parameters from table 1 the parameter β 10 1 a validity range of the daley formulation has been applied only ice crushing at 10 c was considered as a conservative estimate the highest local pressures were assumed in the middle of the contact height except for pc1 contact areas 0 3 m2 for the considered areas from 0 1 m2 to 3 0 m2 the mechanics model with the parameters in table 1 always gives a higher crushing pressure than that assumed by iacs ur ice crushing loads in section i2 3 2 1 this result is reasonable as the bending effect which is present for frame angles of 10 and is not included in the mechanics model note that the gap between the pressure area curves for two adjacent polar classes increases due to the uncertainty from lower class vessels to higher class vessels pc3 pc1 the corresponding changes according to the simplified mechanics models are considerably milder in order to relate to the local pressures the design local pressure was calculated in accordance with the iacs requirements section i2 3 2 2 hull areas other than the bow to account for scatter in the pressure values along the hull the calculated design pressure value in the nonbow area was scaled by the hull area factor af thus for a ship with a given displacement and polar class a design pressure range is produced in the nonbow areas based on the maximum af and minimum af according to the iacs requirements for the mechanics model the aspect ratio a r was set to 3 6 which is equivalent to that in iacs section i2 3 2 2 from the rectangular load patch of the iacs requirements the contact height corresponds to the contact area was utilized to calculate the average pressure it was assumed that the contact would start from the middle of the contact thickness a conservative estimate fig 5 presents a local pressure area from the iacs requirements for ships with pc1 to pc3 hull areas other than the bow and from the mechanics model in the iacs requirements as the size of the vessel increases the upper limit lower limit and range of design pressure change the same trend was observed with respect to the higher ice classes this finding clearly indicates an increase in uncertainty when the ice class and or vessel class increases fig 6 presents the speed effect on the local design pressure according to iacs section i2 3 2 2 and the mechanics model for two vessels 10 kt and 300 kt for a ship with a given displacement and polar class a design pressure range is produced in the nonbow areas based on the maximum af and the minimum af according to the iacs requirements in the iacs requirements the speed effect is considered a polar class attribute so the relationship is discrete the local pressures from the mechanics model fig 6 comprise the averaged pressure that corresponds to the full thickness at the end of the penetration process the relationship between design pressure and velocity is continuous so the speed effect is milder and more linear than that in iacs furthermore there is a large difference between pressures for higher ice classes factor of 5 for pc1 at 6 0 m s 7 discussion in this paper we have approached the uncertainties in rule derived ice crushing loads from an ice mechanics point of view coupled with structural design considerations in a deterministic way we have rederived the ice pressure area relationships using simplified fundamental principles of ice strength and related them to those in the existing ship rules and recommendations for nearly vertical structures i e nonbow areas where the effect of ice bending is minimized for regions other than nonbow areas where the effect of bending can be significant jordaan 2001 pointed out that the inclusion of flexural failure can improve the agreement between the calculated load data based on random pressure area coefficients and the empirical load data fig 7 presents the conceptual difference between the crushing pressure representation in this study and that in iacs rmrs nonstandard hull shapes and mhdm in the ductile regime the mechanics approach considers a trapezoidal pressure profile with a zone of the constant pressures over a certain region whereas the viscous extrusion approaches by kurdyumov and kheisin 1974 and by kennedy et al 1994 suggest a bell shaped pressure profiles when coupled with the structural design considerations e g for plate thickness design a localized loaded area is needed in the order of stiffener spacing squared deviations from a nonuniform distributions will be less significant over the smaller areas and if the peak pressures are not well pronounced over the loaded area like in the ductile regime the assumption of the uniform pressure profile is reasonable in addition kurdyumov and kheisn 1974 state that the pressure distribution in their model is close to uniform and it is reasonable to replace is with a constant pressure value in this study spalling of ice as a reduction in the contact area was not considered however experimental evidence e g glen and comfort 1983 suggests that the actual contact area reduces as the speed increases if this reduction is included in the mechanics model the average pressure will decrease at a faster rate with an increase in the contact area for higher velocities ductile ice strength depends on confinement and the loading rate the triaxial ductile compressive strength of columnar grained ice which possesses the s2 growth texture i e the across column compressive strength measured under biaxial compressive loading across the columns and compressive loading along the columns of ice whose crystallographic c axes are confined to the horizontal plane of the ice cover but randomly oriented within this plane is not affected by the along column stresses schulson and duval 2009 thus the assumption of a uniform pressure distribution over h i is reasonable the confined pressure value eq 4c incorporates the resistance to fast crack growth k ic which is derived from the assumption of the universal behavior of brittle materials in compression renshaw and schulson 2001 this assumption is not applicable to the region of very high confinement where plastic faulting operates the pressure value corresponds to a central zone of the ice s 0 1 m which is also similar to the minimum stiffener spacing value for smaller highly confined areas where plastic faulting is activated the experimental results jordaan 2001 show a maximum pressure of 50 mpa furthermore as the contact area tends to 0 the ice pressure has a physical limit that is equal to the theoretical ice strength of 0 1e where e is the young s modulus of ice since the theoretical strength of steel is higher than that of ice the latter will always fail first thus on very small contact areas order of mm mm pressures higher than σ peak can occur from a structural design point of view the minimum relevant area for local design is equal to the stiffener spacing squared this result is on the order of the sample size in the laboratory thus the pressure for a contact area of 0 1 0 1 m2 is unlikely to exceed that measured in the laboratory for freshwater granular nearly pure ice samples in fully confined conditions depending on the confinement the ductile to brittle transition of salt water ice at 10 c occurs at a strain rate of approximately 10 3 1 s schulson and duval 2009 which may be less than the assumed transition speed of 2 0 knots a reference strain rate v tr 4b for v tr 2 knots is between 8 10 4 and 5 10 3 depending on the ship s dimension b 300 m 50 m and assuming that it acts as a moving indenter under idealized conditions perfectly vertical structure uniform contact areas etc on the other hand a vessel is generally designed to move continuously at a minimum steady speed of approximately 2 0 knots at speeds less than 2 0 knots the maneuverability of a vessel in ice will be lost and the vessel can become stuck in the ice in the latter case the ice structure interaction is no longer governed by the vessel speed but is governed by the speed of the drifting ice the speed of the latter could be low enough to impart ductile behavior over a design area as the ice starts to build up around the vessel which creates biaxial loading conditions the presented model may be unconservative because it assumes that the ductile pressure is independent of the confinement as noted in schulson and duval 2009 the ductile to brittle transition occurs gradually rather than abruptly i e ductile to brittle transition occurs over a small range of strain rates instead of abruptly at a specific strain rate this occurrence is however not considered in detail furthermore we have assumed that there is no speed effect on σ duct a grain size dependent behavior is not considered the characteristic grain size is chosen to be 10 mm at least 10 grains across the highly confined region arguments for this choice is that grain size effects will be less pronounced at engineering scale m scale because of the imperfections internal cracks brine pockets and brine drainage channels temperature gradients snow cover etc the parameters for the ice mechanics approach except v tr and v ref are based on controlled laboratory and medium scale tests the ice pressure profile given by the mechanics approach represents the limit state of the ice qualitatively the results of this model agree with the experimental results of sodhi et al 1998 i e the local pressure σ peak is higher at higher speeds than at lower speeds whereas the average pressures can be higher in the ductile regime the results of the mechanics model in the ductile regime have been placed in the context of the dnv gl ice compression load amidships dnv gl as 2020 section 6 pt 4 8 refer to fig 8 for each polar class the design line load for vertical side shells was calculated assuming that a ship is trapped between moving ice floes fig 8 plots the load values as a function of the ice thickness factor in the ductile regime the functional dependency resembles that given by the dnv gl as however regarding the load magnitude the comparison is difficult because the pressure from the mechanics model was converted to a line load assuming that the actual load height scales are proportional to the ice thickness factors given in dnv gl section 6 pt 4 8 but the exact relationship is uncertain we evaluated the mechanics approach for different values of ductile to brittle transition speed v tr reference speed v ref and peak pressure σ peak the results are plotted in figs 3 5 and 6 the speed dependency given by the ice mechanics model is milder than that assumed in iacs especially for the higher ice classes pc2 and pc1 even with σ peak of 30 50 mpa which is three to five times greater than the level recorded in the laboratory on freshwater granular nearly pure ice samples in fully confined conditions the pressure values given by iacs section i2 3 2 2 for pc1 are higher refer to fig 6 comparison of pressures in the ductile regime with design pressures fig 6 indicates that smaller vessels with class below pc4 could receive side damage if they are stuck in ice because the slow loading from 0 0 upwards will yield a higher average pressure than assumed in the design to further investigate this scenario the value of the ductile strength would need an additional calibration in the above comparison it should be taken into account that the considered iacs requirements do not explicitly specify ice temperature nor distinguish between summer winter navigational seasons whereas the calculated pressures form the mechanics model was based on 10 c and may not include all the effects as the design formulations regarding the iacs process pressure area curve equation 1 β 10 1 flexural ice failure would have to be included in the mechanics model to further comment on the disparities observed in fig 4 the iacs pressure values for the nonbow areas shown in figs 5 and 6 which correspond to the higher ice classes pc2 and pc1 seems to be very uncertain when the speeds of the larger vessels are considered by imposing clear requirements that regulate the speeds of the vessel in ice the uncertainty that was applied to the ice loads could be reduced however an entire ship hull and flexural failure should be considered instead of focusing on a specific area crushing ice loads nonbow area iacs section i2 3 2 2 in this study 8 concluding remarks currently interpretations based on full scale data i e semi empirical approaches provide the best estimates of ice pressures on ship structures this study lays the foundation for how to address the uncertainty in the rule derived ice loads using the first principles of ice mechanics the focus has been the local ice crushing load in iacs nonbow areas the process pressure area relationship p p 0 a q q 0 1 p 0 depends on ice class and speed effects a pressure model was derived as a function of vessel speed and then plotted on the same figure as the pressure valued from the iacs approach the derived model is based on simplified principles of ice mechanics that are coupled with design considerations the main results of this study are summarized as follows within the dominating brittle and brittle like i e plastic faulting failure domain the mechanics model exhibits trends that are similar to those assumed by iacs i e increase in average pressure with increasing speed if ice failure against an inclined ship side is concerned the choice of q and p 0 appears to be reasonable the choice of the parameters in the iacs section i2 3 2 2 for nonbow areas including the area factors for higher ice classes is however highly uncertain especially for larger pc2 and pc1 vessels conversely the smaller ice class vessels pc4 could be prone to side damage if ductile behavior of ice occurs e g when the vessel is stuck in ice the presented approach could be expanded to other hull areas by accounting for flexural failure the approach is based on observations at loading speeds that are slower when compared to ship ice interactions despite a similar appearance of ice crushing processes in laboratory and in situ the presented approach could be refined in the future furthermore it could be interesting to investigate if a probabilistic approach to ice loads and or viscous extrusion approach could also be employed to address the uncertainty in the rule derived ice loads there is a need for full scale ice data collection programs that not only focus on ice loads and underlying ice parameters but also incorporate human aspects e g captain experience and decisions and seek their risky combinations w r t to vessel damage and the corresponding

20771,the wake vortices were manipulated by enclosing a bare circular cylinder with a screen shroud of porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 where β was defined as the ratio of the open area to the total area the diameter ratio between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder was fixed at 2 experiments were conducted in a water flume using particle image velocimetry at a reynolds number re d based on the bare cylinder diameter d of 1600 depending on the porosity of the screen shrouds the wake vortices were formed through two kinds of processes the first one was found for β 37 and 48 and was attributed to wake mode instability or absolute instability of the shear layers generated from the edge of the screen shrouds the bleeding flow from the gap between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder delayed the interactions between the shear layers and elongated the vortex formation length the second one was found for β 61 and 67 and was associated to the merging of the shear layer vortices originated from the edge of the screen shroud with the vortices shed from the bare cylinder due to the gap flow the latter was due to absolute instability caused by the reverse flow immediately downstream of the bare cylinder the vortices in the combined shear layers grew in size through merging and engulfing processes and were finally shed in the wake due to convective instability it was also found that the existence of the screen shroud attenuated the strength of the vortices and weakened the reynolds stresses in the wake keywords circular cylinder wake piv screen shroud vortex shedding 1 introduction vortex shedding occurs when fluid flows over a cylindrical structure at a sufficiently high reynolds number re u l ν where u is the freestream velocity l the characteristic length and ν the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the shedding of vortices causes a time dependent pressure distribution around the structure and hence the time dependent drag and lift forces if the frequencies of the forces are close to the natural frequency of the structure resonance will occur causing the structure to vibrate commonly termed as vortex induced vibration viv the viv may lead to fatigue damages to structures which is one of the most common failure modes of structures therefore the control of vortex shedding from cylindrical structures plays a significant role in extending the fatigue life of structures over the past decades both active and passive methods have been proposed to control vortex shedding active controls involve external energy such as using acoustic excitation huang 1996 synthetic jets feng and wang 2010 and plasma actuators bhattacharya and gregory 2015a 2015b 2018 2020 bhattacharya and gregory 2015a used segmented dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma actuators installed on a circular cylinder at 80 from the front stagnation point to control the wake of a circular cylinder it was found that the high power forcing severely weakens the vortex shedding elongated the formation length and significantly reduced the drag forces the effects of segmented plasma were further verified by joshi and bhattacharya 2019 through large eddy simulation les passive controls do not involve external energy but are accomplished through manipulating the surface of the structure such as using helical strakes zhou et al 2011 and fin shaped strips zhu and zhou 2019 zhu et al 2020 they are attractive due to easy implementation especially for hash environments but may be limited in narrow operation ranges detailed reviews of the control techniques can be found in choi et al 2008 as one of the passive methods porous shrouds have been demonstrated effective in suppressing flow induced forces and viv responses the first extensive study where the perforated shrouds with circular holes of various porosity were utilised to cover a bare cylinder was reported by price 1956 the diameter ratio of the shroud to the inner bare cylinder was 1 25 price 1956 found that the existence of the shrouds could effectively suppress the maximum vibration amplitude for shrouds with a porosity of 37 the ones with hole arrangement parallel and perpendicular to the axis were more effective than the one with a 45 tilt hole row arrangement it was also found that the shrouds induced numerous small vortices downstream of the holes therefore the vortex shedding of a cylinder with the periodic asymmetry was alleviated additionally the forced mixing in the inner passage between the shroud and the inner cylinder limited the development of the vortices zdravkovich 1981 studied the vortex shedding suppression of different porous shrouds the results showed that all the shrouds had a similar inhibitory effect on viv with the square hole shroud being only slightly better than that of the round hole shroud screen shrouds of high porosity of 67 and 72 at gap ratios of 2 0 and 1 25 respectively were tested for viv suppression and the results showed that the vibration amplitude was reduced by about 78 and 50 respectively azmi et al 2012 2015 whereas it is straightforward and relevant to explore the mechanism of viv reduction through the study of the wake structures of a vibrating screen shrouded cylinder it is also pertinent to examine the flow structures and vortex characteristics of a stationary one especially their dependence on the porosity of the screen to our best knowledge only a limited number of studies were reported in the literature oruc 2012 investigated the flow characteristics of a cylinder surrounded by a streamlined screen with a porosity of 50 it was found that the existence of the screen shroud could effectively suppress vortex shedding compared to a bare cylinder unfortunately a streamlined shape could only work in a unidirectional manner ozkan et al 2012 extended the above study by using a circular screen shroud with the outer to inner diameter ratio of 1 2 2 and the porosity of 40 70 the results showed that the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses could be reduced remarkably as a result of restraining the vortex street formation it was found that the interaction between the shear layers of the inner cylinder was impeded this result was supported by durhasan et al 2019 who studied the flow characteristics behind a bare cylinder by adding a perforated cylinder with circular holes for inner to outer diameter ratio ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 azmi and zhou 2018 tested the combined effect of porosity and wire diameters of various screen shrouds in the wake of a bare cylinder for two different diameter ratios it was found that the ratio of 2 0 was more effective than 1 6 in extending the formation region the main objective of this study is to shed some new light on vortex formation and wake characteristics and their dependence on porosity of a screen shrouded cylinder at a fixed diameter ratio d d of 2 hereafter d and d are the diameters of the inner bare cylinder and the outer screen shroud respectively for this purpose screen shrouds with porosities of 37 48 61 and 67 were constructed the flow structures in the near wake region were examined using piv and the results were then compared with that of a bare cylinder wake 2 experimental details experiments were conducted at the middle section of the water flume located at the university of western australia fig 1 the dimensions of the flume are 400 mm width 500 mm height 15 m length and the freestream turbulent intensity of the test section is less than 2 high quality transparent glass windows were opened on both sides and bottom of the water flume to facilitate laser illumination and camera shooting the bare cylinder was made of a polished aluminium tube with a diameter d 10 mm and a length of 400 mm the screen shrouds were made of stainless steel meshes with porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 table 1 which were enfolded into a cylindrical form the porosity β a 2 a t 2 where a is the aperture and t is the wire diameter is defined as the ratio of void area to the total area of the mesh the diameter of the screen shroud d is 20 mm details of the fabrication process of the screen shrouds can be found on sun et al 2020 the freestream velocity was set at 0 16 m s corresponding to re d 1600 the choice of such a reynolds number is a compromise of the cylinder diameter due to blockage effect an improved spatial resolution for piv measurements and the concern of possible deformation of the screen cylinders under relatively large hydrodynamic forces at high reynolds numbers to eliminate the boundary layer effect from the bottom surface a 4 mm transparent perspex plate was placed 80 mm above the flume base to allow the redevelopment of the boundary layer the laser was shot horizontally about 11d away from both the free surface and the transparent perspex plate and the high speed camera was located at the bottom of the flume thus the free surface reflection and the end effect could be ignored in order to strengthen and mount the screen shroud a 3d printed hollow tube with an inner diameter of 10 5 mm and an outer diameter of 19 5 mm was inserted between the shroud and the bare cylinder a 5 mm thickness piece was cut from this hollow tube and was glued onto the transparent perspex supporting plate as a stopper to fix the other end of the shroud the above procedures prevent not only the movement of the shrouded cylinder but also the deformation of the shroud finally the shrouded cylinder was firmly fixed to a wooden frame through two pipe clips the pipe clips with a diameter of 20 mm could hold the model perfectly without being squeezed and the wooden frame was rigidly mounted to the flume walls on both sides of the flume a 5 w continuous wave argo ion laser was used to illuminate the flow and the thickness of the laser sheet was about 1 mm water was seeded with synthetic polycrystalline particles with diameters of 1 5 μm the particles had a density close to that of water and could be suspended and distributed evenly in the flume for at least a few hours images were captured using a high speed camera photron fastcam sa3 at a frame rate of 250 fps through a nikon lens af s 50 mm f 1 4 g with a resolution of 1024 768 pixels the shutter speed was 1 ms overall about 14 500 instantaneous flow fields were captured continuously which was equivalent to about 180 shedding cycles for the bare cylinder and 90 cycles for the screen shrouded cylinders using the open source piv tool in matlab namely pivlab the instantaneous displacements of particles were obtained through the frame to frame cross correlation algorithm thielicke and stamhuis 2014 before further analysis of the images a high pass filter was employed to highlight the particles and remove any uneven light in the background thus the instantaneous velocity and vorticity could be determined the images were taken over an area of 130 mm length 97 5 mm width two interrogation window sizes were selected based on the particle density and displacement the initial and the final interrogation window sizes were 32 32 and 16 16 pixels respectively and the overlap ratio was set to 50 the normalised median test was applied to select the outliers and the 3 3 neighbourhood interpolation method was adopted to replace the outliers in general less than 2 of the vectors had been removed with the current setting about 12065 vectors 127 95 were generated for each image the spatial resolution of the grid in both horizontal and vertical directions was about 1 mm the measurement uncertainty was less than 0 01 pixel based on the particle diameter and particle density according to raffel et al 2018 the uncertainty of the particle displacement in x and y directions was less than 0 1 pixel for an image magnification of 0 127 mm pixel the uncertainties of velocity and vorticity could be estimated at 3 and 5 respectively lourenco and krothapalli 1995 it needs to be noted that spectral attenuation using piv similar to that of hot wire techniques cannot be avoided especially when measuring small scale turbulence or velocity derivatives lavoie et al 2007 the above uncertainties do not include the finite resolution effects on spectral attenuation using piv for turbulence measurements lavoie et al 2007 suggested that an interrogation window of width less than or equal to 5η would be required for the small scale statistics to be measured with less than 30 attenuations where η ν 3 ε 1 4 is the kolmogorov length scale and ε is the mean turbulent energy dissipation rate and can be approximated by ε 15 ν u x 2 based on the isotropic assumption hereafter angular brackets denote time averaging this result is similar to that previously reported by zhou et al 2003 for hot wire measurements who suggested that to measure the small scale turbulence properly i e the velocity gradients vorticity and turbulent energy dissipation rate the wire separation needs to be in the range of 3 5η a larger separation will result in a more significant spectral attenuation whereas a smaller separation will result in overestimation of the velocity derivatives due to noise contamination it has been calculated that η is in the range between 0 17 and 0 2 mm in the wakes of the present study depending on the location in the wake as the resolution for the piv analysis is 1 mm 1 mm this corresponds to 5 9η 5η which is better than that used by lavoie et al 2007 but exceeds the suggested range 5 η by about 20 as mentioned by lavoie et al 2007 a relatively coarse resolution of a piv is somewhat typical of this technique where the scale resolution is a trade off between zooming the image onto a small area to resolve small scale motion which can lead to a loss of global information and increases noise e g saarenrinne and piirto 2000 and capturing the region of the flow field that includes all relevant scales e g poelma et al 2006 based on the results of lavoie et al 2007 the root mean square rms values of the velocity fluctuations in the present study are attenuated by 3 2 for a resolution of 5 9η 5η whereas the rms values of the velocity derivatives are attenuated by about 19 15 these results are also consistent with that reported by zhu and antonia 1996 for small scale turbulence measurements using hot wire arrays 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake vortex structures the wake vortex structures in the near region x 10 of various cylinders are first examined to illustrate the formation of the vortical structures hereafter a superscript asterisk represents normalisation with the diameter of the bare cylinder d and or the freestream velocity fig 2 compares the time averaged streamlines for both the bare cylinder and various screen shrouded cylinders they are generally symmetric about the wake centreline for the bare cylinder wake fig 2a the streamlines show a small recirculation zone over 0 5 x 2 4 where the reverse flow is obvious two focal points are identified at x 1 9 on both sides of the wake with a separation l y 0 8d and one saddle point is identified at x 2 4 on the centreline i e l x 2 4d these results are in agreement with those reported by feng and wang 2010 at re 950 there are a few ways to define the vortex formation length for example zdravkovich 1997 defined the distance from the cylinder center to the location where the mean velocity u 0 whereas williamson 1996 defined the location where the rms values of the streamwise velocity is the largest the saddle point is also used by researchers to determine the vortex formation length e g aydin and ekmekci 2013 gao et al 2019 from fig 2a the vortex formation length as defined by l x agrees well with those defined later by the zero mean velocity and the maximum rms values of the stream velocity for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the widths between the focal points are expanded to l y 1 8d and 2 0d respectively which are approximately twice the width of the bare cylinder as shown in fig 2b and c indicating that these focal points are associated with the screen shrouds also the focal points are located at about x 4 2 and 5 2 for β 37 and 48 which are about 2 2 and 2 7 times that of the bare cylinder wake in addition the saddle points for both cases shift downstream to x 6 and 9 respectively corresponding to a formation length l x 6d and 9d i e about 2 4 and 3 6 times that of the bare cylinder wake there is no doubt that although the kármán vortex streets are very similar among the bare cylinder and the shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the size of the recirculation zone has been increased significantly however if the diameter of the screen shroud d is used for normalisation the widths of the focal points for both cases is comparable to that of the bare cylinder it is also worth pointing out that sun et al 2020 studied the wake structures of the screen cylinders without the inner cylinder used in this study under a comparable re it was shown that the screen cylinders with β 37 and 48 had recirculation zones x d 3 and 4 respectively similar to that of the shrouded cylinders of the same porosity the findings of the two studies indicate that the contribution to wake formation by the inner bare cylinder is negligible this is because most of the flow cannot pass through the screen shrouds due to the low porosity as a result the shroud itself perform as a bluff body since the diameter of the shroud is twice that of the bare cylinder the recirculation region formed is apparently enlarged when the porosity is increased further to 61 and 67 the patterns of the streamlines are changed apparently as shown in fig 2d and e the saddle point for β 61 shifts farther away from the cylinders to around x 10 corresponding to l x 10d the focal points move significantly upstream to x 2 2 and the separation between them reduces back to l y 1 0d which is similar to that for a bare cylinder fig 2a clearly these focal points are associated with the inner bare cylinder for the 67 screen shrouded cylinder unfortunately due to the limited viewing window size and the expected spatial resolution the maximum downstream location can only be achieved at x 10 as a result the saddle point which may exist after x 10 cannot be identified moreover the focal points caused by the inner cylinder can be identified in fig 2e at x 1 5 and the separation between them reduces back to l y 0 8d which is the same as that for a bare cylinder wake fig 2a given a relatively high porosity of the screen a certain amount of fluid can pass through the shroud directly thus these focal points are generated due to wake instability from the inner bare cylinder the values of l x and l y for different screen porosity are summarised in fig 2f as the magnitudes of l x and l y differ by one order different ordinates have been used for them in the figure the variation of l y with the increase of β may suggest different vortex formation mechanisms for different screen shrouded cylinders to demonstrate further the differences in vortex formation processes for different cylinders the time averaged topologies of the spanwise vorticity ω z v x u y are shown in fig 3 for the bare cylinder wake in fig 3a the two shear layers are symmetric about the centreline and disappear at about x 3 consistent with that reported by dong et al 2006 at re 3900 for β 37 and 48 the two shear layers are extended and separated apart significantly in fig 3b and c as they are generated from the edges of the screen shrouds there are no apparent vortical structures in the gap between the two shear layers which may be referred to the low vorticity region in the core in contrast for β 61 and 67 fig 3d and e another two shear layers inner vortices can be identified immediately downstream of the screen shrouds they are generated by the bare cylinder due to the fluid passing through the gap between the two cylinders further downstream the inner vortices gradually merge with those generated by the outer screen cylinders it is also interesting to note that the magnitude of the inner vortices increases monotonically with the increase of the porosity it can therefore be concluded that for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the wake vortices are generated by the shear layers originating from the screen shrouds whereas for β 61 and 67 the formation of the wake vortices involves the merging process of vortices generated by the inner bare cylinder with those in the shear layers generated by the screen shrouds 3 2 turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses the contours of the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke are presented in fig 4 following feng and wang 2010 the tke is defined as 0 75 u 2 v 2 where u and v are the velocity fluctuations in the x and y directions respectively and the superscript prime represents the rms values for the bare cylinder wake in fig 4a tke starts to increase and reaches its peak value of 0 22 at x 2 4 and then decreases gradually this result as well as the peak value is consistent with previous results reported by feng and wang 2010 at re 950 the contours of tke for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 4b and c resemble that of the bare cylinder except that the overall patterns shift further downstream and become wider the peak values occur at x 6 and 9 respectively with the increase in porosity the maximum contour values reduce gradually from 0 19 to 0 13 representing a reduction of 14 and 41 compared with that of the bare cylinder given the broad range of the tke contours for β 37 and 48 it can be inferred that the wakes are generated by the screen shrouds for these two porosities for β 61 and 67 the tke contours depict a novel pattern overall the maximum contour value of tke decreases with the increase of β it seems that the tke contours can be divided into two regions with the first region being from 0 5 x 5 and the second from 5 x 10 in the first region the maximum is generated by the inner bare cylinder as the width of the tke contours is narrow this result is more evident in fig 4e than that in fig 4d within the first region the tke contours resemble those of the bare cylinder with a maximum value of 0 043 at x 2 this value is only about 1 5 of the later as shown in fig 4a after reaching its peak the tke dissipates gradually till x 5 when the porosity of the screen shroud is large a considerable portion of the fluid can pass through and interact with the inner bare cylinder forming a wake structure for the second region the width of the tke contours is increased and another maximum with its shape resembles that of β 37 and 48 can be identified therefore it can be concluded that the formation of the second tke region is due to the external screen shrouds a similar flow pattern was also reported by fu and rockwell 2005 for flow past a circular cylinder with a bleeding slot in the centre the contours of the reynolds normal stresses u u and v v are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively for u u double peaks are identified at y 0 4 and x 2 1 whereas the single peak of v v occurs at x 2 4 corresponding well to the vortex formation length l x it is undeniable that the peak value of u u precedes the peak value of v v which is consistent with the existing literature i e dong et al 2006 feng and wang 2010 ozkan et al 2012 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the patterns of the contours of u u are similar to that of the bare cylinder wake except that their sizes expand and the locations of the maxima move both further downstream and away from the centreline occurring at about y 1 the latter result indicates that the vortex structures are generated from the shear layers of the screen shrouds the downstream movement of the maxima from x 5 for β 37 to x 8 for β 48 reflects the effect of shroud porosity on vortex formation length similar trends of the contours for v v can also be found and the maximum contour values for β 37 and 48 can be identified at x 6 and 9 respectively which are consistent with the formation length l x discussed in sec 3 1 in addition the two region scenarios of the contours of u u and v v can also be found for β 61 and 67 with the first region being associated with the shedding from the inner bare cylinder and the second with the shedding from the screen cylinders furthermore for these two porosities the peak values of both reynolds normal stresses decrease by more than one order compared with that of β 37 and 48 the contours of the reynolds shear stress u u are shown in fig 7 the solid and dashed lines indicate positive and negative values respectively four lobes can be identified in the near wake region of the bare cylinder fig 7a with the two smaller lobes located at x 1 8 and y 0 25 they have a low magnitude indicating that the correlation between u and v is low the two large lobes centred at x 2 4 and y 0 4 have maximum levels of 0 06 both the contour patterns and the levels are consistent with previous studies by dong et al 2006 who studied the near wake structures of a circular cylinder using experimental as well as numerical methods at re 3900 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 7b and c the contour patterns are similar to that of the bare cylinder for β 37 the two smaller lobes are located at x 4 8 and y 0 5 besides the two larger lobes can be seen clearly in both cases with the peaks occurring at y 0 8 it is worth mentioning that the y locations for both the smaller lobes and the larger lobes are twice the value found in the bare cylinder wake indicating that the vortices are generated from the shear layers of the screen shrouds what is more the peak value in the bare cylinder wake appears at x 2 4 for the screen shroud with β 37 however the peak location moves downstream to x 6 as the porosity is increased further to 48 the peak occurs at x 9 these peak locations are consistent with the vortex formation length l x discussed previously compared with the bare cylinder wake the maximum contour levels for u v are significantly reduced by 17 and 33 for β 37 and 48 respectively a remarkable reduction in u v could be the reason why the two smaller lobes disappear when β 48 under the same contour increment as the porosity is increased to 61 and 67 the patterns of u v are changed significantly even though there are still four lobes in the wake they are not arranged in the same way as those for the bare and the 37 screen shrouded cylinder wakes for the bare cylinder wake there is one positive and one negative lobe on each side of the wake as shown in fig 7a and b nevertheless for the 61 and 67 screen shrouded cylinders the two negative or positive lobes are all located on the upper or lower side in fig 7d and e this is because the two negative or positive lobes come from different shear layers the smaller one comes from the inner cylinder whereas the larger one comes from the outer shroud this is also supported by the centre of y the centres of the two smaller lobes from the inner cylinder are located approximately at y 0 4 for β 61 and 67 while for the larger lobes from the outer shroud they are at y 0 7 lastly compared with the bare cylinder the maximum magnitudes of u v for β 61 and 67 drop by 40 and 58 respectively 3 3 spanwise vorticity and energy spectra to understand the wake vortex formation processes the contours of the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z are shown in fig 8 for the bare cylinder wake fig 8a the kármán vortex structures are apparent with vortices being shed alternatively from both sides of the cylinder the maximum and minimum contour levels are 3 5 and 3 5 and the two vortex streets interact with each other at about x 2 4 these results agree well with the previous literature e g sumer and fredsøe 2006 zdravkovich 1997 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the shear layers are originated from the edge of the screen shroud they are elongated and interact with each other at x 6 and 9 respectively forming the kármán vortex structures similar to that of the bare cylinder but with larger size fig 8b and c the lengths of the shear layers on both sides of the screen cylinder are longer than those of the bare cylinder prior to the formation of the kármán vortex streets the two shear layers are separated by a low vorticity region similar to a buffer zone this phenomenon illustrates that the kármán vortex streets are generated directly by the screen shrouds but the bleed flow within the shroud prevents the shear layer from interactions thus delaying the development of the wake vortices compared with the bare cylinder wake the maximum magnitudes of the vortices are reduced by approximately 14 and 29 to 3 and 2 5 for β 37 and 48 respectively for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 fig 8d and e the contours show a different structure the small scale kelvin helmholtz vortices can be identified clearly in the two parallel shear layers originated directly from the edges of the screen shrouds in between the shear layers the buffer zone found in the 37 and 48 screen shrouded cylinder wakes no longer exists instead vortices generated from the bare cylinder due to the gap flow and penetrate the screen shrouds can be seen clearly they merge quickly with the outer shear layers as evolving downstream for β 61 fig 8d the maximum and minimum magnitude of vortices are approximately 2 which are about 57 lower than those of the bare cylinder with the increase of porosity to 67 the maximum contour values of vortices reduce further to 1 6 which are less than half of the figures for the bare cylinder to further illustrate the vortical merging processes downstream of the 67 screen shrouded cylinder five instantaneous snapshots are shown in fig 9 they are selected from one cycle at different phases based on the vortices shed by the inner cylinder and the time delay between the instances is 0 08 s which is equivalent to 1 4 shedding periods at instant a fig 9a there are two vortices a and b shed by the inner bare cylinder over the range of x 1 2 4 besides the two parallel shear layers originating from the screen shroud with some smaller vortices can also be found at y 1 or y d 0 5 over x 1 10 at instant b the sizes of both vortices a and b become larger and move closer to the upper and lower outer shear layers respectively when evolving downstream at instant c vortex a merges into the lower shear layer and vortex b is convected further downstream in the wake a new vortex vortex c is then shed from the bare cylinder at instant d vortex b becomes a free vortex and moves both downstream and upwards with the fluid whereas vortex a now merges into the shear layer located on the lower side meanwhile vortex c grows in size and another vortex vortex d starts growing at instance e vortex b moves closer to the upper shear layer and begins the amalgamation process while vortex a is completely swallowed by the lower shear layer and is almost unrecognisable both vortex c and vortex d grow in sizes and the latter starts to detach from the screen shroud this process continues and each time when a new vortex is shed on one side of the cylinder a detached free vortex is swallowed into the shear layer on the other side the vortex shedding frequency for various cylinder wakes is analysed by conducting fast fourier transform fft of the transverse velocity signals obtained at y 0 5 and the results are shown in fig 10 the peak frequencies represent the strouhal number namely s t f d u where f is the shedding frequency for the bare cylinder wake fig 10a there is a dominant peak at st 0 205 regardless of the downstream location the narrow and sharp peak is consistent with the previous publications of a circular cylinder at the subcritical flow regime i e chen et al 2017 sumer and fredsøe 2006 zdravkovich 1997 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 10b and c the values of st reduce significantly to 0 085 and 0 083 which are less than half of the bare cylinder if the shedding frequencies were normalised by the diameter of the screen shroud d 20 mm the strouhal numbers would equal to 0 170 and 0 166 for β 37 and 48 respectively which are close to the values obtained for the same 37 and 48 screen cylinders sun et al 2020 this result seems to suggest that when β 37 and 48 the vortices in the screen shrouded cylinder wakes are generated by the shrouds rather than the inner bare cylinder for β 37 an apparent peak cannot be found until x 4 while for β 48 the dominant peak appears after x 6 this result demonstrates the delay in the formation of vortices as mentioned earlier furthermore the peak frequencies are constant along the flow direction indicating the formation of the traditional kármán vortex structures e g bearman 1965 sumer and fredsøe 2006 when β 61 fig 10d two peaks at st 0 105 and 0 191 can be identified over the range of x 2 4 with the first one being dominant the second smaller peak st 0 191 disappears at x 6 similarly two different peaks can also be identified for β 67 fig 10e at st 0 096 and 0 189 over the range of x 2 6 with the second one being more apparent than that for β 61 fig 10d recalling the contours for vorticity and reynolds stresses discussed in secs 3 1 and 3 2 two distinct shear layers were identified behind the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 fig 8d and f one is initiated by the inner bare cylinder while the other is initiated by the screen shroud the double peaks corresponding to different shear layers on the spectra support the existence of the vortices in these shear layers it can be conjectured that the vortices corresponding to the higher st 0 189 are formed by the inner bare cylinder as the strouhal value is closer to the value of the bare cylinder itself the lower st 0 096 is associated with the outer screen shroud at x 8 the peak corresponding to the higher st 0 189 disappears indicating that vortices formed by the inner cylinder are synchronised by the outer vortices fig 11 shows the conceptual model of the vortex formation for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes with β 37 and 67 the lateral velocity signals v and their corresponding spectra at different locations x 2 4 and 8 and y 0 5 and 1 are also shown to illustrate the different characteristics of the shear layer vortices the locations y 0 5 and 1 correspond to the inner and outer shear layers respectively for β 37 fig 11a at x 2 the velocity fluctuation is very small at both y 0 5 and 1 and no peak can be identified on the energy spectra especially for the inner cylinder at x 4 the velocity fluctuation becomes apparent with a regular pattern and a single peak st 0 085 is identified on the spectra referring to the vorticity contours discussed previously the large scale structures in the outer shear layers start to interact across the wake centreline forming the large scale vortices at a further downstream location x 8 the velocity signals fluctuate more significantly and the energy level on the spectra at the strouhal frequency st 0 085 has been doubled that at x 4 it is because at this location the large scale structures have been formed completely as shown in fig 3b examining the streamwise variation of the mean velocity on the wake centreline fig 12 f it can be found that similar to the bare cylinder wake the β 37 screen shrouded cylinder wake also has reverse flow with the minimum velocity occurring at x 4 8 therefore the formation of the vortices of the screen shrouded cylinder with β 37 is due to absolute instability the existence of the screen shroud elongates the recirculation region due to the bleeding flow from the gap between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder it has been widely accepted that the formation of the kármán vortices in the near wake of a bare cylinder is due to absolute instability i e oertel 1990 huerre and monkewitz 1990 hudy et al 2007 wee et al 2004 stated that absolute instability was most likely to originate in a region with the strongest back flow for a two stream mixing layer huerre and monkewitz 1985 found that it was absolutely unstable when the velocity ratio defined as the velocity of one freestream divided by that of another freestream was less than 0 136 for β 67 fig 11b the small scale vortices in the shear layers generated at the mesh edge due to kelvin helmholtz k h instability grow in size through vortex merging as evolving downstream where two adjacent vortices spin around each other come closer and then merge downstream of the inner bare cylinder vortices are also formed due to the fluid bleeding through the gaps they merge with the outer shear layers as evolving downstream at about x 4 fig 4e at x 2 the velocity signals show weaker fluctuation in the outer shear layers y 1 than that in the inner y 0 5 where a negative mean transverse velocity based on the signals is obtained resulting in a movement of the vortices to the former shear layers whereas there is only one peak at y 1 double peaks are identified at y 0 5 with the first one representing the dominate wake frequency the second one is in support of the existence of the vortices shed from the inner cylinder this result is in apparent difference with that for the 37 screen shrouded cylinder at x 4 the velocity fluctuations are much lower and double peaks are also identified at both y 0 5 and 1 on the spectra this is because the vortices shed from the inner bare cylinder merge into the outer shear layer it is worth mentioning that the velocity signal at this location is more like a combination of two sine waves with different amplitudes and frequencies further downstream at x 8 the velocity signals depict regular fluctuations similar to a sine wave and the higher shedding frequency disappears on the spectra at both locations as a result of the amalgamation process of the inner vortices with the outer shear layers there is no doubt that the shear layers generated by the bare cylinder fig 11b can be identified as wake instability or the so called absolute instability as reflected by the flow inflection downstream of it fig 12f where the minimum velocity is identified at x 1 5 in an absolute instability the temporal turbulence can be spread out and eventually grow exponentially everywhere however the two parallel shear layers generated by the screen shroud can be classified as the convective instability as the k h vortices are swept downstream and yet still developing in size by engulfing the ambient fluid and vortex merging what is more the mean velocity downstream of the inner bare cylinder increase gradually all the way towards the end of the piv view window and no flow inflection is identified this phenomenon is consistent with the classification of the convective instability i e huerre and monkewitz 1985 wee et al 2004 according to huerre and monkewitz 1990 for homogeneous jets flow a combination of absolute instability and convective instability the convective instability can be preserved over the entire field but the absolute instability can easily be destabilised it is also worth mentioning that the strouhal numbers for the 61 and 67 screen shrouded cylinders keep constant in the flow direction this is apparently different from what have been found for screen cylinder wakes with β 61 and 67 sun et al 2020 where the strouhal numbers keep decreasing with the increase of x due to the merging and tripling of the shear layer vortices suggesting different vortex formation mechanism after the introduction of the inner bare cylinder 3 4 velocity profiles the mean streamwise velocity profiles at different downstream locations are shown in fig 12 for the bare cylinder wake fig 12a the profile at x 2 changes sharply over y 0 7 it is negative around the centreline indicating a reverse flow which is consistent with the results found from the streamlines and the vector plots figs 2a and 3a at x 4 the velocity on the centreline increases significantly to 0 65 suggesting that the formation length l x is between x 2 4 if the vortex formation length l x is defined as the distance from the centre of the cylinder to the location where u u 0 it is found that l x 2 4 fig 12f this result agrees well with that reported previously at a comparable reynolds number e g williamson 1996 for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes depending on the porosity of the screen shrouds two kinds of mean velocity trends can be identified one for β 37 and 48 and the other for β 61 and 67 for β 37 and 48 at x 2 fig 12b and c the shear layers corresponding to y 1 1 5 are narrow and separated by a region with essentially very low velocity due to less fluid penetration as a result the velocity gradients in the shear layer are large for β 37 the values of u u are negative from x 2 to x 6 illustrating an elongated vortex formation length in contrast for β 48 the values of u u are close to 0 in the central area at x 2 indicating that the reverse flow has not yet started when the flow moves downstream to x 4 8 u u becomes negative and the reverse flow occurs in fig 12f the formation lengths l x for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 extend substantially about 6 and 9 respectively the velocity profiles for β 61 and 67 show a totally different trend fig 12d and e the gradients on both sides of the cylinders are smaller than that in figs 12b and c and remain unchanged over x 2 8 indicating that the shear layers do not diffuse significantly as convecting downstream for β 61 the values of u u at y 0 3 are less than 0 over the entire range x 2 10 indicating an extension in the formation length in contrast the negative value of u u for β 67 can only be found at x 2 after that it increases slowly along the flow direction according to fig 12f the formation length l x of vortices generated by the inner cylinder for β 67 equals 2 which is comparable to that of the bare cylinder proving that the inner bare cylinder forms these vortices figs 13 and 14 show the variation of u and v the values of u show a twin peak distribution at y 0 5 for the bare cylinder wake within the range of x 2 8 the peak values reveal a decreasing trend along the streamwise direction as the shear layers dissipate in contrast the values of v fig 14a depict a narrow peak at x 2 near the central region indicating that the shear layers have merged together and formed a single vortex street from x 4 to 8 the peaks become broader and show a decreasing trend as the turbulence intensities drop with the flow in addition the formation length l x defined as the distance between the centre of the cylinder and the peak values of u and v also equals 2 4 figs 13f and 14f for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 compared with the bare cylinder wake the values of u and v are much smaller at x 2 and the twin peaks are further apart occurring at y 1 2 indicating that the dominant shear layers are at the edge of the screen shrouds with very limited penetrating flow along the streamwise direction the increasing trends of u and v indicate the development of the wake vortex structures till x 6 and 8 for β 37 and 48 respectively this scenario also proves a delay in the vortex formation for β 37 the twin peak distribution at x 4 and the single peak distribution at x 6 of v fig 14b indicate the development and merging processes of the shear layers compared with the bare cylinder wake the formation lengths for β 37 and 48 increase to l x 6 and 9 figs 13f and 14f respectively the distributions of u and v for β 61 and 67 present a different trend in both cases twin peaks for u can be found at x 2 and y 0 5 indicating that these shear layers are generated by the inner cylinder further away from the cylinder the two peaks of u spread out towards y 1 and their magnitudes increase gradually due to the shear layers of the screen shroud these trends are consistent with the development and merging of the shear layers generated by the inner cylinder with those by the outer shrouds interestingly the variation of v for β 67 fig 14e indicates that there are apparent vortices formed immediately downstream of the cylinder due to the single peak at x 2 however further downstream at x 4 8 the twin peaks in v with increasing magnitudes as evolving downstream suggest that another vortex structure is developing it is certain that the former comes from the inner cylinder while the latter is associated with the outer shroud also the turbulence immediately behind the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 is weakened significantly compared with that of the bare cylinder wake the streamwise evolution of u u u and v figs 12f 13f and 14f are all consistent with that revealed by the contours in terms of vortex formation lengths l x for various wakes discussed above 4 conclusions in this study wake characteristics of a circular cylinder concentrically enclosed inside a screen shroud with porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 are studied using piv at a reynolds number of 1600 the main aim is to understand the effect of the screen shrouds on the formation of the wake vortex structures and its dependence on porosity at a fixed diameter ratio of 2 two different wake development processes are identified the first process is associated with wake instability or the so called absolute instability for absolute instability it is characterised by an inflection flow in the near wake and the turbulence can diffuse and eventually contaminate the entire wake this process can also be found for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes with β 37 and 48 as the shear layers initiated at the edge of the screen interact with each other in the near wake region the second process is related to a combination of absolute instability and convective instability for the screen shrouds with β 61 and 67 due to the increase of porosity more fluid can pass through the gap between the bare cylinder and the screen shroud as a result two different kinds of vortices are generated which are reflected by the double peaks on the energy spectra the vortices shed from the inner cylinder are due to absolute instability as reflected by the flow inflection over x 2 4 they are much weaker in magnitude than that of the bare cylinder itself as propagating downstream they move away from the wake centreline and merge into the shear layers generated by the screen shrouds where the vortices grow in size as swept away downstream therefore the development of the wake vortices further downstream is associated with convective instability and the wake is then dominated by the parallel shear layers originated from the edge of the screen shrouds more evidence exists on both the tke and reynold stress contours which can be divided into two regions namely 0 5 x 5 and 5 x 10 for the different wake conditions based on the statistical results the peak values for vorticity tke and reynolds stresses in the screen shrouded cylinder wakes are lower than those in the bare cylinder wake with the increase in porosity these values depict a decreasing trend indicating that the vortex structures are weakened for example for β 48 and 67 the maximum values of tke are only 3 5 and 1 5 of the bare cylinder respectively the former can restrain the reynolds shear stress by 33 whereas the latter has a reduction of 58 in a nutshell the present results clearly show that the screen shroud can inhibit the formation and weaken the strength of the vortical structures credit authorship contribution statement chenlin sun

20771,the wake vortices were manipulated by enclosing a bare circular cylinder with a screen shroud of porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 where β was defined as the ratio of the open area to the total area the diameter ratio between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder was fixed at 2 experiments were conducted in a water flume using particle image velocimetry at a reynolds number re d based on the bare cylinder diameter d of 1600 depending on the porosity of the screen shrouds the wake vortices were formed through two kinds of processes the first one was found for β 37 and 48 and was attributed to wake mode instability or absolute instability of the shear layers generated from the edge of the screen shrouds the bleeding flow from the gap between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder delayed the interactions between the shear layers and elongated the vortex formation length the second one was found for β 61 and 67 and was associated to the merging of the shear layer vortices originated from the edge of the screen shroud with the vortices shed from the bare cylinder due to the gap flow the latter was due to absolute instability caused by the reverse flow immediately downstream of the bare cylinder the vortices in the combined shear layers grew in size through merging and engulfing processes and were finally shed in the wake due to convective instability it was also found that the existence of the screen shroud attenuated the strength of the vortices and weakened the reynolds stresses in the wake keywords circular cylinder wake piv screen shroud vortex shedding 1 introduction vortex shedding occurs when fluid flows over a cylindrical structure at a sufficiently high reynolds number re u l ν where u is the freestream velocity l the characteristic length and ν the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the shedding of vortices causes a time dependent pressure distribution around the structure and hence the time dependent drag and lift forces if the frequencies of the forces are close to the natural frequency of the structure resonance will occur causing the structure to vibrate commonly termed as vortex induced vibration viv the viv may lead to fatigue damages to structures which is one of the most common failure modes of structures therefore the control of vortex shedding from cylindrical structures plays a significant role in extending the fatigue life of structures over the past decades both active and passive methods have been proposed to control vortex shedding active controls involve external energy such as using acoustic excitation huang 1996 synthetic jets feng and wang 2010 and plasma actuators bhattacharya and gregory 2015a 2015b 2018 2020 bhattacharya and gregory 2015a used segmented dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma actuators installed on a circular cylinder at 80 from the front stagnation point to control the wake of a circular cylinder it was found that the high power forcing severely weakens the vortex shedding elongated the formation length and significantly reduced the drag forces the effects of segmented plasma were further verified by joshi and bhattacharya 2019 through large eddy simulation les passive controls do not involve external energy but are accomplished through manipulating the surface of the structure such as using helical strakes zhou et al 2011 and fin shaped strips zhu and zhou 2019 zhu et al 2020 they are attractive due to easy implementation especially for hash environments but may be limited in narrow operation ranges detailed reviews of the control techniques can be found in choi et al 2008 as one of the passive methods porous shrouds have been demonstrated effective in suppressing flow induced forces and viv responses the first extensive study where the perforated shrouds with circular holes of various porosity were utilised to cover a bare cylinder was reported by price 1956 the diameter ratio of the shroud to the inner bare cylinder was 1 25 price 1956 found that the existence of the shrouds could effectively suppress the maximum vibration amplitude for shrouds with a porosity of 37 the ones with hole arrangement parallel and perpendicular to the axis were more effective than the one with a 45 tilt hole row arrangement it was also found that the shrouds induced numerous small vortices downstream of the holes therefore the vortex shedding of a cylinder with the periodic asymmetry was alleviated additionally the forced mixing in the inner passage between the shroud and the inner cylinder limited the development of the vortices zdravkovich 1981 studied the vortex shedding suppression of different porous shrouds the results showed that all the shrouds had a similar inhibitory effect on viv with the square hole shroud being only slightly better than that of the round hole shroud screen shrouds of high porosity of 67 and 72 at gap ratios of 2 0 and 1 25 respectively were tested for viv suppression and the results showed that the vibration amplitude was reduced by about 78 and 50 respectively azmi et al 2012 2015 whereas it is straightforward and relevant to explore the mechanism of viv reduction through the study of the wake structures of a vibrating screen shrouded cylinder it is also pertinent to examine the flow structures and vortex characteristics of a stationary one especially their dependence on the porosity of the screen to our best knowledge only a limited number of studies were reported in the literature oruc 2012 investigated the flow characteristics of a cylinder surrounded by a streamlined screen with a porosity of 50 it was found that the existence of the screen shroud could effectively suppress vortex shedding compared to a bare cylinder unfortunately a streamlined shape could only work in a unidirectional manner ozkan et al 2012 extended the above study by using a circular screen shroud with the outer to inner diameter ratio of 1 2 2 and the porosity of 40 70 the results showed that the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses could be reduced remarkably as a result of restraining the vortex street formation it was found that the interaction between the shear layers of the inner cylinder was impeded this result was supported by durhasan et al 2019 who studied the flow characteristics behind a bare cylinder by adding a perforated cylinder with circular holes for inner to outer diameter ratio ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 azmi and zhou 2018 tested the combined effect of porosity and wire diameters of various screen shrouds in the wake of a bare cylinder for two different diameter ratios it was found that the ratio of 2 0 was more effective than 1 6 in extending the formation region the main objective of this study is to shed some new light on vortex formation and wake characteristics and their dependence on porosity of a screen shrouded cylinder at a fixed diameter ratio d d of 2 hereafter d and d are the diameters of the inner bare cylinder and the outer screen shroud respectively for this purpose screen shrouds with porosities of 37 48 61 and 67 were constructed the flow structures in the near wake region were examined using piv and the results were then compared with that of a bare cylinder wake 2 experimental details experiments were conducted at the middle section of the water flume located at the university of western australia fig 1 the dimensions of the flume are 400 mm width 500 mm height 15 m length and the freestream turbulent intensity of the test section is less than 2 high quality transparent glass windows were opened on both sides and bottom of the water flume to facilitate laser illumination and camera shooting the bare cylinder was made of a polished aluminium tube with a diameter d 10 mm and a length of 400 mm the screen shrouds were made of stainless steel meshes with porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 table 1 which were enfolded into a cylindrical form the porosity β a 2 a t 2 where a is the aperture and t is the wire diameter is defined as the ratio of void area to the total area of the mesh the diameter of the screen shroud d is 20 mm details of the fabrication process of the screen shrouds can be found on sun et al 2020 the freestream velocity was set at 0 16 m s corresponding to re d 1600 the choice of such a reynolds number is a compromise of the cylinder diameter due to blockage effect an improved spatial resolution for piv measurements and the concern of possible deformation of the screen cylinders under relatively large hydrodynamic forces at high reynolds numbers to eliminate the boundary layer effect from the bottom surface a 4 mm transparent perspex plate was placed 80 mm above the flume base to allow the redevelopment of the boundary layer the laser was shot horizontally about 11d away from both the free surface and the transparent perspex plate and the high speed camera was located at the bottom of the flume thus the free surface reflection and the end effect could be ignored in order to strengthen and mount the screen shroud a 3d printed hollow tube with an inner diameter of 10 5 mm and an outer diameter of 19 5 mm was inserted between the shroud and the bare cylinder a 5 mm thickness piece was cut from this hollow tube and was glued onto the transparent perspex supporting plate as a stopper to fix the other end of the shroud the above procedures prevent not only the movement of the shrouded cylinder but also the deformation of the shroud finally the shrouded cylinder was firmly fixed to a wooden frame through two pipe clips the pipe clips with a diameter of 20 mm could hold the model perfectly without being squeezed and the wooden frame was rigidly mounted to the flume walls on both sides of the flume a 5 w continuous wave argo ion laser was used to illuminate the flow and the thickness of the laser sheet was about 1 mm water was seeded with synthetic polycrystalline particles with diameters of 1 5 μm the particles had a density close to that of water and could be suspended and distributed evenly in the flume for at least a few hours images were captured using a high speed camera photron fastcam sa3 at a frame rate of 250 fps through a nikon lens af s 50 mm f 1 4 g with a resolution of 1024 768 pixels the shutter speed was 1 ms overall about 14 500 instantaneous flow fields were captured continuously which was equivalent to about 180 shedding cycles for the bare cylinder and 90 cycles for the screen shrouded cylinders using the open source piv tool in matlab namely pivlab the instantaneous displacements of particles were obtained through the frame to frame cross correlation algorithm thielicke and stamhuis 2014 before further analysis of the images a high pass filter was employed to highlight the particles and remove any uneven light in the background thus the instantaneous velocity and vorticity could be determined the images were taken over an area of 130 mm length 97 5 mm width two interrogation window sizes were selected based on the particle density and displacement the initial and the final interrogation window sizes were 32 32 and 16 16 pixels respectively and the overlap ratio was set to 50 the normalised median test was applied to select the outliers and the 3 3 neighbourhood interpolation method was adopted to replace the outliers in general less than 2 of the vectors had been removed with the current setting about 12065 vectors 127 95 were generated for each image the spatial resolution of the grid in both horizontal and vertical directions was about 1 mm the measurement uncertainty was less than 0 01 pixel based on the particle diameter and particle density according to raffel et al 2018 the uncertainty of the particle displacement in x and y directions was less than 0 1 pixel for an image magnification of 0 127 mm pixel the uncertainties of velocity and vorticity could be estimated at 3 and 5 respectively lourenco and krothapalli 1995 it needs to be noted that spectral attenuation using piv similar to that of hot wire techniques cannot be avoided especially when measuring small scale turbulence or velocity derivatives lavoie et al 2007 the above uncertainties do not include the finite resolution effects on spectral attenuation using piv for turbulence measurements lavoie et al 2007 suggested that an interrogation window of width less than or equal to 5η would be required for the small scale statistics to be measured with less than 30 attenuations where η ν 3 ε 1 4 is the kolmogorov length scale and ε is the mean turbulent energy dissipation rate and can be approximated by ε 15 ν u x 2 based on the isotropic assumption hereafter angular brackets denote time averaging this result is similar to that previously reported by zhou et al 2003 for hot wire measurements who suggested that to measure the small scale turbulence properly i e the velocity gradients vorticity and turbulent energy dissipation rate the wire separation needs to be in the range of 3 5η a larger separation will result in a more significant spectral attenuation whereas a smaller separation will result in overestimation of the velocity derivatives due to noise contamination it has been calculated that η is in the range between 0 17 and 0 2 mm in the wakes of the present study depending on the location in the wake as the resolution for the piv analysis is 1 mm 1 mm this corresponds to 5 9η 5η which is better than that used by lavoie et al 2007 but exceeds the suggested range 5 η by about 20 as mentioned by lavoie et al 2007 a relatively coarse resolution of a piv is somewhat typical of this technique where the scale resolution is a trade off between zooming the image onto a small area to resolve small scale motion which can lead to a loss of global information and increases noise e g saarenrinne and piirto 2000 and capturing the region of the flow field that includes all relevant scales e g poelma et al 2006 based on the results of lavoie et al 2007 the root mean square rms values of the velocity fluctuations in the present study are attenuated by 3 2 for a resolution of 5 9η 5η whereas the rms values of the velocity derivatives are attenuated by about 19 15 these results are also consistent with that reported by zhu and antonia 1996 for small scale turbulence measurements using hot wire arrays 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake vortex structures the wake vortex structures in the near region x 10 of various cylinders are first examined to illustrate the formation of the vortical structures hereafter a superscript asterisk represents normalisation with the diameter of the bare cylinder d and or the freestream velocity fig 2 compares the time averaged streamlines for both the bare cylinder and various screen shrouded cylinders they are generally symmetric about the wake centreline for the bare cylinder wake fig 2a the streamlines show a small recirculation zone over 0 5 x 2 4 where the reverse flow is obvious two focal points are identified at x 1 9 on both sides of the wake with a separation l y 0 8d and one saddle point is identified at x 2 4 on the centreline i e l x 2 4d these results are in agreement with those reported by feng and wang 2010 at re 950 there are a few ways to define the vortex formation length for example zdravkovich 1997 defined the distance from the cylinder center to the location where the mean velocity u 0 whereas williamson 1996 defined the location where the rms values of the streamwise velocity is the largest the saddle point is also used by researchers to determine the vortex formation length e g aydin and ekmekci 2013 gao et al 2019 from fig 2a the vortex formation length as defined by l x agrees well with those defined later by the zero mean velocity and the maximum rms values of the stream velocity for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the widths between the focal points are expanded to l y 1 8d and 2 0d respectively which are approximately twice the width of the bare cylinder as shown in fig 2b and c indicating that these focal points are associated with the screen shrouds also the focal points are located at about x 4 2 and 5 2 for β 37 and 48 which are about 2 2 and 2 7 times that of the bare cylinder wake in addition the saddle points for both cases shift downstream to x 6 and 9 respectively corresponding to a formation length l x 6d and 9d i e about 2 4 and 3 6 times that of the bare cylinder wake there is no doubt that although the kármán vortex streets are very similar among the bare cylinder and the shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the size of the recirculation zone has been increased significantly however if the diameter of the screen shroud d is used for normalisation the widths of the focal points for both cases is comparable to that of the bare cylinder it is also worth pointing out that sun et al 2020 studied the wake structures of the screen cylinders without the inner cylinder used in this study under a comparable re it was shown that the screen cylinders with β 37 and 48 had recirculation zones x d 3 and 4 respectively similar to that of the shrouded cylinders of the same porosity the findings of the two studies indicate that the contribution to wake formation by the inner bare cylinder is negligible this is because most of the flow cannot pass through the screen shrouds due to the low porosity as a result the shroud itself perform as a bluff body since the diameter of the shroud is twice that of the bare cylinder the recirculation region formed is apparently enlarged when the porosity is increased further to 61 and 67 the patterns of the streamlines are changed apparently as shown in fig 2d and e the saddle point for β 61 shifts farther away from the cylinders to around x 10 corresponding to l x 10d the focal points move significantly upstream to x 2 2 and the separation between them reduces back to l y 1 0d which is similar to that for a bare cylinder fig 2a clearly these focal points are associated with the inner bare cylinder for the 67 screen shrouded cylinder unfortunately due to the limited viewing window size and the expected spatial resolution the maximum downstream location can only be achieved at x 10 as a result the saddle point which may exist after x 10 cannot be identified moreover the focal points caused by the inner cylinder can be identified in fig 2e at x 1 5 and the separation between them reduces back to l y 0 8d which is the same as that for a bare cylinder wake fig 2a given a relatively high porosity of the screen a certain amount of fluid can pass through the shroud directly thus these focal points are generated due to wake instability from the inner bare cylinder the values of l x and l y for different screen porosity are summarised in fig 2f as the magnitudes of l x and l y differ by one order different ordinates have been used for them in the figure the variation of l y with the increase of β may suggest different vortex formation mechanisms for different screen shrouded cylinders to demonstrate further the differences in vortex formation processes for different cylinders the time averaged topologies of the spanwise vorticity ω z v x u y are shown in fig 3 for the bare cylinder wake in fig 3a the two shear layers are symmetric about the centreline and disappear at about x 3 consistent with that reported by dong et al 2006 at re 3900 for β 37 and 48 the two shear layers are extended and separated apart significantly in fig 3b and c as they are generated from the edges of the screen shrouds there are no apparent vortical structures in the gap between the two shear layers which may be referred to the low vorticity region in the core in contrast for β 61 and 67 fig 3d and e another two shear layers inner vortices can be identified immediately downstream of the screen shrouds they are generated by the bare cylinder due to the fluid passing through the gap between the two cylinders further downstream the inner vortices gradually merge with those generated by the outer screen cylinders it is also interesting to note that the magnitude of the inner vortices increases monotonically with the increase of the porosity it can therefore be concluded that for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the wake vortices are generated by the shear layers originating from the screen shrouds whereas for β 61 and 67 the formation of the wake vortices involves the merging process of vortices generated by the inner bare cylinder with those in the shear layers generated by the screen shrouds 3 2 turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses the contours of the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy tke are presented in fig 4 following feng and wang 2010 the tke is defined as 0 75 u 2 v 2 where u and v are the velocity fluctuations in the x and y directions respectively and the superscript prime represents the rms values for the bare cylinder wake in fig 4a tke starts to increase and reaches its peak value of 0 22 at x 2 4 and then decreases gradually this result as well as the peak value is consistent with previous results reported by feng and wang 2010 at re 950 the contours of tke for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 4b and c resemble that of the bare cylinder except that the overall patterns shift further downstream and become wider the peak values occur at x 6 and 9 respectively with the increase in porosity the maximum contour values reduce gradually from 0 19 to 0 13 representing a reduction of 14 and 41 compared with that of the bare cylinder given the broad range of the tke contours for β 37 and 48 it can be inferred that the wakes are generated by the screen shrouds for these two porosities for β 61 and 67 the tke contours depict a novel pattern overall the maximum contour value of tke decreases with the increase of β it seems that the tke contours can be divided into two regions with the first region being from 0 5 x 5 and the second from 5 x 10 in the first region the maximum is generated by the inner bare cylinder as the width of the tke contours is narrow this result is more evident in fig 4e than that in fig 4d within the first region the tke contours resemble those of the bare cylinder with a maximum value of 0 043 at x 2 this value is only about 1 5 of the later as shown in fig 4a after reaching its peak the tke dissipates gradually till x 5 when the porosity of the screen shroud is large a considerable portion of the fluid can pass through and interact with the inner bare cylinder forming a wake structure for the second region the width of the tke contours is increased and another maximum with its shape resembles that of β 37 and 48 can be identified therefore it can be concluded that the formation of the second tke region is due to the external screen shrouds a similar flow pattern was also reported by fu and rockwell 2005 for flow past a circular cylinder with a bleeding slot in the centre the contours of the reynolds normal stresses u u and v v are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively for u u double peaks are identified at y 0 4 and x 2 1 whereas the single peak of v v occurs at x 2 4 corresponding well to the vortex formation length l x it is undeniable that the peak value of u u precedes the peak value of v v which is consistent with the existing literature i e dong et al 2006 feng and wang 2010 ozkan et al 2012 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the patterns of the contours of u u are similar to that of the bare cylinder wake except that their sizes expand and the locations of the maxima move both further downstream and away from the centreline occurring at about y 1 the latter result indicates that the vortex structures are generated from the shear layers of the screen shrouds the downstream movement of the maxima from x 5 for β 37 to x 8 for β 48 reflects the effect of shroud porosity on vortex formation length similar trends of the contours for v v can also be found and the maximum contour values for β 37 and 48 can be identified at x 6 and 9 respectively which are consistent with the formation length l x discussed in sec 3 1 in addition the two region scenarios of the contours of u u and v v can also be found for β 61 and 67 with the first region being associated with the shedding from the inner bare cylinder and the second with the shedding from the screen cylinders furthermore for these two porosities the peak values of both reynolds normal stresses decrease by more than one order compared with that of β 37 and 48 the contours of the reynolds shear stress u u are shown in fig 7 the solid and dashed lines indicate positive and negative values respectively four lobes can be identified in the near wake region of the bare cylinder fig 7a with the two smaller lobes located at x 1 8 and y 0 25 they have a low magnitude indicating that the correlation between u and v is low the two large lobes centred at x 2 4 and y 0 4 have maximum levels of 0 06 both the contour patterns and the levels are consistent with previous studies by dong et al 2006 who studied the near wake structures of a circular cylinder using experimental as well as numerical methods at re 3900 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 7b and c the contour patterns are similar to that of the bare cylinder for β 37 the two smaller lobes are located at x 4 8 and y 0 5 besides the two larger lobes can be seen clearly in both cases with the peaks occurring at y 0 8 it is worth mentioning that the y locations for both the smaller lobes and the larger lobes are twice the value found in the bare cylinder wake indicating that the vortices are generated from the shear layers of the screen shrouds what is more the peak value in the bare cylinder wake appears at x 2 4 for the screen shroud with β 37 however the peak location moves downstream to x 6 as the porosity is increased further to 48 the peak occurs at x 9 these peak locations are consistent with the vortex formation length l x discussed previously compared with the bare cylinder wake the maximum contour levels for u v are significantly reduced by 17 and 33 for β 37 and 48 respectively a remarkable reduction in u v could be the reason why the two smaller lobes disappear when β 48 under the same contour increment as the porosity is increased to 61 and 67 the patterns of u v are changed significantly even though there are still four lobes in the wake they are not arranged in the same way as those for the bare and the 37 screen shrouded cylinder wakes for the bare cylinder wake there is one positive and one negative lobe on each side of the wake as shown in fig 7a and b nevertheless for the 61 and 67 screen shrouded cylinders the two negative or positive lobes are all located on the upper or lower side in fig 7d and e this is because the two negative or positive lobes come from different shear layers the smaller one comes from the inner cylinder whereas the larger one comes from the outer shroud this is also supported by the centre of y the centres of the two smaller lobes from the inner cylinder are located approximately at y 0 4 for β 61 and 67 while for the larger lobes from the outer shroud they are at y 0 7 lastly compared with the bare cylinder the maximum magnitudes of u v for β 61 and 67 drop by 40 and 58 respectively 3 3 spanwise vorticity and energy spectra to understand the wake vortex formation processes the contours of the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z are shown in fig 8 for the bare cylinder wake fig 8a the kármán vortex structures are apparent with vortices being shed alternatively from both sides of the cylinder the maximum and minimum contour levels are 3 5 and 3 5 and the two vortex streets interact with each other at about x 2 4 these results agree well with the previous literature e g sumer and fredsøe 2006 zdravkovich 1997 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 the shear layers are originated from the edge of the screen shroud they are elongated and interact with each other at x 6 and 9 respectively forming the kármán vortex structures similar to that of the bare cylinder but with larger size fig 8b and c the lengths of the shear layers on both sides of the screen cylinder are longer than those of the bare cylinder prior to the formation of the kármán vortex streets the two shear layers are separated by a low vorticity region similar to a buffer zone this phenomenon illustrates that the kármán vortex streets are generated directly by the screen shrouds but the bleed flow within the shroud prevents the shear layer from interactions thus delaying the development of the wake vortices compared with the bare cylinder wake the maximum magnitudes of the vortices are reduced by approximately 14 and 29 to 3 and 2 5 for β 37 and 48 respectively for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 fig 8d and e the contours show a different structure the small scale kelvin helmholtz vortices can be identified clearly in the two parallel shear layers originated directly from the edges of the screen shrouds in between the shear layers the buffer zone found in the 37 and 48 screen shrouded cylinder wakes no longer exists instead vortices generated from the bare cylinder due to the gap flow and penetrate the screen shrouds can be seen clearly they merge quickly with the outer shear layers as evolving downstream for β 61 fig 8d the maximum and minimum magnitude of vortices are approximately 2 which are about 57 lower than those of the bare cylinder with the increase of porosity to 67 the maximum contour values of vortices reduce further to 1 6 which are less than half of the figures for the bare cylinder to further illustrate the vortical merging processes downstream of the 67 screen shrouded cylinder five instantaneous snapshots are shown in fig 9 they are selected from one cycle at different phases based on the vortices shed by the inner cylinder and the time delay between the instances is 0 08 s which is equivalent to 1 4 shedding periods at instant a fig 9a there are two vortices a and b shed by the inner bare cylinder over the range of x 1 2 4 besides the two parallel shear layers originating from the screen shroud with some smaller vortices can also be found at y 1 or y d 0 5 over x 1 10 at instant b the sizes of both vortices a and b become larger and move closer to the upper and lower outer shear layers respectively when evolving downstream at instant c vortex a merges into the lower shear layer and vortex b is convected further downstream in the wake a new vortex vortex c is then shed from the bare cylinder at instant d vortex b becomes a free vortex and moves both downstream and upwards with the fluid whereas vortex a now merges into the shear layer located on the lower side meanwhile vortex c grows in size and another vortex vortex d starts growing at instance e vortex b moves closer to the upper shear layer and begins the amalgamation process while vortex a is completely swallowed by the lower shear layer and is almost unrecognisable both vortex c and vortex d grow in sizes and the latter starts to detach from the screen shroud this process continues and each time when a new vortex is shed on one side of the cylinder a detached free vortex is swallowed into the shear layer on the other side the vortex shedding frequency for various cylinder wakes is analysed by conducting fast fourier transform fft of the transverse velocity signals obtained at y 0 5 and the results are shown in fig 10 the peak frequencies represent the strouhal number namely s t f d u where f is the shedding frequency for the bare cylinder wake fig 10a there is a dominant peak at st 0 205 regardless of the downstream location the narrow and sharp peak is consistent with the previous publications of a circular cylinder at the subcritical flow regime i e chen et al 2017 sumer and fredsøe 2006 zdravkovich 1997 for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 fig 10b and c the values of st reduce significantly to 0 085 and 0 083 which are less than half of the bare cylinder if the shedding frequencies were normalised by the diameter of the screen shroud d 20 mm the strouhal numbers would equal to 0 170 and 0 166 for β 37 and 48 respectively which are close to the values obtained for the same 37 and 48 screen cylinders sun et al 2020 this result seems to suggest that when β 37 and 48 the vortices in the screen shrouded cylinder wakes are generated by the shrouds rather than the inner bare cylinder for β 37 an apparent peak cannot be found until x 4 while for β 48 the dominant peak appears after x 6 this result demonstrates the delay in the formation of vortices as mentioned earlier furthermore the peak frequencies are constant along the flow direction indicating the formation of the traditional kármán vortex structures e g bearman 1965 sumer and fredsøe 2006 when β 61 fig 10d two peaks at st 0 105 and 0 191 can be identified over the range of x 2 4 with the first one being dominant the second smaller peak st 0 191 disappears at x 6 similarly two different peaks can also be identified for β 67 fig 10e at st 0 096 and 0 189 over the range of x 2 6 with the second one being more apparent than that for β 61 fig 10d recalling the contours for vorticity and reynolds stresses discussed in secs 3 1 and 3 2 two distinct shear layers were identified behind the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 fig 8d and f one is initiated by the inner bare cylinder while the other is initiated by the screen shroud the double peaks corresponding to different shear layers on the spectra support the existence of the vortices in these shear layers it can be conjectured that the vortices corresponding to the higher st 0 189 are formed by the inner bare cylinder as the strouhal value is closer to the value of the bare cylinder itself the lower st 0 096 is associated with the outer screen shroud at x 8 the peak corresponding to the higher st 0 189 disappears indicating that vortices formed by the inner cylinder are synchronised by the outer vortices fig 11 shows the conceptual model of the vortex formation for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes with β 37 and 67 the lateral velocity signals v and their corresponding spectra at different locations x 2 4 and 8 and y 0 5 and 1 are also shown to illustrate the different characteristics of the shear layer vortices the locations y 0 5 and 1 correspond to the inner and outer shear layers respectively for β 37 fig 11a at x 2 the velocity fluctuation is very small at both y 0 5 and 1 and no peak can be identified on the energy spectra especially for the inner cylinder at x 4 the velocity fluctuation becomes apparent with a regular pattern and a single peak st 0 085 is identified on the spectra referring to the vorticity contours discussed previously the large scale structures in the outer shear layers start to interact across the wake centreline forming the large scale vortices at a further downstream location x 8 the velocity signals fluctuate more significantly and the energy level on the spectra at the strouhal frequency st 0 085 has been doubled that at x 4 it is because at this location the large scale structures have been formed completely as shown in fig 3b examining the streamwise variation of the mean velocity on the wake centreline fig 12 f it can be found that similar to the bare cylinder wake the β 37 screen shrouded cylinder wake also has reverse flow with the minimum velocity occurring at x 4 8 therefore the formation of the vortices of the screen shrouded cylinder with β 37 is due to absolute instability the existence of the screen shroud elongates the recirculation region due to the bleeding flow from the gap between the screen shroud and the bare cylinder it has been widely accepted that the formation of the kármán vortices in the near wake of a bare cylinder is due to absolute instability i e oertel 1990 huerre and monkewitz 1990 hudy et al 2007 wee et al 2004 stated that absolute instability was most likely to originate in a region with the strongest back flow for a two stream mixing layer huerre and monkewitz 1985 found that it was absolutely unstable when the velocity ratio defined as the velocity of one freestream divided by that of another freestream was less than 0 136 for β 67 fig 11b the small scale vortices in the shear layers generated at the mesh edge due to kelvin helmholtz k h instability grow in size through vortex merging as evolving downstream where two adjacent vortices spin around each other come closer and then merge downstream of the inner bare cylinder vortices are also formed due to the fluid bleeding through the gaps they merge with the outer shear layers as evolving downstream at about x 4 fig 4e at x 2 the velocity signals show weaker fluctuation in the outer shear layers y 1 than that in the inner y 0 5 where a negative mean transverse velocity based on the signals is obtained resulting in a movement of the vortices to the former shear layers whereas there is only one peak at y 1 double peaks are identified at y 0 5 with the first one representing the dominate wake frequency the second one is in support of the existence of the vortices shed from the inner cylinder this result is in apparent difference with that for the 37 screen shrouded cylinder at x 4 the velocity fluctuations are much lower and double peaks are also identified at both y 0 5 and 1 on the spectra this is because the vortices shed from the inner bare cylinder merge into the outer shear layer it is worth mentioning that the velocity signal at this location is more like a combination of two sine waves with different amplitudes and frequencies further downstream at x 8 the velocity signals depict regular fluctuations similar to a sine wave and the higher shedding frequency disappears on the spectra at both locations as a result of the amalgamation process of the inner vortices with the outer shear layers there is no doubt that the shear layers generated by the bare cylinder fig 11b can be identified as wake instability or the so called absolute instability as reflected by the flow inflection downstream of it fig 12f where the minimum velocity is identified at x 1 5 in an absolute instability the temporal turbulence can be spread out and eventually grow exponentially everywhere however the two parallel shear layers generated by the screen shroud can be classified as the convective instability as the k h vortices are swept downstream and yet still developing in size by engulfing the ambient fluid and vortex merging what is more the mean velocity downstream of the inner bare cylinder increase gradually all the way towards the end of the piv view window and no flow inflection is identified this phenomenon is consistent with the classification of the convective instability i e huerre and monkewitz 1985 wee et al 2004 according to huerre and monkewitz 1990 for homogeneous jets flow a combination of absolute instability and convective instability the convective instability can be preserved over the entire field but the absolute instability can easily be destabilised it is also worth mentioning that the strouhal numbers for the 61 and 67 screen shrouded cylinders keep constant in the flow direction this is apparently different from what have been found for screen cylinder wakes with β 61 and 67 sun et al 2020 where the strouhal numbers keep decreasing with the increase of x due to the merging and tripling of the shear layer vortices suggesting different vortex formation mechanism after the introduction of the inner bare cylinder 3 4 velocity profiles the mean streamwise velocity profiles at different downstream locations are shown in fig 12 for the bare cylinder wake fig 12a the profile at x 2 changes sharply over y 0 7 it is negative around the centreline indicating a reverse flow which is consistent with the results found from the streamlines and the vector plots figs 2a and 3a at x 4 the velocity on the centreline increases significantly to 0 65 suggesting that the formation length l x is between x 2 4 if the vortex formation length l x is defined as the distance from the centre of the cylinder to the location where u u 0 it is found that l x 2 4 fig 12f this result agrees well with that reported previously at a comparable reynolds number e g williamson 1996 for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes depending on the porosity of the screen shrouds two kinds of mean velocity trends can be identified one for β 37 and 48 and the other for β 61 and 67 for β 37 and 48 at x 2 fig 12b and c the shear layers corresponding to y 1 1 5 are narrow and separated by a region with essentially very low velocity due to less fluid penetration as a result the velocity gradients in the shear layer are large for β 37 the values of u u are negative from x 2 to x 6 illustrating an elongated vortex formation length in contrast for β 48 the values of u u are close to 0 in the central area at x 2 indicating that the reverse flow has not yet started when the flow moves downstream to x 4 8 u u becomes negative and the reverse flow occurs in fig 12f the formation lengths l x for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 extend substantially about 6 and 9 respectively the velocity profiles for β 61 and 67 show a totally different trend fig 12d and e the gradients on both sides of the cylinders are smaller than that in figs 12b and c and remain unchanged over x 2 8 indicating that the shear layers do not diffuse significantly as convecting downstream for β 61 the values of u u at y 0 3 are less than 0 over the entire range x 2 10 indicating an extension in the formation length in contrast the negative value of u u for β 67 can only be found at x 2 after that it increases slowly along the flow direction according to fig 12f the formation length l x of vortices generated by the inner cylinder for β 67 equals 2 which is comparable to that of the bare cylinder proving that the inner bare cylinder forms these vortices figs 13 and 14 show the variation of u and v the values of u show a twin peak distribution at y 0 5 for the bare cylinder wake within the range of x 2 8 the peak values reveal a decreasing trend along the streamwise direction as the shear layers dissipate in contrast the values of v fig 14a depict a narrow peak at x 2 near the central region indicating that the shear layers have merged together and formed a single vortex street from x 4 to 8 the peaks become broader and show a decreasing trend as the turbulence intensities drop with the flow in addition the formation length l x defined as the distance between the centre of the cylinder and the peak values of u and v also equals 2 4 figs 13f and 14f for the screen shrouded cylinders with β 37 and 48 compared with the bare cylinder wake the values of u and v are much smaller at x 2 and the twin peaks are further apart occurring at y 1 2 indicating that the dominant shear layers are at the edge of the screen shrouds with very limited penetrating flow along the streamwise direction the increasing trends of u and v indicate the development of the wake vortex structures till x 6 and 8 for β 37 and 48 respectively this scenario also proves a delay in the vortex formation for β 37 the twin peak distribution at x 4 and the single peak distribution at x 6 of v fig 14b indicate the development and merging processes of the shear layers compared with the bare cylinder wake the formation lengths for β 37 and 48 increase to l x 6 and 9 figs 13f and 14f respectively the distributions of u and v for β 61 and 67 present a different trend in both cases twin peaks for u can be found at x 2 and y 0 5 indicating that these shear layers are generated by the inner cylinder further away from the cylinder the two peaks of u spread out towards y 1 and their magnitudes increase gradually due to the shear layers of the screen shroud these trends are consistent with the development and merging of the shear layers generated by the inner cylinder with those by the outer shrouds interestingly the variation of v for β 67 fig 14e indicates that there are apparent vortices formed immediately downstream of the cylinder due to the single peak at x 2 however further downstream at x 4 8 the twin peaks in v with increasing magnitudes as evolving downstream suggest that another vortex structure is developing it is certain that the former comes from the inner cylinder while the latter is associated with the outer shroud also the turbulence immediately behind the screen shrouded cylinders with β 61 and 67 is weakened significantly compared with that of the bare cylinder wake the streamwise evolution of u u u and v figs 12f 13f and 14f are all consistent with that revealed by the contours in terms of vortex formation lengths l x for various wakes discussed above 4 conclusions in this study wake characteristics of a circular cylinder concentrically enclosed inside a screen shroud with porosities β 37 48 61 and 67 are studied using piv at a reynolds number of 1600 the main aim is to understand the effect of the screen shrouds on the formation of the wake vortex structures and its dependence on porosity at a fixed diameter ratio of 2 two different wake development processes are identified the first process is associated with wake instability or the so called absolute instability for absolute instability it is characterised by an inflection flow in the near wake and the turbulence can diffuse and eventually contaminate the entire wake this process can also be found for the screen shrouded cylinder wakes with β 37 and 48 as the shear layers initiated at the edge of the screen interact with each other in the near wake region the second process is related to a combination of absolute instability and convective instability for the screen shrouds with β 61 and 67 due to the increase of porosity more fluid can pass through the gap between the bare cylinder and the screen shroud as a result two different kinds of vortices are generated which are reflected by the double peaks on the energy spectra the vortices shed from the inner cylinder are due to absolute instability as reflected by the flow inflection over x 2 4 they are much weaker in magnitude than that of the bare cylinder itself as propagating downstream they move away from the wake centreline and merge into the shear layers generated by the screen shrouds where the vortices grow in size as swept away downstream therefore the development of the wake vortices further downstream is associated with convective instability and the wake is then dominated by the parallel shear layers originated from the edge of the screen shrouds more evidence exists on both the tke and reynold stress contours which can be divided into two regions namely 0 5 x 5 and 5 x 10 for the different wake conditions based on the statistical results the peak values for vorticity tke and reynolds stresses in the screen shrouded cylinder wakes are lower than those in the bare cylinder wake with the increase in porosity these values depict a decreasing trend indicating that the vortex structures are weakened for example for β 48 and 67 the maximum values of tke are only 3 5 and 1 5 of the bare cylinder respectively the former can restrain the reynolds shear stress by 33 whereas the latter has a reduction of 58 in a nutshell the present results clearly show that the screen shroud can inhibit the formation and weaken the strength of the vortical structures credit authorship contribution statement chenlin sun

20772,the dynamic response of the telescopic gangway strongly links to the relative motion which is significant when the gangway vessel works along with another floating unit in proximity the failure might cause operational downtime or even personnel casualty in this paper gangway motions including extension retraction rotations and relative motions are studied numerically in the time domain and compared to experimental measurements the hydrodynamic interaction of the multi body system is analyzed by 3d diffraction and radiation computation in the frequency domain the nonlinear roll damping is calibrated and validated in both free decay and regular waves two uni directional scenarios of primary irregular waves and one bi directional scenario of both primary and secondary irregular waves are taken into account in the study remarkable vertical motion up to 10 m between gangway departure and landing points are observed even if the significant wave height is only 3 25 m extreme value analysis shows the gangway inclination can be as high as 17 which exceeds the maximum acceptance so that enhanced slip resistance feature must be added on the gangway the different patterns of gangway motion trajectory in the vertical plane are also illustrated to corroborate the conclusion keywords gangway offshore operation time domain multi body hydrodynamics flotel 1 introduction as the demand for a safe and efficient walk to work approach prevails in the offshore operation activity a remarkable growth in the use of offshore gangway for the transfer of personnel from one to another offshore facility pérez et al 2014 can be expected besides the oil and gas industry there is also huge potential for the growth of gangway utilization in the offshore wind industry leanwind 2018 gangway operation it has several rigorous operational limitations such as the dynamic inclination angle extending and retraction of gangway etc gangway access can be even more challenging when it connects to a floating structure instead of a fixed installation the relative motions between gangway based vessel and the floating structure are the main concern for telescopic gangway in particular gangway motions are almost dominated by the dynamic response of departure and landing points once gangway failure occurs it will result in downtime financial loss and cause injury or even death therefore before the commencement of work relevant parties owner operator and classification must ensure all indicators stay within operational limits all time during operation to the best of authors knowledge the attention to the gangway analysis has gained focus in recent years due to the increase use of accommodation vessels flotel and the safety of walk to work was valued by the industry the study in specialized gangway motion especially the telescopic type has been rarely done and thus little is known about its underlying physics as well as its motion characteristics guanche et al 2016 conducted numerical simulation on relative motions of a supply vessel and semi submersible floating wind turbine to study the gangway walkability in general the dynamic gangway response is induced by the wave actions especially the first order wave excitation the response can be significant because the gangway location is usually above the main deck the situation may even worsen if the operation vessel is the traditional ship shape like the case in the present study when the operation vessel approaches another floating unit the motion characteristics are altered depending on the physical layout and heading condition the motion of the operation vessel may get amplified and lead to remarkable gangway motions in numerical prediction one problem that needs to be solved is the multi body hydrodynamics which analyzes the wave structure and structure structure interactions the 3d radiation and diffraction computation within the potential flow theory is widely used previous researchers adopted the method and tried to study the offloading operation between flng and lng carriers buchner et al 2001 kim et al 2003 hong et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 fournier et al 2006 pauw et al 2007 pessoa et al 2015 special attention was paid to the wave resonance in the gap feng and bai 2017 zhao et al 2018 chua et al 2018 somehow the recent focus is placed more on wave kinematics rather than structure motions inspired by existing research summarized above huang et al 2018 investigated numerically the dynamic gangway response in the frequency domain the impact of multi body interaction was interpreted and rao of relative motion and gangway dynamic response are computed and compared to the experimental values in light of this study we aim to investigate gangway motions in the time domain where the complicated motion is intuitively presented and the nonlinear factor or time dependent parameter can be handled straightforward the time series results also allow higher level numerical extreme value analysis certainly the analysis in the time domain enables the cycle by cycle comparison between simulation and measurement in this study by focusing on the irregular waves various gangway operational limits are taken into account and discussed in this paper the dynamic motions of fpso and flotel where the gangway was installed are analyzed in the time domain sections 2 1 and 2 3 briefly introduce the numerical method and modeling as the input of the time domain study the multi body hydrodynamic problem is solved by the 3d diffraction and radiation computation which is elucidated in section 2 2 gangway s extension and various rotations are derived and elaborated in section 2 4 in general results are presented in time series and compared to the measurement from the model test note that some of the gangway motions were not recorded in the experiment because the dynamic roll response is heavily involved in the gangway motions the calibration and validation of nonlinear damping were carried out in calm water and in the presence of waves section 4 2 the irregular waves considered in the study include two uni directional scenarios of primary wave and one bi directional scenario comprising both primary and secondary waves to guarantee the identical wave conditions between simulation and measurement irregular waves were reconstructed by carefully matching the measured wave elevation section 4 1 the flotel s global motions show a large dynamic response due to the presence of the fpso in proximity section 4 4 a remarkable relative vertical motion up to 10 m occurs the most probable maximum by weibull fitting indicates gangway s inclination in the vertical plane can be as high as 17 which request gangway to be equipped the enhanced slip resistance feature section 4 5 the trajectory of gangway motions in the vertical plane illustrates three different patterns due to the phase difference generally the numerical simulation shows a good agreement with the results by model test finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the theoretical background 2 1 coordinate systems in general two different coordinate systems are defined to describe the kinematics of floating structure floater including the earth fixed global system o x y z and local inertial system o x y z attached to each moving floater the floater is considered as a rigid body of 6 dofs degree of freedom fig 1 illustrates both the coordinate systems and the directional convention of environmental load in the 2d o x y plane both coordinate systems follow right hand rule the horizontal o x y and o x y planes coincide with the undisturbed free surface and the vertical o z and o z axes are orienting positively upward 2 2 multi body diffraction and radiation the computation of hydrodynamic loads on a multi body system is considered it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational so that a velocity potential φ exists deep water is assumed and the normal vector is defined positively pointing inwards the fluid domain in the steady state the velocity potential at a flow field point p is written as 1 φ p t re ϕ p e i ω t based on the linear superposition principle the spatial potential ϕ is decomposed into 2 ϕ m 1 m j 1 6 i ω η j m ϕ j m a 0 ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 m where a 0 is the amplitude of incident waves ϕ 7 m denotes the scattering potential η j m means the amplitude of the motion in j mode of body m and ϕ j m is the corresponding radiation potential besides ϕ 0 is the potential of incident waves per unit amplitude given by 3 ϕ 0 g ω e k 0 z i x cos β y sin β where β and k 0 denote the heading angle and wavenumber of incident waves respectively the linearized boundary value problem for the potential ϕ j m with j 1 2 7 is expressed as chen 2004 lee and newman 2005 4a 2 ϕ j m 0 in the fluid domain 4b ϕ j m n n j m on h m 4c k 0 ϕ j m ϕ j m z 0 at z 0 4d lim r r ϕ j m r i k 0 ϕ j m 0 in the far field where n j m denotes the generalized vector defined as 5 n j m n j on h m 0 otherwise with n j n j for j 1 2 3 r n for j 4 5 6 n ϕ 0 for j 7 where h m is the hull surface of the body m the boundary value problem 4 is solved by means of the boundary element method in which the free surface green function is adopted as the fundamental solution and the boundary integral equation is written as 6 2 π ϕ j p m h m ϕ j q n q g p q g p q n q ϕ j q d s where p x y z and q ξ η ζ denote the flow field and source points respectively and g is the free surface green function written as wehausen and laitone 1960 7 g 1 r 1 d g f with r d x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 where g f is the free surface term in the form of a single integral by solving the boundary integral equation 6 the radiation and diffraction potentials can be determined and then the added mass a k j n m wave radiation damping b k j n m and the wave exciting force f k m are obtained 8 i ω a k j n m b k j n m i ω ρ h n ϕ j m n k d s and f k n i ω ρ a 0 h n ϕ 0 ϕ 7 n n k d s for the computation of the added mass at infinite frequency the green function satisfying the free surface condition at infinite frequency is adopted and it is expressed as 9 g 1 r 1 d the above mentioned method provides wave force and hydrodynamic coefficients for the time domain computation the software hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 is employed which is dedicated for 3d diffraction and radiation calculation in frequency domain 2 3 time domain dynamics of floating structures as a sequel to the frequency domain computation the time domain analysis is considered the time domain motion computation relies on the motion equations based on newton s 2nd law the frequency dependent wave radiation damping and added mass are needed which are therefore treated further by using cummins s equation cummins 1962 10 m m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ b lin x t b qua x t x t c x t f t where m is the mass matrix of dimension 6 n 6 n with n denoting the number of bodies here c denotes linear stiffness matrix such as the hydrostatic restoring matrix b lin and b qua represent frequency independent linear and quadratic damping matrix f is the external force vector which consists of the environmental force connection force such as mooring or other force acting on the structure k is the retardation function defined as 11 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where b and ω are radiation damping and angular frequency meanwhile the added mass m a at the infinite frequency can alternatively be estimated by 12 m a m a ω 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t where ω is an arbitrary frequency in reality it is impractical and unnecessary to carry out the computation from zero to infinite frequency in the diffraction and radiation computation therefore the artificial decay is conducted on b for a certain range of frequencies beyond both upper and lower cutoff points before calculating eq 11 τ also needs to be cut off at a reasonable duration where no more fluctuation exists in k regarding m a the mean value can be taken by repeating eq 12 at different ω for reliable precision alternatively the added mass at infinity frequency is also able to be provided by radiation calculation directly based on 6 and 9 the motion equation in 10 with respect to floater s cog center of gravity is solved in the local coordinate system at each time step by 4th order runge kutta scheme then the location of cog and other points to be studied such as fairlead is converted to the global coordinate system the environmental load of floater is updated at each time step based on the filtered low frequency position when considering the irregular waves the elevation is described by a series of linear harmonic waves as follows 13 η t x β wave re i 1 n a i e i ω i t k i x ϵ i with x cos β wave x sin β wave y where x y and β wave are locations in north and west as well as wave incoming direction in the global system ϵ i and k i denote random phase and wavenumber respectively and the wavenumber satisfies the dispersion equation ω 2 g k newman 1977 a i is the wave amplitude determined by 14 a i 2 s η η ω i δ ω where s η η is the wave spectrum the linear wave exciting force is then expressed as 15 f wave 1 t ℜ i 1 n a i 1 a i e i φ i e i ω i t k i x ϵ i where a i 1 φ i are the amplitude of the linear wave force and corresponding phase determined by the hydrodynamic analysis the amplitude and phase could be updated at each time step by interpolation due to the change of floater s heading the second order wave forces and other types of environmental forces are not presented here because they are not the scope of this paper the time domain computations were performed by in house software kraken which is developed for dynamic analysis of floating systems and specialized in offshore operation study 2 4 gangway motions in this section the critical gangway motions are derived including telescopic extension and rotations in vertical and horizontal planes we introduced another coordinate system to study the gangway fig 2 shows whole system which comprises two vessels in nonparallel side by side configuration and the gangway in 2d x y plane 2 4 1 gangway extension a key objective is to obtain the relative motions therefore two vessels as well as the gangway are defined in the respective local coordinate systems the reference system can be defined fixed to either flotel or fpso here we choose fpso as the frame of reference the three translation displacements at a fixed point on the vessel in the local coordinate system can be expressed as following according to rigid body kinematics 16 x y z a 1 a 2 a 3 0 z g w y g w z g w 0 x g w y g w x g w 0 a 4 a 5 a 6 where a i i 1 6 denote surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively besides x g w y g w z g w is the location a point on the gangway to transfer the motion of the flotel to the reference system with respect to the fpso the following relation is used 17 x y z cos θ f sin θ f 0 sin θ f cos θ f 0 0 0 1 x y z finally relative motions δ x δ y δ z in the frame of reference with respect to the fpso can be obtained by subtraction of respective displacement as in eqs 16 and 17 relative motions in the frame of reference with respect to the fpso are further converted to the system to the gangway 18 δ x g w δ y g w δ z g w cos θ g w sin θ g w 0 sin θ g w cos θ g w 0 0 0 1 δ x δ y δ z gangway extension is directly relevant to motions at departure and landing points of gangway on each vessel according to the geometrical relation it is expressed as 19 d e x t l 0 1 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 1 l 0 1 cos arctan δ x g w l 0 1 δ y g w cos arctan δ x g w l 0 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 where l 0 is gangway original length the three terms on the right hand side of 19 are contributions of δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w respectively 2 4 2 gangway rotation one important parameter in the gangway analysis is the angle between gangway and gangway top base plate denoted by α z as illustrated in fig 3 to calculate α z we consider the angle between gangway and gangway tower φ z as follows according to geometrical relation 20 φ z 9 0 β z γ z where β z and γ z are the angle between gangway and horizontal plane and angle between gangway tower and vertical plane respectively β z can be straightforwardly determined by the vertical relative motion of both gangway ends 0 of gangway and horizontal plane in static equilibrium position 21 β z δ z g w l 0 in eq 20 γ z is induced by the flotel s roll and pitch motions i e a 4 flotel and a 5 flotel however these rotations need to be converted to gangway coordinate system by following equation 22 γ z a 4 flotel cos θ f g w a 5 flotel sin θ f g w then α z can be obtained by the following relation 23 α z 9 0 φ z another criterion we are discussing in this paper is the gangway horizontal angle denoted by α h and α h consists of two components 24 α h β h γ h where β h and γ h are the gangway angle induced by horizontal relative motion and gangway column rotation respectively β h is expressed as 25 β h arctan l 0 sin α h 0 δ x g w l 0 cos α h 0 α h 0 where α h 0 is the angle at the equilibrium position as shown in fig 2 similar as γ z γ h is written as 26 γ h h l 0 a 4 flotel sin θ f g w a 5 flotel cos θ f g w where h is height from the end of gangway at the flotel to its center of gravity actually as we can realize all responses of the gangway we derived above are essentially determined by relative motions between two vessels it is interesting that the relative motion is only governing factor 3 the physical configuration the main dimensions of flotel shown in fig 4 in this study are of 180 m length overall 24 3 m width and 6 4 m draught the fpso in proximity is of 320 m long 54 m width and 9 m draught the displaced volumes are 15 800 t and 120 000 t respectively the relative angle between flotel and fpso is 15 in this study in the numerical simulation the heading of fpso is placed towards the north while flotel s heading is between north and northeast a telescopic gangway is located on the portside of the flotel 0 m from aft perpendicular ap 8 4 m from centerline and 18 5 m from the mean water surface and lands at the fpso s starboard 70 m from ap 25 5 m from centerline and 20 8 m from the mean water surface the gangway is equipped with a two section slidable structure with a length 38 5 m and telescopically adjustable 8 0 m the initial inclination angle in the vertical gangway plane is nearly 0 because the difference of the elevation between gangway departure and landing points is only 2 3 m in current loading condition the described physical configuration above is therefore used for defining the hydrodynamic model fig 5 shows the panel models of flotel and fpso 4 results and discussions in this section the vessel s respective motions and relative motions as well as gangway s motions under various wave conditions are presented and discussed in section 4 1 the physical model test campaign is introduced briefly the irregular waves used in experiments are reconstructed the nonlinear roll damping is calibrated and validated in both calm water and waves in section 4 2 the results of the multi body hydrodynamic analysis are shown in section 4 3 and followed by global motion discussed in section 4 4 under irregular waves of uni directional and bi directional scenarios finally the motion characters of gangway s extension rotations and trajectories are discussed in section 4 5 4 1 model test briefing and numerical reconstruction of waves the 1 50 model test was conducted to validate the hydrodynamic computation such as vessels motions and gangway s response the dynamic positioning dp capability is modeled by the equivalent dp system installed on the accommodation vessel in the experiment however which is not included in this study the experiment illustrated in fig 6 was carried out at marintek s facilities where the ocean basin is 80 m long and 50 m wide fpso s station was equivalently kept by a set of springs placed horizontally the 6 dofs of vessels global motions as well as the departure and landing of gangway were monitored by the oqus system which uses optical electronic tracking techniques jonswap spectrum was employed for generating the irregular waves table 1 summarizes irregular waves used in the experiment in which all the wave conditions were calibrated before the testing procedure with the model in place to better compare the simulation and measurement in the time domain the numerical reconstruction of the wave elevation needs to be implemented thus the measured time series at the global origin point of the tank was chosen for calibration then the reconstructed elevation at the origin and derived elevation at another location were both compared to the measurement the reconstruction requires the fft fast fourier transform technique to acquire the amplitude and corresponding phase it is noted that the amplitude and phase need to match each other carefully in this study the number of wave components is truncated at 5000 this number depends on sample rate and duration in each irregular wave test which fully covers the wave spectrum fig 7 illustrates reconstructed and measured wave elevations for wave condition 1 w1 at the origin and another location where the flotel is in place at the origin the simulation and measurement are in generally good agreement while the subtle difference appears around toughs at flotel s equilibrium location besides the stds standard derivation of simulation at two probed locations are shown identical however a small discrepancy can be found in the experiment because the flotel s location is closer to the wavemaker the energy loss downstream at the origin point may explain the std drop meanwhile wave wave interactions may be another reason 4 2 roll damping identification and validation the vessel s roll motion is regarded as a nonlinear response because the quadratic damping associated with the flow separation from bilges is predominant free decay tests were conducted and repeated in the lab for two vessels individually and in side by side configuration according to the results of the free decay test the outcome does not show any difference which means the influence due to interaction between two vessels on roll damping is negligible at least in the present case the linear and quadratic damping coefficients shown in table 2 are therefore estimated by linear fitting of the peaks of decay curve according to faltinsen 1993 by using damping coefficients the free decay is numerically carried out and is validated by comparing with prior experimental measurements the initial roll is set at the same angle with the experiment and then is released and oscillates for the duration of nine periods as shown in fig 8 flotel s roll motion agrees well with measurement in terms of amplitude at each period whereas the simulation for the fpso overestimates the damping besides results show a shorter natural period of flotel in the numerical model while a longer period for the fpso in compared to the model test one major source that causes the discrepancy stems from the error during model manufacturing to further validate the numerical model simulations in regular wave under the beam sea excitation 90 perpendicular to vessel centerline and the wave propagates from the flotel side were performed the natural period of the roll motion for each vessel was taken as the period of incident waves the wave amplitude is 1 25 m which is considered as close as h s 2 5 m in pink noise test in the lab the wave force was ramped for 10 periods before 0 s in fig 9 the black straight line marks the rao value read from rao plot which was obtained by the pink noise test the results show clearly that the roll motion of the flotel model is overestimated the damping is underestimated while that of the fpso model is underestimated just like the case in calm water for comparison purposes corresponding heave motions are depicted in fig 10 where the simulation matches measurement well therefore the validation indicates the identification of roll damping from the free decay curve may not be always reliable as expected even if the realized free decay results can show good agreement with the model test 4 3 hydrodynamic forces of flotel and fpso the frequency range in the hydrodynamic computation is selected from 0 2 to 2 6 rad s which can cover the wave spectrum used in this model test fig 11 depicts the modulus of the wave exciting force for both vessels under three different heading angles where the flotel is always on the weather side the angles shown in fig 11 are defined in the local coordinate system which can be found in fig 1 therefore 90 here is equivalent to 90 in the global system because the fpso s heading was oriented to the north furthermore the flotel is under the beam sea excitation when heading angle is 75 because the relative angle θ f between the flotel and fpso is 15 in the configuration according to fig 11 for the period of 15 s and below notable spikes can be observed on the flotel due to the hydrodynamic iterations these spikes should amplify flotel s motions even if the wave period is short these frequencies where spikes occur are associated with gap distance gap length and vessel draught etc similar spikes could also be found in the wave exciting force on the fpso however the intensity is largely reduced because of the location on the lee side in addition we can observe from the figure that the flotel s pitch moment of 75 is not much smaller than other angles which means that the pitch motion of the flotel will occur even in the beam sea condition this phenomenon does not take place when no other vessel is present in proximity 4 4 global motions under irregular waves in this section the global motions of both vessels are discussed under three different wave conditions including two uni directional and one bi directional irregular waves which are listed in table 3 the wave scenarios are carefully chosen from the scatter diagram and arranged in the lab to reflect the situations of primary wave action as well as the joint action of both primary and secondary waves it is noted that the chosen peak periods of w1 and w2 are closed to fpso s roll natural period while that of w3 is close to flotel s roll natural period without ramping in the beginning the simulation starts from 0 s to approximately 12 000 s which is the duration in the experiment the time step used is 0 5 s in the numerical simulation four linear springs are employed on each vessel to reflect the equivalent relation between restoring force and offset in the experiment the reconstructed irregular waves in section 4 1 are used as input the time series of simulation and measurement are plotted in fig 12 heave roll and pitch motions are discussed here because they are strongly linked to gangway motions according to section 2 4 fig 12 shows that the simulation manages to match the measurement despite the minor phase shift is observed the prediction on the heave motion is relatively the best among the three dofs in terms of standard derivation given in table 3 fpso s roll in simulation underestimates while flotel s roll slightly overestimates particularly under w2 w3 this discrepancy reminds of the previous findings in roll damping calibration as expected flotel motion due to its weather side location is generally larger than fpso on the lee side 4 5 gangway motions under irregular waves as we derived in section 2 4 due to the principle of telescopic equipment the gangway motions are strongly linked to and determined by the relative motions between the departure and landing position on vessels fig 13 illustrates the vertical relative motion δ z g w under w1 which indicates a good agreement between simulation and measurement δ z g w response fluctuates dramatically larger than any vessel s global motions the maximum value in this realization is up to 10 m by considering the waves of only h s 3 25 m the opposite phase out of phase is one of the reasons due to gap distance between vessels and finally it causes the superposition of respective heave motions moreover the linear displacement transferred by pitch and roll at both gangway locations also contributes it is worth mentioning that the gangway location and landing location are usually restricted in an area near either stern or bow and starboard or portside by taking the deck layout into consideration the gangway motions discussed in this section only contain the simulated results because they are not measured directly by any sensor in the model test unless specifically stated otherwise all results shown in the section containing the dynamic component only in this section various gangway motions such as rotations and extension are presented and discussed by combining the gangway operational limits which are summarized in table 4 4 5 1 the gangway rotation the simulation of gangway rotations in vertical and horizontal planes are shown in fig 14 in the vertical plane β z and γ z two components of α z have a phase difference of π this is because gangway s δ z g w and vessel s roll as well as pitch are commonly out of phase therefore α z is almost the superposition of β z and γ z according to eq 23 besides γ z shows a smaller magnitude compared to β z except for bi directional scenario this is not difficult to understand because the vertical motion directly induces the vertical plane angle nevertheless the flotel s roll and pitch motions are both well excited under the bi directional scenario where waves come from both bow and beam directions γ z derived by roll and pitch is thus amplified and becomes comparable to β z on the contrary β h and γ h the two components of α h in the horizontal plane keep at the same magnitude considering the heavy involvement of nonlinear roll the extreme response at most probable maximum mpm level is estimated by fitting the weibull distribution and positive peaks from time series the tail fitting method is adopted for better accuracy which fits 7 sets of tailed peaks i e 60 65 70 90 of tailed peaks the final weibull parameters obtained are the average values of the parameters of 7 sets table 5 summaries the extreme responses of α z β z and α h for comparison purposes the mpm extremes based on spectrum analysis rayleigh distribution in frequency domain are also included in table 5 the mpm extreme based on rayleigh distribution is given as follows 27 a m a x n α 2 λ ln 1 1 α 1 n 1 28 n d s υ 0 υ 0 λ η 2 π λ 0 s x x ω d ω η 0 ω 2 s x x ω d ω where α υ 0 n are the exceedance probability zero crossing rate and the number of mean cycles λ and η are the zeroth and second order area moment of s x x α is chosen as 0 63 here which corresponds to the most probable maximum in order to be consistent with the weibull fitting from time series apparently the maxima of direct weibull fitting shows larger extreme rotation than that derived from the rayleigh distribution assumption due to the nonlinear effect of roll damping the classic extreme estimation in the frequency domain underestimates slightly the gangway s rotation besides by comparing all wave scenarios the beam sea w1 is obviously the dominant sea state in terms of gangway rotations therefore attention should be paid to the rotation in the vertical plane in particular when the operation has to be implemented under the beam sea dnvgl 2017 recommends the maximum operational angle to the horizon β z which is 1 0 and could up to 2 0 if the gangway is fitted with enhanced slip resistance features according to table 5 only the gangway equipped with slip resistance could work under w1 and w2 in practical operation the operator prefers more rigorous limit such as 5 the response spectrum of rotation in the vertical plane is further shown in fig 15 the significant response of corresponding rotations are summarized in table 6 in w1 the majority of β z comes from the wave excitation around 0 6 rad s and so does the α z meanwhile we can observe the secondary response between 0 8 0 9 rad s due to hydrodynamic interaction γ z does not occur around the wave excitation range because the flotel s roll is not sensitive to in w2 the tertiary response is shown between 1 1 1 rad s in w2 w3 α z comprises of both wave excitation and the response of γ z in where the roll resonance occurs in terms of the gangway horizontal angle the operational criterion is considered as 4 s for the velocity v α h is the time derivative from α h the extreme velocities by weibull fitting are summarized in table 7 results show that the extreme velocities of the horizontal angle still possess a moderate distance from the operation limit which is considered not as critical as gangway s angle in the vertical plane 4 5 2 the gangway extension the telescopic gangway extension needs to be restricted in a certain range within extendable length according to the specification manual dnvgl 2017 further requests the minimum reserved extendable length must be 1 l 0 20 50 and no less than 1 m in this case the reserved margin is therefore 1 37 m besides the extension velocity is also one of the monitored parameters which is not discussed in this paper fig 16 plots the dynamic extension under w1 by comparing d e x t and the last term of d e x t according to eq 19 the positive d e x t means extending while a negative value means shortening the figure shows intentionally the positive part only two curves in the figure are generally close to each other which demonstrates the extension is mainly contributed by δ y g w even so the minor discrepancy can be observed for some cycles which proves that the other two terms linked to gangway s δ x g w and δ z g w can also influence it is worth noting that δ x g w and δ z g w only cause the extending of gangway regardless of the positive or negative response which is physically reasonable by the perception of the operational principle of the telescopic gangway consequently δ y g w becomes the only source for the shortening of the gangway the mpm extremes of gangway extension from weibull fitting are summarized in table 8 the maximum value 5 93 m among the three extremes still can guarantees 2 07 m 8 5 93 reserved extendable length which is considered acceptable according to rule specified margin 1 37 m in practical operation the operator may adopt more rigorous criteria which is 5 5 m for the dynamic extension in this case wave scenario w1 is not permitted for the gangway operation 4 5 3 the velocity of gangway top base plate besides gangway s extension and rotation the velocity at gangway top base plate as shown in fig 3 needs also to be checked against the operational limiting criteria according to gangway vendor and operator the maximum accepted velocity v x t o w e r v y t o w e r and v z t o w e r are set as 1 5 m s 3 2 m s and 4 8 m s respectively the velocity can be obtained by employing the time derivative of displacement at the location of the gangway top base plate which is determined by eq 16 fig 17 present the velocities of gangway top base plate for the three wave scenarios the corresponding extreme responses by weibull fitting are summarized in table 9 results indicate that v x t o w e r is much far below the criterion 1 5m s while v y t o w e r gets slightly closer to its criterion nevertheless the governing condition here is obviously the vertical velocity v z t o w e r the maximum response under w1 is just 10 less than the 4 8 m s threshold which suggests the roll motion leads the large response at the base plate on top of gangway tower 4 5 4 the trajectory of gangway motion in engineering practice it is important understand the relation of gangway extension and inclination the δ y gw δ z gw trajectory plot is a practical way to illustrate approximately in a 2d plane instead of a 3d three subplots in fig 18 show gangway s motion behaviors for all three wave conditions respectively for the convenience of visualization the equilibrium positions are added to δ y gw and δ z gw i e gangway s initial length and static height the departure point on the flotel is set as a fixed reference point the sketch of the gangway plotted by the solid lines illustrates the equilibrium position while dash lines represent the gangway s dynamic response undoubtedly the largest gangway motion occurs under w1 while the smallest under w2 by simply comparing the amplitude of the trajectory moreover three different motion patterns are shown for w1 the trajectory forms an oval shape and oscillates in the 1st and 3rd quadrants if the equilibrium landing point is considered as the origin it means δ y gw and δ z gw are more or less in phase on the contrary w2 shows clearly a different pattern which implies δ y gw and δ z gw are out of phase the situation of w2 w3 is just in between 5 concluding remarks numerical modeling and simulation of telescopic gangway motions including the extension inclination and rotation were studied in time domain the hydrodynamic interaction of a multi body system consisting of a fpso and an flotel was analyzed by 3d diffraction and radiation computation the nonlinear roll damping is studied in calm water and in waves the simulation and measurement of various results are compared and interpreted under uni directional and bi directional wave scenarios the wave exciting force shows quite a few additional spikes which occur around the common wave period range in terms of flotel on the weather side indeed flotel s global motions are later found amplified obviously in the time domain simulation and even the notable pitch motion was excited under the beam sea excitation the simulation and measurement have generally a good agreement except for roll motion whose performance in free decay and regular wave shows discrepancy by using the same damping coefficients the time domain method facilitates the nonlinear factor such as roll damping directly and the nonlinearity is proved to affect the maximum response of gangway motion by comparing the extremes from both direct weifull fitting and spectral analysis in the frequency domain the time domain method opens a door to fully coupled analysis which may take into account the complex direct simulation of motion compensated gangway and the vessel s dynamic positioning system moreover the time domain method can help and assist the operator and designer to create an intuitive impression regarding the dynamic response of gangway and the vessels the gangway extension is dominated by gangway relative motion in y axis of gangway coordinate system besides relative motions in z axis and x axis also contributes in a small amount but never induce gangway retraction under the irregular waves with 3 25 m h s only the relative motion in z axis shows significant response up to 10 m due when they are out of phase similarly the gangway rotation and inclination in the vertical plane are also subjected to a large dynamic angle of about 17 by comparing against various operational limits gangway s vertical rotation is the most governing factor among all operational criteria besides the vertical velocity of gangway top base plate is close to the operational limit which suggests the roll motion under beam sea causes the large response at the base plate on top of gangway tower the trajectory plot illustrates different motion patterns due to different wave headings in where relative motions in y axis and z axis show different phase relation this study not only investigates the motion

20772,the dynamic response of the telescopic gangway strongly links to the relative motion which is significant when the gangway vessel works along with another floating unit in proximity the failure might cause operational downtime or even personnel casualty in this paper gangway motions including extension retraction rotations and relative motions are studied numerically in the time domain and compared to experimental measurements the hydrodynamic interaction of the multi body system is analyzed by 3d diffraction and radiation computation in the frequency domain the nonlinear roll damping is calibrated and validated in both free decay and regular waves two uni directional scenarios of primary irregular waves and one bi directional scenario of both primary and secondary irregular waves are taken into account in the study remarkable vertical motion up to 10 m between gangway departure and landing points are observed even if the significant wave height is only 3 25 m extreme value analysis shows the gangway inclination can be as high as 17 which exceeds the maximum acceptance so that enhanced slip resistance feature must be added on the gangway the different patterns of gangway motion trajectory in the vertical plane are also illustrated to corroborate the conclusion keywords gangway offshore operation time domain multi body hydrodynamics flotel 1 introduction as the demand for a safe and efficient walk to work approach prevails in the offshore operation activity a remarkable growth in the use of offshore gangway for the transfer of personnel from one to another offshore facility pérez et al 2014 can be expected besides the oil and gas industry there is also huge potential for the growth of gangway utilization in the offshore wind industry leanwind 2018 gangway operation it has several rigorous operational limitations such as the dynamic inclination angle extending and retraction of gangway etc gangway access can be even more challenging when it connects to a floating structure instead of a fixed installation the relative motions between gangway based vessel and the floating structure are the main concern for telescopic gangway in particular gangway motions are almost dominated by the dynamic response of departure and landing points once gangway failure occurs it will result in downtime financial loss and cause injury or even death therefore before the commencement of work relevant parties owner operator and classification must ensure all indicators stay within operational limits all time during operation to the best of authors knowledge the attention to the gangway analysis has gained focus in recent years due to the increase use of accommodation vessels flotel and the safety of walk to work was valued by the industry the study in specialized gangway motion especially the telescopic type has been rarely done and thus little is known about its underlying physics as well as its motion characteristics guanche et al 2016 conducted numerical simulation on relative motions of a supply vessel and semi submersible floating wind turbine to study the gangway walkability in general the dynamic gangway response is induced by the wave actions especially the first order wave excitation the response can be significant because the gangway location is usually above the main deck the situation may even worsen if the operation vessel is the traditional ship shape like the case in the present study when the operation vessel approaches another floating unit the motion characteristics are altered depending on the physical layout and heading condition the motion of the operation vessel may get amplified and lead to remarkable gangway motions in numerical prediction one problem that needs to be solved is the multi body hydrodynamics which analyzes the wave structure and structure structure interactions the 3d radiation and diffraction computation within the potential flow theory is widely used previous researchers adopted the method and tried to study the offloading operation between flng and lng carriers buchner et al 2001 kim et al 2003 hong et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 fournier et al 2006 pauw et al 2007 pessoa et al 2015 special attention was paid to the wave resonance in the gap feng and bai 2017 zhao et al 2018 chua et al 2018 somehow the recent focus is placed more on wave kinematics rather than structure motions inspired by existing research summarized above huang et al 2018 investigated numerically the dynamic gangway response in the frequency domain the impact of multi body interaction was interpreted and rao of relative motion and gangway dynamic response are computed and compared to the experimental values in light of this study we aim to investigate gangway motions in the time domain where the complicated motion is intuitively presented and the nonlinear factor or time dependent parameter can be handled straightforward the time series results also allow higher level numerical extreme value analysis certainly the analysis in the time domain enables the cycle by cycle comparison between simulation and measurement in this study by focusing on the irregular waves various gangway operational limits are taken into account and discussed in this paper the dynamic motions of fpso and flotel where the gangway was installed are analyzed in the time domain sections 2 1 and 2 3 briefly introduce the numerical method and modeling as the input of the time domain study the multi body hydrodynamic problem is solved by the 3d diffraction and radiation computation which is elucidated in section 2 2 gangway s extension and various rotations are derived and elaborated in section 2 4 in general results are presented in time series and compared to the measurement from the model test note that some of the gangway motions were not recorded in the experiment because the dynamic roll response is heavily involved in the gangway motions the calibration and validation of nonlinear damping were carried out in calm water and in the presence of waves section 4 2 the irregular waves considered in the study include two uni directional scenarios of primary wave and one bi directional scenario comprising both primary and secondary waves to guarantee the identical wave conditions between simulation and measurement irregular waves were reconstructed by carefully matching the measured wave elevation section 4 1 the flotel s global motions show a large dynamic response due to the presence of the fpso in proximity section 4 4 a remarkable relative vertical motion up to 10 m occurs the most probable maximum by weibull fitting indicates gangway s inclination in the vertical plane can be as high as 17 which request gangway to be equipped the enhanced slip resistance feature section 4 5 the trajectory of gangway motions in the vertical plane illustrates three different patterns due to the phase difference generally the numerical simulation shows a good agreement with the results by model test finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the theoretical background 2 1 coordinate systems in general two different coordinate systems are defined to describe the kinematics of floating structure floater including the earth fixed global system o x y z and local inertial system o x y z attached to each moving floater the floater is considered as a rigid body of 6 dofs degree of freedom fig 1 illustrates both the coordinate systems and the directional convention of environmental load in the 2d o x y plane both coordinate systems follow right hand rule the horizontal o x y and o x y planes coincide with the undisturbed free surface and the vertical o z and o z axes are orienting positively upward 2 2 multi body diffraction and radiation the computation of hydrodynamic loads on a multi body system is considered it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational so that a velocity potential φ exists deep water is assumed and the normal vector is defined positively pointing inwards the fluid domain in the steady state the velocity potential at a flow field point p is written as 1 φ p t re ϕ p e i ω t based on the linear superposition principle the spatial potential ϕ is decomposed into 2 ϕ m 1 m j 1 6 i ω η j m ϕ j m a 0 ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 m where a 0 is the amplitude of incident waves ϕ 7 m denotes the scattering potential η j m means the amplitude of the motion in j mode of body m and ϕ j m is the corresponding radiation potential besides ϕ 0 is the potential of incident waves per unit amplitude given by 3 ϕ 0 g ω e k 0 z i x cos β y sin β where β and k 0 denote the heading angle and wavenumber of incident waves respectively the linearized boundary value problem for the potential ϕ j m with j 1 2 7 is expressed as chen 2004 lee and newman 2005 4a 2 ϕ j m 0 in the fluid domain 4b ϕ j m n n j m on h m 4c k 0 ϕ j m ϕ j m z 0 at z 0 4d lim r r ϕ j m r i k 0 ϕ j m 0 in the far field where n j m denotes the generalized vector defined as 5 n j m n j on h m 0 otherwise with n j n j for j 1 2 3 r n for j 4 5 6 n ϕ 0 for j 7 where h m is the hull surface of the body m the boundary value problem 4 is solved by means of the boundary element method in which the free surface green function is adopted as the fundamental solution and the boundary integral equation is written as 6 2 π ϕ j p m h m ϕ j q n q g p q g p q n q ϕ j q d s where p x y z and q ξ η ζ denote the flow field and source points respectively and g is the free surface green function written as wehausen and laitone 1960 7 g 1 r 1 d g f with r d x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 where g f is the free surface term in the form of a single integral by solving the boundary integral equation 6 the radiation and diffraction potentials can be determined and then the added mass a k j n m wave radiation damping b k j n m and the wave exciting force f k m are obtained 8 i ω a k j n m b k j n m i ω ρ h n ϕ j m n k d s and f k n i ω ρ a 0 h n ϕ 0 ϕ 7 n n k d s for the computation of the added mass at infinite frequency the green function satisfying the free surface condition at infinite frequency is adopted and it is expressed as 9 g 1 r 1 d the above mentioned method provides wave force and hydrodynamic coefficients for the time domain computation the software hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 is employed which is dedicated for 3d diffraction and radiation calculation in frequency domain 2 3 time domain dynamics of floating structures as a sequel to the frequency domain computation the time domain analysis is considered the time domain motion computation relies on the motion equations based on newton s 2nd law the frequency dependent wave radiation damping and added mass are needed which are therefore treated further by using cummins s equation cummins 1962 10 m m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ b lin x t b qua x t x t c x t f t where m is the mass matrix of dimension 6 n 6 n with n denoting the number of bodies here c denotes linear stiffness matrix such as the hydrostatic restoring matrix b lin and b qua represent frequency independent linear and quadratic damping matrix f is the external force vector which consists of the environmental force connection force such as mooring or other force acting on the structure k is the retardation function defined as 11 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where b and ω are radiation damping and angular frequency meanwhile the added mass m a at the infinite frequency can alternatively be estimated by 12 m a m a ω 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t where ω is an arbitrary frequency in reality it is impractical and unnecessary to carry out the computation from zero to infinite frequency in the diffraction and radiation computation therefore the artificial decay is conducted on b for a certain range of frequencies beyond both upper and lower cutoff points before calculating eq 11 τ also needs to be cut off at a reasonable duration where no more fluctuation exists in k regarding m a the mean value can be taken by repeating eq 12 at different ω for reliable precision alternatively the added mass at infinity frequency is also able to be provided by radiation calculation directly based on 6 and 9 the motion equation in 10 with respect to floater s cog center of gravity is solved in the local coordinate system at each time step by 4th order runge kutta scheme then the location of cog and other points to be studied such as fairlead is converted to the global coordinate system the environmental load of floater is updated at each time step based on the filtered low frequency position when considering the irregular waves the elevation is described by a series of linear harmonic waves as follows 13 η t x β wave re i 1 n a i e i ω i t k i x ϵ i with x cos β wave x sin β wave y where x y and β wave are locations in north and west as well as wave incoming direction in the global system ϵ i and k i denote random phase and wavenumber respectively and the wavenumber satisfies the dispersion equation ω 2 g k newman 1977 a i is the wave amplitude determined by 14 a i 2 s η η ω i δ ω where s η η is the wave spectrum the linear wave exciting force is then expressed as 15 f wave 1 t ℜ i 1 n a i 1 a i e i φ i e i ω i t k i x ϵ i where a i 1 φ i are the amplitude of the linear wave force and corresponding phase determined by the hydrodynamic analysis the amplitude and phase could be updated at each time step by interpolation due to the change of floater s heading the second order wave forces and other types of environmental forces are not presented here because they are not the scope of this paper the time domain computations were performed by in house software kraken which is developed for dynamic analysis of floating systems and specialized in offshore operation study 2 4 gangway motions in this section the critical gangway motions are derived including telescopic extension and rotations in vertical and horizontal planes we introduced another coordinate system to study the gangway fig 2 shows whole system which comprises two vessels in nonparallel side by side configuration and the gangway in 2d x y plane 2 4 1 gangway extension a key objective is to obtain the relative motions therefore two vessels as well as the gangway are defined in the respective local coordinate systems the reference system can be defined fixed to either flotel or fpso here we choose fpso as the frame of reference the three translation displacements at a fixed point on the vessel in the local coordinate system can be expressed as following according to rigid body kinematics 16 x y z a 1 a 2 a 3 0 z g w y g w z g w 0 x g w y g w x g w 0 a 4 a 5 a 6 where a i i 1 6 denote surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively besides x g w y g w z g w is the location a point on the gangway to transfer the motion of the flotel to the reference system with respect to the fpso the following relation is used 17 x y z cos θ f sin θ f 0 sin θ f cos θ f 0 0 0 1 x y z finally relative motions δ x δ y δ z in the frame of reference with respect to the fpso can be obtained by subtraction of respective displacement as in eqs 16 and 17 relative motions in the frame of reference with respect to the fpso are further converted to the system to the gangway 18 δ x g w δ y g w δ z g w cos θ g w sin θ g w 0 sin θ g w cos θ g w 0 0 0 1 δ x δ y δ z gangway extension is directly relevant to motions at departure and landing points of gangway on each vessel according to the geometrical relation it is expressed as 19 d e x t l 0 1 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 1 l 0 1 cos arctan δ x g w l 0 1 δ y g w cos arctan δ x g w l 0 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 where l 0 is gangway original length the three terms on the right hand side of 19 are contributions of δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w respectively 2 4 2 gangway rotation one important parameter in the gangway analysis is the angle between gangway and gangway top base plate denoted by α z as illustrated in fig 3 to calculate α z we consider the angle between gangway and gangway tower φ z as follows according to geometrical relation 20 φ z 9 0 β z γ z where β z and γ z are the angle between gangway and horizontal plane and angle between gangway tower and vertical plane respectively β z can be straightforwardly determined by the vertical relative motion of both gangway ends 0 of gangway and horizontal plane in static equilibrium position 21 β z δ z g w l 0 in eq 20 γ z is induced by the flotel s roll and pitch motions i e a 4 flotel and a 5 flotel however these rotations need to be converted to gangway coordinate system by following equation 22 γ z a 4 flotel cos θ f g w a 5 flotel sin θ f g w then α z can be obtained by the following relation 23 α z 9 0 φ z another criterion we are discussing in this paper is the gangway horizontal angle denoted by α h and α h consists of two components 24 α h β h γ h where β h and γ h are the gangway angle induced by horizontal relative motion and gangway column rotation respectively β h is expressed as 25 β h arctan l 0 sin α h 0 δ x g w l 0 cos α h 0 α h 0 where α h 0 is the angle at the equilibrium position as shown in fig 2 similar as γ z γ h is written as 26 γ h h l 0 a 4 flotel sin θ f g w a 5 flotel cos θ f g w where h is height from the end of gangway at the flotel to its center of gravity actually as we can realize all responses of the gangway we derived above are essentially determined by relative motions between two vessels it is interesting that the relative motion is only governing factor 3 the physical configuration the main dimensions of flotel shown in fig 4 in this study are of 180 m length overall 24 3 m width and 6 4 m draught the fpso in proximity is of 320 m long 54 m width and 9 m draught the displaced volumes are 15 800 t and 120 000 t respectively the relative angle between flotel and fpso is 15 in this study in the numerical simulation the heading of fpso is placed towards the north while flotel s heading is between north and northeast a telescopic gangway is located on the portside of the flotel 0 m from aft perpendicular ap 8 4 m from centerline and 18 5 m from the mean water surface and lands at the fpso s starboard 70 m from ap 25 5 m from centerline and 20 8 m from the mean water surface the gangway is equipped with a two section slidable structure with a length 38 5 m and telescopically adjustable 8 0 m the initial inclination angle in the vertical gangway plane is nearly 0 because the difference of the elevation between gangway departure and landing points is only 2 3 m in current loading condition the described physical configuration above is therefore used for defining the hydrodynamic model fig 5 shows the panel models of flotel and fpso 4 results and discussions in this section the vessel s respective motions and relative motions as well as gangway s motions under various wave conditions are presented and discussed in section 4 1 the physical model test campaign is introduced briefly the irregular waves used in experiments are reconstructed the nonlinear roll damping is calibrated and validated in both calm water and waves in section 4 2 the results of the multi body hydrodynamic analysis are shown in section 4 3 and followed by global motion discussed in section 4 4 under irregular waves of uni directional and bi directional scenarios finally the motion characters of gangway s extension rotations and trajectories are discussed in section 4 5 4 1 model test briefing and numerical reconstruction of waves the 1 50 model test was conducted to validate the hydrodynamic computation such as vessels motions and gangway s response the dynamic positioning dp capability is modeled by the equivalent dp system installed on the accommodation vessel in the experiment however which is not included in this study the experiment illustrated in fig 6 was carried out at marintek s facilities where the ocean basin is 80 m long and 50 m wide fpso s station was equivalently kept by a set of springs placed horizontally the 6 dofs of vessels global motions as well as the departure and landing of gangway were monitored by the oqus system which uses optical electronic tracking techniques jonswap spectrum was employed for generating the irregular waves table 1 summarizes irregular waves used in the experiment in which all the wave conditions were calibrated before the testing procedure with the model in place to better compare the simulation and measurement in the time domain the numerical reconstruction of the wave elevation needs to be implemented thus the measured time series at the global origin point of the tank was chosen for calibration then the reconstructed elevation at the origin and derived elevation at another location were both compared to the measurement the reconstruction requires the fft fast fourier transform technique to acquire the amplitude and corresponding phase it is noted that the amplitude and phase need to match each other carefully in this study the number of wave components is truncated at 5000 this number depends on sample rate and duration in each irregular wave test which fully covers the wave spectrum fig 7 illustrates reconstructed and measured wave elevations for wave condition 1 w1 at the origin and another location where the flotel is in place at the origin the simulation and measurement are in generally good agreement while the subtle difference appears around toughs at flotel s equilibrium location besides the stds standard derivation of simulation at two probed locations are shown identical however a small discrepancy can be found in the experiment because the flotel s location is closer to the wavemaker the energy loss downstream at the origin point may explain the std drop meanwhile wave wave interactions may be another reason 4 2 roll damping identification and validation the vessel s roll motion is regarded as a nonlinear response because the quadratic damping associated with the flow separation from bilges is predominant free decay tests were conducted and repeated in the lab for two vessels individually and in side by side configuration according to the results of the free decay test the outcome does not show any difference which means the influence due to interaction between two vessels on roll damping is negligible at least in the present case the linear and quadratic damping coefficients shown in table 2 are therefore estimated by linear fitting of the peaks of decay curve according to faltinsen 1993 by using damping coefficients the free decay is numerically carried out and is validated by comparing with prior experimental measurements the initial roll is set at the same angle with the experiment and then is released and oscillates for the duration of nine periods as shown in fig 8 flotel s roll motion agrees well with measurement in terms of amplitude at each period whereas the simulation for the fpso overestimates the damping besides results show a shorter natural period of flotel in the numerical model while a longer period for the fpso in compared to the model test one major source that causes the discrepancy stems from the error during model manufacturing to further validate the numerical model simulations in regular wave under the beam sea excitation 90 perpendicular to vessel centerline and the wave propagates from the flotel side were performed the natural period of the roll motion for each vessel was taken as the period of incident waves the wave amplitude is 1 25 m which is considered as close as h s 2 5 m in pink noise test in the lab the wave force was ramped for 10 periods before 0 s in fig 9 the black straight line marks the rao value read from rao plot which was obtained by the pink noise test the results show clearly that the roll motion of the flotel model is overestimated the damping is underestimated while that of the fpso model is underestimated just like the case in calm water for comparison purposes corresponding heave motions are depicted in fig 10 where the simulation matches measurement well therefore the validation indicates the identification of roll damping from the free decay curve may not be always reliable as expected even if the realized free decay results can show good agreement with the model test 4 3 hydrodynamic forces of flotel and fpso the frequency range in the hydrodynamic computation is selected from 0 2 to 2 6 rad s which can cover the wave spectrum used in this model test fig 11 depicts the modulus of the wave exciting force for both vessels under three different heading angles where the flotel is always on the weather side the angles shown in fig 11 are defined in the local coordinate system which can be found in fig 1 therefore 90 here is equivalent to 90 in the global system because the fpso s heading was oriented to the north furthermore the flotel is under the beam sea excitation when heading angle is 75 because the relative angle θ f between the flotel and fpso is 15 in the configuration according to fig 11 for the period of 15 s and below notable spikes can be observed on the flotel due to the hydrodynamic iterations these spikes should amplify flotel s motions even if the wave period is short these frequencies where spikes occur are associated with gap distance gap length and vessel draught etc similar spikes could also be found in the wave exciting force on the fpso however the intensity is largely reduced because of the location on the lee side in addition we can observe from the figure that the flotel s pitch moment of 75 is not much smaller than other angles which means that the pitch motion of the flotel will occur even in the beam sea condition this phenomenon does not take place when no other vessel is present in proximity 4 4 global motions under irregular waves in this section the global motions of both vessels are discussed under three different wave conditions including two uni directional and one bi directional irregular waves which are listed in table 3 the wave scenarios are carefully chosen from the scatter diagram and arranged in the lab to reflect the situations of primary wave action as well as the joint action of both primary and secondary waves it is noted that the chosen peak periods of w1 and w2 are closed to fpso s roll natural period while that of w3 is close to flotel s roll natural period without ramping in the beginning the simulation starts from 0 s to approximately 12 000 s which is the duration in the experiment the time step used is 0 5 s in the numerical simulation four linear springs are employed on each vessel to reflect the equivalent relation between restoring force and offset in the experiment the reconstructed irregular waves in section 4 1 are used as input the time series of simulation and measurement are plotted in fig 12 heave roll and pitch motions are discussed here because they are strongly linked to gangway motions according to section 2 4 fig 12 shows that the simulation manages to match the measurement despite the minor phase shift is observed the prediction on the heave motion is relatively the best among the three dofs in terms of standard derivation given in table 3 fpso s roll in simulation underestimates while flotel s roll slightly overestimates particularly under w2 w3 this discrepancy reminds of the previous findings in roll damping calibration as expected flotel motion due to its weather side location is generally larger than fpso on the lee side 4 5 gangway motions under irregular waves as we derived in section 2 4 due to the principle of telescopic equipment the gangway motions are strongly linked to and determined by the relative motions between the departure and landing position on vessels fig 13 illustrates the vertical relative motion δ z g w under w1 which indicates a good agreement between simulation and measurement δ z g w response fluctuates dramatically larger than any vessel s global motions the maximum value in this realization is up to 10 m by considering the waves of only h s 3 25 m the opposite phase out of phase is one of the reasons due to gap distance between vessels and finally it causes the superposition of respective heave motions moreover the linear displacement transferred by pitch and roll at both gangway locations also contributes it is worth mentioning that the gangway location and landing location are usually restricted in an area near either stern or bow and starboard or portside by taking the deck layout into consideration the gangway motions discussed in this section only contain the simulated results because they are not measured directly by any sensor in the model test unless specifically stated otherwise all results shown in the section containing the dynamic component only in this section various gangway motions such as rotations and extension are presented and discussed by combining the gangway operational limits which are summarized in table 4 4 5 1 the gangway rotation the simulation of gangway rotations in vertical and horizontal planes are shown in fig 14 in the vertical plane β z and γ z two components of α z have a phase difference of π this is because gangway s δ z g w and vessel s roll as well as pitch are commonly out of phase therefore α z is almost the superposition of β z and γ z according to eq 23 besides γ z shows a smaller magnitude compared to β z except for bi directional scenario this is not difficult to understand because the vertical motion directly induces the vertical plane angle nevertheless the flotel s roll and pitch motions are both well excited under the bi directional scenario where waves come from both bow and beam directions γ z derived by roll and pitch is thus amplified and becomes comparable to β z on the contrary β h and γ h the two components of α h in the horizontal plane keep at the same magnitude considering the heavy involvement of nonlinear roll the extreme response at most probable maximum mpm level is estimated by fitting the weibull distribution and positive peaks from time series the tail fitting method is adopted for better accuracy which fits 7 sets of tailed peaks i e 60 65 70 90 of tailed peaks the final weibull parameters obtained are the average values of the parameters of 7 sets table 5 summaries the extreme responses of α z β z and α h for comparison purposes the mpm extremes based on spectrum analysis rayleigh distribution in frequency domain are also included in table 5 the mpm extreme based on rayleigh distribution is given as follows 27 a m a x n α 2 λ ln 1 1 α 1 n 1 28 n d s υ 0 υ 0 λ η 2 π λ 0 s x x ω d ω η 0 ω 2 s x x ω d ω where α υ 0 n are the exceedance probability zero crossing rate and the number of mean cycles λ and η are the zeroth and second order area moment of s x x α is chosen as 0 63 here which corresponds to the most probable maximum in order to be consistent with the weibull fitting from time series apparently the maxima of direct weibull fitting shows larger extreme rotation than that derived from the rayleigh distribution assumption due to the nonlinear effect of roll damping the classic extreme estimation in the frequency domain underestimates slightly the gangway s rotation besides by comparing all wave scenarios the beam sea w1 is obviously the dominant sea state in terms of gangway rotations therefore attention should be paid to the rotation in the vertical plane in particular when the operation has to be implemented under the beam sea dnvgl 2017 recommends the maximum operational angle to the horizon β z which is 1 0 and could up to 2 0 if the gangway is fitted with enhanced slip resistance features according to table 5 only the gangway equipped with slip resistance could work under w1 and w2 in practical operation the operator prefers more rigorous limit such as 5 the response spectrum of rotation in the vertical plane is further shown in fig 15 the significant response of corresponding rotations are summarized in table 6 in w1 the majority of β z comes from the wave excitation around 0 6 rad s and so does the α z meanwhile we can observe the secondary response between 0 8 0 9 rad s due to hydrodynamic interaction γ z does not occur around the wave excitation range because the flotel s roll is not sensitive to in w2 the tertiary response is shown between 1 1 1 rad s in w2 w3 α z comprises of both wave excitation and the response of γ z in where the roll resonance occurs in terms of the gangway horizontal angle the operational criterion is considered as 4 s for the velocity v α h is the time derivative from α h the extreme velocities by weibull fitting are summarized in table 7 results show that the extreme velocities of the horizontal angle still possess a moderate distance from the operation limit which is considered not as critical as gangway s angle in the vertical plane 4 5 2 the gangway extension the telescopic gangway extension needs to be restricted in a certain range within extendable length according to the specification manual dnvgl 2017 further requests the minimum reserved extendable length must be 1 l 0 20 50 and no less than 1 m in this case the reserved margin is therefore 1 37 m besides the extension velocity is also one of the monitored parameters which is not discussed in this paper fig 16 plots the dynamic extension under w1 by comparing d e x t and the last term of d e x t according to eq 19 the positive d e x t means extending while a negative value means shortening the figure shows intentionally the positive part only two curves in the figure are generally close to each other which demonstrates the extension is mainly contributed by δ y g w even so the minor discrepancy can be observed for some cycles which proves that the other two terms linked to gangway s δ x g w and δ z g w can also influence it is worth noting that δ x g w and δ z g w only cause the extending of gangway regardless of the positive or negative response which is physically reasonable by the perception of the operational principle of the telescopic gangway consequently δ y g w becomes the only source for the shortening of the gangway the mpm extremes of gangway extension from weibull fitting are summarized in table 8 the maximum value 5 93 m among the three extremes still can guarantees 2 07 m 8 5 93 reserved extendable length which is considered acceptable according to rule specified margin 1 37 m in practical operation the operator may adopt more rigorous criteria which is 5 5 m for the dynamic extension in this case wave scenario w1 is not permitted for the gangway operation 4 5 3 the velocity of gangway top base plate besides gangway s extension and rotation the velocity at gangway top base plate as shown in fig 3 needs also to be checked against the operational limiting criteria according to gangway vendor and operator the maximum accepted velocity v x t o w e r v y t o w e r and v z t o w e r are set as 1 5 m s 3 2 m s and 4 8 m s respectively the velocity can be obtained by employing the time derivative of displacement at the location of the gangway top base plate which is determined by eq 16 fig 17 present the velocities of gangway top base plate for the three wave scenarios the corresponding extreme responses by weibull fitting are summarized in table 9 results indicate that v x t o w e r is much far below the criterion 1 5m s while v y t o w e r gets slightly closer to its criterion nevertheless the governing condition here is obviously the vertical velocity v z t o w e r the maximum response under w1 is just 10 less than the 4 8 m s threshold which suggests the roll motion leads the large response at the base plate on top of gangway tower 4 5 4 the trajectory of gangway motion in engineering practice it is important understand the relation of gangway extension and inclination the δ y gw δ z gw trajectory plot is a practical way to illustrate approximately in a 2d plane instead of a 3d three subplots in fig 18 show gangway s motion behaviors for all three wave conditions respectively for the convenience of visualization the equilibrium positions are added to δ y gw and δ z gw i e gangway s initial length and static height the departure point on the flotel is set as a fixed reference point the sketch of the gangway plotted by the solid lines illustrates the equilibrium position while dash lines represent the gangway s dynamic response undoubtedly the largest gangway motion occurs under w1 while the smallest under w2 by simply comparing the amplitude of the trajectory moreover three different motion patterns are shown for w1 the trajectory forms an oval shape and oscillates in the 1st and 3rd quadrants if the equilibrium landing point is considered as the origin it means δ y gw and δ z gw are more or less in phase on the contrary w2 shows clearly a different pattern which implies δ y gw and δ z gw are out of phase the situation of w2 w3 is just in between 5 concluding remarks numerical modeling and simulation of telescopic gangway motions including the extension inclination and rotation were studied in time domain the hydrodynamic interaction of a multi body system consisting of a fpso and an flotel was analyzed by 3d diffraction and radiation computation the nonlinear roll damping is studied in calm water and in waves the simulation and measurement of various results are compared and interpreted under uni directional and bi directional wave scenarios the wave exciting force shows quite a few additional spikes which occur around the common wave period range in terms of flotel on the weather side indeed flotel s global motions are later found amplified obviously in the time domain simulation and even the notable pitch motion was excited under the beam sea excitation the simulation and measurement have generally a good agreement except for roll motion whose performance in free decay and regular wave shows discrepancy by using the same damping coefficients the time domain method facilitates the nonlinear factor such as roll damping directly and the nonlinearity is proved to affect the maximum response of gangway motion by comparing the extremes from both direct weifull fitting and spectral analysis in the frequency domain the time domain method opens a door to fully coupled analysis which may take into account the complex direct simulation of motion compensated gangway and the vessel s dynamic positioning system moreover the time domain method can help and assist the operator and designer to create an intuitive impression regarding the dynamic response of gangway and the vessels the gangway extension is dominated by gangway relative motion in y axis of gangway coordinate system besides relative motions in z axis and x axis also contributes in a small amount but never induce gangway retraction under the irregular waves with 3 25 m h s only the relative motion in z axis shows significant response up to 10 m due when they are out of phase similarly the gangway rotation and inclination in the vertical plane are also subjected to a large dynamic angle of about 17 by comparing against various operational limits gangway s vertical rotation is the most governing factor among all operational criteria besides the vertical velocity of gangway top base plate is close to the operational limit which suggests the roll motion under beam sea causes the large response at the base plate on top of gangway tower the trajectory plot illustrates different motion patterns due to different wave headings in where relative motions in y axis and z axis show different phase relation this study not only investigates the motion characteristics of the gangway linking two vessels in nonparallel side by side configuration but also provides a useful guidance to engineering practice credit authorship contribution statement binbin

are commonly used for fabricating the substructure of the most common type of offshore structures i e jacket type platforms the intersection of tubular members in which one end of the branch members i e braces are attached to the undisturbed outer surface of the main member i e chord by welding is named a tubular joint although the multi planar joints cover the majority of practical applications investigations on their structural behavior even at the ambient temperature are rather limited because of the complexity and high cost involved numerous studies have been conducted to examine the strength of multi planar tubular connections at the ambient temperature for example the reader is referred to paul et al 1992 makino et al 1993 forti et al 2015 and lee and wilmshurst 1995 1996 1997 on tubular kk joints paul et al 1993 and scola et al 1990 on tubular tt joints and the studies of van der vegte et al van der vegte et al 2005 and paul et al 1989 on tubular xx joints deterioration of the physical properties of the steel at elevated temperatures is a considerable issue hence at fire condition a tubular joint might collapse under a load considerably less than its strength at ambient temperature as a result the whole structure may collapse after the failure of one or several joints at the fire condition recently azari dodaran and ahmadi 2019a 2019b 2020 conducted parametric investigations on the static behavior of unreinforced two planar tt kt and kk joints they found that at high temperatures the ultimate bearing capacity of a multi planar joint might decrease dramatically therefore there is an urgent need to evaluate the fire resistance of multi planar tubular joints a great deal of studies have been conducted on the examination of the reinforcing methods of tubular joints one useful method that has been reported in the literature is using the internal stiffening rings sawada et al 1979 examined the static and fatigue behavior of chs t joints and concluded that a stiffening ring considerably enhances the strength of the joint van der vegte et al van der vegte et al 1991 investigated the strength of uniplanar x joint stiffened by t shaped ring stiffeners under axial load and concluded that the height of the t shaped stiffeners has a remarkable influence on the bearing capacity of uniplanar x joints lee and llewelyn parry 2004 2005 published the results of a detailed parametric study based on the fe method on the structural behavior of internally ring stiffened dt and t joints they recommended a predictive theoretical model for determining the static strength of such joints zhang et al 2004 concluded that using the internal rings can enhance the ultimate load of x joints thandavamoorthy et al 1999 and thandavamoorthy 2000 experimentally examined the effect of internal rings on the static strength of chs y and t joints lan et al 2016 performed a parametric investigation on the static strength of internally saddle and crown reinforced dt t and y joints under brace axial loading at high temperatures they found that the influences of the stiffening location and joint s geometrical characteristics on the strength reduction at fire condition fall in a narrow area moreover these researchers proposed a formula for calculating the static strength reduction ahmadi 2016 and nassiraei 2020 provided additional information on other aspects of stiffened tubular joints behavior such as the stress concentration and local joint flexibility as it can be concluded from preceding discussion most of the studies on the performance of internal ring stiffeners have focused on uniplanar joints at ambient temperatures and it is obvious that there is a shortage of understanding of the static behavior of multi tubular tt joints reinforced with internal rings at fire induced elevated temperatures in addition there are no design formulas for determining the ultimate load of this joint type therefore in this study after the validation of developed fe model against experimental data presented by paul et al 1992 on unreinforced tubular kk joint at ambient temperature and tan et al 2013 on unreinforced t joints at 20 550 and 700 c a parametric investigation was carried out to examine the influence of dimensionless geometrical parameters η γ τ and β and temperature on the structural behavior of the internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints subjected to brace compression at ambient and high temperatures above mentioned dimensionless geometrical parameters have been introduced in fig 1 also the effects of geometrical parameters on failure modes of stiffened joints were investigated and an individual design equation was developed for each of the failure modes to determine the ultimate load of the internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints under the compressive brace load at fire induced high temperatures 2 fe analysis 2 1 model generation for defining the material properties of the steel the isotropic strain hardening and von mises failure criterion were utilized the poisson s ratio yield stress and elastic modulus at ambient temperature were 0 3 355 n mm2 and 206 gpa respectively the steel material characteristics at high temperatures were deduced based on en 1993 1 2 1993 1 2 eurocode 3 2005 as shown in fig 2 for a precise definition of plastic behavior of the material eqs 1 and 2 were used for transforming the engineering strain and stress to true strain and stress 1 σ t σ 1 ε 2 ε t ln 1 ε because of the insignificant influence of the weld modeling on the values of ultimate bearing capacity of the circular hollow section connections it was not included in the present work for a detailed discussion on this matter the reader is referred to azari dodaran and ahmadi 2019a ansys element type solid186 was selected to model the two planar tubular joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings at fire induced high temperatures for finding the optimum size of the mesh a convergence study was conducted after separating the model into two areas i e intersection area and outside the intersection area different mesh sizes were tested and it was concluded that the mesh size of 15 mm for the intersection area and 40 mm for outside the intersection area were suitable table 1 summarized the results of the convergence study the fe mesh layout has been shown in fig 3 ansys contact capability was utilized to simulate the interaction between the surfaces of the rings and the chord in the present study the outer surface of the rings and the inner surface of the chord were selected to be the target and contact surfaces respectively in this study the chord ends were assumed to be fixed also due to the symmetry in loading condition and the geometry of the connection and to reduce the computational time only one fourth of the entire connection was modeled and analyzed the type of analysis in the present work is steady state in the steady state analysis at a particular elevated temperature the load was applied and increased until the failure of the connection both geometric and material nonlinearities were considered in fe analysis in chs joints under the axial loading the load deformation curve generally grows to a peak point and then reduces in such condition typical methods fail to converge hence in this study an arc length technique was used to control the numerical instability the reader is referred to kohnke 2009 for more detailed information regarding the arc length technique 2 2 validation of the fe model against experimental test results before using the fe results for the prediction of the static strength in chs multi planar tt joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings the reliability of the results must be evaluated one of the best ways for evaluating the accuracy of the developed fe model is through comparing the numerical results with available experimental test data since there is no experimental database available on the ultimate load of multi planar tt joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings at fire condition a set of related experimental data was utilized to verify the fe modeling a paul et al 1992 results on the static strength of unreinforced tubular kk joint at ambient temperature and b tan et al 2013 data on the bearing capacity of unreinforced t joints at 20 550 and 700 c geometrical parameters of the joints studied by paul et al 1992 and tan et al 2013 are listed in tables 2 and 3 at the start to select the type of the element the t joint models of tan et al 2013 were generated and analyzed by using ansys element types shell281 and solid186 afterwards as shown in figs 4 and 5 results of the fe analysis were compared with the test results provided by tan et al 2013 it can be concluded that utilizing solid elements results in more accurate strength values hence solid elements were selected in the present research for modeling the tubular tt joints as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 there is a good agreement between the displacement initial stiffness and ultimate bearing capacity extracted from experimental results of tan et al 2013 and the predictions of the verifying fe model figs 6 8 compare the experimental and numerical deformed shapes of the studied joints it can be found from this comparison that the fe model can well estimate the deformed shape of the connections the values of the ultimate bearing capacity obtained from experimental and numerical models are tabulated in table 4 indicating that the agreement between numerical data and the experimental results is acceptable the standard deviation and average fe test ratio were 6 62 and 0 92 respectively from fig 4 8 and table 4 it can be clearly seen that the developed fe model is capable of generating valid results with acceptable accuracy 3 scheme of parametric study 3 1 details to quantify the influence of high temperature and the geometry of the joint and internal rings i e geometrical parameters β τ γ and η on the static behavior of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints under axial load a comprehensive parametric study was conducted in this regard a total of 81 fe models were generated and analyzed by utilizing engineering simulation and 3d design software ansys since each model was analyzed at four temperatures i e 20 400 550 and 700 c altogether 324 fe analyses were performed the non dimensional and dimensional geometrical parameters are defined in fig 1 in this work in order to keep away from the influence of the short chord and brace lengths realistic values of α 14 and α b 10 were selected for all joints the assigned ranges and values for dimensionless parameters and temperatures are as follows 3 0 3 β 0 6 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 10 γ 30 10 20 and 30 0 4 τ 1 0 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 0 1 η 0 2 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 forti et al 2015 criterion which is an extension of lu et al 1994 criterion for multi planar tubular connections has been used to obtain the ultimate load of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints according to this criterion the horizontal displacement of nodes e and e or the vertical displacement of nodes f and f fig 9 should be less than 0 03d ultimate bearing capacity is quantified by the maximum load in load ovalization curves or the load at the deformation of 0 03d whichever is smaller 3 2 the influence of high temperature on the initial stiffness static strength and static strength ratio rut the load ovalization curves for a series of stiffened and unstiffened tt joints subjected to axial load have been shown in figs 10 12 it is evident that in all joints the initial stiffness and ultimate load decrease considerably by increasing the temperature r ut is defined as the ratio of joint s static strength at the elevated temperature to its strength at the ambient temperature on average the value of the static strength ratio r ut is 0 753 0 459 and 0 153 at 400 550 and 700 c respectively in fig 13 the r ut has been compared with k yt k et and k pt k yt is the ratio of effective yield stress at elevated temperature to the yield stress at 20 c k yt f yt f y k et is the ratio of young s modulus at elevated temperature to the young s modulus at 20 c k et e at e a and k pt is the ratio of the proportional limit at elevated temperature to the yield stress at 20 c k pt f pt f y it can be observed that all r ut values are between the values of k yt and k pt 3 3 the effect of the stiffener geometry on the ultimate load the parameter η is the ratio of the stiffener width to the diameter of the chord η w s d accordingly the increase of the η in a joint having a constant value of the chord diameter results in the increase of the stiffener width at all elevated temperatures using the ring stiffeners leads to an increase in the ultimate strength of the joints even so for different values of the γ three different trends were observed main observations from studying the influence of the η on the ultimate load are as follows for small γ values i e γ 10 by rising the η the ultimate bearing capacity has no significant change fig 14 for intermediate values of the γ i e γ 20 two different trends were detected in this case when the β is small i e β 0 3 for τ 0 4 the value of the η has no noticeable influence on the ultimate load fig 15 a while for τ 0 7 and τ 1 0 the ultimate load increases by increasing the η fig 15b when the β has big and intermediate values i e β 0 6 and β 0 45 for τ 0 4 the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the rise of the η fig 15c but for τ 0 7 and τ 1 0 by increasing the η from 0 1 to 0 15 the ultimate load increases whilst by its rise from 0 15 to 0 2 the ultimate load has no considerable change fig 15d for big values of the γ i e γ 30 when β 0 3 and β 0 45 the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the increase of the η fig 16 a while for big values of the β i e β 0 6 by increasing the η from 0 1 to 0 15 the ultimate load increases but by its increase from 0 15 to 0 2 the ultimate load has no significant change fig 16b 3 4 the effect of the γ on the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient rs initial stiffness and ultimate load the parameter γ is the ratio of the d to 2t fig 17 demonstrates the influence of the γ on the r s r s is defined as the ratio of the stiffened joint s strength to the unstiffened joint s strength it can be observed that by increasing the γ the value of r s increases as it can be seen in fig 17b the values of r s might exceed six for bigger values of the γ moreover when the γ increases from 10 to 20 the strengthening effect is more tangible compared to when the γ increases from 20 to 30 the effects of the γ on the ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness have been illustrated in figs 18 and 19 respectively it is clear that at ambient and all elevated temperatures with the increase of the γ the ultimate load and initial stiffness of internally ring stiffened and unstiffened joints decreases 3 5 the effect of the β on rs initial stiffness and ultimate load as shown in fig 20 the increase of the β leads to the decrease of the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r s particularly when the β increases from 0 3 to 0 45 the value of the r s reduces dramatically which means that using the internal ring stiffeners is more effective for models having small values of the β comparing the ultimate loads of internally ring stiffened and associated unstiffened joints at ambient 20 c and high temperatures 400 550 and 700 c as depicted in fig 21 it can be concluded that the ultimate load increases by increasing the β 3 6 the influence of the τ on the initial stiffness and ultimate bearing capacity as demonstrated in fig 22 a and b for small values of the β i e β 0 3 by increasing the τ the ultimate bearing capacity increases at all temperatures but for big and intermediate values of the β i e β 0 6 and β 0 45 by increasing the τ from 0 4 to 0 7 the ultimate load bearing capacity increases while when τ increases from 0 7 to 1 0 the ultimate load has insignificant change fig 22c and d also it has been found from fig 23 that the initial stiffness of internally ring stiffened joints is not affected by the τ 3 7 the influence of geometrical parameters on the failure modes the failure modes of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints are affected by geometrical parameters two failure modes were detected in the present work the most frequent failure mode was chord wall plastification that was observed in almost 80 of the joints fig 24 a another observed failure mode was brace failure that was detected in nearly 20 of the joints fig 24b for small values of the γ i e γ 10 when the τ has small and intermediate values i e τ 0 4 and τ 0 7 the failure mode was brace failure whereas for big values of the τ i e τ 1 0 the failure mode was brace failure for big and intermediate values of γ i e γ 30 and γ 20 the failure modes of all the models was chord wall plastification 4 formulation of ultimate load at ambient and high temperatures until now there has been no design formula available for calculating the ultimate load of internally ring strengthened multi planar tubular tt joints at fire induced elevated temperatures multiple nonlinear regression analyses were conducted for developing design equations by using the statistical software platform spss the input data consists of the values of dependent and independent variables in this study the ultimate load of the joint was defined as the dependent variable and the geometrical and thermal parameters i e k et k yt k pt γ β τ and η were defined as independent variables following parametric equations were developed after performing a large number of nonlinear

the joint and the stiffener i e γ β τ and η for the derived formulas are 10 γ 30 0 3 β 0 6 0 4 τ 1 0 and 0 1 η 0 2 fig 25 demonstrates that there is a reasonable agreement between the ultimate loads predicted by the proposed equations and the associated numerical values extracted from the fe analysis the usability of proposed equations was tested based on the uk department of energy doe criteria uk department of energy doe 1983 results of the assessment have been summarized in table 5 a detailed explanation of the uk doe criteria uk department of energy doe 1983 has been presented by azari

in such a way that the resulted f u values satisfy the uk doe acceptance criteria for determining the optimum value of the design factor multiple comparative analyses were performed and finally eq 7

results of 324 nonlinear fe analyses were utilized to examine the influence of the stiffener temperature and the joint geometry on the structural behavior of internally ring stiffened multi planar chs tt joints under axial loads furthermore a new set of design formulas was established by using nonlinear regression analyses to determine the ultimate load of the connections at high temperatures the results could be summarized as follows by reinforcing the multi planar tubular tt joints through welding the internal rings the ultimate load can notably increase at ambient and high temperatures for example for bigger values of the γ and smaller values of the β the ultimate bearing capacity of a multi planar chs tt joint stiffened with internal rings can be up to 522 of the ultimate load of the associated unstiffened joint at a high temperature increasing of the γ and decreasing of the β lead to increasing the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r s by increasing the temperature static strength and initial stiffness of the joint decreases the ultimate load of an internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joint at 400 550 and 700 c is on average 0 753 0 459 and 0 153 of the associated joint s ultimate bearing capacity at 20 c respectively the values of the r ut for all joints are between the values k yt and k pt geometrical parameters have a prominent influence on the failure modes of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints new design formulas were developed for obtaining the ultimate load of the internally ring stiffened multi planar chs tt joints subjected to compressive brace load at ambient and high temperatures regarding the high values of the coefficient of determination and the satisfaction of the admission standards proposed by the uk department of energy the accuracy of the developed equations is guaranteed and these equations can be reliably applied for the analysis and design of chs structures credit authorship contribution

on tubular kk joints paul et al 1993 and scola et al 1990 on tubular tt joints and the studies of van der vegte et al van der vegte et al 2005 and paul et al 1989 on tubular xx joints deterioration of the physical properties of the steel at elevated temperatures is a considerable issue hence at fire condition a tubular joint might collapse under a load considerably less than its strength at ambient temperature as a result the whole structure may collapse after the failure of one or several joints at the fire condition recently azari dodaran and ahmadi 2019a 2019b 2020 conducted parametric investigations on the static behavior of unreinforced two planar tt kt and kk joints they found that at high temperatures the ultimate bearing capacity of a multi planar joint might decrease dramatically therefore there is an urgent need to evaluate the fire resistance of multi planar tubular joints a great deal of studies have been conducted on the examination of the reinforcing methods of tubular joints one useful method that has been reported in the literature is using the internal stiffening rings sawada et al 1979 examined the static and fatigue behavior of chs t joints and concluded that a stiffening ring considerably enhances the strength of the joint van der vegte et al van der vegte et al 1991 investigated the strength of uniplanar x joint stiffened by t shaped ring stiffeners under axial load and concluded that the height of the t shaped stiffeners has a remarkable influence on the bearing capacity of uniplanar x joints lee and llewelyn parry 2004 2005 published the results of a detailed parametric study based on the fe method on the structural behavior of internally ring stiffened dt and t joints they recommended a predictive theoretical model for determining the static strength of such joints zhang et al 2004 concluded that using the internal rings can enhance the ultimate load of x joints thandavamoorthy et al 1999 and thandavamoorthy 2000 experimentally examined the effect of internal rings on the static strength of chs y and t joints lan et al 2016 performed a parametric investigation on the static strength of internally saddle and crown reinforced dt t and y joints under brace axial loading at high temperatures they found that the influences of the stiffening location and joint s geometrical characteristics on the strength reduction at fire condition fall in a narrow area moreover these researchers proposed a formula for calculating the static strength reduction ahmadi 2016 and nassiraei 2020 provided additional information on other aspects of stiffened tubular joints behavior such as the stress concentration and local joint flexibility as it can be concluded from preceding discussion most of the studies on the performance of internal ring stiffeners have focused on uniplanar joints at ambient temperatures and it is obvious that there is a shortage of understanding of the static behavior of multi tubular tt joints reinforced with internal rings at fire induced elevated temperatures in addition there are no design formulas for determining the ultimate load of this joint type therefore in this study after the validation of developed fe model against experimental data presented by paul et al 1992 on unreinforced tubular kk joint at ambient temperature and tan et al 2013 on unreinforced t joints at 20 550 and 700 c a parametric investigation was carried out to examine the influence of dimensionless geometrical parameters η γ τ and β and temperature on the structural behavior of the internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints subjected to brace compression at ambient and high temperatures above mentioned dimensionless geometrical parameters have been introduced in fig 1 also the effects of geometrical parameters on failure modes of stiffened joints were investigated and an individual design equation was developed for each of the failure modes to determine the ultimate load of the internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints under the compressive brace load at fire induced high temperatures 2 fe analysis 2 1 model generation for defining the material properties of the steel the isotropic strain hardening and von mises failure criterion were utilized the poisson s ratio yield stress and elastic modulus at ambient temperature were 0 3 355 n mm2 and 206 gpa respectively the steel material characteristics at high temperatures were deduced based on en 1993 1 2 1993 1 2 eurocode 3 2005 as shown in fig 2 for a precise definition of plastic behavior of the material eqs 1 and 2 were used for transforming the engineering strain and stress to true strain and stress 1 σ t σ 1 ε 2 ε t ln 1 ε because of the insignificant influence of the weld modeling on the values of ultimate bearing capacity of the circular hollow section connections it was not included in the present work for a detailed discussion on this matter the reader is referred to azari dodaran and ahmadi 2019a ansys element type solid186 was selected to model the two planar tubular joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings at fire induced high temperatures for finding the optimum size of the mesh a convergence study was conducted after separating the model into two areas i e intersection area and outside the intersection area different mesh sizes were tested and it was concluded that the mesh size of 15 mm for the intersection area and 40 mm for outside the intersection area were suitable table 1 summarized the results of the convergence study the fe mesh layout has been shown in fig 3 ansys contact capability was utilized to simulate the interaction between the surfaces of the rings and the chord in the present study the outer surface of the rings and the inner surface of the chord were selected to be the target and contact surfaces respectively in this study the chord ends were assumed to be fixed also due to the symmetry in loading condition and the geometry of the connection and to reduce the computational time only one fourth of the entire connection was modeled and analyzed the type of analysis in the present work is steady state in the steady state analysis at a particular elevated temperature the load was applied and increased until the failure of the connection both geometric and material nonlinearities were considered in fe analysis in chs joints under the axial loading the load deformation curve generally grows to a peak point and then reduces in such condition typical methods fail to converge hence in this study an arc length technique was used to control the numerical instability the reader is referred to kohnke 2009 for more detailed information regarding the arc length technique 2 2 validation of the fe model against experimental test results before using the fe results for the prediction of the static strength in chs multi planar tt joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings the reliability of the results must be evaluated one of the best ways for evaluating the accuracy of the developed fe model is through comparing the numerical results with available experimental test data since there is no experimental database available on the ultimate load of multi planar tt joints reinforced with internal stiffening rings at fire condition a set of related experimental data was utilized to verify the fe modeling a paul et al 1992 results on the static strength of unreinforced tubular kk joint at ambient temperature and b tan et al 2013 data on the bearing capacity of unreinforced t joints at 20 550 and 700 c geometrical parameters of the joints studied by paul et al 1992 and tan et al 2013 are listed in tables 2 and 3 at the start to select the type of the element the t joint models of tan et al 2013 were generated and analyzed by using ansys element types shell281 and solid186 afterwards as shown in figs 4 and 5 results of the fe analysis were compared with the test results provided by tan et al 2013 it can be concluded that utilizing solid elements results in more accurate strength values hence solid elements were selected in the present research for modeling the tubular tt joints as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 there is a good agreement between the displacement initial stiffness and ultimate bearing capacity extracted from experimental results of tan et al 2013 and the predictions of the verifying fe model figs 6 8 compare the experimental and numerical deformed shapes of the studied joints it can be found from this comparison that the fe model can well estimate the deformed shape of the connections the values of the ultimate bearing capacity obtained from experimental and numerical models are tabulated in table 4 indicating that the agreement between numerical data and the experimental results is acceptable the standard deviation and average fe test ratio were 6 62 and 0 92 respectively from fig 4 8 and table 4 it can be clearly seen that the developed fe model is capable of generating valid results with acceptable accuracy 3 scheme of parametric study 3 1 details to quantify the influence of high temperature and the geometry of the joint and internal rings i e geometrical parameters β τ γ and η on the static behavior of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints under axial load a comprehensive parametric study was conducted in this regard a total of 81 fe models were generated and analyzed by utilizing engineering simulation and 3d design software ansys since each model was analyzed at four temperatures i e 20 400 550 and 700 c altogether 324 fe analyses were performed the non dimensional and dimensional geometrical parameters are defined in fig 1 in this work in order to keep away from the influence of the short chord and brace lengths realistic values of α 14 and α b 10 were selected for all joints the assigned ranges and values for dimensionless parameters and temperatures are as follows 3 0 3 β 0 6 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 10 γ 30 10 20 and 30 0 4 τ 1 0 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 0 1 η 0 2 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 forti et al 2015 criterion which is an extension of lu et al 1994 criterion for multi planar tubular connections has been used to obtain the ultimate load of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints according to this criterion the horizontal displacement of nodes e and e or the vertical displacement of nodes f and f fig 9 should be less than 0 03d ultimate bearing capacity is quantified by the maximum load in load ovalization curves or the load at the deformation of 0 03d whichever is smaller 3 2 the influence of high temperature on the initial stiffness static strength and static strength ratio rut the load ovalization curves for a series of stiffened and unstiffened tt joints subjected to axial load have been shown in figs 10 12 it is evident that in all joints the initial stiffness and ultimate load decrease considerably by increasing the temperature r ut is defined as the ratio of joint s static strength at the elevated temperature to its strength at the ambient temperature on average the value of the static strength ratio r ut is 0 753 0 459 and 0 153 at 400 550 and 700 c respectively in fig 13 the r ut has been compared with k yt k et and k pt k yt is the ratio of effective yield stress at elevated temperature to the yield stress at 20 c k yt f yt f y k et is the ratio of young s modulus at elevated temperature to the young s modulus at 20 c k et e at e a and k pt is the ratio of the proportional limit at elevated temperature to the yield stress at 20 c k pt f pt f y it can be observed that all r ut values are between the values of k yt and k pt 3 3 the effect of the stiffener geometry on the ultimate load the parameter η is the ratio of the stiffener width to the diameter of the chord η w s d accordingly the increase of the η in a joint having a constant value of the chord diameter results in the increase of the stiffener width at all elevated temperatures using the ring stiffeners leads to an increase in the ultimate strength of the joints even so for different values of the γ three different trends were observed main observations from studying the influence of the η on the ultimate load are as follows for small γ values i e γ 10 by rising the η the ultimate bearing capacity has no significant change fig 14 for intermediate values of the γ i e γ 20 two different trends were detected in this case when the β is small i e β 0 3 for τ 0 4 the value of the η has no noticeable influence on the ultimate load fig 15 a while for τ 0 7 and τ 1 0 the ultimate load increases by increasing the η fig 15b when the β has big and intermediate values i e β 0 6 and β 0 45 for τ 0 4 the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the rise of the η fig 15c but for τ 0 7 and τ 1 0 by increasing the η from 0 1 to 0 15 the ultimate load increases whilst by its rise from 0 15 to 0 2 the ultimate load has no considerable change fig 15d for big values of the γ i e γ 30 when β 0 3 and β 0 45 the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the increase of the η fig 16 a while for big values of the β i e β 0 6 by increasing the η from 0 1 to 0 15 the ultimate load increases but by its increase from 0 15 to 0 2 the ultimate load has no significant change fig 16b 3 4 the effect of the γ on the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient rs initial stiffness and ultimate load the parameter γ is the ratio of the d to 2t fig 17 demonstrates the influence of the γ on the r s r s is defined as the ratio of the stiffened joint s strength to the unstiffened joint s strength it can be observed that by increasing the γ the value of r s increases as it can be seen in fig 17b the values of r s might exceed six for bigger values of the γ moreover when the γ increases from 10 to 20 the strengthening effect is more tangible compared to when the γ increases from 20 to 30 the effects of the γ on the ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness have been illustrated in figs 18 and 19 respectively it is clear that at ambient and all elevated temperatures with the increase of the γ the ultimate load and initial stiffness of internally ring stiffened and unstiffened joints decreases 3 5 the effect of the β on rs initial stiffness and ultimate load as shown in fig 20 the increase of the β leads to the decrease of the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r s particularly when the β increases from 0 3 to 0 45 the value of the r s reduces dramatically which means that using the internal ring stiffeners is more effective for models having small values of the β comparing the ultimate loads of internally ring stiffened and associated unstiffened joints at ambient 20 c and high temperatures 400 550 and 700 c as depicted in fig 21 it can be concluded that the ultimate load increases by increasing the β 3 6 the influence of the τ on the initial stiffness and ultimate bearing capacity as demonstrated in fig 22 a and b for small values of the β i e β 0 3 by increasing the τ the ultimate bearing capacity increases at all temperatures but for big and intermediate values of the β i e β 0 6 and β 0 45 by increasing the τ from 0 4 to 0 7 the ultimate load bearing capacity increases while when τ increases from 0 7 to 1 0 the ultimate load has insignificant change fig 22c and d also it has been found from fig 23 that the initial stiffness of internally ring stiffened joints is not affected by the τ 3 7 the influence of geometrical parameters on the failure modes the failure modes of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints are affected by geometrical parameters two failure modes were detected in the present work the most frequent failure mode was chord wall plastification that was observed in almost 80 of the joints fig 24 a another observed failure mode was brace failure that was detected in nearly 20 of the joints fig 24b for small values of the γ i e γ 10 when the τ has small and intermediate values i e τ 0 4 and τ 0 7 the failure mode was brace failure whereas for big values of the τ i e τ 1 0 the failure mode was brace failure for big and intermediate values of γ i e γ 30 and γ 20 the failure modes of all the models was chord wall plastification 4 formulation of ultimate load at ambient and high temperatures until now there has been no design formula available for calculating the ultimate load of internally ring strengthened multi planar tubular tt joints at fire induced elevated temperatures multiple nonlinear regression analyses were conducted for developing design equations by using the statistical software platform spss the input data consists of the values of dependent and independent variables in this study the ultimate load of the joint was defined as the dependent variable and the geometrical and thermal parameters i e k et k yt k pt γ β τ and η were defined as independent variables following parametric equations were developed after performing a large number of nonlinear

predicted by the proposed equations and the associated numerical values extracted from the fe analysis the usability of proposed equations was tested based on the uk department of energy doe criteria uk department of energy doe 1983 results of the assessment have been summarized in table 5 a detailed explanation of the uk doe criteria uk department of energy doe 1983 has been presented by azari

results of 324 nonlinear fe analyses were utilized to examine the influence of the stiffener temperature and the joint geometry on the structural behavior of internally ring stiffened multi planar chs tt joints under axial loads furthermore a new set of design formulas was established by using nonlinear regression analyses to determine the ultimate load of the connections at high temperatures the results could be summarized as follows by reinforcing the multi planar tubular tt joints through welding the internal rings the ultimate load can notably increase at ambient and high temperatures for example for bigger values of the γ and smaller values of the β the ultimate bearing capacity of a multi planar chs tt joint stiffened with internal rings can be up to 522 of the ultimate load of the associated unstiffened joint at a high temperature increasing of the γ and decreasing of the β lead to increasing the ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r s by increasing the temperature static strength and initial stiffness of the joint decreases the ultimate load of an internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joint at 400 550 and 700 c is on average 0 753 0 459 and 0 153 of the associated joint s ultimate bearing capacity at 20 c respectively the values of the r ut for all joints are between the values k yt and k pt geometrical parameters have a prominent influence on the failure modes of internally ring stiffened multi planar tubular tt joints new design formulas were developed for obtaining the ultimate load of the internally ring stiffened multi planar chs tt joints subjected to compressive brace load at ambient and high temperatures regarding the high values of the coefficient of determination and the satisfaction of the admission standards proposed by the uk department of energy the accuracy of the developed equations is guaranteed and these equations can be reliably applied for the analysis and design of chs structures credit authorship contribution

20774,when an internal solitary wave isw breaks over a sloping bottom in the ocean turbulent mixing causes energy dissipation that is associated with the breaking type in a two layer fluid when pycnocline thickness is negligible the breaking can be categorized into one of four breaker types surging plunging collapsing and fission breakers the latest classification into four breaker types is based on wave slope bottom slope gradient and an internal reynolds number however it was unknown if this classification can be applied to categorize the breaking of an isw under thick pycnocline conditions the present study uses two dimensional numerical simulations to investigate energy dissipation due to an isw breaking over a slope under changing pycnocline thickness we found that the classification can categorize all breaker types even when pycnocline thickness varies also the practical reflection coefficient defined in this study becomes smaller for collapsing and surging breakers with the increase in the pycnocline thickness due to an offshore shift in breaking points in contrast the practical reflection coefficient is found to be constant for plunging and fission breakers under changing pycnocline thickness keywords internal wave classification reflection coefficient energy dissipation numerical simulation 1 introduction internal waves play a significant role in resuspension and transport of particulate matter due to breaking over sloping bottoms in lakes and the ocean boegman and stastna 2019 resuspension of particulate matter due to internal waves has been demonstrated with high resolution field observations in lake erken pierson and weyhenmeyer 1994 the study found that epilimnion mixing induces resuspension due to internal seiches in the benthic boundary layer these internal seiches have also been shown to cause high frequency internal waves which drive resuspension over the bottom of lake alpnach gloor et al 1994 pineda 1994 demonstrated that mass transport in both offshore and onshore directions occurs due to the breaking of high frequency internal waves over a topographical slope based on the observed vertical profile of density and horizontal velocity in southern california davis and monismith 2011 also showed that the several different breaking types of internal waves potentially exhibit a broad range of turbulence strength and energy dissipation which affected the resuspension of particulate matter in the outer southeast florida shelf in particular internal solitary waves isws have been shown to significantly influence energy dissipation over sloping bottoms helfrich and melville 2006 lamb 2014 therefore it is useful to investigate the characteristics of isw breaking over a sloping bottom such as energy dissipation in lakes and the ocean many laboratory experiments have been conducted related to the breaking of isws over slopes horn et al 2001 investigated the deformation of low frequency internal waves into a train of isws using a tilting tank in which the upper layer thickness was thinner than the lower layer using the same tilting tank as horn et al 2001 boegman et al 2005 showed that breaking over a sloping bottom leads to localized turbulent mixing and enhanced energy dissipation which transfers energy from a basin scale seiche to isws and small scale dissipation regarding the interaction between internal waves and a sloping bottom boundary michallet and ivey 1999 found that the reflection of incident energy from an isw over a slope which is associated with energy dissipation is a function of the wavelength of the isw and slope length by carrying out additional laboratory experiments and numerical simulations similar to michallet and ivey 1999 bourgault and kelley 2007 also revealed that the reflection coefficient of an isw from a slope is a function of the iribarren number michallet and ivey 1999 and bourgault and kelley 2007 clarified the factors essential for estimating energy dissipation due to isw breaking over a slope the ratio of the wavelength of the isw to slope length and the iribarren number however bourgault and kelley 2007 suggested that further studies were necessary to validate the parameter to estimate energy dissipation in a previous study related to isw breaking and energy dissipation over a slope using numerical simulations forgia et al 2018 found that the reflection coefficient varies with the change in breaking type over a sloping bottom which means that energy dissipation may be associated with breaking types additionally forgia et al 2020 revealed that the reflection coefficient decreases with the increase in the pycnocline thickness using numerical simulations aghsaee et al 2012 demonstrated that vortex shedding beneath isws over the bottom depends on a non dimensional pressure gradient and the momentum thickness reynolds number at the separation point which may change the breaking type of an isw over a slope nakayama et al 2012 investigated mass transport due to the breaking of an isw over a slope which revealed that the larger the quadratic nonlinear coefficient of the kdv equation the more extensive the energy dissipation becomes they also showed that energy dissipation increases with a decrease in the slope gradient using a critical amplitude nakayama and imberger 2010 which may suggest that the breaking type of an isw is related to energy dissipation therefore the prediction of the breaking type of an isw over a sloping bottom is crucial for estimation of energy dissipation in terms of the breaking type of isws over a slope boegman et al 2005 proposed three types of breaking by setting up a slope in the tilting tank used by horn et al 2001 spilling plunging and collapsing breakers they also proposed an internal iribarren number to classify the breaking type of an isw over a slope by modifying the iribarren number by galvin 1968 on the other hand aghsaee et al 2010 proposed a new categorization of breaker types for isw over slopes using numerical simulations they demonstrated that four breaker types surging plunging collapsing and fission breakers could be classified based on bottom slope gradient and wave slope sutherland et al 2013 found difficulty in categorizing their results according to bottom slope gradient and wave slope only they suggested the application of the internal iribarren number to classify all breaker types however nakayama et al 2019b showed that the classifications by aghsaee et al 2010 and sutherland et al 2013 could not categorize breaking in the laboratory experiments by boegman et al 2005 aghsaee et al 2012 revealed that viscosity at the bottom boundary controls whether or not collapsing or plunging breakers occur furthermore shroyer et al 2009 saffarinia and kao 1996 and nakayama et al 2012 suggested the importance of critical depth on residual currents and breaking of an isw in numerical simulations tsuji and oikawa 2007 critical depth is the depth where a conjugate flow appears which was shown by lamb and wan 1998 tsuji and oikawa 2007 also showed the importance of critical depth on the excitation and deformation of an isw the critical depth is located in the middle of the total water column in a two layer fluid under the boussinesq approximation shroyer et al 2009 explored isws from shipboard measurements off the coast of new jersey and found deformation of depression waves into elevation waves at a critical point critical depth based on these findings nakayama et al 2019b proposed a new parameter an internal reynolds number by combining the quadratic term coefficient of the kdv equation and the traditional reynolds number based on wave speed which indicates the effects of critical depth and viscosity the internal reynolds number was found to classify all breaker types by combining with bottom slope gradient and wave slope however application only to two layer fluids with a thin pycnocline condition has been discussed so far and applicability of the classification to the ocean remains unresolved the effect of breaking type on energy dissipation also needs to be clarified by exploring changing pycnocline thicknesses this study thus aims to investigate whether nakayama s classification can categorize breaker types when pycnocline thickness varies and to clarify the effect of pycnocline thickness on an isw breaking over a slope first we adjusted four physical parameters density ratio bottom slope gradient wave slope and the internal reynolds number to simulate four breaker types conditions using nakayama s classification with the thin pycnocline thickness then we investigated four breaker types over a slope by changing pycnocline thickness to clarify the thickness s influence on breaker types second breaking points where the vertical pressure gradient becomes zero were verified by comparing with the general breaking location defined in previous studies lamb 2014 boegman et al 2005 when pycnocline thickness varies finally the effect of pycnocline thickness on reflection of an isw from a slope was investigated under changing pycnocline thickness to evaluate energy dissipation due to the breaking of an isw over a slope note that we used two different parameters regarding reflection from a slope practical reflection coefficient and reflection coefficient the practical reflection coefficient is defined in this study to understand the peak energy ratio of reflected and incident internal waves with the reflection coefficient defined as by michallet and ivey 1999 for example as the spatially integrated energy ratio of a reflected and incident internal waves 2 methods 2 1 numerical simulations a three dimensional non hydrostatic model fantom was used to analyze the breaking of shoaling internal solitary waves nakayama et al 2014 2016 2019 nakayama et al 2019b fantom is an object oriented parallel simulator for the analysis of environmental fluid flows employing a turbulence closure scheme option a k ε turbulence closure scheme jones and launder 1972 umlauf and burchard 2003 a free surface was applied to the top boundary and a no slip condition was given on the bottom and sloping boundaries respectively the partial cell scheme was used to represent a uniform bottom slope in the z coordinate model adcroft et al 1997 according to previous studies nakayama and imberger 2010 arthur and fringer 2014 the local turbulent dissipation in the breaking zone is about 3 10 6 to 10 5 m2 s 3 for a laboratory scale which gives a corresponding kolmogorov length scale of 0 56 0 76 mm in the breaking zone we used 2 mm grid sizes in a vertical cross section which is a factor of about three compared to the kolmogorov length scale additionally since the k ε turbulence closure scheme has problems in reproducing flows in low reynolds number regions including bottom boundary layers we decided to apply direct numerical simulations the use of two dimensional numerical simulations does not capture three dimensional processes such as secondary instability and a three dimensional computation is important for the accurate estimation of energetics due to breaking arthur and fringer 2014 arthur and fringer 2014 showed that a three dimensional simulation had about 8 more energy dissipation compared to a two dimensional simulation in previous studies two dimensional simulations were validated through investigation of shoaling mode 1 waves onto a shelf such as overturning and shear instabilities over a slope vlasenko and hutter 2002 bourgault and kelley 2007 aghsaee et al 2012 lamb 2014 we attempt to investigate the breaking criteria by comparing it with that obtained using two dimensional numerical simulations by aghsaee et al 2010 also we aimed to validate energy dissipation by comparing with bourgault and kelley 2007 in which a two dimensional simulation was applied therefore the two dimensional vertical computational domain was used to investigate the breaking of an isw over a slope in the same manner as in nakayama et al 2019b it should be noted that the available potential and kinetic energy analysis in this study may show an underestimation of energy dissipation by up to a maximum of about 8 we applied the hyperbolic tangent function into a vertical profile of density to give different pycnocline thickness eq 1 1 ρ z ρ 1 0 5 δ ρ 1 tanh z h 2 a i 2 where ρ is the density z is the upward positive vertical coordinate with an origin at the flat bottom h 1 and h 2 are the upper and lower layer thicknesses ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and lower layers δ ρ ρ 2 ρ 1 and a i is the thickness of the pycnocline to generate a stable isw we gave a flat bottom length of 3 m for all cases the horizontal and vertical grid sizes over the slope were 0 002 m 0 002 m and the maximum grid size was 0 02 m 0 01 m adjacent to the flat bottom close to the wave generator to save computational time fig 1 the spanwise single grid size was set at 0 02 m b e we applied mirie and pennell 1989 to generate an isw based on third order solutions appendix in nakayama et al 2019a which gives sufficient accuracy similar to the dubreil jacotin long equation aghsaee et al 2010 nakayama et al 2019a b fluxes to generate an isw were given in the upper and lower layers with thicknesses of

density interface displacement given by mirie and pennell 1989 and δ t is the time step in a numerical simulation 2 2 analytical methods cases s c p and f correspond to surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively table 1 note this case categorization is based on the classification confirmed with thin pycnocline condition nakayama et al 2019b and we will discuss the effect of pycnocline thickness on the breaking classification also cases as ac ap and af correspond to surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers for cases s c p and f the numbers 1 to 8 indicate eight different pycnocline thicknesses a i of 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m 0 10 m and 0 12 m respectively tables 1 and 2 cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were selected to investigate the effect of pycnocline thickness on isw breaking over a slope in detail for cases as ac ap and af two pycnocline thicknesses were given in 1 and 2 a i of 0 01 m and 0 12 m to understand the difference between two extreme cases thin and thick pycnoclines when a i 0 12 m the thickest pycnocline condition the pycnocline reached the water surface classification indices were bottom slope gradient s wave slope s w a

ρ 2 h 1 c 0 is the linear longwave speed and h is the representative depth in a two layer fluid defined as 5 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 in numerical simulations densities of the upper layer ρ 1 were 1000 kg m 3 as one of our aims was to clarify the influence of the pycnocline thickness on the classification of breaker type we investigated the location of the breaking point of the isws over the slope nakayama et al 2012 2019 we computed the breaking point where the vertical pressure gradient becomes zero inside of the pycnocline furthermore we investigated the variation of energy due to the breaking of isws over the slope with changes in pycnocline thickness to clarify the reflection of isws from the slope the energy of a non breaking isw consists of available potential energy e p and kinetic energy e k taileux 2013 6 e p ρ 1 ρ 2 g 2 ρ 2 z ρ ρ z ρ i ρ 2 d ρ 7 e k b t h 1 h 2 1 2 u 2 w 2 d z where g is the gravity acceleration ρ is the density z ρ is the height of the density ρ from the flat bottom z ρ i is z ρ at the initial condition b t is the height at the bottom topography and u and w are the velocities in the x and z coordinates respectively e k is available in the entire computational domain but e p is not available in the breaking zone over a slope because the vertical profile of density becomes unstable over a slope a typical example is a plunging breaker potential energy is available only when densities in the vertical profile at initial condition correspond one to one with densities after internal wave motions we thus compute e k in the entire region but e p in a non breaking zone only therefore we can estimate the reflection of an incident isw and the reflected internal waves in the non breaking zone by using total energy e t e k e p under changing pycnocline thicknesses on the other hand since we can compute e k over the slope there is the possibility to evaluate the influence of pycnocline thickness on energy transfer from available potential to kinetic energy due to breaking for each breaker type 3 results 3 1 classification of breaker types cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m are the typical cases inducing four different breakers surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively according to the classification by nakayama et al 2019b figs 2 and 3 each snap shot was chosen to show its typical breaker type fig 3 in a surging breaker mixing occurred at the front of the wave and the front ran up the slope accompanying strong mixing a collapsing breaker is one of the most common breakers in laboratory experiments when the upper layer thickness is the same as the lower layer in the offshore flat bottom nakayama and imberger 2010 in the collapsing breaker the front behaved like a gravity current down slope plunging breakers had an apparent rolling over the slope in which the direction of rotation was opposite to the collapsing breaker in a fission breaker several high frequency internal waves were generated and broke over the slope in this study we did not explore a combined type of breakers such as collapsing surging and collapsing plunging breakers aghsaee et al 2010 there are two useful conceptual parameters turning point and critical depth to investigate the breaking point of isws under the boussinesq approximation a turning point exists where an initial density interface crosses the critical depth fig 1 the critical depth corresponds to the level where the quadratic term of the kdv equation becomes zero and the ratio of the layers is ρ 1 ρ 2 critical depth is also found in a three layer fluid from the extended kdv or gardner equation when the quadratic term is zero and breathers exist nakayama and lamb 2020 as has been shown in previous studies breaking points for cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m appeared below the critical depth fig 4 note that the horizontal and vertical coordinates are normalized with slope length and total depth respectively in fig 4 to plot all breaking points as found in nakayama et al 2019b the breaking points of collapsing and fission breakers appeared onshore from the turning point on the one hand the surging breaking point occurred close to the turning point and the plunging breaking point occurred offshore from the turning point to analyze the effect of pycnocline thicknesses on the breaking type we prepared 8 different thicknesses from 1 to 8 for each breaker type while keeping the wave amplitude almost the same in each type table 2 the thicker the pycnocline the less the specific vertically integrated density between the upper and lower layers namely the longer the wavelength λ and the smaller the wave slope s w fig 2 in the classification diagram although the case c 8 a i 0 12 m appeared close to the classification border between surging collapsing and plunging breakers the classification factors for cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were still confirmed to be valid even with the largest increase in the pycnocline thickness to see the effect of the pycnocline thickness on the breaking behavior the breaker types for the cases with a i 0 04 m and 0 12 m are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in a i 0 04 m there was no change in the surging breaker fig 5a collapsing breakers changed to behave like a collapsing surging breaker but we could still find the characteristics of a collapsing breaker fig 5b plunging breakers had weaker rolling in a i 0 04 m compared to a i 0 01 m fig 5c in the fission breaker in a i 0 04 m an isw generated high frequency internal waves which deformed into bolus type waves that were similar to a i 0 01 m fig 5d in a i 0 12 m breakings occurred in a more extensive region compared to a i 0 01 m fig 6 but we found the same characteristics for cases with a i 0 12 m as a i 0 04 m and there was no change in all breaker types from a i 0 01 m 0 12 m figs 3 5 and 6 for the effect of pycnocline thickness on the breaking point for surging collapsing and plunging breakers shifted offshore as the pycnocline got thicker for cases s c and p 1 to 8 fig 4 the breaking points of these breakers were found to appear when an isw collided with a downdraft in these cases and the gradient of the density interface at the rear of the isw became vertical since the brunt väisälä frequency decreases with the increase in pycnocline thickness and overturning tends to occur more quickly the isws broke further offshore in the three breaker cases on the other hand the breaking point of fission breakers shifted onshore in case f 1 to 8 with the increase in the pycnocline thickness in case f fission breaker the drawback became thinner and gave less energy to breaking with the increase in pycnocline thickness which might enhance the onshore shift in the breaking point in this study the breaking point of an isw was defined as the point where the vertical pressure gradient became zero inside of the pycnocline which corresponds to a zero gravity location in previous studies lamb 2014 boegman et al 2005 dean and dalrymple 1991 helfrich 1992 the general breaking location gbl was defined as being where the rear part of the internal wave becomes vertical for surging collapsing and plunging breakers and where the first wave of elevation emerges for fission breaker aghsaee et al 2010 note that 0 28 and 0 13 in equation 5 1 of aghsaee et al 2010 should be 0 35 and 0 18 we thus applied the criteria of boegman et al 2005 and aghsaee et al 2010 to our numerical results to clarify the difference between our study s definition and gbl fig 7 since a plunging type breaks dynamically at the farthest point offshore and the zero gravity location is close to the vertical rear of the internal wave breaking points obtained from numerical simulations are close to the gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 in the thin pycnocline cases 1 is p and ap a i 0 01 m significantly surging and collapsing breakers also agree with gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 under thin pycnocline conditions cases 1 is s c as and ac the thin pycnocline case of fission breaker slightly deviates from gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 case f 1 the breaking points for all breaker types slightly differ from gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 when pycnocline thickness varies however gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 appears to fit our numerical simulations satisfactory under changing pycnocline thickness compared to gbl by boegman et al 2005 therefore gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 could be used to predict the breaking points of an isw propagating under different pycnocline thickness s6 in table 3 3 2 energy reflection to observe the effect of pycnocline thickness on breaking from an energetic point of view we compared energy dissipation by breaking first we confirmed that e k was equal to e p for incident isws for all cases which supports the validity of the numerical simulations fig 8 we defined the peak ratio of e t for a reflected internal wave and an incident isw as practical reflection coefficient c p in contrast to the practical reflection coefficient the reflection coefficient c r e f as defined by michallet and ivey 1999 is obtained by integrating the spatial distribution of available potential and kinetic energies bourgault and kelley 2007 therefore when the practical reflection coefficient is much smaller than the reflection coefficient we can expect that the reflected internal waves consist of a broad range of internal wave frequencies i e we can evaluate the broadening of reflected internal waves from a slope by comparing practical reflection coefficients with reflection coefficients therefore the combination of both reflection coefficients can provide important information about how an isw deforms into a broad range of internal waves for the cases with the thinnest pycnocline a i 0 01 m the practical reflection coefficient was 68 29 11 and 5 for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively in cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m in the breaking zone the peak in e k was larger than that of the incident isw for collapsing plunging and fission breakers fig 8 we conjecture that available potential energy was effectively transferred to kinetic energy due to breaking to a greater extent in collapsing plunging and fission breakers compared to surging breakers which resulted in considerably higher energy reflection with surging breakers in the cases of a i 0 01 m in general an isw tends to become unstable when the brunt väisälä frequency decreases which corresponds to thicker pycnocline conditions in this study therefore practical reflection coefficients decreased for all thickness ratios when pycnocline thickness increased fig 8 the practical reflection coefficient was 33 13 9 and 2 for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively in cases 8 is s c p and f a i 0 12 m practical reflection coefficients decreased greatly for surging and collapsing breakers in cases 8 is s and c a i 0 12 m compared to cases 1 is s and c a i 0 01 m fig 8 in particular spatially integrated e k was relatively greater over the slope in the case when a i 0 12 m compared to a i 0 01 m for surging breakers in which the practical reflection coefficient decreased most significantly fig 8 breaking points shifted offshore for surging breaker to a greater extent than for the other breakers suggesting that more substantial breaking occurred in the surging breaker than the others when pycnocline thickness increased fig 8 consequently we conjecture that under thick pycnocline conditions available potential energy was transferred to kinetic energy over the slope more efficiently for the surging breaker therefore for surging and collapsing breakers energy decreased more actively due to turbulent dissipation with thicker pycnoclines 4 discussion we found that all classification factors for cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were valid even with the largest increase in pycnocline thickness to confirm the applicability of the categorization in fig 2 we filled the gap in the classification diagram by adding eight more numerical simulations of extreme pycnocline thickness cases as ac ap and af 1 and 2 a i 0 01 m and a i 0 12 m tables 1 and 2 cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 are also well categorized into surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers according to the classification by nakayama et al 2019b fig 2 however there existed a combination of breakers with increased pycnocline thickness figs 3 5 and 6 anti clockwise and clockwise circulations occurred for a collapsing and plunging breakers clearly when the pycnocline thickness is thin fig 9 a and d the circulations became weaker when the pycnocline thickness increased in particular a plunging breaker showed the collapsing characteristic slightly which is so called a collapsing plunging breaker fig 9f nevertheless the clockwise circulation was formed even when pycnocline is the thickest therefore all classification factors were confirmed to be valid even with the largest increase in the pycnocline thickness and there may be no significant difference in the characteristics of breaker type even when pycnocline thickness varies as summarized in s1 table 3 nakayama et al 2019b demonstrated the classification s applicability into a real stratified fluid using the results of vlasenko and hutter 2002 they simulated a plunging breaker under the real scale condition in which the upper and lower layer thicknesses are 50 m and 950 m their result was categorized into a plunging breaker suggesting the high applicability of nakayama s classification nakayama et al 2019b also showed that a fission beaker occurs predominantly in a real scale because the natural bottom slope is mild enough to allow fission or plunging breakers due to the high internal reynolds number besides the applicability of nakayama s classification to the wide range of real scale conditions remains to be investigated in the future as shown in cases s c p and f is 1 8 all breaking points for cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 appeared below the critical depth fig 4 also the breaking points of collapsing and fission breakers appeared onshore from the turning point the surging breaking point occurred close to the turning point and the plunging breaking point occurred offshore from the turning point when pycnocline thickness increased breaking points for all breakers shifted offshore in cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 fig 4 in the fission breakers cases f 1 to 8 the breaking points shifted onshore when pycnocline thickness increased therefore excluding fission breakers breaking points are likely to shift offshore with an increase in the pycnocline thickness s2 in table 3 for the reflection of the internal waves from the sloping boundary nakayama and imberger 2010 demonstrated that the reflection coefficient of internal waves tends to become zero in a two layer fluid of equivalent depth when the amplitude of an incident internal wave is more than the critical amplitude the practical reflection coefficient was 29 in case c 1 which represents conditions similar to the case by nakayama and imberger 2010 when the reflection coefficient was zero this is because nakayama and imberger 2010 used sinusoidal internal waves propagated over a flat bottom using the same water depth setup in a two layer fluid an isw may reflect more than a sinusoidal type internal wave energy dissipation due to the breaking of an isw over a slope is one of the most significant issues in the ocean michallet and ivey 1999 bourgault and kelley 2007 therefore we computed the time series of the spatially integrated available potential and kinetic energies φ p and φ k by integrating available potential and kinetic energies e p and e k horizontally from offshore to the breaking point in a non breaking zone regarding e k we also obtained the spatially integrated kinetic energy ψ k by integrating kinetic energy e k in the region from the breaking point to the most onshore point in a breaking zone fig 10 here φ t φ p φ k and we define reflection coefficient c r e f which is the ratio of φ t for a reflected internal wave and an incident isw our definition of reflection coefficient corresponds to that of the reflection coefficient by michallet and ivey 1999 and bourgault et al 2007 reflection coefficients were greater in order for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers under thin pycnocline conditions fig 10 a surging breaker with a i 0 01 m had the maximum reflection coefficients of 86 in case s 1 and 82 in case as 1 when a i 0 01 m the minimum reflection coefficients were 25 case f 1 and 17 case af 1 in a fission breaker which was higher than the practical reflection coefficients 5 and 3 because the wavelength of the reflected internal wave had broader range frequencies than the incident isw which results in the reduction of the peak of total energy in the reflected internal wave when a i 0 12 m surging and collapsing breakers had larger decreases in reflection coefficients compared to the other breakers with a i 0 01 m concerning the spatially integrated kinetic energy ψ k in the breaking zone the thicker the pycnocline the larger the ψ k for surging and collapsing breakers we conjecture that available potential energy over a slope was transferred to kinetic energy by breaking which enhances energy dissipation and decreases reflection coefficients when pycnocline thickness increased for surging and collapsing breakers practical reflection coefficients provide essential information on the internal wave reflected from a slope for the investigation of real scale phenomena therefore we attempted to clarify the effect of pycnocline thickness on practical reflection coefficients fig 11 practical reflection coefficients dramatically decreased until the pycnocline thickness equaled to the upper layer thickness α i h 1 1 0 for surging and collapsing breakers and became almost constant in the range of α i h 1 1 0 fig 11a s3 in table 3 in contrast the practical reflection coefficients were less than 10 and did not change under varying pycnocline thickness for plunging and fission breakers s3 in table 3 on the other hand spatially integrated energy dissipation i e the reflection coefficient is also vital for real scale modelling reflection coefficients were higher in order for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers in the same manner as practical reflection coefficients in this study s8 in table 3 interestingly the reflection coefficients were almost constant under changing pycnocline thickness for plunging and fission breakers but changed slightly in the range from α i h 1 0 to α i h 1 0 6 for surging and collapsing breakers because of the offshore shift in breaking points which makes breaking more dynamic fig 11b s4 in table 3 interestingly the difference between c p and c r e f for surging and collapsing breakers became more remarkable with an increase in the pycnocline thickness thus we conjecture that energy is transferred to a broad range of frequencies due to the isw breaking for surging and collapsing breakers to a greater extent than plunging and fission breakers under thick pycnocline conditions compared to thin pycnocline condition s5 in table 3 michallet and ivey 1999 demonstrated that the reflection coefficient was a function of λ l note that their experimental conditions were categorized as plunging breakers using the classification indices by nakayama et al 2019b the reflection coefficients presented in this study are slightly larger but those for plunging cases are close to their laboratory experiment results fig 12 a chen et al 2007 showed the similar tendency as our results in which the reflection coefficients obtained from the laboratory experiments were slightly larger than michallet and ivey 1999 on the other hand bourgault and kelley 2007 investigated the reflection coefficient using the same conditions as michallet and ivey 1999 showing that the reflection coefficient is a function of the internal iribarren number ξ i s s w our results appeared to agree with the criteria of bourgault and kelley 2007 better than michallet and ivey 1999 which suggests the high applicability of the following equation to thin pycnocline conditions fig 12b s7 in table 3 8 c r e f 1 exp ξ i in thick pycnocline conditions reflection coefficients are slightly smaller for surging and collapsing breakers compared to eq 10 however all cases agree well with eq 8 since aghsaee et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 and nakayama et al 2019b suggested that the internal iribarren number has difficulty in capturing the characteristics of breaker types for an isw over a slope further research is needed to confirm the validity of the relationship between the reflection coefficient and the internal iribarren number 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of breaker type on energy dissipation due to an isw breaking over a uniform slope when pycnocline thickness varies table 3 we showed the possibility of classifying isw breaking into surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers using bottom slope gradient wave slope and the internal reynolds number proposed by nakayama et al 2019b even when the pycnocline thickness reaches the water surface practical reflection coefficients became smaller with the increase in pycnocline thickness for surging and collapsing breakers while it was constant for plunging and fission breakers under changing pycnocline thickness on the other hand the reflection coefficient of spatially integrated energy from a slope did not change significantly under varying pycnocline thickness except for a slight decrease for surging and collapsing breakers when pycnocline thickness increased the definition of gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 could be used to predict the breaking points of an isw propagating under different pycnocline thickness the reflection coefficient of an isw from a slope may be estimated as a function of the iribarren number even for thick pycnocline cases note that our two dimensional simulations may underestimate 8 energy dissipation than a three dimensional simulation as demonstrated in

20774,when an internal solitary wave isw breaks over a sloping bottom in the ocean turbulent mixing causes energy dissipation that is associated with the breaking type in a two layer fluid when pycnocline thickness is negligible the breaking can be categorized into one of four breaker types surging plunging collapsing and fission breakers the latest classification into four breaker types is based on wave slope bottom slope gradient and an internal reynolds number however it was unknown if this classification can be applied to categorize the breaking of an isw under thick pycnocline conditions the present study uses two dimensional numerical simulations to investigate energy dissipation due to an isw breaking over a slope under changing pycnocline thickness we found that the classification can categorize all breaker types even when pycnocline thickness varies also the practical reflection coefficient defined in this study becomes smaller for collapsing and surging breakers with the increase in the pycnocline thickness due to an offshore shift in breaking points in contrast the practical reflection coefficient is found to be constant for plunging and fission breakers under changing pycnocline thickness keywords internal wave classification reflection coefficient energy dissipation numerical simulation 1 introduction internal waves play a significant role in resuspension and transport of particulate matter due to breaking over sloping bottoms in lakes and the ocean boegman and stastna 2019 resuspension of particulate matter due to internal waves has been demonstrated with high resolution field observations in lake erken pierson and weyhenmeyer 1994 the study found that epilimnion mixing induces resuspension due to internal seiches in the benthic boundary layer these internal seiches have also been shown to cause high frequency internal waves which drive resuspension over the bottom of lake alpnach gloor et al 1994 pineda 1994 demonstrated that mass transport in both offshore and onshore directions occurs due to the breaking of high frequency internal waves over a topographical slope based on the observed vertical profile of density and horizontal velocity in southern california davis and monismith 2011 also showed that the several different breaking types of internal waves potentially exhibit a broad range of turbulence strength and energy dissipation which affected the resuspension of particulate matter in the outer southeast florida shelf in particular internal solitary waves isws have been shown to significantly influence energy dissipation over sloping bottoms helfrich and melville 2006 lamb 2014 therefore it is useful to investigate the characteristics of isw breaking over a sloping bottom such as energy dissipation in lakes and the ocean many laboratory experiments have been conducted related to the breaking of isws over slopes horn et al 2001 investigated the deformation of low frequency internal waves into a train of isws using a tilting tank in which the upper layer thickness was thinner than the lower layer using the same tilting tank as horn et al 2001 boegman et al 2005 showed that breaking over a sloping bottom leads to localized turbulent mixing and enhanced energy dissipation which transfers energy from a basin scale seiche to isws and small scale dissipation regarding the interaction between internal waves and a sloping bottom boundary michallet and ivey 1999 found that the reflection of incident energy from an isw over a slope which is associated with energy dissipation is a function of the wavelength of the isw and slope length by carrying out additional laboratory experiments and numerical simulations similar to michallet and ivey 1999 bourgault and kelley 2007 also revealed that the reflection coefficient of an isw from a slope is a function of the iribarren number michallet and ivey 1999 and bourgault and kelley 2007 clarified the factors essential for estimating energy dissipation due to isw breaking over a slope the ratio of the wavelength of the isw to slope length and the iribarren number however bourgault and kelley 2007 suggested that further studies were necessary to validate the parameter to estimate energy dissipation in a previous study related to isw breaking and energy dissipation over a slope using numerical simulations forgia et al 2018 found that the reflection coefficient varies with the change in breaking type over a sloping bottom which means that energy dissipation may be associated with breaking types additionally forgia et al 2020 revealed that the reflection coefficient decreases with the increase in the pycnocline thickness using numerical simulations aghsaee et al 2012 demonstrated that vortex shedding beneath isws over the bottom depends on a non dimensional pressure gradient and the momentum thickness reynolds number at the separation point which may change the breaking type of an isw over a slope nakayama et al 2012 investigated mass transport due to the breaking of an isw over a slope which revealed that the larger the quadratic nonlinear coefficient of the kdv equation the more extensive the energy dissipation becomes they also showed that energy dissipation increases with a decrease in the slope gradient using a critical amplitude nakayama and imberger 2010 which may suggest that the breaking type of an isw is related to energy dissipation therefore the prediction of the breaking type of an isw over a sloping bottom is crucial for estimation of energy dissipation in terms of the breaking type of isws over a slope boegman et al 2005 proposed three types of breaking by setting up a slope in the tilting tank used by horn et al 2001 spilling plunging and collapsing breakers they also proposed an internal iribarren number to classify the breaking type of an isw over a slope by modifying the iribarren number by galvin 1968 on the other hand aghsaee et al 2010 proposed a new categorization of breaker types for isw over slopes using numerical simulations they demonstrated that four breaker types surging plunging collapsing and fission breakers could be classified based on bottom slope gradient and wave slope sutherland et al 2013 found difficulty in categorizing their results according to bottom slope gradient and wave slope only they suggested the application of the internal iribarren number to classify all breaker types however nakayama et al 2019b showed that the classifications by aghsaee et al 2010 and sutherland et al 2013 could not categorize breaking in the laboratory experiments by boegman et al 2005 aghsaee et al 2012 revealed that viscosity at the bottom boundary controls whether or not collapsing or plunging breakers occur furthermore shroyer et al 2009 saffarinia and kao 1996 and nakayama et al 2012 suggested the importance of critical depth on residual currents and breaking of an isw in numerical simulations tsuji and oikawa 2007 critical depth is the depth where a conjugate flow appears which was shown by lamb and wan 1998 tsuji and oikawa 2007 also showed the importance of critical depth on the excitation and deformation of an isw the critical depth is located in the middle of the total water column in a two layer fluid under the boussinesq approximation shroyer et al 2009 explored isws from shipboard measurements off the coast of new jersey and found deformation of depression waves into elevation waves at a critical point critical depth based on these findings nakayama et al 2019b proposed a new parameter an internal reynolds number by combining the quadratic term coefficient of the kdv equation and the traditional reynolds number based on wave speed which indicates the effects of critical depth and viscosity the internal reynolds number was found to classify all breaker types by combining with bottom slope gradient and wave slope however application only to two layer fluids with a thin pycnocline condition has been discussed so far and applicability of the classification to the ocean remains unresolved the effect of breaking type on energy dissipation also needs to be clarified by exploring changing pycnocline thicknesses this study thus aims to investigate whether nakayama s classification can categorize breaker types when pycnocline thickness varies and to clarify the effect of pycnocline thickness on an isw breaking over a slope first we adjusted four physical parameters density ratio bottom slope gradient wave slope and the internal reynolds number to simulate four breaker types conditions using nakayama s classification with the thin pycnocline thickness then we investigated four breaker types over a slope by changing pycnocline thickness to clarify the thickness s influence on breaker types second breaking points where the vertical pressure gradient becomes zero were verified by comparing with the general breaking location defined in previous studies lamb 2014 boegman et al 2005 when pycnocline thickness varies finally the effect of pycnocline thickness on reflection of an isw from a slope was investigated under changing pycnocline thickness to evaluate energy dissipation due to the breaking of an isw over a slope note that we used two different parameters regarding reflection from a slope practical reflection coefficient and reflection coefficient the practical reflection coefficient is defined in this study to understand the peak energy ratio of reflected and incident internal waves with the reflection coefficient defined as by michallet and ivey 1999 for example as the spatially integrated energy ratio of a reflected and incident internal waves 2 methods 2 1 numerical simulations a three dimensional non hydrostatic model fantom was used to analyze the breaking of shoaling internal solitary waves nakayama et al 2014 2016 2019 nakayama et al 2019b fantom is an object oriented parallel simulator for the analysis of environmental fluid flows employing a turbulence closure scheme option a k ε turbulence closure scheme jones and launder 1972 umlauf and burchard 2003 a free surface was applied to the top boundary and a no slip condition was given on the bottom and sloping boundaries respectively the partial cell scheme was used to represent a uniform bottom slope in the z coordinate model adcroft et al 1997 according to previous studies nakayama and imberger 2010 arthur and fringer 2014 the local turbulent dissipation in the breaking zone is about 3 10 6 to 10 5 m2 s 3 for a laboratory scale which gives a corresponding kolmogorov length scale of 0 56 0 76 mm in the breaking zone we used 2 mm grid sizes in a vertical cross section which is a factor of about three compared to the kolmogorov length scale additionally since the k ε turbulence closure scheme has problems in reproducing flows in low reynolds number regions including bottom boundary layers we decided to apply direct numerical simulations the use of two dimensional numerical simulations does not capture three dimensional processes such as secondary instability and a three dimensional computation is important for the accurate estimation of energetics due to breaking arthur and fringer 2014 arthur and fringer 2014 showed that a three dimensional simulation had about 8 more energy dissipation compared to a two dimensional simulation in previous studies two dimensional simulations were validated through investigation of shoaling mode 1 waves onto a shelf such as overturning and shear instabilities over a slope vlasenko and hutter 2002 bourgault and kelley 2007 aghsaee et al 2012 lamb 2014 we attempt to investigate the breaking criteria by comparing it with that obtained using two dimensional numerical simulations by aghsaee et al 2010 also we aimed to validate energy dissipation by comparing with bourgault and kelley 2007 in which a two dimensional simulation was applied therefore the two dimensional vertical computational domain was used to investigate the breaking of an isw over a slope in the same manner as in nakayama et al 2019b it should be noted that the available potential and kinetic energy analysis in this study may show an underestimation of energy dissipation by up to a maximum of about 8 we applied the hyperbolic tangent function into a vertical profile of density to give different pycnocline thickness eq 1 1 ρ z ρ 1 0 5 δ ρ 1 tanh z h 2 a i 2 where ρ is the density z is the upward positive vertical coordinate with an origin at the flat bottom h 1 and h 2 are the upper and lower layer thicknesses ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and lower layers δ ρ ρ 2 ρ 1 and a i is the thickness of the pycnocline to generate a stable isw we gave a flat bottom length of 3 m for all cases the horizontal and vertical grid sizes over the slope were 0 002 m 0 002 m and the maximum grid size was 0 02 m 0 01 m adjacent to the flat bottom close to the wave generator to save computational time fig 1 the spanwise single grid size was set at 0 02 m b e we applied mirie and pennell 1989 to generate an isw based on third order solutions appendix in nakayama et al 2019a which gives sufficient accuracy similar to the dubreil jacotin long equation aghsaee et al 2010 nakayama et al 2019a b fluxes to generate an isw were given in the upper and lower layers with thicknesses of 0 04 m and 0 12 m respectively fig 1 and eq 2 2 q 1 q 2 c r η t δ t b e where q 1 and q 2 are the fluxes in the upper and lower layers c r is the wave speed of an internal solitary wave η is the density interface displacement given by mirie and pennell 1989 and δ t is the time step in a numerical simulation 2 2 analytical methods cases s c p and f correspond to surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively table 1 note this case categorization is based on the classification confirmed with thin pycnocline condition nakayama et al 2019b and we will discuss the effect of pycnocline thickness on the breaking classification also cases as ac ap and af correspond to surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers for cases s c p and f the numbers 1 to 8 indicate eight different pycnocline thicknesses a i of 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m 0 10 m and 0 12 m respectively tables 1 and 2 cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were selected to investigate the effect of pycnocline thickness on isw breaking over a slope in detail for cases as ac ap and af two pycnocline thicknesses were given in 1 and 2 a i of 0 01 m and 0 12 m to understand the difference between two extreme cases thin and thick pycnoclines when a i 0 12 m the thickest pycnocline condition the pycnocline reached the water surface classification indices were bottom slope gradient s wave slope s w a

ρ 2 h 1 c 0 is the linear longwave speed and h is the representative depth in a two layer fluid defined as 5 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 in numerical simulations densities of the upper layer ρ 1 were 1000 kg m 3 as one of our aims was to clarify the influence of the pycnocline thickness on the classification of breaker type we investigated the location of the breaking point of the isws over the slope nakayama et al 2012 2019 we computed the breaking point where the vertical pressure gradient becomes zero inside of the pycnocline furthermore we investigated the variation of energy due to the breaking of isws over the slope with changes in pycnocline thickness to clarify the reflection of isws from the slope the energy of a non breaking isw consists of available potential energy e p and kinetic energy e k taileux 2013 6 e p ρ 1 ρ 2 g 2 ρ 2 z ρ ρ z ρ i ρ 2 d ρ 7 e k b t h 1 h 2 1 2 u 2 w 2 d z where g is the gravity acceleration ρ is the density z ρ is the height of the density ρ from the flat bottom z ρ i is z ρ at the initial condition b t is the height at the bottom topography and u and w are the velocities in the x and z coordinates respectively e k is available in the entire computational domain but e p is not available in the breaking zone over a slope because the vertical profile of density becomes unstable over a slope a typical example is a plunging breaker potential energy is available only when densities in the vertical profile at initial condition correspond one to one with densities after internal wave motions we thus compute e k in the entire region but e p in a non breaking zone only therefore we can estimate the reflection of an incident isw and the reflected internal waves in the non breaking zone by using total energy e t e k e p under changing pycnocline thicknesses on the other hand since we can compute e k over the slope there is the possibility to evaluate the influence of pycnocline thickness on energy transfer from available potential to kinetic energy due to breaking for each breaker type 3 results 3 1 classification of breaker types cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m are the typical cases inducing four different breakers surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively according to the classification by nakayama et al 2019b figs 2 and 3 each snap shot was chosen to show its typical breaker type fig 3 in a surging breaker mixing occurred at the front of the wave and the front ran up the slope accompanying strong mixing a collapsing breaker is one of the most common breakers in laboratory experiments when the upper layer thickness is the same as the lower layer in the offshore flat bottom nakayama and imberger 2010 in the collapsing breaker the front behaved like a gravity current down slope plunging breakers had an apparent rolling over the slope in which the direction of rotation was opposite to the collapsing breaker in a fission breaker several high frequency internal waves were generated and broke over the slope in this study we did not explore a combined type of breakers such as collapsing surging and collapsing plunging breakers aghsaee et al 2010 there are two useful conceptual parameters turning point and critical depth to investigate the breaking point of isws under the boussinesq approximation a turning point exists where an initial density interface crosses the critical depth fig 1 the critical depth corresponds to the level where the quadratic term of the kdv equation becomes zero and the ratio of the layers is ρ 1 ρ 2 critical depth is also found in a three layer fluid from the extended kdv or gardner equation when the quadratic term is zero and breathers exist nakayama and lamb 2020 as has been shown in previous studies breaking points for cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m appeared below the critical depth fig 4 note that the horizontal and vertical coordinates are normalized with slope length and total depth respectively in fig 4 to plot all breaking points as found in nakayama et al 2019b the breaking points of collapsing and fission breakers appeared onshore from the turning point on the one hand the surging breaking point occurred close to the turning point and the plunging breaking point occurred offshore from the turning point to analyze the effect of pycnocline thicknesses on the breaking type we prepared 8 different thicknesses from 1 to 8 for each breaker type while keeping the wave amplitude almost the same in each type table 2 the thicker the pycnocline the less the specific vertically integrated density between the upper and lower layers namely the longer the wavelength λ and the smaller the wave slope s w fig 2 in the classification diagram although the case c 8 a i 0 12 m appeared close to the classification border between surging collapsing and plunging breakers the classification factors for cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were still confirmed to be valid even with the largest increase in the pycnocline thickness to see the effect of the pycnocline thickness on the breaking behavior the breaker types for the cases with a i 0 04 m and 0 12 m are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in a i 0 04 m there was no change in the surging breaker fig 5a collapsing breakers changed to behave like a collapsing surging breaker but we could still find the characteristics of a collapsing breaker fig 5b plunging breakers had weaker rolling in a i 0 04 m compared to a i 0 01 m fig 5c in the fission breaker in a i 0 04 m an isw generated high frequency internal waves which deformed into bolus type waves that were similar to a i 0 01 m fig 5d in a i 0 12 m breakings occurred in a more extensive region compared to a i 0 01 m fig 6 but we found the same characteristics for cases with a i 0 12 m as a i 0 04 m and there was no change in all breaker types from a i 0 01 m 0 12 m figs 3 5 and 6 for the effect of pycnocline thickness on the breaking point for surging collapsing and plunging breakers shifted offshore as the pycnocline got thicker for cases s c and p 1 to 8 fig 4 the breaking points of these breakers were found to appear when an isw collided with a downdraft in these cases and the gradient of the density interface at the rear of the isw became vertical since the brunt väisälä frequency decreases with the increase in pycnocline thickness and overturning tends to occur more quickly the isws broke further offshore in the three breaker cases on the other hand the breaking point of fission breakers shifted onshore in case f 1 to 8 with the increase in the pycnocline thickness in case f fission breaker the drawback became thinner and gave less energy to breaking with the increase in pycnocline thickness which might enhance the onshore shift in the breaking point in this study the breaking point of an isw was defined as the point where the vertical pressure gradient became zero inside of the pycnocline which corresponds to a zero gravity location in previous studies lamb 2014 boegman et al 2005 dean and dalrymple 1991 helfrich 1992 the general breaking location gbl was defined as being where the rear part of the internal wave becomes vertical for surging collapsing and plunging breakers and where the first wave of elevation emerges for fission breaker aghsaee et al 2010 note that 0 28 and 0 13 in equation 5 1 of aghsaee et al 2010 should be 0 35 and 0 18 we thus applied the criteria of boegman et al 2005 and aghsaee et al 2010 to our numerical results to clarify the difference between our study s definition and gbl fig 7 since a plunging type breaks dynamically at the farthest point offshore and the zero gravity location is close to the vertical rear of the internal wave breaking points obtained from numerical simulations are close to the gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 in the thin pycnocline cases 1 is p and ap a i 0 01 m significantly surging and collapsing breakers also agree with gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 under thin pycnocline conditions cases 1 is s c as and ac the thin pycnocline case of fission breaker slightly deviates from gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 case f 1 the breaking points for all breaker types slightly differ from gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 when pycnocline thickness varies however gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 appears to fit our numerical simulations satisfactory under changing pycnocline thickness compared to gbl by boegman et al 2005 therefore gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 could be used to predict the breaking points of an isw propagating under different pycnocline thickness s6 in table 3 3 2 energy reflection to observe the effect of pycnocline thickness on breaking from an energetic point of view we compared energy dissipation by breaking first we confirmed that e k was equal to e p for incident isws for all cases which supports the validity of the numerical simulations fig 8 we defined the peak ratio of e t for a reflected internal wave and an incident isw as practical reflection coefficient c p in contrast to the practical reflection coefficient the reflection coefficient c r e f as defined by michallet and ivey 1999 is obtained by integrating the spatial distribution of available potential and kinetic energies bourgault and kelley 2007 therefore when the practical reflection coefficient is much smaller than the reflection coefficient we can expect that the reflected internal waves consist of a broad range of internal wave frequencies i e we can evaluate the broadening of reflected internal waves from a slope by comparing practical reflection coefficients with reflection coefficients therefore the combination of both reflection coefficients can provide important information about how an isw deforms into a broad range of internal waves for the cases with the thinnest pycnocline a i 0 01 m the practical reflection coefficient was 68 29 11 and 5 for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively in cases 1 is s c p and f a i 0 01 m in the breaking zone the peak in e k was larger than that of the incident isw for collapsing plunging and fission breakers fig 8 we conjecture that available potential energy was effectively transferred to kinetic energy due to breaking to a greater extent in collapsing plunging and fission breakers compared to surging breakers which resulted in considerably higher energy reflection with surging breakers in the cases of a i 0 01 m in general an isw tends to become unstable when the brunt väisälä frequency decreases which corresponds to thicker pycnocline conditions in this study therefore practical reflection coefficients decreased for all thickness ratios when pycnocline thickness increased fig 8 the practical reflection coefficient was 33 13 9 and 2 for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers respectively in cases 8 is s c p and f a i 0 12 m practical reflection coefficients decreased greatly for surging and collapsing breakers in cases 8 is s and c a i 0 12 m compared to cases 1 is s and c a i 0 01 m fig 8 in particular spatially integrated e k was relatively greater over the slope in the case when a i 0 12 m compared to a i 0 01 m for surging breakers in which the practical reflection coefficient decreased most significantly fig 8 breaking points shifted offshore for surging breaker to a greater extent than for the other breakers suggesting that more substantial breaking occurred in the surging breaker than the others when pycnocline thickness increased fig 8 consequently we conjecture that under thick pycnocline conditions available potential energy was transferred to kinetic energy over the slope more efficiently for the surging breaker therefore for surging and collapsing breakers energy decreased more actively due to turbulent dissipation with thicker pycnoclines 4 discussion we found that all classification factors for cases s c p and f 1 to 8 were valid even with the largest increase in pycnocline thickness to confirm the applicability of the categorization in fig 2 we filled the gap in the classification diagram by adding eight more numerical simulations of extreme pycnocline thickness cases as ac ap and af 1 and 2 a i 0 01 m and a i 0 12 m tables 1 and 2 cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 are also well categorized into surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers according to the classification by nakayama et al 2019b fig 2 however there existed a combination of breakers with increased pycnocline thickness figs 3 5 and 6 anti clockwise and clockwise circulations occurred for a collapsing and plunging breakers clearly when the pycnocline thickness is thin fig 9 a and d the circulations became weaker when the pycnocline thickness increased in particular a plunging breaker showed the collapsing characteristic slightly which is so called a collapsing plunging breaker fig 9f nevertheless the clockwise circulation was formed even when pycnocline is the thickest therefore all classification factors were confirmed to be valid even with the largest increase in the pycnocline thickness and there may be no significant difference in the characteristics of breaker type even when pycnocline thickness varies as summarized in s1 table 3 nakayama et al 2019b demonstrated the classification s applicability into a real stratified fluid using the results of vlasenko and hutter 2002 they simulated a plunging breaker under the real scale condition in which the upper and lower layer thicknesses are 50 m and 950 m their result was categorized into a plunging breaker suggesting the high applicability of nakayama s classification nakayama et al 2019b also showed that a fission beaker occurs predominantly in a real scale because the natural bottom slope is mild enough to allow fission or plunging breakers due to the high internal reynolds number besides the applicability of nakayama s classification to the wide range of real scale conditions remains to be investigated in the future as shown in cases s c p and f is 1 8 all breaking points for cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 appeared below the critical depth fig 4 also the breaking points of collapsing and fission breakers appeared onshore from the turning point the surging breaking point occurred close to the turning point and the plunging breaking point occurred offshore from the turning point when pycnocline thickness increased breaking points for all breakers shifted offshore in cases as ac ap and af 1 to 2 fig 4 in the fission breakers cases f 1 to 8 the breaking points shifted onshore when pycnocline thickness increased therefore excluding fission breakers breaking points are likely to shift offshore with an increase in the pycnocline thickness s2 in table 3 for the reflection of the internal waves from the sloping boundary nakayama and imberger 2010 demonstrated that the reflection coefficient of internal waves tends to become zero in a two layer fluid of equivalent depth when the amplitude of an incident internal wave is more than the critical amplitude the practical reflection coefficient was 29 in case c 1 which represents conditions similar to the case by nakayama and imberger 2010 when the reflection coefficient was zero this is because nakayama and imberger 2010 used sinusoidal internal waves propagated over a flat bottom using the same water depth setup in a two layer fluid an isw may reflect more than a sinusoidal type internal wave energy dissipation due to the breaking of an isw over a slope is one of the most significant issues in the ocean michallet and ivey 1999 bourgault and kelley 2007 therefore we computed the time series of the spatially integrated available potential and kinetic energies φ p and φ k by integrating available potential and kinetic energies e p and e k horizontally from offshore to the breaking point in a non breaking zone regarding e k we also obtained the spatially integrated kinetic energy ψ k by integrating kinetic energy e k in the region from the breaking point to the most onshore point in a breaking zone fig 10 here φ t φ p φ k and we define reflection coefficient c r e f which is the ratio of φ t for a reflected internal wave and an incident isw our definition of reflection coefficient corresponds to that of the reflection coefficient by michallet and ivey 1999 and bourgault et al 2007 reflection coefficients were greater in order for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers under thin pycnocline conditions fig 10 a surging breaker with a i 0 01 m had the maximum reflection coefficients of 86 in case s 1 and 82 in case as 1 when a i 0 01 m the minimum reflection coefficients were 25 case f 1 and 17 case af 1 in a fission breaker which was higher than the practical reflection coefficients 5 and 3 because the wavelength of the reflected internal wave had broader range frequencies than the incident isw which results in the reduction of the peak of total energy in the reflected internal wave when a i 0 12 m surging and collapsing breakers had larger decreases in reflection coefficients compared to the other breakers with a i 0 01 m concerning the spatially integrated kinetic energy ψ k in the breaking zone the thicker the pycnocline the larger the ψ k for surging and collapsing breakers we conjecture that available potential energy over a slope was transferred to kinetic energy by breaking which enhances energy dissipation and decreases reflection coefficients when pycnocline thickness increased for surging and collapsing breakers practical reflection coefficients provide essential information on the internal wave reflected from a slope for the investigation of real scale phenomena therefore we attempted to clarify the effect of pycnocline thickness on practical reflection coefficients fig 11 practical reflection coefficients dramatically decreased until the pycnocline thickness equaled to the upper layer thickness α i h 1 1 0 for surging and collapsing breakers and became almost constant in the range of α i h 1 1 0 fig 11a s3 in table 3 in contrast the practical reflection coefficients were less than 10 and did not change under varying pycnocline thickness for plunging and fission breakers s3 in table 3 on the other hand spatially integrated energy dissipation i e the reflection coefficient is also vital for real scale modelling reflection coefficients were higher in order for surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers in the same manner as practical reflection coefficients in this study s8 in table 3 interestingly the reflection coefficients were almost constant under changing pycnocline thickness for plunging and fission breakers but changed slightly in the range from α i h 1 0 to α i h 1 0 6 for surging and collapsing breakers because of the offshore shift in breaking points which makes breaking more dynamic fig 11b s4 in table 3 interestingly the difference between c p and c r e f for surging and collapsing breakers became more remarkable with an increase in the pycnocline thickness thus we conjecture that energy is transferred to a broad range of frequencies due to the isw breaking for surging and collapsing breakers to a greater extent than plunging and fission breakers under thick pycnocline conditions compared to thin pycnocline condition s5 in table 3 michallet and ivey 1999 demonstrated that the reflection coefficient was a function of λ l note that their experimental conditions were categorized as plunging breakers using the classification indices by nakayama et al 2019b the reflection coefficients presented in this study are slightly larger but those for plunging cases are close to their laboratory experiment results fig 12 a chen et al 2007 showed the similar tendency as our results in which the reflection coefficients obtained from the laboratory experiments were slightly larger than michallet and ivey 1999 on the other hand bourgault and kelley 2007 investigated the reflection coefficient using the same conditions as michallet and ivey 1999 showing that the reflection coefficient is a function of the internal iribarren number ξ i s s w our results appeared to agree with the criteria of bourgault and kelley 2007 better than michallet and ivey 1999 which suggests the high applicability of the following equation to thin pycnocline conditions fig 12b s7 in table 3 8 c r e f 1 exp ξ i in thick pycnocline conditions reflection coefficients are slightly smaller for surging and collapsing breakers compared to eq 10 however all cases agree well with eq 8 since aghsaee et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 and nakayama et al 2019b suggested that the internal iribarren number has difficulty in capturing the characteristics of breaker types for an isw over a slope further research is needed to confirm the validity of the relationship between the reflection coefficient and the internal iribarren number 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of breaker type on energy dissipation due to an isw breaking over a uniform slope when pycnocline thickness varies table 3 we showed the possibility of classifying isw breaking into surging collapsing plunging and fission breakers using bottom slope gradient wave slope and the internal reynolds number proposed by nakayama et al 2019b even when the pycnocline thickness reaches the water surface practical reflection coefficients became smaller with the increase in pycnocline thickness for surging and collapsing breakers while it was constant for plunging and fission breakers under changing pycnocline thickness on the other hand the reflection coefficient of spatially integrated energy from a slope did not change significantly under varying pycnocline thickness except for a slight decrease for surging and collapsing breakers when pycnocline thickness increased the definition of gbl by aghsaee et al 2010 could be used to predict the breaking points of an isw propagating under different pycnocline thickness the reflection coefficient of an isw from a slope may be estimated as a function of the iribarren number even for thick pycnocline cases note that our two dimensional simulations may underestimate 8 energy dissipation than a three dimensional simulation as demonstrated in
