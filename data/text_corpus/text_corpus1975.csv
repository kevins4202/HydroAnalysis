compared with ambient temperature it means that deficit irrigation is better applied to reduce root biomass accumulation in the superficial soil layer 0 40 cm especially at sixth leaf to 12th leaf stage and milk to physiological maturity stage for maize to some extent the reduced water infiltration in soil profile offset the increased soil evaporation at 0 80 cm layer under warming simultaneously the maize water uptake for shallow soil layers was greatly induced due to the decrease acclimation of vapor pressure deficit vpd especially during tasseling silking to maturation stage

forner et al 2016 grossiord et al 2017 xu et al 2021 water uptake from roots to leaves played an essential role in water cycle in the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac by indicating canopy transpiration and soil water status understanding the depth distribution and magnitude of root water uptake is critical for planning irrigation and developing crop acclimation strategies to warming warming would expect to reduce soil water content swc nadal sala et al 2021 and amplify drought intensity by higher evapotranspiration from soils and plants will et al 2013 williams et al 2013 beyer et al 2018 so crop often tend to absorb water from deep water sources to resist high temperature environment or droughts brunel et al 1995 1997 williams and ehleringer 2000 however some researches pointed out that warming restricted or even reduced trees water uptake from deep moisture sources by lowering their root activity hendrick and pregitzer 1993 west et al 2006 2007 williams et al 2013 crop root elongation drennan and nobel 1998 and root foraging capacity grossiord et al 2017 compared with ambient conditions meanwhile every plant root system may subject to different temperature extreme such as pinon may not alter its water use in response to warming grossiord et al 2017 on the other hand increased vapor pressure deficit vpd and crop transpiration under warming condition could modify root water uptake patterns in comparison with ambient conditions will et al 2013 williams et al 2013 therefore warming will have a profound impact on agroecosystem water balances and plant adaptation determining how water sources will change under projected warming is critical for enhancing our knowledge of crop water uptake acclimation to future warming and providing new insights into agricultural water management meanwhile in order to accurately predict crop growth and water use under future climate change indicating the depth distribution and magnitude of root water uptake is essential to improve model assumptions and optimize model parameters peng et al 2020 however a comprehensive assessment of crop seasonal water uptake pattern under warming is lacking on the other hand to which extent soil water contributions at different depths will be change accompanying by crop growth variations under warming is poorly known therefore it was essential to accurately monitor climatic factors temperature humidity vpd etc soil water dynamics and crop water uptake patterns in gspac during the whole growing stages by warming stable isotopes δd and δ18o tracing technique has provided an effective way to assess crop root water uptake patterns ehleringer and dawson 1992 brunel et al 1995 it was commonly assumed that there was no isotopic fractionation in the root water uptake process zimmermann et al 1968 comparing the difference of isotopic compositions in crop and its potential water sources gives important clues to identify the main water uptake depth wang et al 2010 ma and song 2016 the mixsiar bayesian mixing model was widely used to quantify definite contributions of different water sources to crops due to its advantages in consideration of their uncertainties ma and song 2016 in this study the water transformation dynamical processes experimental device wtdped was developed to control climatic conditions and monitored water fluxes in the gspac two experiments of maize under increased temperature by 2 c t warm and ambient temperature t control scenarios were conducted by wtdped device simultaneously the mixsiar bayesian mixing model together with δd and δ18o dual stable isotopes was used to determine the seasonal water uptake depth and quantify the contributions of different water sources for summer maize the primary objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the contribution of soil water at different depths to crop water uptake at different growing stages of summer maize 2 compare the seasonal variations in maize water uptake patterns under t control and t warm experiments 3 identify the soil water dynamic after irrigation for summer maize under t control and t warm experiments the results of this study are expected to provide implications for crop water utilization and agricultural water management to adapt to warming environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the water transformation dynamical processes experimental device wtdped the wtdped was located at the key laboratory of water cycle and related land surface processes institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr beijing china it can monitor water movement in gspac by a climatic chamber a weighing lysimeters and a groundwater supply subsystem fig 1 the climatic chamber was used to monitor climatic factors and the weighing lysimeters can measure crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamic simultaneously the groundwater recharge and seepage also can be monitored by groundwater supply subsystem in wtdped the length width and high of the device were 7 m 5 m and 4 5 m above the surface of soil respectively the details of the device can be found in wu et al 2018 2 2 experimental design the designed and observed climatic factors were monitored in the t control and t warm experiment the average values of daily meteorological data ta rh co2 concentration etc were simulated for 10 year 2000 2010 during the whole growing season of maize in beijing to fully reflect the normal diurnal variation the ta was designed every three hours using the for 10 year average values at 01 00 04 00 07 00 10 00 13 00 16 00 19 00 and 22 00 in the t control experiment and increase of 2 at the corresponding time point for the t warm experiment the mean annual ta was approximately 23 5 and 25 4 in the t control and t warm experiment respectively fig 2 the vpd ranged from 0 2 to 1 9 and 0 3 2 7 hpa with the average value of 1 0 and 1 2 hpa in the t control and t warm experiment respectively the whole maize growing season was from may 17th 2014 to september 19th 2014 in the t control experiment and january 7th 2015 to may 4th 2015 in the t warm experiment respectively seedlings of maize variety zhengdan 958 beijing china were manually transplanted with the planting density of 6 0 plants m 2 the whole growing period of summer maize was divided into six stages planting time to sixth leaf stage pt v6 sixth leaf to 12th leaf stage v6 v12 12th leaf to tasseling silking stage v12 vt tasseling silking stage to milk stage vt r3 and milk stage to physiological maturity stage r3 r6 the corresponding dates of these six stages for maize in both experiments were showed in table 1 the bulk density saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity of our experimental soil was 1 55 g cm 3 0 45 cm3cm 3 and 19 95 cmd 1 respectively every treatment has two reduplications with the same soil properties and soil texture of sandy loam the total irrigation amount was both 300 mm in the two treatments the compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 was applied in accordance with the local farmer s practices and it happened at the same growth stage in both experiments the schedules for irrigation and fertilization applied in both treatments were listed in table 1 for deeply investigating the soil water dynamic and water uptake pattern after irrigation the δd labeled experiments were conducted along with the irrigation event on july 1st in t control treatment and march 30th in t warm experiment during the vt stage for maize the standard deuterium isotope solution 99 9 was mixed with irrigation water in a ratio of 1 1000 the soil water and stem water were sampled in the same day for measuring hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes 2 3 water sampling and isotope analyses irrigation water soil water and stem water in the t control and t warm experiment were sampled for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analysis 2 3 1 irrigation water samples irrigation water samples were collected from the irrigation water pipe and transferred to a bottle at once and sealed and then kept frozen in a freezer 15 to 20 before isotopic analysis 2 3 2 soil water samples thirteen porous ceramic suction cups dls ⅱ igsnrr beijing china were installed at depths of 10 33 43 53 63 73 82 5 100 5 120 5 140 5 170 5 200 5 230 5and 265 5 cm in each lysimeter for extracting the different depths of soil water a vacuum of 0 8 mpa was applied to the suction lysimeter in 12 h for collecting the soil water for isotope analyses at different growing stages for summer maize wang et al 2012 then the soil water samples were transferred to bottles and sealed and then kept frozen in a freezer the same as the irrigation water 2 3 3 stem water samples three plants were selected for maize stem sampling and measuring in each plot the stems close to the soil and below the first node were selected for stem water extracted the epidermis of the stems was detached because of isotopic equilibrium with the isotopically exhausted atmospheric water vapor brunel et al 1997 every stem was cut into pieces and placed in a vial and sealed with membrane and saved in a freezer for extracting stem water before hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analysis then they were extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 lica china west et al 2006 the extracting percent of water for stem samples need to over 98 0 δd and δ18o were measured by lgr lgr dlt100 usa in the environmental isotope laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences results were expressed as parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 0 the results were indicated as δ values which were relative to vsmow on a normalized scale δ rsample rstandard rstandard 1000 where r indicated the ratio of 18o and 16o or 2h and 1h precisions of 0 1 2 s d and 1 2 s d were obtained for δ18o and δd in standard water sample respectively 2 4 the mixsiar model quantifying the contributions of water sources during the growing stages for summer maize was conducted by the mixsiar bayesian isotope mixing model v2 1 3 the 3 m soil profile was divided into four layers of 0 20 20 40 40 80 and 80 270 cm the input data of the mixsiar model were the measured dual isotope values δd and δ18o of stem water and soil water in different depths and mean isotope discrimination values with standard error for different depths of soil water since there is no isotopic fractionation in the process of plant water absorption the discrimination values of different sources were set to 0 both δd and δ18o ehleringer and dawson 1992 the estimated median 50 quantiles ratio the median source contribution value for each water source was analyzed for comparisons 2 5 statistical analysis differences of the seasonal variations in the isotopic compositions of water sources and water uptake contributions for summer maize were compared between the warming and current treatments via analysis of variance anova with lsd least significance difference all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss version 22 0 software package ibm corp chicago illinois usa the level of statistical significance was determined as p 0 05 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition of water there was no significant difference of δ18o 6 2 0 6 3 0 2 and δd 50 1 0 22 49 7 0 85 for irrigation water in t control and t warm respectively soil water isotopes were more enriched than irrigation water isotopes the line fitting between δd and δ18o in soil water was δd 7 40δ18o 7 5 r2 0 68 in t control treatment and it was δd 9 80δ18o 7 4 r2 0 62 in t warm treatment soil water isotopes varied with soil depths and were enriched in topsoil and depleted with depth fig 3 the soil water isotopes in the t warm treatment were more enriched than those of t control treatments especially δd values of soil water in the upper layer of 10 53 cm fig 3 this may be due to the fact that higher evaporation takes away lighter isotopes under warming the δd and δ18o of stem water ranged from 47 87 to 29 40 and 4 86 to 4 00 respectively in t control which fell near the fitting line of soil water δd δ18o relationship as shown in fig 3a however the average δd and δ18o values of stem water were 36 66 5 52 and 4 28 0 57 in t warm experiment respectively so warming increased the δd and δ18o values in stem water the values of stem water isotopes were close to soil water isotopes values in the 10 33 cm and 43 73 cm layers especially in t warm treatment fig 3b 3 2 difference of δd and δ18o in stem water and soil water at different maize growth stages the average δd and δ18o in stem water during different growth stages for maize were compared in fig 4 a b it indicated that there were no significant differences of average δd and δ18o in stem water at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages under current and warming experiments p 0 05 however the average δd and δ18o in stem water were more enriched at pt v6 and r3 r6 stage in t warm experiment than that in t control experiment although warming had no great impact on isotopic composition of stem water for maize in our experiments it varied in maize growth stages during the whole maize growth stages the soil layers were divided into 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 140 cm and 140 270 cm layers to compare the differences of average δd and δ18o in soil water in t control and t warm experiments fig 4c and d the average δd and δ18o in soil water were more depleted as soil layers depth increased both in t control and t warm experiments although warming had no significant effect on the average δd and δ18o in different soil waters for the whole growth stages of maize in our experiments it varied in different soil layers the average δd values of soil water in 10 265 5 cm in t warm treatment was more enriched than that in t control treatment p 0 05 and warming significantly decreased the average δd values in 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 however there was no significant difference of average δ18o values in soil water in two treatments p 0 05 the average δd values of soil water in 63 265 5 cm layer were more enriched in t warm treatment than these in t control treatment warming did not increase the average δd and δ18o in topsoil but led the enrichment of average δd and δ18o in deep soil layers especially the average δd in 40 80 cm 3 3 contributions of soil water at different depths to maize water uptake the contributions of soil water at different soil depths to crop water uptake during different growing stages for summer maize was quantified by mixsiar bayesian isotope mixing model in fig 5 summer maize mainly used soil water from 0 to 20 cm depth at the pt v6 stage both in t control and t warm experiments with the mean values of 28 9 and 25 7 respectively fig 5a at the v6 v12 stage the maximal contributions of soil water in the layers of 40 80 cm in t control treatment and 20 40 cm in t warm experiment were 27 2 and 31 4 respectively fig 5b the water uptake depth was concentrated in the 20 40 cm layer and 0 20 cm layer at the v12 vt stage for summer maize in t control and t warm treatments respectively and the contributions were 30 8 and 36 6 respectively fig 5c at vt r3 stage fig 5d the water uptake depth was concentrated in the 0 20 cm layer again and the contribution of this layer to crop water uptake attained 41 4 in t warm experiment however the 0 20 cm soil layer only contributed 24 to crop water uptake and 20 40 cm layer contributed 27 1 in t control treatment therefore the dominant water uptake depth returned to 0 40 cm with more than 63 5 and 69 4 contribution at the vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in the t warm treatment fig 5e whereas the contribution of 0 40 cm soil layer to crop water uptake only was 39 6 at r3 r6 stage in the t control treatment the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers ranged from 48 6 to 69 4 during the whole growth stages in the t warm treatment however the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers decreased from 45 1 at pt v3 stage to 32 at v3 v12 stage then it increased to 50 4 and 51 1 in v12 vt vt r3 stage respectively lastly it decreased to 39 6 at r3 r6 stage in t control treatments the soil water in the 40 270 cm layers in the t control treatments contributed more to summer maize water uptake than it did in the t warm treatment particularly from pt to vt stage warming improved the crop water uptake contribution of 0 40 cm soil layer especially at v12 to r6 stage the difference of the contribution of soil water at different depths to crop water uptake during the whole growing stages for summer maize were showed in fig 5 f warming significantly improved the contributions of soil water at 0 20 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 however there was no great impact on the contributions of soil water at 20 40 40 80 and 80 140 layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 under warming in comparison with ambient conditions in our experiments simultaneously warming greatly decreased the contributions of soil water at 140 270 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 3 4 the vertical variation of δd and water potential in soil water after irrigation by δd labeling experiments to clarify the vertical variations of soil water dynamic evapotranspiration and infiltration because of irrigation the profiles of δd value soil matric potential and soil volumetric water content during irrigation events were illuminated by δd labeled experiments in fig 6 the soil water potential and δd values in all soil layers were depleted enough in t control treatment until irrigation on july 1st after irrigation the soil water potential and δd values in 10 60 cm layer were greatly increased and enriched in t control treatment fig 6a however the δd values in deep soil 60 265 5 cm were not affected in t control treatment by the δd labeled experiment on the first day after added δd labeled irrigation water δd in soil water at the 0 40 cm soil layer both in t control and t warm experiments were increased rapidly fig 6a and b on the fourth day after irrigation δd in soil water at the 0 40 cm soil layer increased again due to soil evaporation the δd in soil water at the 40 60 cm soil layer was affected by water infiltration even on the 25th day after irrigation zero flux plane zfp could give critical clues for soil evaporation and infiltration in soil profile there were two zfps happened during the irrigation event and they occurred at 40 and 70 cm depth on the first day and stabilized at 40 cm and 100 cm on the last five days after irrigation in t control treatment fig 6c while in t warm treatment fig 6d zfp was at 40 cm depth on the first day after irrigation then extended to 50 cm depth on the second day after irrigation and deepens to 60 cm and then extended to 80 cm depth on the five day both the movement of zero flux plane and enrichment of δd suggest evaporation mainly occurred in the soil layer 0 40 cm in t control treatment but 0 80 cm in t warm treatment and the water infiltration after 60 mm irrigation extended to 100 cm and 80 cm in t control and t warm treatments respectively on the second day after irrigation in t warm treatment δd in soil water at the 60 240 cm layer fig 6b was decreasing however soil water content at the 60 240 cm layer fig 6f was increasing partly because of isotope fractionation effect occurred in the process of water infiltration however it did not occur in t control treatment until 25 days after irrigation fig 6a and e meanwhile this irrigation with labeled δd greatly affected the δd values in 10 33 cm layer and soil water content variations in 10 100 cm layers in t warm treatment fig 6 therefore although warming enhanced the soil water content at the 80 100 cm layer fig 6f it resulted in the depletion of δd values in deep soil 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of warming 2 on maize water uptake patterns summer maize had a fibrous root system and the vast majority of its roots were distributed in the upper 40 cm of soil liu et al 2009 yi et al 2009 root depth and biomass improved as maize grow and reached its maximum at tasseling or milk stages ma and song 2016 showed that the contribution of 0 20 cm soil layer to summer maize water uptake was 67 7 60 5 47 5 and 43 9 at the seeding jointing tasseling and harvest stages respectively and at the milk stage the main depth of root water uptake was 20 50 cm maize had a bias towards shallower soil water at the early growth stages and gradually inclined to absorb deep soil water then used shallower soil water again accompanying with the aging of crops this is in agreement with a previous study showing that summer maize mainly uses the shallow soil water at 0 20 cm layer in jointing stage and extending to 20 50 cm in flowering stage then 0 20 cm again in full ripe stage wang et al 2010 our results from the ambient treatment indicated that the main water uptake depth was 0 20 cm 40 80 cm 20 40 cm 20 40 cm and 20 40 cm at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages respectively the period of preferential use of deep water occurred earlier in our study and this maybe because the soil compactness in our experimental filled soil was more conducive to root deep growth in the maize early stages meanwhile the soil water content was sufficient enough especially in the deeper layers in our experiment during the whole growth stages for maize wu et al 2018 so maize could get adequate water in shallow soil layers and did not need to reinforce its access to deep water sources simultaneously our results found that warming significantly improved the contributions of soil water at 0 20 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 especially at v12 r6 stages and it greatly decreased the contributions of soil water at 140 270 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 mainly during vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in our t warm experiment obviously warming further enhanced water uptake in shallow soil water especially in the late maize growth stages in our experiment this is consistent with a previous study indicating that warming could decrease roots water uptake from deep moisture sources for juniper grossiord et al 2017 warming would also strengthen soil evaporation and crop evapotranspiration by increasing the vapor pressure deficit vpd will et al 2013 in our study warming mainly increased the vpd and evapotranspiration during the early growth stages for maize before 60 days after transplanting fig 2 and it induced the deeper soil water uptake for maize growth in some extent however the slight decrease of vpd during the reproductive growth stages led the decrease of soil evaporation and plant evapotranspiration so maize was inclined to absorb shallow soil water until it was ripe 4 2 the difference on soil water dynamic after irrigation between t control and t warm treatments our results showed that on the fifth day after irrigation for maize deep soil water content attained its maximum due to water infiltration in t control and t warm treatment wu et al 2016 however the δd in soil water at the 60 240 cm layer was decreasing accompanying with isotope fractionation effect and the δd in stem water at vt r3 stage were more enriched suggesting less deep water 60 240 cm layer uptake for maize during this stage this could be related to isotopic enrichment associated with upper water loss by soil evaporation and water infiltration which had been illuminated in ehleringer and dawson 1992 the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers reached 51 1 in t control treatment and 69 4 in t warm treatment when δd labeled irrigation happened these results were agreed with the previous studies indicating that 32 78 of maize water uptake was from the 0 20 cm layer on the first day after irrigation and 6 80 and 30 60 from 60 to 80 cm and 40 60 cm on the seventh day after irrigation wu et al 2016 on the seventh day after irrigation the deeper soil water contents were increased due to water infiltration however our study indicated that summer maize absorbed water mainly from the upper soil layers even at times when water was abundant in deeper soil layers especially in late growth stages for maize under warming the dominant water uptake depth returned to 0 40 cm at the vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in the t warm treatment it might result from the difference of environmental parameters such as vpd williams et al 2013 garcia forner et al 2016 and leaf water potential stahl et al 2013 4 3 implications and further scopes of this study this study quantified the contributions of different water sources to maize water uptake patterns at gspac interfaces under current and warming experiments by a new device and mixsiar model we have demonstrated that predicted climate change could modify water sources of summer maize and it varied in different growing stages these findings suggested that summer maize tends to absorb the shallow soil water under warming it gives new perspectives that acclimation of water uptake patterns may not increase the resistance of summer maize to warming in relatively smaller water supply however several issues still need further investigation first more experiments should be conducted under different temperature gradients to synthetically indicate the responses of water cycle and crop growth in gspac to warming synchronously warming had an important impact on leaf water potential stomatal conductance and net assimilation rates etc integrated monitoring these indicators was of great significance for synthesized analysis the mechanism of crop water uptake under warming last but not the least as one of the components of climate change the response of crop water uptake patterns to co2 and precipitation conditions in gspac was also crucial for systematically elucidating the impact of future climate change to water cycle and crop growth 5 conclusion in this study the mixsiar bayesian mixing model coupled with d and 18o dual stable isotopes technique was conducted to determine seasonal variations in water uptake of summer maize under t control and t warm treatments by wtdped device the main water uptake depth was 0 20 cm 28 9 40 80 cm 27 2 20 40 cm 30 8 20 40 cm 27 1 and 20 40 cm 24 7 at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages respectively in t control experiment however the average contribution of soil water were 25 7 0 20 cm 31 4 20 40 cm 36 6 0 20 cm 41 4 0 20 cm and 35 0 0 20 cm at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in t warm treatment respectively simultaneously warming significantly improved the proportions of soil water contributions at 0 40 cm layer mainly due to vpd and soil water content especially in v12 r6 stages for maize therefore smaller water supply and more irrigation times were required under warming especially during the reproductive periods our study could be served as a reference to develop more effective agricultural water managements for improving crop water

compared with ambient temperature it means that deficit irrigation is better applied to reduce root biomass accumulation in the superficial soil layer 0 40 cm especially at sixth leaf to 12th leaf stage and milk to physiological maturity stage for maize to some extent the reduced water infiltration in soil profile offset the increased soil evaporation at 0 80 cm layer under warming simultaneously the maize water uptake for shallow soil layers was greatly induced due to the decrease acclimation of vapor pressure deficit vpd especially during tasseling silking to maturation stage

et al 2013 crop root elongation drennan and nobel 1998 and root foraging capacity grossiord et al 2017 compared with ambient conditions meanwhile every plant root system may subject to different temperature extreme such as pinon may not alter its water use in response to warming grossiord et al 2017 on the other hand increased vapor pressure deficit vpd and crop transpiration under warming condition could modify root water uptake patterns in comparison with ambient conditions will et al 2013 williams et al 2013 therefore warming will have a profound impact on agroecosystem water balances and plant adaptation determining how water sources will change under projected warming is critical for enhancing our knowledge of crop water uptake acclimation to future warming and providing new insights into agricultural water management meanwhile in order to accurately predict crop growth and water use under future climate change indicating the depth distribution and magnitude of root water uptake is essential to improve model assumptions and optimize model parameters peng et al 2020 however a comprehensive assessment of crop seasonal water uptake pattern under warming is lacking on the other hand to which extent soil water contributions at different depths will be change accompanying by crop growth variations under warming is poorly known therefore it was essential to accurately monitor climatic factors temperature humidity vpd etc soil water dynamics and crop water uptake patterns in gspac during the whole growing stages by warming stable isotopes δd and δ18o tracing technique has provided an effective way to assess crop root water uptake patterns ehleringer and dawson 1992 brunel et al 1995 it was commonly assumed that there was no isotopic fractionation in the root water uptake process zimmermann et al 1968 comparing the difference of isotopic compositions in crop and its potential water sources gives important clues to identify the main water uptake depth wang et al 2010 ma and song 2016 the mixsiar bayesian mixing model was widely used to quantify definite contributions of different water sources to crops due to its advantages in consideration of their uncertainties ma and song 2016 in this study the water transformation dynamical processes experimental device wtdped was developed to control climatic conditions and monitored water fluxes in the gspac two experiments of maize under increased temperature by 2 c t warm and ambient temperature t control scenarios were conducted by wtdped device simultaneously the mixsiar bayesian mixing model together with δd and δ18o dual stable isotopes was used to determine the seasonal water uptake depth and quantify the contributions of different water sources for summer maize the primary objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the contribution of soil water at different depths to crop water uptake at different growing stages of summer maize 2 compare the seasonal variations in maize water uptake patterns under t control and t warm experiments 3 identify the soil water dynamic after irrigation for summer maize under t control and t warm experiments the results of this study are expected to provide implications for crop water utilization and agricultural water management to adapt to warming environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the water transformation dynamical processes experimental device wtdped the wtdped was located at the key laboratory of water cycle and related land surface processes institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr beijing china it can monitor water movement in gspac by a climatic chamber a weighing lysimeters and a groundwater supply subsystem fig 1 the climatic chamber was used to monitor climatic factors and the weighing lysimeters can measure crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamic simultaneously the groundwater recharge and seepage also can be monitored by groundwater supply subsystem in wtdped the length width and high of the device were 7 m 5 m and 4 5 m above the surface of soil respectively the details of the device can be found in wu et al 2018 2 2 experimental design the designed and observed climatic factors were monitored in the t control and t warm experiment the average values of daily meteorological data ta rh co2 concentration etc were simulated for 10 year 2000 2010 during the whole growing season of maize in beijing to fully reflect the normal diurnal variation the ta was designed every three hours using the for 10 year average values at 01 00 04 00 07 00 10 00 13 00 16 00 19 00 and 22 00 in the t control experiment and increase of 2 at the corresponding time point for the t warm experiment the mean annual ta was approximately 23 5 and 25 4 in the t control and t warm experiment respectively fig 2 the vpd ranged from 0 2 to 1 9 and 0 3 2 7 hpa with the average value of 1 0 and 1 2 hpa in the t control and t warm experiment respectively the whole maize growing season was from may 17th 2014 to september 19th 2014 in the t control experiment and january 7th 2015 to may 4th 2015 in the t warm experiment respectively seedlings of maize variety zhengdan 958 beijing china were manually transplanted with the planting density of 6 0 plants m 2 the whole growing period of summer maize was divided into six stages planting time to sixth leaf stage pt v6 sixth leaf to 12th leaf stage v6 v12 12th leaf to tasseling silking stage v12 vt tasseling silking stage to milk stage vt r3 and milk stage to physiological maturity stage r3 r6 the corresponding dates of these six stages for maize in both experiments were showed in table 1 the bulk density saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity of our experimental soil was 1 55 g cm 3 0 45 cm3cm 3 and 19 95 cmd 1 respectively every treatment has two reduplications with the same soil properties and soil texture of sandy loam the total irrigation amount was both 300 mm in the two treatments the compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 was applied in accordance with the local farmer s practices and it happened at the same growth stage in both experiments the schedules for irrigation and fertilization applied in both treatments were listed in table 1 for deeply investigating the soil water dynamic and water uptake pattern after irrigation the δd labeled experiments were conducted along with the irrigation event on july 1st in t control treatment and march 30th in t warm experiment during the vt stage for maize the standard deuterium isotope solution 99 9 was mixed with irrigation water in a ratio of 1 1000 the soil water and stem water were sampled in the same day for measuring hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes 2 3 water sampling and isotope analyses irrigation water soil water and stem water in the t control and t warm experiment were sampled for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analysis 2 3 1 irrigation water samples irrigation water samples were collected from the irrigation water pipe and transferred to a bottle at once and sealed and then kept frozen in a freezer 15 to 20 before isotopic analysis 2 3 2 soil water samples thirteen porous ceramic suction cups dls ⅱ igsnrr beijing china were installed at depths of 10 33 43 53 63 73 82 5 100 5 120 5 140 5 170 5 200 5 230 5and 265 5 cm in each lysimeter for extracting the different depths of soil water a vacuum of 0 8 mpa was applied to the suction lysimeter in 12 h for collecting the soil water for isotope analyses at different growing stages for summer maize wang et al 2012 then the soil water samples were transferred to bottles and sealed and then kept frozen in a freezer the same as the irrigation water 2 3 3 stem water samples three plants were selected for maize stem sampling and measuring in each plot the stems close to the soil and below the first node were selected for stem water extracted the epidermis of the stems was detached because of isotopic equilibrium with the isotopically exhausted atmospheric water vapor brunel et al 1997 every stem was cut into pieces and placed in a vial and sealed with membrane and saved in a freezer for extracting stem water before hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analysis then they were extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2000 lica china west et al 2006 the extracting percent of water for stem samples need to over 98 0 δd and δ18o were measured by lgr lgr dlt100 usa in the environmental isotope laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences results were expressed as parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 0 the results were indicated as δ values which were relative to vsmow on a normalized scale δ rsample rstandard rstandard 1000 where r indicated the ratio of 18o and 16o or 2h and 1h precisions of 0 1 2 s d and 1 2 s d were obtained for δ18o and δd in standard water sample respectively 2 4 the mixsiar model quantifying the contributions of water sources during the growing stages for summer maize was conducted by the mixsiar bayesian isotope mixing model v2 1 3 the 3 m soil profile was divided into four layers of 0 20 20 40 40 80 and 80 270 cm the input data of the mixsiar model were the measured dual isotope values δd and δ18o of stem water and soil water in different depths and mean isotope discrimination values with standard error for different depths of soil water since there is no isotopic fractionation in the process of plant water absorption the discrimination values of different sources were set to 0 both δd and δ18o ehleringer and dawson 1992 the estimated median 50 quantiles ratio the median source contribution value for each water source was analyzed for comparisons 2 5 statistical analysis differences of the seasonal variations in the isotopic compositions of water sources and water uptake contributions for summer maize were compared between the warming and current treatments via analysis of variance anova with lsd least significance difference all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss version 22 0 software package ibm corp chicago illinois usa the level of statistical significance was determined as p 0 05 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition of water there was no significant difference of δ18o 6 2 0 6 3 0 2 and δd 50 1 0 22 49 7 0 85 for irrigation water in t control and t warm respectively soil water isotopes were more enriched than irrigation water isotopes the line fitting between δd and δ18o in soil water was δd 7 40δ18o 7 5 r2 0 68 in t control treatment and it was δd 9 80δ18o 7 4 r2 0 62 in t warm treatment soil water isotopes varied with soil depths and were enriched in topsoil and depleted with depth fig 3 the soil water isotopes in the t warm treatment were more enriched than those of t control treatments especially δd values of soil water in the upper layer of 10 53 cm fig 3 this may be due to the fact that higher evaporation takes away lighter isotopes under warming the δd and δ18o of stem water ranged from 47 87 to 29 40 and 4 86 to 4 00 respectively in t control which fell near the fitting line of soil water δd δ18o relationship as shown in fig 3a however the average δd and δ18o values of stem water were 36 66 5 52 and 4 28 0 57 in t warm experiment respectively so warming increased the δd and δ18o values in stem water the values of stem water isotopes were close to soil water isotopes values in the 10 33 cm and 43 73 cm layers especially in t warm treatment fig 3b 3 2 difference of δd and δ18o in stem water and soil water at different maize growth stages the average δd and δ18o in stem water during different growth stages for maize were compared in fig 4 a b it indicated that there were no significant differences of average δd and δ18o in stem water at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages under current and warming experiments p 0 05 however the average δd and δ18o in stem water were more enriched at pt v6 and r3 r6 stage in t warm experiment than that in t control experiment although warming had no great impact on isotopic composition of stem water for maize in our experiments it varied in maize growth stages during the whole maize growth stages the soil layers were divided into 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 140 cm and 140 270 cm layers to compare the differences of average δd and δ18o in soil water in t control and t warm experiments fig 4c and d the average δd and δ18o in soil water were more depleted as soil layers depth increased both in t control and t warm experiments although warming had no significant effect on the average δd and δ18o in different soil waters for the whole growth stages of maize in our experiments it varied in different soil layers the average δd values of soil water in 10 265 5 cm in t warm treatment was more enriched than that in t control treatment p 0 05 and warming significantly decreased the average δd values in 40 80 cm soil layer p 0 05 however there was no significant difference of average δ18o values in soil water in two treatments p 0 05 the average δd values of soil water in 63 265 5 cm layer were more enriched in t warm treatment than these in t control treatment warming did not increase the average δd and δ18o in topsoil but led the enrichment of average δd and δ18o in deep soil layers especially the average δd in 40 80 cm 3 3 contributions of soil water at different depths to maize water uptake the contributions of soil water at different soil depths to crop water uptake during different growing stages for summer maize was quantified by mixsiar bayesian isotope mixing model in fig 5 summer maize mainly used soil water from 0 to 20 cm depth at the pt v6 stage both in t control and t warm experiments with the mean values of 28 9 and 25 7 respectively fig 5a at the v6 v12 stage the maximal contributions of soil water in the layers of 40 80 cm in t control treatment and 20 40 cm in t warm experiment were 27 2 and 31 4 respectively fig 5b the water uptake depth was concentrated in the 20 40 cm layer and 0 20 cm layer at the v12 vt stage for summer maize in t control and t warm treatments respectively and the contributions were 30 8 and 36 6 respectively fig 5c at vt r3 stage fig 5d the water uptake depth was concentrated in the 0 20 cm layer again and the contribution of this layer to crop water uptake attained 41 4 in t warm experiment however the 0 20 cm soil layer only contributed 24 to crop water uptake and 20 40 cm layer contributed 27 1 in t control treatment therefore the dominant water uptake depth returned to 0 40 cm with more than 63 5 and 69 4 contribution at the vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in the t warm treatment fig 5e whereas the contribution of 0 40 cm soil layer to crop water uptake only was 39 6 at r3 r6 stage in the t control treatment the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers ranged from 48 6 to 69 4 during the whole growth stages in the t warm treatment however the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers decreased from 45 1 at pt v3 stage to 32 at v3 v12 stage then it increased to 50 4 and 51 1 in v12 vt vt r3 stage respectively lastly it decreased to 39 6 at r3 r6 stage in t control treatments the soil water in the 40 270 cm layers in the t control treatments contributed more to summer maize water uptake than it did in the t warm treatment particularly from pt to vt stage warming improved the crop water uptake contribution of 0 40 cm soil layer especially at v12 to r6 stage the difference of the contribution of soil water at different depths to crop water uptake during the whole growing stages for summer maize were showed in fig 5 f warming significantly improved the contributions of soil water at 0 20 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 however there was no great impact on the contributions of soil water at 20 40 40 80 and 80 140 layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 under warming in comparison with ambient conditions in our experiments simultaneously warming greatly decreased the contributions of soil water at 140 270 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 3 4 the vertical variation of δd and water potential in soil water after irrigation by δd labeling experiments to clarify the vertical variations of soil water dynamic evapotranspiration and infiltration because of irrigation the profiles of δd value soil matric potential and soil volumetric water content during irrigation events were illuminated by δd labeled experiments in fig 6 the soil water potential and δd values in all soil layers were depleted enough in t control treatment until irrigation on july 1st after irrigation the soil water potential and δd values in 10 60 cm layer were greatly increased and enriched in t control treatment fig 6a however the δd values in deep soil 60 265 5 cm were not affected in t control treatment by the δd labeled experiment on the first day after added δd labeled irrigation water δd in soil water at the 0 40 cm soil layer both in t control and t warm experiments were increased rapidly fig 6a and b on the fourth day after irrigation δd in soil water at the 0 40 cm soil layer increased again due to soil evaporation the δd in soil water at the 40 60 cm soil layer was affected by water infiltration even on the 25th day after irrigation zero flux plane zfp could give critical clues for soil evaporation and infiltration in soil profile there were two zfps happened during the irrigation event and they occurred at 40 and 70 cm depth on the first day and stabilized at 40 cm and 100 cm on the last five days after irrigation in t control treatment fig 6c while in t warm treatment fig 6d zfp was at 40 cm depth on the first day after irrigation then extended to 50 cm depth on the second day after irrigation and deepens to 60 cm and then extended to 80 cm depth on the five day both the movement of zero flux plane and enrichment of δd suggest evaporation mainly occurred in the soil layer 0 40 cm in t control treatment but 0 80 cm in t warm treatment and the water infiltration after 60 mm irrigation extended to 100 cm and 80 cm in t control and t warm treatments respectively on the second day after irrigation in t warm treatment δd in soil water at the 60 240 cm layer fig 6b was decreasing however soil water content at the 60 240 cm layer fig 6f was increasing partly because of isotope fractionation effect occurred in the process of water infiltration however it did not occur in t control treatment until 25 days after irrigation fig 6a and e meanwhile this irrigation with labeled δd greatly affected the δd values in 10 33 cm layer and soil water content variations in 10 100 cm layers in t warm treatment fig 6 therefore although warming enhanced the soil water content at the 80 100 cm layer fig 6f it resulted in the depletion of δd values in deep soil 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of warming 2 on maize water uptake patterns summer maize had a fibrous root system and the vast majority of its roots were distributed in the upper 40 cm of soil liu et al 2009 yi et al 2009 root depth and biomass improved as maize grow and reached its maximum at tasseling or milk stages ma and song 2016 showed that the contribution of 0 20 cm soil layer to summer maize water uptake was 67 7 60 5 47 5 and 43 9 at the seeding jointing tasseling and harvest stages respectively and at the milk stage the main depth of root water uptake was 20 50 cm maize had a bias towards shallower soil water at the early growth stages and gradually inclined to absorb deep soil water then used shallower soil water again accompanying with the aging of crops this is in agreement with a previous study showing that summer maize mainly uses the shallow soil water at 0 20 cm layer in jointing stage and extending to 20 50 cm in flowering stage then 0 20 cm again in full ripe stage wang et al 2010 our results from the ambient treatment indicated that the main water uptake depth was 0 20 cm 40 80 cm 20 40 cm 20 40 cm and 20 40 cm at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages respectively the period of preferential use of deep water occurred earlier in our study and this maybe because the soil compactness in our experimental filled soil was more conducive to root deep growth in the maize early stages meanwhile the soil water content was sufficient enough especially in the deeper layers in our experiment during the whole growth stages for maize wu et al 2018 so maize could get adequate water in shallow soil layers and did not need to reinforce its access to deep water sources simultaneously our results found that warming significantly improved the contributions of soil water at 0 20 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 especially at v12 r6 stages and it greatly decreased the contributions of soil water at 140 270 cm layer to summer maize water uptake p 0 05 mainly during vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in our t warm experiment obviously warming further enhanced water uptake in shallow soil water especially in the late maize growth stages in our experiment this is consistent with a previous study indicating that warming could decrease roots water uptake from deep moisture sources for juniper grossiord et al 2017 warming would also strengthen soil evaporation and crop evapotranspiration by increasing the vapor pressure deficit vpd will et al 2013 in our study warming mainly increased the vpd and evapotranspiration during the early growth stages for maize before 60 days after transplanting fig 2 and it induced the deeper soil water uptake for maize growth in some extent however the slight decrease of vpd during the reproductive growth stages led the decrease of soil evaporation and plant evapotranspiration so maize was inclined to absorb shallow soil water until it was ripe 4 2 the difference on soil water dynamic after irrigation between t control and t warm treatments our results showed that on the fifth day after irrigation for maize deep soil water content attained its maximum due to water infiltration in t control and t warm treatment wu et al 2016 however the δd in soil water at the 60 240 cm layer was decreasing accompanying with isotope fractionation effect and the δd in stem water at vt r3 stage were more enriched suggesting less deep water 60 240 cm layer uptake for maize during this stage this could be related to isotopic enrichment associated with upper water loss by soil evaporation and water infiltration which had been illuminated in ehleringer and dawson 1992 the contribution of soil water in the 0 40 cm layers reached 51 1 in t control treatment and 69 4 in t warm treatment when δd labeled irrigation happened these results were agreed with the previous studies indicating that 32 78 of maize water uptake was from the 0 20 cm layer on the first day after irrigation and 6 80 and 30 60 from 60 to 80 cm and 40 60 cm on the seventh day after irrigation wu et al 2016 on the seventh day after irrigation the deeper soil water contents were increased due to water infiltration however our study indicated that summer maize absorbed water mainly from the upper soil layers even at times when water was abundant in deeper soil layers especially in late growth stages for maize under warming the dominant water uptake depth returned to 0 40 cm at the vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in the t warm treatment it might result from the difference of environmental parameters such as vpd williams et al 2013 garcia forner et al 2016 and leaf water potential stahl et al 2013 4 3 implications and further scopes of this study this study quantified the contributions of different water sources to maize water uptake patterns at gspac interfaces under current and warming experiments by a new device and mixsiar model we have demonstrated that predicted climate change could modify water sources of summer maize and it varied in different growing stages these findings suggested that summer maize tends to absorb the shallow soil water under warming it gives new perspectives that acclimation of water uptake patterns may not increase the resistance of summer maize to warming in relatively smaller water supply however several issues still need further investigation first more experiments should be conducted under different temperature gradients to synthetically indicate the responses of water cycle and crop growth in gspac to warming synchronously warming had an important impact on leaf water potential stomatal conductance and net assimilation rates etc integrated monitoring these indicators was of great significance for synthesized analysis the mechanism of crop water uptake under warming last but not the least as one of the components of climate change the response of crop water uptake patterns to co2 and precipitation conditions in gspac was also crucial for systematically elucidating the impact of future climate change to water cycle and crop growth 5 conclusion in this study the mixsiar bayesian mixing model coupled with d and 18o dual stable isotopes technique was conducted to determine seasonal variations in water uptake of summer maize under t control and t warm treatments by wtdped device the main water uptake depth was 0 20 cm 28 9 40 80 cm 27 2 20 40 cm 30 8 20 40 cm 27 1 and 20 40 cm 24 7 at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages respectively in t control experiment however the average contribution of soil water were 25 7 0 20 cm 31 4 20 40 cm 36 6 0 20 cm 41 4 0 20 cm and 35 0 0 20 cm at pt v6 v6 v12 v12 vt vt r3 and r3 r6 stages in t warm treatment respectively simultaneously warming significantly improved the proportions of soil water contributions at 0 40 cm layer mainly due to vpd and soil water content especially in v12 r6 stages for maize therefore smaller water supply and more irrigation times were required under warming especially during the reproductive periods our study could be served as a reference to develop more effective agricultural water managements for improving crop water

and evaporation losses wdel are some of the major sprinkler irrigation losses which exist even in a well managed irrigation system several research studies found a wide range of wdel under different and nearly similar configurations of sprinkler irrigation systems under similar weather conditions but using different methodologies to measure the wdel the specific objective of this research was to evaluate the three most commonly used measuring techniques standard catch can tests cc an electrical conductivity method ec and a physical based mathematical approach pm for wdel on a common sprinkler irrigation system under the same climatic conditions we conducted 33 experiments from may to september of 2018 near prosser washington twenty two of these experiments were during the daylight hours and 11 were during the night we used catch cans of 29 3 cm diameter and rain gauges diameter of 10 cm to collect water to measure the irrigation water s electrical conductivity mass and heat transfer approaches were used in the pm technique the results showed that the three techniques yielded statistically different mean wdel the highest wdels were in cc 22 8 followed by ec 17 5 and pm 6 8 techniques the cc wdels were better correlated with pm than the ec approach the mean nighttime wdel for the ec and cc methods were not statistically different p 0 05 the cc wdels were more closely related to wind speed than the vapor pressure deficit the ec and pm approaches have a higher correlation to the vapor pressure deficit the overall conclusion disclosed that the more we use indirect measurement methods the more the chances of erroneous numbers the ec and pm approaches are likely limited to measuring droplet evaporation as the latter includes several assumptions the cc approach is a direct measurement of the wdel keywords wind drift evaporation losses electrical conductivity sprinkler irrigation droplet ballistic theory 1 introduction mechanized sprinkler irrigation systems linear move and center pivot are commonly used worldwide and their use is growing steadily however they are often criticized for their poor resource usage molle et al 2012 the greatest sprinkler irrigation water losses include runoff deep percolation and wind drift and evaporation losses wdel deep percolation and runoff losses can be minimized if the system is controlled and well managed but wdels are mostly a function of the weather and cannot be minimized without modifying the irrigation system mohamed et al 2019 nrc 2007 peters et al 2016 for example sprinkler irrigation evaporation and drift losses range from 2 to 5 for low elevation spray application lesa 15 20 for mid elevation spray application mesa and are around 40 for high pressure impact sprinklers on top of the center pivot pipe sarwar et al 2019 estimating wind drift and evaporation losses from sprinklers is extremely important these are a major source of water losses for sprinkler irrigation systems irrigation system design too high is expensive too low results in crop water stress water rights allocations hugely contentious and large amounts of money involved and the overall irrigation water requirements for irrigation water management depend on the irrigation efficiency and therefore the wdel several researchers documented different techniques to measure wdel with different operating and sprinkler system types in a wide variety of climates mohamed et al 2021 molaei et al 2021 playán et al 2004 2005 uddin 2012 yazar 1984 because sprinkler losses were not defined in common terms and because of uncertainty and measurement errors of the experimental techniques a wide range of sprinkler losses 0 50 have been reported from the last 80 years of research hendawi et al 2005 molle et al 2012 measuring techniques like the standard catch can test electrical conductivity ec method conservative tracer method and physical based mathematical techniques have been used to quantify evaporation and wind drift losses king et al 2012 mclean et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 yan et al 2010 the conservative tracer method is not used frequently because of its complicated and deliberate protocols that are susceptible to measurement errors kohl et al 1987 and king et al 2012 used this method and reported 0 4 1 4 and 0 9 5 2 wdel respectively the standard catch can tests most widely used in wdel and irrigation application efficiency studies reported a higher percentage of wdel than ec conservative tracer and physical based mathematical modeling methods the standard catch can test is frequently criticized for the test protocols and evaporation from within the can during and post irrigation catch can tests measured high wdel especially under extremely windy conditions and for design and operational conditions producing a high percentage of smaller droplets hendawi et al 2005 carran 1976 standard catch can tests measure the combined losses due to wind drift and evaporation this results in a global estimate few efforts were reported to measure wind drift losses separately from evaporation to understand the phenomenon better when using the ec method yazar 1984 the electrical conductivity method for estimating sprinkler wdel was first used by george 1957 this estimates evaporation loss using the changes in the salt concentration due to evaporated water between the water source and the collection site evaporation from the collection can be a big issue followed by instrument accuracy when instigating measurement errors hermsmeier 1973 used oil in the cans to suppress evaporation and reported 17 2 less evaporation than without oil kraus 1966 painted catch cans white and filled them 6 mm deep to decrease metal catch cans evaporation he founds 3 4 17 evaporation losses some research studies adjusted the final loss values for the can evaporation by placing a can filled with water outside the microclimate generated by the irrigation event sprinkler wdels is a complicated process in the sense that it involves a huge number of operational design and weather parameters that make it difficult to separate evaporation from wind drift losses that is why modeling efforts to estimate wdels mostly rely on statistical based empirical techniques to get a bigger picture rather than process based physical solutions however the different statistical techniques used by different authors result in a wide range of wdels values al oqaili et al 2020 sarwar et al 2020 2019 uddin 2012 physical based mathematical approaches pm are often based on the mass and heat transfer combined with droplet ballistic theory kinzer and gunn 1951 langmuir 1918 molle et al 2012 yan et al 2010 they can include analytical approaches based on the frictional effects of surrounding air on the droplet excluded mass heat transfer e g lorenzini 2004 the impulse momentum principle for calculating kinetic energy droplet wind drift and evaporation edling 1985 and a mass and heat transfer approach along with empirical drag coefficient kincaid and longley 1989 seginer 1965 all versions of physical based mathematical approaches reported small values of wdels on the lower extreme of the wdel range and are vastly at odds with measured results using catch cans and even ec or tracer based methods according to their definition of wdel pm approaches believe that soil and crop canopy evaporation are around 60 of the applied water and very little energy is available for the droplet to evaporate during its flight from the nozzle to ground thus droplet evaporation is almost negligible wind drift losses are solely dependent on wind speed and direction many believe that these should not be considered losses as the drifted water often stays within the premises of the land being irrigated kume et al 2006 thompson et al 1993a 1997 yonts et al 2007 considering the developments so far and the complicated nature of the problem we decided to evaluate the most used measuring techniques the standard catch can test an ec based method and a physical based mathematical approach for sprinkler wdel basic protocols were followed to ensure common operating design and weather conditions on a single sprinkler irrigation system the specific objective of this study was i to define wdel common terms to help in the final evaluation of the measuring techniques and the sprinkler system itself ii to evaluate three of the most widely used measuring techniques for wdel and iii to compare and contrast these different techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup this research study was conducted in the summer of 2018 at the irrigated agriculture research and extension center of washington state university wsu in prosser 46 15 4 n 119 44 18 w wa a linear move 8000 series sprinkler irrigation system by valley irrigation valley nebraska was used in this study the linear move system was mounted with s3000 yellow spinner sprinkler plates and number 22 nozzles 4 37 mm diameter with 138 kpa 20 psi pressure regulators by nelson irrigation corporation walla walla washington usa the sprinklers were 1 8 m from the ground and 3 0 m spacing between the sprinklers a weather station was located 15 m southwest upstream of prevailing wind direction of the experimental site this measured wind speed at 2 0 m high air temperature and relative humidity at 1 5 m high solar radiation and precipitation reference evapotranspiration and vapor pressure deficit were derived as described in walter et al 2005 weather data was collected at 5 second intervals and logged after every 15 min fig 1 2 2 wind drift and evaporation losses measuring techniques we selected three commonly used methods to measure the wdels the standard catch can test the electrical conductivity method and a physical based mathematical approach 2 2 1 standard catch can test the basis for this method is the difference in the depth of water that reached the ground compared to the gross amount of water discharged from the nozzle a standard catch can test under the iso standards 7749 1 was conducted anonymous 1995 we used catch cans with a 29 3 cm diameter for measuring net irrigation depth stratus rain gauges stratus technologies bermuda ltd were also used to measure the amount of irrigation these rain gauges had a 100 mm opening diameter and are better at avoiding in can evaporation catch cans and rain gauges were installed level to the ground surface to circumvent the poor catch efficiency caused by collection device walls under windy conditions catch cans were installed 1 5 m distance apart in a straight line under the lateral with two rows of rain gauges on each side of the catch can with a 9 m distance between the two rain gauges fig 1 wdels were calculated using eq 1 sarwar et al 2019 1 wdel igross inet igross 100 where i gross q avg s l and i net is the net irrigation depth in m i e a sum of the total volume of water collected in the collection devices in m3

travel speed of the linear in m s 1 and l is the distance between the sprinkler heads in m 2 2 2 electrical conductivity method electrical conductivity ec is a measurement of salt concentration the ec of the water collected at the ground compared to the ec of the source water can estimate droplet evaporation losses we used stratus precision rain gauges as explained in the above section to measure the ec of the water in the rain gauges the rain gauges were deliberately washed using distilled water and dried before every experiment to avoid measurement error these rain gauges were installed such that their opening was level to the ground surface one of the prime benefits of using these rain gauges was the funnel like structure for the water entering into the rain gauge with zero chances of evaporation from collected water the graduated measuring tube of the rain gauge can read up to 1 100th of an inch 0 254 mm accuracy leading to reliable measurements of the irrigation water without using any extra measuring cylinder that could instigate measurement error the source water was collected using 1 gallon plastic zip lock disposal bags and care was taken to immediately measure the ec of the source water without any delay ec was measured using a conductivity meter fisher scientific inc ma usa having a reported accuracy of 0 2 of full scale plus one digit with automatic temperature compensation from 0 to 60 c resolution of 0 1 and accuracy 0 8 c the conductivity meter was calibrated using potassium chloride 1413 μs cm 1 conductivity standard solution at 25 c oakton instruments il usa before and in the middle of data collection to ensure accurate measurements wdels were estimated using eq 2 mclean et al 2000 below 2 wdels ec cw ec sw ec cw 100 where ec cw and ec sw are the electrical conductivity of the collected water in the rain gauge and the source water respectively in μs cm 1 2 2 3 physical based mathematical approach we adopted the physical approach based on the mass and heat transfer phenomenon combined with droplet ballistic theory the droplet ballistic model was incorporated to include the effect of wind on the distance covered and eventually changes in the droplet flight time details of the procedures and mathematical relations are given in appendix a 2 2 3 1 droplet ballistic model langmuir 1918 first explained droplet trajectory dynamics in his

summer of 2018 apart from preliminary trials experiments were done during the day as well as at night to incorporate dynamic weather variations all of the experiments before sunrise were considered nighttimes while those done before the sunset were day times preliminary experiments measured sprinkler discharge linear move speed source water temperature and electrical conductivity the overall working of the linear move sprinklers was checked including the operating pressure and collection devices setup a catch can used to measure the irrigation depth was placed outside of the wet microclimate of the irrigation event to adjust for the evaporation losses during the measurements of the water collected by the catch cans the linear move was run at 30 travel speed setting and the system passed over the collection devices until the throw radius stopped affecting the collection area the volume of water was measured first in the catch cans followed by the net irrigation depth in the rain gauges and the electrical conductivity of the water collected in the rain gauges the prevailing weather conditions during the experiment and the time of the day day or night are given in fig 4 the data were analyzed using jmp version 13 2 1 by the sas institute inc cary nc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall measured wdel the overall results of the wdel are presented in table 1 the overall average wdel showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 among the three measuring techniques cc ec pm the maximum wdel 22 8 was measured by the standard catch can tests cc followed by the ec 17 5 and pm 6 8 techniques the results revealed that although the cc and ec measured wdel values were statistically different they were closer than the pm technique fig 5 presents two time duration experiments day time and nighttime including the overall average of the total 33 experiments three wdel measuring techniques were statistically evaluated within specific time duration e g daytime experiments and nighttime experiments the average day time wdel was also statistically different p 0 05 for the three techniques the average maximum value was measured by cc 26 6 then ec 19 3 and pm 8 2 methodologies the nighttime experiments showed interesting results for the cc 15 3 and ec 13 9 techniques where the mean differences between the wdel were not statistically significant p 0 05 between the two approaches this is likely because the cc method measures both evaporation and wind drift while the ec primarily measures evaporation and the evaporation losses at night are lower this indicates that the ec and pm techniques may have more shortcomings in the more dry and windy weather conditions pm nighttime average wdel estimated values were statistically different and far smaller than cc and ec approach there was an 11 2 decrease in the nighttime wdel for the cc technique and 5 5 and 4 2 in the ec and pm approaches respectively fig 5 3 2 wdel by standard catch can test the standard catch can test cc approach showed a wind drift and evaporation losses wdelcc range of 12 39 with a mean value of 23 where day time and nighttime losses were 27 and 15 respectively cc losses have higher correlations with ws r 0 71 and sr r 0 70 than vpd r 0 48 as shown in fig 6a b averages values were in close agreement with the measured losses in past studies at the same experimental site measured through catch cans drainage lysimeters and the strip method sadeghi et al 2017 sarwar et al 2019 wdelcc has a higher correlation with wind drift and evaporation losses by pm approach wdelpm r 0 68 than wind drift and evaporation losses by ec technique wdelec r 0 63 fig 7a b this shows the overall trend similarity among the different measurement techniques 3 3 wdel by electrical conductivity method the overall average wdels by electrical conductivity method ec were 18 with a range of 9 25 the daytime average wdel was 19 whereas the mean nighttime wdel was 14 ec method showed a higher correlation with vpd r 0 66 than sr r 0 44 and ws r 0 33 as presented in fig 8a b weaker correlations with ws indicate the inherent drawback of the technique where the smaller droplets not being accounted in the collected water electrical conductivity measurement results revealed that wdelec has a higher correlation with wdelpm r 0 70 than wdelcc r 0 63 fig 9a b 3 4 wdel by a physical based mathematical approach the droplet trajectory model for the physical based mathematical pm approach showed the smaller droplets being more affected by the weather variables distance traveled and the droplet diameter has an inverse relationship where smaller droplets are traveling farther than bigger ones fig 10a b droplet evaporation and drop diameter have a nearly linear inverse relationship with droplets diameter droplets near zero mm diameter are evaporated 100 fig 10c as described by thompson et al 1993a 1993b and yan et al 2010 the distance traveled by the droplets and drop diameter shows an inverse exponential relationship fig 10b where the smaller droplets are traveling much more distance than the bigger ones this is not true when the droplet size is much smaller i e diameter 0 01 mm in fact the water droplets are traveling a smaller distance and less than this diameter this indicates the limiting use of the pm approach in fully capturing the behavior of the gaseous phase of the wdel phenomenon this rough behavior of the numerical solution urged the need to comprehensively look into the problem for more stable and smooth solutions for smaller droplets the pm approach showed an average wdel of 7 whereas the range was 3 12 the mean daytime wdel was 8 and the mean nighttime wdel was 4 the pm approach showed a higher correlation with vpd r 0 75 than sr r 0 68 and ws r 0 55 fig 11a b based on the mass and heat transfer theory this makes sense where the water evaporation is solely based on the vapor pressure difference between the droplet surface and the ambient surroundings moreover the wind is related since it can throw the droplets a bit farther increasing the total flight time that has very little effect on the final droplet evaporation wdelpm has an almost similar correlation with wdelec r 0 70 and wdelcc r 0 68 fig 12a b 3 5 comparison of measuring techniques all three wdel measuring techniques give different results and the mean losses were statistically different p 0 05 the cc and ec techniques mean losses were closer to each other while the pm technique average losses were lower than cc and ec fig 5 the cc experiments had higher losses ranging from 11 5 to 38 5 followed by the ec 8 7 25 3 and pm 3 0 11 7 methodologies the analysis of variance revealed that 50 variability in the cc technique losses is explained by wind speed and around 23 by vapor pressure deficit wind speed is undoubtedly the biggest factor that controls wind drift losses whereas the evaporation portion of the losses is well explained by the correlation of losses with the vapor pressure deficit molle et al 2012 at the same time the ec and pm methodologies losses were predominantly controlled by vapor pressure deficit explaining 44 and 56 variability respectively wind speed effects were limited particularly in the ec 11 method as compared to the pm 30 technique figs 6 and 7 differences in the mean and extreme values of losses between cc and ec can be explained by dynamic variations of weather variables system operation or design configurations and more specifically how these techniques work to measure wdel in the cc technique the amount of irrigation water is measured with the help of the catching devices with openings leveled to the ground and is referred to as the actual amount of water rather than any indirect measurement wind affects the amount of irrigation water that reaches the ground by its drifting capacity and evaporation capacity based on how warm blowy and dry the air is catching efficiency is often criticized as being low under high wind conditions and thus measuring a high percentage of losses however it is unclear whether this is the fault of the catch cans not catching the water or whether there are simply higher losses during windy conditions this is noted by the fact that burying the catch cans such that their openings are level with the soil surface also yields similarly high losses hendawi et al 2005 conducted a study to evaluate the collection efficiency of different droplet diameters as influenced by wind speed and concluded that there is a decrease in the collection rate at a high wind speed of 9 m s only of droplets 1 3 mm diameter in the current study with a low pressure linear move irrigation system with coarse grooved spray plate and where the maximum wind speed was 4 35 m s table 1 a lower percentage of smaller droplets were generated and there were negligible chances of wind speed influencing catching efficiency of catch cans figs 6 and 7 here we need to define the wdel wdel is that fraction of water that is not delivered to the target area and should be considered as lost according to this definition the cc technique actually measures the amount of water that reaches the target area the ec technique is based on an indirect measurement method and therefore is more susceptible to measurement errors specific to smaller droplets that drift away and are not being accounted for in the collected water electrical conductivity measurement these droplets depend on the operational and design conditions of the system and are affected by wind speed too this inherent bias should cause lower values of wdel under extreme weather conditions in the ec technique the cc and ec losses for nighttime experiments revealed that the mean losses were not statistically different p 0 05 the higher mean losses for the cc technique are likely because of the lower catching efficiency of the catching devices or the high wind speed that blows away smaller droplets there was a correlation of 0 63 between wdelcc and wdelec when comparing the cc technique with the pm technique the difference between the mean losses and the overall range was quite high the mean wdel was significantly different there was a slightly higher correlation r 0 68 between the cc and pm losses than with the cc and ec losses r 0 63 the differences between wdel and the correlation between cc and pm indicate that the basic mass and heat transfer approach followed was in line with the phenomenon of droplet evaporation losses the pm approach is based on the physical conduction and convection of heat transfer where sensible heat is converted to latent heat in the form of droplet evaporation and is based on the difference in the vapor pressure between the droplet surface and the surrounding atmosphere the pm approach is more droplet evaporation oriented than a wind drift effect measurement the smaller droplets 0 5 mm diameter evaporated around 75 so these droplets must be drifted to far places before they completely evaporate another reason for the difference in pm and cc techniques could be the energy available for the mass and heat transfer which is small because of the droplet flight time compared to the energy available from the higher wind speeds the wind component parallel to the ground and in the horizontal direction of the jet influence the droplet flight time which eventually affects the final droplet evaporation but the magnitudes are almost negligible this is why the pm approach does not have a high correlation to the wind speed r 0 55 as compared to vapor pressure deficit r 0 75 we observed it as an inherently induced systematic error bias more than a process inaccuracy random error figs 9 and 12 a detailed analysis of the pm and ec techniques shows many similarities in the wdel measured by these methods the pm and ec approaches showed the highest correlation r 0 70 between the losses and vapor pressure deficits of 0 75 and 0 66 these techniques represent more of a droplet evaporation based measurement they are dependent on the instrument accuracy calibration and usage personal error as in the case of ec at the same time the incorporated empiricism in the pm approach limits the ability of the technique to measure the wdel accurately systematic error and precision error caused 2 of the combined uncertainty in the final wdel values measured using the ec approach figs 8 and 11 in summary the more surrogate indirect measurements of wdel the more uncertain we were about the final values some aspects such as the ability of the different methods to measure the separation of evaporation losses and wind drift losses seem intuitive the portion of evaporation losses is much smaller than wind drift losses hence a combined estimation worked well in the case of standard catch can studies cc 4 conclusions this study was conducted to answer the wide range of sprinkler water application losses called wind drift and evaporation losses wdel thirty three daytime and nighttime trials were conducted at the experimental research station near prosser in wa the overall evaluation of three wdel measuring techniques cc ec and pm disclosed several factors affecting wdel related to how any specific methodology works and how it was developed in the first place with all its advantages and disadvantages the three techniques give different mean wdel values which were statistically different p 0 05 the cc and ec mean wdel numbers were more similar the cc and ec approach nighttime mean wdel were not statistically different p 0 05 the ec and pm techniques were more correlated to each other and with vapor pressure deficit while the cc approach had a higher correlation to pm than with ec the cc approach was more correlated with wind speed rather than with vapor pressure deficit overall uncertainties inherently induced errors and complexities of the procedures due to surrogate measurements and empiricism cause unreliable ec and pm measured wdel in contrast the cc technique is a direct measurement backed by other wdel measuring approaches like the strip method sadeghi et al 2017 we suggested that underestimated values of the ec and pm techniques are because tiny droplets are not captured and evaporated under daylight times the more empiricism involved in the pm technique the models based on physical processes and

and evaporation losses wdel are some of the major sprinkler irrigation losses which exist even in a well managed irrigation system several research studies found a wide range of wdel under different and nearly similar configurations of sprinkler irrigation systems under similar weather conditions but using different methodologies to measure the wdel the specific objective of this research was to evaluate the three most commonly used measuring techniques standard catch can tests cc an electrical conductivity method ec and a physical based mathematical approach pm for wdel on a common sprinkler irrigation system under the same climatic conditions we conducted 33 experiments from may to september of 2018 near prosser washington twenty two of these experiments were during the daylight hours and 11 were during the night we used catch cans of 29 3 cm diameter and rain gauges diameter of 10 cm to collect water to measure the irrigation water s electrical conductivity mass and heat transfer approaches were used in the pm technique the results showed that the three techniques yielded statistically different mean wdel the highest wdels were in cc 22 8 followed by ec 17 5 and pm 6 8 techniques the cc wdels were better correlated with pm than the ec approach the mean nighttime wdel for the ec and cc methods were not statistically different p 0 05 the cc wdels were more closely related to wind speed than the vapor pressure deficit the ec and pm approaches have a higher correlation to the vapor pressure deficit the overall conclusion disclosed that the more we use indirect measurement methods the more the chances of erroneous numbers the ec and pm approaches are likely limited to measuring droplet evaporation as the latter includes several assumptions the cc approach is a direct measurement of the wdel keywords wind drift evaporation losses electrical conductivity sprinkler irrigation droplet ballistic theory 1 introduction mechanized sprinkler irrigation systems linear move and center pivot are commonly used worldwide and their use is growing steadily however they are often criticized for their poor resource usage molle et al 2012 the greatest sprinkler irrigation water losses include runoff deep percolation and wind drift and evaporation losses wdel deep percolation and runoff losses can be minimized if the system is controlled and well managed but wdels are mostly a function of the weather and cannot be minimized without modifying the irrigation system mohamed et al 2019 nrc 2007 peters et al 2016 for example sprinkler irrigation evaporation and drift losses range from 2 to 5 for low elevation spray application lesa 15 20 for mid elevation spray application mesa and are around 40 for high pressure impact sprinklers on top of the center pivot pipe sarwar et al 2019 estimating wind drift and evaporation losses from sprinklers is extremely important these are a major source of water losses for sprinkler irrigation systems irrigation system design too high is expensive too low results in crop water stress water rights allocations hugely contentious and large amounts of money involved and the overall irrigation water requirements for irrigation water management depend on the irrigation efficiency and therefore the wdel several researchers documented different techniques to measure wdel with different operating and sprinkler system types in a wide variety of climates mohamed et al 2021 molaei et al 2021 playán et al 2004 2005 uddin 2012 yazar 1984 because sprinkler losses were not defined in common terms and because of uncertainty and measurement errors of the experimental techniques a wide range of sprinkler losses 0 50 have been reported from the last 80 years of research hendawi et al 2005 molle et al 2012 measuring techniques like the standard catch can test electrical conductivity ec method conservative tracer method and physical based mathematical techniques have been used to quantify evaporation and wind drift losses king et al 2012 mclean et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 yan et al 2010 the conservative tracer method is not used frequently because of its complicated and deliberate protocols that are susceptible to measurement errors kohl et al 1987 and king et al 2012 used this method and reported 0 4 1 4 and 0 9 5 2 wdel respectively the standard catch can tests most widely used in wdel and irrigation application efficiency studies reported a higher percentage of wdel than ec conservative tracer and physical based mathematical modeling methods the standard catch can test is frequently criticized for the test protocols and evaporation from within the can during and post irrigation catch can tests measured high wdel especially under extremely windy conditions and for design and operational conditions producing a high percentage of smaller droplets hendawi et al 2005 carran 1976 standard catch can tests measure the combined losses due to wind drift and evaporation this results in a global estimate few efforts were reported to measure wind drift losses separately from evaporation to understand the phenomenon better when using the ec method yazar 1984 the electrical conductivity method for estimating sprinkler wdel was first used by george 1957 this estimates evaporation loss using the changes in the salt concentration due to evaporated water between the water source and the collection site evaporation from the collection can be a big issue followed by instrument accuracy when instigating measurement errors hermsmeier 1973 used oil in the cans to suppress evaporation and reported 17 2 less evaporation than without oil kraus 1966 painted catch cans white and filled them 6 mm deep to decrease metal catch cans evaporation he founds 3 4 17 evaporation losses some research studies adjusted the final loss values for the can evaporation by placing a can filled with water outside the microclimate generated by the irrigation event sprinkler wdels is a complicated process in the sense that it involves a huge number of operational design and weather parameters that make it difficult to separate evaporation from wind drift losses that is why modeling efforts to estimate wdels mostly rely on statistical based empirical techniques to get a bigger picture rather than process based physical solutions however the different statistical techniques used by different authors result in a wide range of wdels values al oqaili et al 2020 sarwar et al 2020 2019 uddin 2012 physical based mathematical approaches pm are often based on the mass and heat transfer combined with droplet ballistic theory kinzer and gunn 1951 langmuir 1918 molle et al 2012 yan et al 2010 they can include analytical approaches based on the frictional effects of surrounding air on the droplet excluded mass heat transfer e g lorenzini 2004 the impulse momentum principle for calculating kinetic energy droplet wind drift and evaporation edling 1985 and a mass and heat transfer approach along with empirical drag coefficient kincaid and longley 1989 seginer 1965 all versions of physical based mathematical approaches reported small values of wdels on the lower extreme of the wdel range and are vastly at odds with measured results using catch cans and even ec or tracer based methods according to their definition of wdel pm approaches believe that soil and crop canopy evaporation are around 60 of the applied water and very little energy is available for the droplet to evaporate during its flight from the nozzle to ground thus droplet evaporation is almost negligible wind drift losses are solely dependent on wind speed and direction many believe that these should not be considered losses as the drifted water often stays within the premises of the land being irrigated kume et al 2006 thompson et al 1993a 1997 yonts et al 2007 considering the developments so far and the complicated nature of the problem we decided to evaluate the most used measuring techniques the standard catch can test an ec based method and a physical based mathematical approach for sprinkler wdel basic protocols were followed to ensure common operating design and weather conditions on a single sprinkler irrigation system the specific objective of this study was i to define wdel common terms to help in the final evaluation of the measuring techniques and the sprinkler system itself ii to evaluate three of the most widely used measuring techniques for wdel and iii to compare and contrast these different techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup this research study was conducted in the summer of 2018 at the irrigated agriculture research and extension center of washington state university wsu in prosser 46 15 4 n 119 44 18 w wa a linear move 8000 series sprinkler irrigation system by valley irrigation valley nebraska was used in this study the linear move system was mounted with s3000 yellow spinner sprinkler plates and number 22 nozzles 4 37 mm diameter with 138 kpa 20 psi pressure regulators by nelson irrigation corporation walla walla washington usa the sprinklers were 1 8 m from the ground and 3 0 m spacing between the sprinklers a weather station was located 15 m southwest upstream of prevailing wind direction of the experimental site this measured wind speed at 2 0 m high air temperature and relative humidity at 1 5 m high solar radiation and precipitation reference evapotranspiration and vapor pressure deficit were derived as described in walter et al 2005 weather data was collected at 5 second intervals and logged after every 15 min fig 1 2 2 wind drift and evaporation losses measuring techniques we selected three commonly used methods to measure the wdels the standard catch can test the electrical conductivity method and a physical based mathematical approach 2 2 1 standard catch can test the basis for this method is the difference in the depth of water that reached the ground compared to the gross amount of water discharged from the nozzle a standard catch can test under the iso standards 7749 1 was conducted anonymous 1995 we used catch cans with a 29 3 cm diameter for measuring net irrigation depth stratus rain gauges stratus technologies bermuda ltd were also used to measure the amount of irrigation these rain gauges had a 100 mm opening diameter and are better at avoiding in can evaporation catch cans and rain gauges were installed level to the ground surface to circumvent the poor catch efficiency caused by collection device walls under windy conditions catch cans were installed 1 5 m distance apart in a straight line under the lateral with two rows of rain gauges on each side of the catch can with a 9 m distance between the two rain gauges fig 1 wdels were calculated using eq 1 sarwar et al 2019 1 wdel igross inet igross 100 where i gross q avg s l and i net is the net irrigation depth in m i e a sum of the total volume of water collected in the collection devices in m3

travel speed of the linear in m s 1 and l is the distance between the sprinkler heads in m 2 2 2 electrical conductivity method electrical conductivity ec is a measurement of salt concentration the ec of the water collected at the ground compared to the ec of the source water can estimate droplet evaporation losses we used stratus precision rain gauges as explained in the above section to measure the ec of the water in the rain gauges the rain gauges were deliberately washed using distilled water and dried before every experiment to avoid measurement error these rain gauges were installed such that their opening was level to the ground surface one of the prime benefits of using these rain gauges was the funnel like structure for the water entering into the rain gauge with zero chances of evaporation from collected water the graduated measuring tube of the rain gauge can read up to 1 100th of an inch 0 254 mm accuracy leading to reliable measurements of the irrigation water without using any extra measuring cylinder that could instigate measurement error the source water was collected using 1 gallon plastic zip lock disposal bags and care was taken to immediately measure the ec of the source water without any delay ec was measured using a conductivity meter fisher scientific inc ma usa having a reported accuracy of 0 2 of full scale plus one digit with automatic temperature compensation from 0 to 60 c resolution of 0 1 and accuracy 0 8 c the conductivity meter was calibrated using potassium chloride 1413 μs cm 1 conductivity standard solution at 25 c oakton instruments il usa before and in the middle of data collection to ensure accurate measurements wdels were estimated using eq 2 mclean et al 2000 below 2 wdels ec cw ec sw ec cw 100 where ec cw and ec sw are the electrical conductivity of the collected water in the rain gauge and the source water respectively in μs cm 1 2 2 3 physical based mathematical approach we adopted the physical approach based on the mass and heat transfer phenomenon combined with droplet ballistic theory the droplet ballistic model was incorporated to include the effect of wind on the distance covered and eventually changes in the droplet flight time details of the procedures and mathematical relations are given in appendix a 2 2 3 1 droplet ballistic model langmuir 1918 first explained droplet trajectory dynamics in his mass heat transfer model for droplet evaporation the jet dispersion resulted in many droplets generated from the nozzle and spray plate combination and mathematical equations can present the path they

kohl and deboer 1984 solomon et al 1985 we used the experimentally backed method of mugele and evans 1951 using an upper limit log normal distribution ulln as explained in solomon et al 1985 and

summer of 2018 apart from preliminary trials experiments were done during the day as well as at night to incorporate dynamic weather variations all of the experiments before sunrise were considered nighttimes while those done before the sunset were day times preliminary experiments measured sprinkler discharge linear move speed source water temperature and electrical conductivity the overall working of the linear move sprinklers was checked including the operating pressure and collection devices setup a catch can used to measure the irrigation depth was placed outside of the wet microclimate of the irrigation event to adjust for the evaporation losses during the measurements of the water collected by the catch cans the linear move was run at 30 travel speed setting and the system passed over the collection devices until the throw radius stopped affecting the collection area the volume of water was measured first in the catch cans followed by the net irrigation depth in the rain gauges and the electrical conductivity of the water collected in the rain gauges the prevailing weather conditions during the experiment and the time of the day day or night are given in fig 4 the data were analyzed using jmp version 13 2 1 by the sas institute inc cary nc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall measured wdel the overall results of the wdel are presented in table 1 the overall average wdel showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 among the three measuring techniques cc ec pm the maximum wdel 22 8 was measured by the standard catch can tests cc followed by the ec 17 5 and pm 6 8 techniques the results revealed that although the cc and ec measured wdel values were statistically different they were closer than the pm technique fig 5 presents two time duration experiments day time and nighttime including the overall average of the total 33 experiments three wdel measuring techniques were statistically evaluated within specific time duration e g daytime experiments and nighttime experiments the average day time wdel was also statistically different p 0 05 for the three techniques the average maximum value was measured by cc 26 6 then ec 19 3 and pm 8 2 methodologies the nighttime experiments showed interesting results for the cc 15 3 and ec 13 9 techniques where the mean differences between the wdel were not statistically significant p 0 05 between the two approaches this is likely because the cc method measures both evaporation and wind drift while the ec primarily measures evaporation and the evaporation losses at night are lower this indicates that the ec and pm techniques may have more shortcomings in the more dry and windy weather conditions pm nighttime average wdel estimated values were statistically different and far smaller than cc and ec approach there was an 11 2 decrease in the nighttime wdel for the cc technique and 5 5 and 4 2 in the ec and pm approaches respectively fig 5 3 2 wdel by standard catch can test the standard catch can test cc approach showed a wind drift and evaporation losses wdelcc range of 12 39 with a mean value of 23 where day time and nighttime losses were 27 and 15 respectively cc losses have higher correlations with ws r 0 71 and sr r 0 70 than vpd r 0 48 as shown in fig 6a b averages values were in close agreement with the measured losses in past studies at the same experimental site measured through catch cans drainage lysimeters and the strip method sadeghi et al 2017 sarwar et al 2019 wdelcc has a higher correlation with wind drift and evaporation losses by pm approach wdelpm r 0 68 than wind drift and evaporation losses by ec technique wdelec r 0 63 fig 7a b this shows the overall trend similarity among the different measurement techniques 3 3 wdel by electrical conductivity method the overall average wdels by electrical conductivity method ec were 18 with a range of 9 25 the daytime average wdel was 19 whereas the mean nighttime wdel was 14 ec method showed a higher correlation with vpd r 0 66 than sr r 0 44 and ws r 0 33 as presented in fig 8a b weaker correlations with ws indicate the inherent drawback of the technique where the smaller droplets not being accounted in the collected water electrical conductivity measurement results revealed that wdelec has a higher correlation with wdelpm r 0 70 than wdelcc r 0 63 fig 9a b 3 4 wdel by a physical based mathematical approach the droplet trajectory model for the physical based mathematical pm approach showed the smaller droplets being more affected by the weather variables distance traveled and the droplet diameter has an inverse relationship where smaller droplets are traveling farther than bigger ones fig 10a b droplet evaporation and drop diameter have a nearly linear inverse relationship with droplets diameter droplets near zero mm diameter are evaporated 100 fig 10c as described by thompson et al 1993a 1993b and yan et al 2010 the distance traveled by the droplets and drop diameter shows an inverse exponential relationship fig 10b where the smaller droplets are traveling much more distance than the bigger ones this is not true when the droplet size is much smaller i e diameter 0 01 mm in fact the water droplets are traveling a smaller distance and less than this diameter this indicates the limiting use of the pm approach in fully capturing the behavior of the gaseous phase of the wdel phenomenon this rough behavior of the numerical solution urged the need to comprehensively look into the problem for more stable and smooth solutions for smaller droplets the pm approach showed an average wdel of 7 whereas the range was 3 12 the mean daytime wdel was 8 and the mean nighttime wdel was 4 the pm approach showed a higher correlation with vpd r 0 75 than sr r 0 68 and ws r 0 55 fig 11a b based on the mass and heat transfer theory this makes sense where the water evaporation is solely based on the vapor pressure difference between the droplet surface and the ambient surroundings moreover the wind is related since it can throw the droplets a bit farther increasing the total flight time that has very little effect on the final droplet evaporation wdelpm has an almost similar correlation with wdelec r 0 70 and wdelcc r 0 68 fig 12a b 3 5 comparison of measuring techniques all three wdel measuring techniques give different results and the mean losses were statistically different p 0 05 the cc and ec techniques mean losses were closer to each other while the pm technique average losses were lower than cc and ec fig 5 the cc experiments had higher losses ranging from 11 5 to 38 5 followed by the ec 8 7 25 3 and pm 3 0 11 7 methodologies the analysis of variance revealed that 50 variability in the cc technique losses is explained by wind speed and around 23 by vapor pressure deficit wind speed is undoubtedly the biggest factor that controls wind drift losses whereas the evaporation portion of the losses is well explained by the correlation of losses with the vapor pressure deficit molle et al 2012 at the same time the ec and pm methodologies losses were predominantly controlled by vapor pressure deficit explaining 44 and 56 variability respectively wind speed effects were limited particularly in the ec 11 method as compared to the pm 30 technique figs 6 and 7 differences in the mean and extreme values of losses between cc and ec can be explained by dynamic variations of weather variables system operation or design configurations and more specifically how these techniques work to measure wdel in the cc technique the amount of irrigation water is measured with the help of the catching devices with openings leveled to the ground and is referred to as the actual amount of water rather than any indirect measurement wind affects the amount of irrigation water that reaches the ground by its drifting capacity and evaporation capacity based on how warm blowy and dry the air is catching efficiency is often criticized as being low under high wind conditions and thus measuring a high percentage of losses however it is unclear whether this is the fault of the catch cans not catching the water or whether there are simply higher losses during windy conditions this is noted by the fact that burying the catch cans such that their openings are level with the soil surface also yields similarly high losses hendawi et al 2005 conducted a study to evaluate the collection efficiency of different droplet diameters as influenced by wind speed and concluded that there is a decrease in the collection rate at a high wind speed of 9 m s only of droplets 1 3 mm diameter in the current study with a low pressure linear move irrigation system with coarse grooved spray plate and where the maximum wind speed was 4 35 m s table 1 a lower percentage of smaller droplets were generated and there were negligible chances of wind speed influencing catching efficiency of catch cans figs 6 and 7 here we need to define the wdel wdel is that fraction of water that is not delivered to the target area and should be considered as lost according to this definition the cc technique actually measures the amount of water that reaches the target area the ec technique is based on an indirect measurement method and therefore is more susceptible to measurement errors specific to smaller droplets that drift away and are not being accounted for in the collected water electrical conductivity measurement these droplets depend on the operational and design conditions of the system and are affected by wind speed too this inherent bias should cause lower values of wdel under extreme weather conditions in the ec technique the cc and ec losses for nighttime experiments revealed that the mean losses were not statistically different p 0 05 the higher mean losses for the cc technique are likely because of the lower catching efficiency of the catching devices or the high wind speed that blows away smaller droplets there was a correlation of 0 63 between wdelcc and wdelec when comparing the cc technique with the pm technique the difference between the mean losses and the overall range was quite high the mean wdel was significantly different there was a slightly higher correlation r 0 68 between the cc and pm losses than with the cc and ec losses r 0 63 the differences between wdel and the correlation between cc and pm indicate that the basic mass and heat transfer approach followed was in line with the phenomenon of droplet evaporation losses the pm approach is based on the physical conduction and convection of heat transfer where sensible heat is converted to latent heat in the form of droplet evaporation and is based on the difference in the vapor pressure between the droplet surface and the surrounding atmosphere the pm approach is more droplet evaporation oriented than a wind drift effect measurement the smaller droplets 0 5 mm diameter evaporated around 75 so these droplets must be drifted to far places before they completely evaporate another reason for the difference in pm and cc techniques could be the energy available for the mass and heat transfer which is small because of the droplet flight time compared to the energy available from the higher wind speeds the wind component parallel to the ground and in the horizontal direction of the jet influence the droplet flight time which eventually affects the final droplet evaporation but the magnitudes are almost negligible this is why the pm approach does not have a high correlation to the wind speed r 0 55 as compared to vapor pressure deficit r 0 75 we observed it as an inherently induced systematic error bias more than a process inaccuracy random error figs 9 and 12 a detailed analysis of the pm and ec techniques shows many similarities in the wdel measured by these methods the pm and ec approaches showed the highest correlation r 0 70 between the losses and vapor pressure deficits of 0 75 and 0 66 these techniques represent more of a droplet evaporation based measurement they are dependent on the instrument accuracy calibration and usage personal error as in the case of ec at the same time the incorporated empiricism in the pm approach limits the ability of the technique to measure the wdel accurately systematic error and precision error caused 2 of the combined uncertainty in the final wdel values measured using the ec approach figs 8 and 11 in summary the more surrogate indirect measurements of wdel the more uncertain we were about the final values some aspects such as the ability of the different methods to measure the separation of evaporation losses and wind drift losses seem intuitive the portion of evaporation losses is much smaller than wind drift losses hence a combined estimation worked well in the case of standard catch can studies cc 4 conclusions this study was conducted to answer the wide range of sprinkler water application losses called wind drift and evaporation losses wdel thirty three daytime and nighttime trials were conducted at the experimental research station near prosser in wa the overall evaluation of three wdel measuring techniques cc ec and pm disclosed several factors affecting wdel related to how any specific methodology works and how it was developed in the first place with all its advantages and disadvantages the three techniques give different mean wdel values which were statistically different p 0 05 the cc and ec mean wdel numbers were more similar the cc and ec approach nighttime mean wdel were not statistically different p 0 05 the ec and pm techniques were more correlated to each other and with vapor pressure deficit while the cc approach had a higher correlation to pm than with ec the cc approach was more correlated with wind speed rather than with vapor pressure deficit overall uncertainties inherently induced errors and complexities of the procedures due to surrogate measurements and empiricism cause unreliable ec and pm measured wdel in contrast the cc technique is a direct measurement backed by other wdel measuring approaches like the strip method sadeghi et al 2017 we suggested that underestimated values of the ec and pm techniques are because tiny droplets are not captured and evaporated under daylight times the more empiricism involved in the pm technique the models based on physical processes and

9877,both field observation and numerical model have demonstrated that trees can extend their roots to deep soil 1 m in depth however little work has been done to assess how deep roots impact trees transpiration this study hypothesized that when available water in deep soil is exhausted roots in drying soil will inhibit forest transpiration to test this hypothesis two irrigation schemes shallow soil irrigation si and shallow soil plus deep soil irrigation sdi were performed in september 2017 in a 23 year old apple orchard after irrigation 100 mm for si and 500 mm for sdi soil water within the top 3 m for si and top 8 m for sdi were replenished to about field capacity measurements were conducted before irrigation in july 2017 and after irrigation from april to july in 2018 the results showed that the two treatments had similar soil water status and sap flow density before irrigation p 0 05 soil water storage from 1 to 18 m depth decreased more than 1200 mm after afforestation however after irrigation sap flow density in the si treatment was significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment p 0 05 sap flow density in the si treatment only accounted for 60 6 of that in the sdi treatment during the period with high water demand stomatal conductance in the si plot was significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment while there was no difference in leaf area index between the two plots these results demonstrated that growing deep roots has opposing roles it promotes transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil but inhibits transpiration via decreasing stomatal conductance when available water in deep soil is exhausted these findings improve the understanding of how deep roots impact apple tree water use in water limited environments keywords deep soil deep roots soil water content sap flow density transpiration 1 introduction drought is projected to become more serious with global warming mccallum et al 2010 peng et al 2013 touhami et al 2015 consequently presenting more severe water stress on terrestrial ecosystems especially for the forest ecosystems characterized by high evapotranspiration allen et al 2010 carnicer et al 2011 therefore tree response to drought stress determines current productivity and the sustainability of the forest ecosystems in the future in this context many researchers have investigated how drought stress alters evapotranspiration zhang et al 2001 zhao et al 2014 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi revadekar et al 2012 soil water biswas 2014 li et al 2019a gamage et al 2018 gao et al 2018 hu and si 2014 and root development fan et al 2017 germon et al 2019 nepstad et al 1994 xi et al 2018 in past decades root water uptake in deep soil occurring in both tropical forests and precipitation limited environments germon et al 2020 schenk and jackson 2005 effectively alleviates trees water stress christina et al 2016 markewitz et al 2010 oliveira et al 2005 for trees the average value of the global maximum rooting depth is 7 0 1 2 m canadell et al 1996 during the dry season as much as 82 of the water used in the amazonian forests were from soil below 1 m oliveira et al 2005 for this reason the deep rooted plants relative to the shallower rooted species maintained a higher leaf area index nepstad et al 1994 and transpiration rate ivanov et al 2012 rocha et al 2004 during the long dry season in the amazonian tropical forests on the other hand soil water below 1 m depth contributes 118 mm of water every year to apple trees in the subhumid region of the loess plateau of china li et al 2019a further most of the water extracted from deep soil is transpired but approximately 43 6 8 of shallow soil water is for nonproductive evaporation wei et al 2017 therefore the deep soil water reserve within the root zone helps overcome drought stress and could be more efficient than shallow soil water to date two types of deep soil water extraction have been revealed the repeatable pattern and the one way pattern the repeatable pattern refers to the deep soil water being depleted in the dry season by deep rooted plants is fully replenished by subsequent wet season rainfall this has been demonstrated by both direct field observation rempe and dietrich 2018 fig 1a and numerical model ivanov et al 2012 markewitz et al 2010 in tropical forest in contrast the one way pattern mainly seen in drier environments is that the deep soil water being depleted can hardly be replenished by subsequent rainfall resulting in continuous decrease of soil water content in deep strata thus the water extraction in deep soil is one way mining li et al 2019b fig 1b collectively the repeatable deep soil water extraction results in seasonal desiccation in deep soil while the one way pattern leads to permanent root zone desiccation in deep strata deep soil desiccation is found in many deep rooted ecosystems li et al 2019b gao et al 2014 oliveira et al 2005 rempe and dietrich 2018 however the consequence of deep soil desiccation on tree water use remains poorly understood previous partial irrigation with part of the root system is exposed to drying soil while the remaining part is irrigated have demonstrated that the root system in dry soil tends to inhibit plant transpiration kang and zhang 2004 when roots in dry soil are excised plant transpiration increases rapidly gowing et al 1990 synthesizing the reported one way deep soil water extraction and the transpiration barrier induced by the roots living in dry soil we hypothesize that in water limited environments the effect of deep roots on tree water use is two fold first deep roots promote plant transpiration when the deep soil water content is high this occurs in the first few years after afforestation during which deep root zone soil water content swc is high and can be extracted without additional stress but when soil water in the deep root zone is depleted to a low level and becomes close to or reaches the low limit for root water uptake the deep roots in dry soil prone to prevent plant transpiration to test this hypothesis widely afforested deep rooting apple is irrigated to produce two different water profiles one plot with only shallow soil is wetted and the other plot with both shallow and deep soil are wetted the results of this study are projected to advance our understanding of deep soil water extraction and provide valuable suggestions for land management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was performed on the loess plateau which located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin with an area of 640 000 km2 the loess plateau has the world s largest loess deposits and a climate ranging from arid in the northwest to semi humid in the southwest the water table is great than 30 m in most case because of the great thickness of the loess the dryness index defined as annual potential evapotranspiration divided by annual precipitation is 2 1 0 1 in this region most agriculture is rain fed due to the subhumid climate and deep water table apple trees were widely revegetated on the loess plateau since 1980 s and now this region has become the world s largest apple cultivation area 1 83 million ha in 2019 compared with traditional farmlands apple orchards have higher water consumption and therefore have higher requirements for agricultural water management the experimental site is located in a 23 year old apple orchard afforested on long term cultivated farmland since 1994 in the flat highland within the wangdonggou watershed in changwu county 35 14 n 107 41 e of shanxi province china fig 2 with a slope less than 0 05 the highland has an elevation of 1200 m above sea level and is characterized by a subhumid climate the average annual precipitation is 577 mm from 1960 to 2020 approximately 55 of which falls between july and september the average annual temperature is about 9 1 with an average frost free period of 171 days and an average annual solar radiation of approximately 5266 mj m 2 the average annual pan evapotranspiration is 1358 mm which is more than twice of the annual precipitation the soil in this area is aeolian loess with a slit loam texture according to the united states department of agriculture classification method the field capacity is 0 29 cm3 cm 3 huang et al 2001 liu etal 2010 and the average soil bulk density is 1 39 g cm 3 from 0 to 20 m depth li et al 2019a the depth of the water table is larger than 80 m all vegetation is rain fed 2 2 experimental design two plots were established in the selected orchard with four trees in each plot in july 2017 tree size soil water content and sap flow were measured to test if the two plots had similar initial conditions meanwhile as soil variability in the study site is quite small li et al 2019a the soil water content in a spring maize field about 100 m away from the selected orchard was measured to establish a benchmark for the soil water condition before afforestation the spring maize field was selected because this crop has similar growing season with apple trees soil water content is affected by many biotic and abiotic factors like plant type growth condition and climate however for shallow rooted farmlands these external factors mainly affect soil water conditions in shallow soil soil water content in deep soil is affected more by soil hydraulic properties and land cover in our study region soil water variation in farmlands mainly appeared in the upper 3 m cheng et al 2014 lin et al 2016 and the soil water content in deep soil barely changes over time as our study mainly focus on how roots growing in deep soil will impact apple tree s transpiration soil water contents farmlands can be used to benchmark soil water conditions before afforestation soil water storage loss mm was calculated according to the following equation 1 soil water storage loss i 1 n θ f i θ a i d i 10 3 where θ fi and θ ai are swc m3 m 3 in farmland and apple orchard in depth increment i respectively d i is the thickness m of the depth increment i the selected apple orchard had a dry deep root zone the dry deep root zone means that the soil water content in deep soil approached to the lower limit for root water uptake of apple trees two irrigation schemes surface soil irrigation si and surface plus deep soil irrigation sdi were implemented in the respective two plots in september 2017 table 1 the aim of si and sdi were to replenish soil water content within 0 3 m and 0 8 m to the field capacity and thus establishing a dry deep root zone in si and a wet deep root zone in sdi respectively before the 2018 growing season in the sdi plot 41 holes 1 m 1 m with a depth of 8 m were drilled using a soil auger 4 cm in diameter and the 3 8 m soil layer was irrigated through these holes bore hole irrigation fig 2 during irrigation the top of the water column in each hole was controlled at approximately 3 m below the soil surface and the total irrigation amount within 3 8 m soil depth was 500 mm subsequently all auger holes were refilled and then surface irrigation was subsequently conducted furrow irrigation in the si and sdi plots simultaneously with an irrigation amount of approximately 100 mm since irrigation was terminated in october 2017 there were six months from october 2017 to april 2018 for the irrigated water to redistribute in the irrigated zone before the 2018 growing season 2 3 data acquisition based on the irrigation time table 1 the data acquisition was divided into two periods before irrigation and after irrigation the measurements before irrigation were conducted between jun 20 to sept 12 in 2017 the measurements after irrigation were conducted within apr 5 to jul 25 in 2018 before irrigation soil water content was measured in jul 20 2017 and sap flow density was measured between jun 20 to sept 12 in 2017 with an interval of 10 min after irrigation soil water content and stomatal conductance were measured approximately once a month sap flow density was measured with an interval of 10 min and leaf area index lai were measured about twice a month in the two plots 2 3 1 soil water content a neutron access tube was installed in the center of each plot representing the average soil water content in the plot the neutron access tubes were 18 m and 20 m long for si and sdi respectively volumetric soil water content was measured with a neutron probe cnc503b beijing china at a depth interval of 0 20 m the initial soil water contents within the 0 18 m depth were measured from the samples taken when installing the neutron access tubes and then used to calibrate the neutron probe r2 0 87 moreover to examine deep soil water extraction following 23 year old trees soil water content was measured in a 30 year old apple orchard to a depth of 18 m to benchmark the soil water conditions before afforestation of apple trees soil water contents in the selected spring maize field were measured in jul 20 2017 using a neutron probe that installed one year ago 2 3 2 sap flow density the sap flow density was measured using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 in the selected four apple trees in each treatment two probes were installed on the south side of the tree along its trunk at approximately 60 cm above the land surface the distance between the two probes was 4 cm each probe contained two stainless steel needles with a 2 mm external diameter and 2 cm length the upper needle contained a loop of nichrome 80 alloy resistance wire diameter 0 13 mm resistance 87 ω ft 1 pelican wire co usa and acted as the heat source t type thermocouples tt t 36 sle omega engineering stamford ct were inserted at the middle of each needle to measure the temperature difference between the two needles the two needles were filled with omega epoxy ob 101 16 omega engineering stamford ct with high thermal conductivity the epoxy is a good electrical insulator and was used with the thermocouples and resistance wire in the needle to prevent short circuits to minimize the effect of external temperature fluctuation tin foil was wrapped around the tree trunk where the probes were installed wilson et al 2001 wullschleger et al 2001 the cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan ut was used to record the temperature difference from the thermocouples in the two needles within each probe at 1 min sampling intervals from 5 april to 20 july 2018 the means of 10 scans were used to calculate the sap flow density j s cm hr 1 based on the following equation granier 1987 2 j s 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 3600 where t is the dynamic temperature difference between the two probes and t m is the maximum temperature difference in this study t m was calculated as the temperature difference between 02 00 and 05 00 because in this period j s was close or equal to zero dawson et al 2007 the sap flux density was up scaled to daily transpiration t mm day 1 according to the following empirical equation r 2 0 93 n 23 that was established at our study site 3 t 0 2598 j s 0 045 where t is measured with an extended heat pulse probe 8 cm in length that measured sap flux density at 1 cm 3 cm 5 cm and 7 cm along the radial direction of the trunk we converted the 10 min average j s measured at different depth to tree stem flow rate f cm3 h 1 using the following equation 4 f i 1 n π r i 2 r i 1 2 j si here the thermocouples were located at the center of the sapwood area bounded by inner radius r i 1 and outer radius r i we assumed that the zone of influence for each thermocouple junction was 2 cm wide and did not overlap with the adjacent zones ford et al 2004 subsequently f was converted to daily transpiration based on the crown area 2 3 3 stomatal conductance and leaf area index stomatal conductance was measured using ap4 porometer delta t devices cambridge uk at eight selected positions on the east side of each tree n 32 stomatal conductance was measured approximately once a month at the selected positions for a similar height leaf area index was measured via the lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor inc usa at six positions for each tree including four points along the canopy perimeter and two points within the perimeter of each of the four trees 2 3 4 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the meteorology data was collected from a nearby weather station approximately 500 m from the study site and the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated based on the penman monteith equation and crop coefficients with kc ini 0 6 and kc mid 0 95 allan et al 1998 fig 3 from 5 april to 15 june pet was 1 62 times the precipitation thus this period was marked as a dry season conversely from 15 june to 20 july pet only accounted for 57 of the precipitation and therefore this period was marked as a wet season pet was divided into potential evaporation and potential transpiration based on measured lai and beer s law ritchie 1972 5 e p t et p t exp k lai t 6 t p t et p t e p t where k is light extinction coefficient that describes the efficiency of light interception for the canopy of a terrestrial ecosystem according to previous meta analysis zhang et al 2014 k was set to be 0 59 for apple trees 2 4 statistics analysis the differences among treatments were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova the statistical tests were performed with spss 18 0 spss usa at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 similar soil water profile and sap flow density before irrigation before irrigation soil water contents in the si and sdi plots treatments were significantly smaller than that in farmland p 0 05 fig 4a and the difference appeared at the depth below 1 4 m and extended to the depth of 18 m the average soil water content within 0 18 m depth was 0 273 0 024 cm3 cm 3 0 203 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and 0 202 0 028 cm3 cm 3 for farmland si and sdi respectively moreover relative to the farmland si and sdi plots had a water storage loss of 1259 mm and 1278 mm respectively the soil water profiles for the si and sdi plots were almost identical before irrigation p 0 05 indicating the same initial water conditions in the two treatments in addition soil water profiles for si and sdi were almost the same p 0 05 as that in the 30 year old orchard fig 4a indicating that the available water in deep soil had been exhausted in the previous 22 years after afforestation and remained unchanged after that similarly si and sdi plots had no significant difference in the daily sap flow densities before irrigation n 21 p 0 05 fig 4b 3 2 soil water profile changes following irrigation treatments at the begin of the 2018 growing season 23 april the upper 3 m in the si plot and the upper 8 m in the sdi plot had higher soil water content than that before irrigation fig 5 table 2 moreover the sdi treatment had similar soil water content in the upper 3 m with the si plot p 0 05 but had significantly greater soil water content within 3 8 m strata than si treatment p 0 05 during the subsequent dry season april 23 to june 21 2018 both si and sdi plots showed reduced soil water content in the root zone fig 5 the reduction mainly occurred in the upper 3 m depth for the si treatment where the average soil water content decreased from 0 264 0 013 cm3 cm 3 to 0 250 0 018 cm3 cm 3 below 3 m depth the soil water contents remained unchanged fig 5 and table 2 for the sdi treatment however the soil water content decreased evidently in both 0 3 m and 3 8 m depths the average soil water content in the upper 3 m decreased from 0 267 0 015 cm3 cm 3 to 0 257 0 012 cm3 cm 3 the soil water content in the 3 8 m layer decreased from 0 255 0 023 cm3 cm 3 to 0 244 0 026 cm3 cm 3 fig 5 after the major precipitation events from june 21 to july 15 fig 3 the soil water content in the upper 3 m of the two treatments was replenished to the same level p 0 05 and were 0 282 0 035 and 0 285 0 029 for the si and sdi respectively these values are close to the field capacity 0 288 cm3 cm 3 however such a replenishment did not occur in either treatment at the 3 8 m depth in this period table 2 the soil water content did not change in the si treatment and decreased from 0 244 0 026 0 234 0 025 in the sdi plot table 2 this decrease represents an additional loss of 52 mm soil water from the 3 8 m depth of the sdi plot therefore soil water contents in the upper 3 m fluctuated around the field capacity with time showing no significant differences between the two treatments p 0 05 there was however a reduction of soil water contents at depths below 3 m in the sdi plot table 2 from april 23 to july 14 in 2018 the sdi treatment experienced an additional soil water storage loss of 104 mm in deep soil fig 5c 3 3 response of lai and stomatal conductance to irrigation and precipitation lai increased gradually from april to july in the two plots fig 6a but there was no significant difference in lai between si and sdi treatments p 0 05 however the stomatal conductance in the sdi plot was significantly greater than that in the si plot p 0 05 fig 6b these results suggest that water stress in deep soil decreased stomatal conductance but did not affect lai 3 4 sap flow dynamics following irrigation and precipitation sap flow density generally increased with increasing potential transpiration in the si and sdi plots fig 7 during april 5 25 when the potential transpiration was relatively small the two plots had similar daily sap flow densities with the maximum sap flow density less than 15 cm hr 1 fig 7b however after april 25 sap flow density was significantly larger in the sdi plot than that in the si plot p 0 05 the difference between the two plots increased with the increase of potential daily transpiration fig 7 within a day the sap flow differences between the two plots emerged at approximately 7 30 am then increased gradually with the increase of sap flow and finally reached the maximum around 1 30 pm after the precipitation events during july 5 20 soil water contents in the upper 3 m of the two plots were replenished to the same level fig 5 and were the highest in the growing season however the sdi plot still had a significantly larger sap flow density than the si plot p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 wet deep root zone promotes transpiration before irrigation soil water storage loss in deep soil 1 m relative to the farmland were 1259 mm and 1278 mm for the si and sdi plots respectively fig 4 as evaporation mainly occurs in the upper 1 m soil depth lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 and in our study region the maximum depth that is influenced by evaporation is 3 m cheng et al 2014 lin et al 2016 considering the small deep drainage rates in orchards li et al 2018 we assume that the soil water storage loss in deep soil was attributed to transpiration the progressive loss of deep soil water may have been used for apple tree transpiration effectively in the past decades moreover from april 23 to july 14 little soil water change occurred in the si treatment in the 3 8 m layer but the sdi treatment had a reduction of 105 mm soil water storage fig 5 and table 2 because this period was also characterized by high water demand potential transpiration the higher soil water storage loss in deep soil may have resulted in a significantly greater daily average sap flux density in the sdi fig 7a and c this finding is also corroborated by our previous study that apple trees annually extracted 118 mm water from the depth below 1 m in orchards from 11 to 22 years old li et al 2019a and 40 30 of the water in fruit tissue of a 17 year old orchard is from the soil within the depth of 4 9 m zhang et al 2017 therefore growing deep roots is an effective way to combat droughts and to promote apple trees transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil the importance of deep soil water extraction in forests has been widely reported christina et al 2016 ivanov et al 2012 markewitz et al 2010 oliveira et al 2005 pierret et al 2016 rempe and dietrich 2018 and is recognized as a major discovery for the lowland forests of the amazon markewitz et al 2010 nepstad et al 1994 the extraction depth can be as deep as 18 m below the soil surface in an amazonian forest davidson et al 2011 where there is evergreen canopy sustained by water mining in the deep soil during the dry season anderson et al 2010 saleska et al 2007 recent advances in deep critical zones found that trees extracted up to 280 mm water every year from the deep weathered bedrock 4 25 m in depth beneath the surface soil mantle in a region receiving more than 2000 mm annual precipitation rempe and dietrich 2018 moreover the availability of deep soil water could also modify the aboveground vegetation composition as shown in a savannah ecosystem for a constant level of precipitation the increases in precipitation intensity increased deep soil water storage this in turn increased aboveground growth of deep rooted woody plants and suppressed aboveground growth of shallow rooted grasses kulmatiski and beard 2013 4 2 dry deep root zone suppresses transpiration although the benefits of deep soil water extraction are widely reported the effect of desiccated deep soil with low water availability on transpiration remains poorly understood in this study we found that the transpiration of apple trees in the si plot was smaller than that in the sdi treatment under the same climate and the transpiration difference between the two treatments increased with the increase of potential transpiration fig 8 the ratio between actual transpiration and potential transpiration t t p were 0 67 0 03 and 0 91 0 02 for trees growing in si and sdi treatment respectively this result demonstrated that the apple trees growing in si plot with desiccated deep soil experienced higher water stress the small transpiration in the si treatment was due to the low sap flux density fig 7b which affected by soil water conditions in the si treatment soil water contents below 3 m depth converged with that in the 30 year old orchard fig 4a indicating that the available deep soil water below 3 m depth has been exhausted moreover the sap flow density of apple trees in the si treatment is significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment fig 7b despite the fact that the soil water contents in the upper 3 m were close to the reported field capacity 0 29 cm3 cm 3 liu et al 2010 fig 5 and table 2 for instance from may 25 to jul 20 in 2018 during which the potential transpiration was high the daily average sap flow density in the si treatment only accounted for 60 6 of that in the sdi treatment when the soil water in the upper 3 m of the two treatments was fully replenished to field capacity due to the large precipitation events between july 5 and july 20 fig 5 the daily average sap flow density in the si treatment accounted for only 68 of that in the sdi treatment fig 7b therefore the ratio of sap flow densities between the two treatments did not improve much with the increase of shallow soil water storage suggesting that the sap flow density in the si treatment still experienced serious water stress from the desiccated deep soil previous partial root zone irrigation experiments demonstrated that roots in dry soil could respond to the drying by sending a root sourced signal to the shoots inhibiting stomatal conductance and finally reducing water loss from leaves davies and zhang 1991 kang and zhang 2004 when those roots in dry soil were excised the apple seedlings showed significant recovery in leaf growth rates compared to the group not excising the roots in dry soil gowing et al 1990 for the mature apple trees in this study we found that deep soil desiccation significantly decreased stomatal conductance resulting in a lower sap flow density the main reason for the higher water stress in the si plot may be largely attributed to the large percentage of fine roots in dry soil 82 6 below 3 m 4 3 desiccated thick deep soil weaken compensated root water uptake plants can compensate the reduced water uptake from the dry part of the root zone by absorbing more water in the wetted root zone which is termed as compensated root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 as indicated by the measured soil water profiles trees growing in the si plot only extracted water from the 0 3 m layer while those in the sdi plot extracted water from both the 0 3 m and 3 8 m layers fig 5 and table 1 fine roots within the 0 3 m layer only accounted for 37 7 of that in the 0 8 m layer fig 5 however as indicated by sap flow densities the root water uptake within the 0 3 m layer for the si treatment accounted for 68 of that in the sdi treatment where water extraction occurred within the 0 8 m layer this result suggested that the roots in the 0 3 m layer for the si treatment absorbed 1 84 times of water that should be allocated based on fine root length directly undergoing compensated root water uptake however as most of the fine roots were in deep soil the compensated root water uptake cannot completely diminish apple trees water stress soil water status in shallow soil is sensitive to climate conditions and can rapidly decrease to a low level following a period of drought in this context the water stored in shallow soil is not a stable water source for plants transpiration especially for trees with high water demand growing deep roots to extract water in deep soil is reported globally fan et al 2017 germon et al 2020 the observations in this study revealed that in the subhumid loess region the revegetated 22 year old apple trees extracted more than 1200 mm water from deep soil via growing deep roots fig 4a therefore growing deep roots promoted apple trees transpiration in the first few years following afforestation however in this study the water benefit from deep soil cannot be sustained for apple trees as indicated by the similar soil water conditions between the 22 and 30 year old orchard fig 4a and the soil water storage loss in deep soil increased with the age of apple tree li et al 2019b moreover through irrigation treatment we found that for the apple trees with wet shallow soil but dry deep root zone the transpiration of apple trees was significantly inhibited figs 7c and 8 therefore growing deep roots has opposing impacts on apple trees transpiration it promotes trees transpiration when soil water is highly available and suppresses it when deep roots grow in drying soil even if there is no water stress in the upper layer fig 9 meanwhile our results also indicate that the previous theory on partial root zone irrigation that soil water availability varies in a horizontal direction may also apply to forests facing deep soil desiccation the intensive water stress from the dry deep root zone may have inhibited tree growth decreased precipitation use efficiency and finally threatened the sustainability of apple cultivation in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin which need to receive more attention in future studies 5 conclusion in this study the sap flow density stomatal conductance and lai of apple trees were investigated in plots with shallow soil irrigation and both shallow and deep soil irrigation in line with our hypothesis our results demonstrated that the growing deep roots regulates apple trees transpiration in two opposing aspects it promotes apple tree water use and increase transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil and suppresses apple trees transpiration when the deep soil water is exhausted even when there is enough available

9877,both field observation and numerical model have demonstrated that trees can extend their roots to deep soil 1 m in depth however little work has been done to assess how deep roots impact trees transpiration this study hypothesized that when available water in deep soil is exhausted roots in drying soil will inhibit forest transpiration to test this hypothesis two irrigation schemes shallow soil irrigation si and shallow soil plus deep soil irrigation sdi were performed in september 2017 in a 23 year old apple orchard after irrigation 100 mm for si and 500 mm for sdi soil water within the top 3 m for si and top 8 m for sdi were replenished to about field capacity measurements were conducted before irrigation in july 2017 and after irrigation from april to july in 2018 the results showed that the two treatments had similar soil water status and sap flow density before irrigation p 0 05 soil water storage from 1 to 18 m depth decreased more than 1200 mm after afforestation however after irrigation sap flow density in the si treatment was significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment p 0 05 sap flow density in the si treatment only accounted for 60 6 of that in the sdi treatment during the period with high water demand stomatal conductance in the si plot was significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment while there was no difference in leaf area index between the two plots these results demonstrated that growing deep roots has opposing roles it promotes transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil but inhibits transpiration via decreasing stomatal conductance when available water in deep soil is exhausted these findings improve the understanding of how deep roots impact apple tree water use in water limited environments

touhami et al 2015 consequently presenting more severe water stress on terrestrial ecosystems especially for the forest ecosystems characterized by high evapotranspiration allen et al 2010 carnicer et al 2011 therefore tree response to drought stress determines current productivity and the sustainability of the forest ecosystems in the future in this context many researchers have investigated how drought stress alters evapotranspiration zhang et al 2001 zhao et al 2014 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi revadekar et al 2012 soil water biswas 2014 li et al 2019a gamage et al 2018 gao et al 2018 hu and si 2014 and root development fan et al 2017 germon et al 2019 nepstad et al 1994 xi et al 2018 in past decades root water uptake in deep soil occurring in both tropical forests and precipitation limited environments germon et al 2020 schenk and jackson 2005 effectively alleviates trees water stress christina et al 2016 markewitz et al 2010 oliveira et al 2005 for trees the average value of the global maximum rooting depth is 7 0 1 2 m canadell et al 1996 during the dry season as much as 82 of the water used in the amazonian forests were from soil below 1 m oliveira et al 2005 for this reason the deep rooted plants relative to the shallower rooted species maintained a higher leaf area index nepstad et al 1994 and transpiration rate ivanov et al 2012 rocha et al 2004 during the long dry season in the amazonian tropical forests on the other hand soil water below 1 m depth contributes 118 mm of water every year to apple trees in the subhumid region of the loess plateau of china li et al 2019a further most of the water extracted from deep soil is transpired but approximately 43 6 8 of shallow soil water is for nonproductive evaporation wei et al 2017 therefore the deep soil water reserve within the root zone helps overcome drought stress and could be more efficient than shallow soil water to date two types of deep soil water extraction have been revealed the repeatable pattern and the one way pattern the repeatable pattern refers to the deep soil water being depleted in the dry season by deep rooted plants is fully replenished by subsequent wet season rainfall this has been demonstrated by both direct field observation rempe and dietrich 2018 fig 1a and numerical model ivanov et al 2012 markewitz et al 2010 in tropical forest in contrast the one way pattern mainly seen in drier environments is that the deep soil water being depleted can hardly be replenished by subsequent rainfall resulting in continuous decrease of soil water content in deep strata thus the water extraction in deep soil is one way mining li et al 2019b fig 1b collectively the repeatable deep soil water extraction results in seasonal desiccation in deep soil while the one way pattern leads to permanent root zone desiccation in deep strata deep soil desiccation is found in many deep rooted ecosystems li et al 2019b gao et al 2014 oliveira et al 2005 rempe and dietrich 2018 however the consequence of deep soil desiccation on tree water use remains poorly understood previous partial irrigation with part of the root system is exposed to drying soil while the remaining part is irrigated have demonstrated that the root system in dry soil tends to inhibit plant transpiration kang and zhang 2004 when roots in dry soil are excised plant transpiration increases rapidly gowing et al 1990 synthesizing the reported one way deep soil water extraction and the transpiration barrier induced by the roots living in dry soil we hypothesize that in water limited environments the effect of deep roots on tree water use is two fold first deep roots promote plant transpiration when the deep soil water content is high this occurs in the first few years after afforestation during which deep root zone soil water content swc is high and can be extracted without additional stress but when soil water in the deep root zone is depleted to a low level and becomes close to or reaches the low limit for root water uptake the deep roots in dry soil prone to prevent plant transpiration to test this hypothesis widely afforested deep rooting apple is irrigated to produce two different water profiles one plot with only shallow soil is wetted and the other plot with both shallow and deep soil are wetted the results of this study are projected to advance our understanding of deep soil water extraction and provide valuable suggestions for land management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was performed on the loess plateau which located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin with an area of 640 000 km2 the loess plateau has the world s largest loess deposits and a climate ranging from arid in the northwest to semi humid in the southwest the water table is great than 30 m in most case because of the great thickness of the loess the dryness index defined as annual potential evapotranspiration divided by annual precipitation is 2 1 0 1 in this region most agriculture is rain fed due to the subhumid climate and deep water table apple trees were widely revegetated on the loess plateau since 1980 s and now this region has become the world s largest apple cultivation area 1 83 million ha in 2019 compared with traditional farmlands apple orchards have higher water consumption and therefore have higher requirements for agricultural water management the experimental site is located in a 23 year old apple orchard afforested on long term cultivated farmland since 1994 in the flat highland within the wangdonggou watershed in changwu county 35 14 n 107 41 e of shanxi province china fig 2 with a slope less than 0 05 the highland has an elevation of 1200 m above sea level and is characterized by a subhumid climate the average annual precipitation is 577 mm from 1960 to 2020 approximately 55 of which falls between july and september the average annual temperature is about 9 1 with an average frost free period of 171 days and an average annual solar radiation of approximately 5266 mj m 2 the average annual pan evapotranspiration is 1358 mm which is more than twice of the annual precipitation the soil in this area is aeolian loess with a slit loam texture according to the united states department of agriculture classification method the field capacity is 0 29 cm3 cm 3 huang et al 2001 liu etal 2010 and the average soil bulk density is 1 39 g cm 3 from 0 to 20 m depth li et al 2019a the depth of the water table is larger than 80 m all vegetation is rain fed 2 2 experimental design two plots were established in the selected orchard with four trees in each plot in july 2017 tree size soil water content and sap flow were measured to test if the two plots had similar initial conditions meanwhile as soil variability in the study site is quite small li et al 2019a the soil water content in a spring maize field about 100 m away from the selected orchard was measured to establish a benchmark for the soil water condition before afforestation the spring maize field was selected because this crop has similar growing season with apple trees soil water content is affected by many biotic and abiotic factors like plant type growth condition and climate however for shallow rooted farmlands these external factors mainly affect soil water conditions in shallow soil soil water content in deep soil is affected more by soil hydraulic properties and land cover in our study region soil water variation in farmlands mainly appeared in the upper 3 m cheng et al 2014 lin et al 2016 and the soil water content in deep soil barely changes over time as our study mainly focus on how roots growing in deep soil will impact apple tree s transpiration soil water contents farmlands can be used to benchmark soil water conditions before afforestation soil water storage loss mm was calculated according to the following equation 1 soil water storage loss i 1 n θ f i θ a i d i 10 3 where θ fi and θ ai are swc m3 m 3 in farmland and apple orchard in depth increment i respectively d i is the thickness m of the depth increment i the selected apple orchard had a dry deep root zone the dry deep root zone means that the soil water content in deep soil approached to the lower limit for root water uptake of apple trees two irrigation schemes surface soil irrigation si and surface plus deep soil irrigation sdi were implemented in the respective two plots in september 2017 table 1 the aim of si and sdi were to replenish soil water content within 0 3 m and 0 8 m to the field capacity and thus establishing a dry deep root zone in si and a wet deep root zone in sdi respectively before the 2018 growing season in the sdi plot 41 holes 1 m 1 m with a depth of 8 m were drilled using a soil auger 4 cm in diameter and the 3 8 m soil layer was irrigated through these holes bore hole irrigation fig 2 during irrigation the top of the water column in each hole was controlled at approximately 3 m below the soil surface and the total irrigation amount within 3 8 m soil depth was 500 mm subsequently all auger holes were refilled and then surface irrigation was subsequently conducted furrow irrigation in the si and sdi plots simultaneously with an irrigation amount of approximately 100 mm since irrigation was terminated in october 2017 there were six months from october 2017 to april 2018 for the irrigated water to redistribute in the irrigated zone before the 2018 growing season 2 3 data acquisition based on the irrigation time table 1 the data acquisition was divided into two periods before irrigation and after irrigation the measurements before irrigation were conducted between jun 20 to sept 12 in 2017 the measurements after irrigation were conducted within apr 5 to jul 25 in 2018 before irrigation soil water content was measured in jul 20 2017 and sap flow density was measured between jun 20 to sept 12 in 2017 with an interval of 10 min after irrigation soil water content and stomatal conductance were measured approximately once a month sap flow density was measured with an interval of 10 min and leaf area index lai were measured about twice a month in the two plots 2 3 1 soil water content a neutron access tube was installed in the center of each plot representing the average soil water content in the plot the neutron access tubes were 18 m and 20 m long for si and sdi respectively volumetric soil water content was measured with a neutron probe cnc503b beijing china at a depth interval of 0 20 m the initial soil water contents within the 0 18 m depth were measured from the samples taken when installing the neutron access tubes and then used to calibrate the neutron probe r2 0 87 moreover to examine deep soil water extraction following 23 year old trees soil water content was measured in a 30 year old apple orchard to a depth of 18 m to benchmark the soil water conditions before afforestation of apple trees soil water contents in the selected spring maize field were measured in jul 20 2017 using a neutron probe that installed one year ago 2 3 2 sap flow density the sap flow density was measured using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 in the selected four apple trees in each treatment two probes were installed on the south side of the tree along its trunk at approximately 60 cm above the land surface the distance between the two probes was 4 cm each probe contained two stainless steel needles with a 2 mm external diameter and 2 cm length the upper needle contained a loop of nichrome 80 alloy resistance wire diameter 0 13 mm resistance 87 ω ft 1 pelican wire co usa and acted as the heat source t type thermocouples tt t 36 sle omega engineering stamford ct were inserted at the middle of each needle to measure the temperature difference between the two needles the two needles were filled with omega epoxy ob 101 16 omega engineering stamford ct with high thermal conductivity the epoxy is a good electrical insulator and was used with the thermocouples and resistance wire in the needle to prevent short circuits to minimize the effect of external temperature fluctuation tin foil was wrapped around the tree trunk where the probes were installed wilson et al 2001 wullschleger et al 2001 the cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific inc logan ut was used to record the temperature difference from the thermocouples in the two needles within each probe at 1 min sampling intervals from 5 april to 20 july 2018 the means of 10 scans were used to calculate the sap flow density j s cm hr 1 based on the following equation granier 1987 2 j s 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 3600 where t is the dynamic temperature difference between the two probes and t m is the maximum temperature difference in this study t m was calculated as the temperature difference between 02 00 and 05 00 because in this period j s was close or equal to zero dawson et al 2007 the sap flux density was up scaled to daily transpiration t mm day 1 according to the following empirical equation r 2 0 93 n 23 that was established at our study site 3 t 0 2598 j s 0 045 where t is measured with an extended heat pulse probe 8 cm in length that measured sap flux density at 1 cm 3 cm 5 cm and 7 cm along the radial direction of the trunk we converted the 10 min average j s measured at different depth to tree stem flow rate f cm3 h 1 using the following equation 4 f i 1 n π r i 2 r i 1 2 j si here the thermocouples were located at the center of the sapwood area bounded by inner radius r i 1 and outer radius r i we assumed that the zone of influence for each thermocouple junction was 2 cm wide and did not overlap with the adjacent zones ford et al 2004 subsequently f was converted to daily transpiration based on the crown area 2 3 3 stomatal conductance and leaf area index stomatal conductance was measured using ap4 porometer delta t devices cambridge uk at eight selected positions on the east side of each tree n 32 stomatal conductance was measured approximately once a month at the selected positions for a similar height leaf area index was measured via the lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor inc usa at six positions for each tree including four points along the canopy perimeter and two points within the perimeter of each of the four trees 2 3 4 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the meteorology data was collected from a nearby weather station approximately 500 m from the study site and the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated based on the penman monteith equation and crop coefficients with kc ini 0 6 and kc mid 0 95 allan et al 1998 fig 3 from 5 april to 15 june pet was 1 62 times the precipitation thus this period was marked as a dry season conversely from 15 june to 20 july pet only accounted for 57 of the precipitation and therefore this period was marked as a wet season pet was divided into potential evaporation and potential transpiration based on measured lai and beer s law ritchie 1972 5 e p t et p t exp k lai t 6 t p t et p t e p t where k is light extinction coefficient that describes the efficiency of light interception for the canopy of a terrestrial ecosystem according to previous meta analysis zhang et al 2014 k was set to be 0 59 for apple trees 2 4 statistics analysis the differences among treatments were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova the statistical tests were performed with spss 18 0 spss usa at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 similar soil water profile and sap flow density before irrigation before irrigation soil water contents in the si and sdi plots treatments were significantly smaller than that in farmland p 0 05 fig 4a and the difference appeared at the depth below 1 4 m and extended to the depth of 18 m the average soil water content within 0 18 m depth was 0 273 0 024 cm3 cm 3 0 203 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and 0 202 0 028 cm3 cm 3 for farmland si and sdi respectively moreover relative to the farmland si and sdi plots had a water storage loss of 1259 mm and 1278 mm respectively the soil water profiles for the si and sdi plots were almost identical before irrigation p 0 05 indicating the same initial water conditions in the two treatments in addition soil water profiles for si and sdi were almost the same p 0 05 as that in the 30 year old orchard fig 4a indicating that the available water in deep soil had been exhausted in the previous 22 years after afforestation and remained unchanged after that similarly si and sdi plots had no significant difference in the daily sap flow densities before irrigation n 21 p 0 05 fig 4b 3 2 soil water profile changes following irrigation treatments at the begin of the 2018 growing season 23 april the upper 3 m in the si plot and the upper 8 m in the sdi plot had higher soil water content than that before irrigation fig 5 table 2 moreover the sdi treatment had similar soil water content in the upper 3 m with the si plot p 0 05 but had significantly greater soil water content within 3 8 m strata than si treatment p 0 05 during the subsequent dry season april 23 to june 21 2018 both si and sdi plots showed reduced soil water content in the root zone fig 5 the reduction mainly occurred in the upper 3 m depth for the si treatment where the average soil water content decreased from 0 264 0 013 cm3 cm 3 to 0 250 0 018 cm3 cm 3 below 3 m depth the soil water contents remained unchanged fig 5 and table 2 for the sdi treatment however the soil water content decreased evidently in both 0 3 m and 3 8 m depths the average soil water content in the upper 3 m decreased from 0 267 0 015 cm3 cm 3 to 0 257 0 012 cm3 cm 3 the soil water content in the 3 8 m layer decreased from 0 255 0 023 cm3 cm 3 to 0 244 0 026 cm3 cm 3 fig 5 after the major precipitation events from june 21 to july 15 fig 3 the soil water content in the upper 3 m of the two treatments was replenished to the same level p 0 05 and were 0 282 0 035 and 0 285 0 029 for the si and sdi respectively these values are close to the field capacity 0 288 cm3 cm 3 however such a replenishment did not occur in either treatment at the 3 8 m depth in this period table 2 the soil water content did not change in the si treatment and decreased from 0 244 0 026 0 234 0 025 in the sdi plot table 2 this decrease represents an additional loss of 52 mm soil water from the 3 8 m depth of the sdi plot therefore soil water contents in the upper 3 m fluctuated around the field capacity with time showing no significant differences between the two treatments p 0 05 there was however a reduction of soil water contents at depths below 3 m in the sdi plot table 2 from april 23 to july 14 in 2018 the sdi treatment experienced an additional soil water storage loss of 104 mm in deep soil fig 5c 3 3 response of lai and stomatal conductance to irrigation and precipitation lai increased gradually from april to july in the two plots fig 6a but there was no significant difference in lai between si and sdi treatments p 0 05 however the stomatal conductance in the sdi plot was significantly greater than that in the si plot p 0 05 fig 6b these results suggest that water stress in deep soil decreased stomatal conductance but did not affect lai 3 4 sap flow dynamics following irrigation and precipitation sap flow density generally increased with increasing potential transpiration in the si and sdi plots fig 7 during april 5 25 when the potential transpiration was relatively small the two plots had similar daily sap flow densities with the maximum sap flow density less than 15 cm hr 1 fig 7b however after april 25 sap flow density was significantly larger in the sdi plot than that in the si plot p 0 05 the difference between the two plots increased with the increase of potential daily transpiration fig 7 within a day the sap flow differences between the two plots emerged at approximately 7 30 am then increased gradually with the increase of sap flow and finally reached the maximum around 1 30 pm after the precipitation events during july 5 20 soil water contents in the upper 3 m of the two plots were replenished to the same level fig 5 and were the highest in the growing season however the sdi plot still had a significantly larger sap flow density than the si plot p 0 05 4 discussions 4 1 wet deep root zone promotes transpiration before irrigation soil water storage loss in deep soil 1 m relative to the farmland were 1259 mm and 1278 mm for the si and sdi plots respectively fig 4 as evaporation mainly occurs in the upper 1 m soil depth lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 and in our study region the maximum depth that is influenced by evaporation is 3 m cheng et al 2014 lin et al 2016 considering the small deep drainage rates in orchards li et al 2018 we assume that the soil water storage loss in deep soil was attributed to transpiration the progressive loss of deep soil water may have been used for apple tree transpiration effectively in the past decades moreover from april 23 to july 14 little soil water change occurred in the si treatment in the 3 8 m layer but the sdi treatment had a reduction of 105 mm soil water storage fig 5 and table 2 because this period was also characterized by high water demand potential transpiration the higher soil water storage loss in deep soil may have resulted in a significantly greater daily average sap flux density in the sdi fig 7a and c this finding is also corroborated by our previous study that apple trees annually extracted 118 mm water from the depth below 1 m in orchards from 11 to 22 years old li et al 2019a and 40 30 of the water in fruit tissue of a 17 year old orchard is from the soil within the depth of 4 9 m zhang et al 2017 therefore growing deep roots is an effective way to combat droughts and to promote apple trees transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil the importance of deep soil water extraction in forests has been widely reported christina et al 2016 ivanov et al 2012 markewitz et al 2010 oliveira et al 2005 pierret et al 2016 rempe and dietrich 2018 and is recognized as a major discovery for the lowland forests of the amazon markewitz et al 2010 nepstad et al 1994 the extraction depth can be as deep as 18 m below the soil surface in an amazonian forest davidson et al 2011 where there is evergreen canopy sustained by water mining in the deep soil during the dry season anderson et al 2010 saleska et al 2007 recent advances in deep critical zones found that trees extracted up to 280 mm water every year from the deep weathered bedrock 4 25 m in depth beneath the surface soil mantle in a region receiving more than 2000 mm annual precipitation rempe and dietrich 2018 moreover the availability of deep soil water could also modify the aboveground vegetation composition as shown in a savannah ecosystem for a constant level of precipitation the increases in precipitation intensity increased deep soil water storage this in turn increased aboveground growth of deep rooted woody plants and suppressed aboveground growth of shallow rooted grasses kulmatiski and beard 2013 4 2 dry deep root zone suppresses transpiration although the benefits of deep soil water extraction are widely reported the effect of desiccated deep soil with low water availability on transpiration remains poorly understood in this study we found that the transpiration of apple trees in the si plot was smaller than that in the sdi treatment under the same climate and the transpiration difference between the two treatments increased with the increase of potential transpiration fig 8 the ratio between actual transpiration and potential transpiration t t p were 0 67 0 03 and 0 91 0 02 for trees growing in si and sdi treatment respectively this result demonstrated that the apple trees growing in si plot with desiccated deep soil experienced higher water stress the small transpiration in the si treatment was due to the low sap flux density fig 7b which affected by soil water conditions in the si treatment soil water contents below 3 m depth converged with that in the 30 year old orchard fig 4a indicating that the available deep soil water below 3 m depth has been exhausted moreover the sap flow density of apple trees in the si treatment is significantly smaller than that in the sdi treatment fig 7b despite the fact that the soil water contents in the upper 3 m were close to the reported field capacity 0 29 cm3 cm 3 liu et al 2010 fig 5 and table 2 for instance from may 25 to jul 20 in 2018 during which the potential transpiration was high the daily average sap flow density in the si treatment only accounted for 60 6 of that in the sdi treatment when the soil water in the upper 3 m of the two treatments was fully replenished to field capacity due to the large precipitation events between july 5 and july 20 fig 5 the daily average sap flow density in the si treatment accounted for only 68 of that in the sdi treatment fig 7b therefore the ratio of sap flow densities between the two treatments did not improve much with the increase of shallow soil water storage suggesting that the sap flow density in the si treatment still experienced serious water stress from the desiccated deep soil previous partial root zone irrigation experiments demonstrated that roots in dry soil could respond to the drying by sending a root sourced signal to the shoots inhibiting stomatal conductance and finally reducing water loss from leaves davies and zhang 1991 kang and zhang 2004 when those roots in dry soil were excised the apple seedlings showed significant recovery in leaf growth rates compared to the group not excising the roots in dry soil gowing et al 1990 for the mature apple trees in this study we found that deep soil desiccation significantly decreased stomatal conductance resulting in a lower sap flow density the main reason for the higher water stress in the si plot may be largely attributed to the large percentage of fine roots in dry soil 82 6 below 3 m 4 3 desiccated thick deep soil weaken compensated root water uptake plants can compensate the reduced water uptake from the dry part of the root zone by absorbing more water in the wetted root zone which is termed as compensated root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 as indicated by the measured soil water profiles trees growing in the si plot only extracted water from the 0 3 m layer while those in the sdi plot extracted water from both the 0 3 m and 3 8 m layers fig 5 and table 1 fine roots within the 0 3 m layer only accounted for 37 7 of that in the 0 8 m layer fig 5 however as indicated by sap flow densities the root water uptake within the 0 3 m layer for the si treatment accounted for 68 of that in the sdi treatment where water extraction occurred within the 0 8 m layer this result suggested that the roots in the 0 3 m layer for the si treatment absorbed 1 84 times of water that should be allocated based on fine root length directly undergoing compensated root water uptake however as most of the fine roots were in deep soil the compensated root water uptake cannot completely diminish apple trees water stress soil water status in shallow soil is sensitive to climate conditions and can rapidly decrease to a low level following a period of drought in this context the water stored in shallow soil is not a stable water source for plants transpiration especially for trees with high water demand growing deep roots to extract water in deep soil is reported globally fan et al 2017 germon et al 2020 the observations in this study revealed that in the subhumid loess region the revegetated 22 year old apple trees extracted more than 1200 mm water from deep soil via growing deep roots fig 4a therefore growing deep roots promoted apple trees transpiration in the first few years following afforestation however in this study the water benefit from deep soil cannot be sustained for apple trees as indicated by the similar soil water conditions between the 22 and 30 year old orchard fig 4a and the soil water storage loss in deep soil increased with the age of apple tree li et al 2019b moreover through irrigation treatment we found that for the apple trees with wet shallow soil but dry deep root zone the transpiration of apple trees was significantly inhibited figs 7c and 8 therefore growing deep roots has opposing impacts on apple trees transpiration it promotes trees transpiration when soil water is highly available and suppresses it when deep roots grow in drying soil even if there is no water stress in the upper layer fig 9 meanwhile our results also indicate that the previous theory on partial root zone irrigation that soil water availability varies in a horizontal direction may also apply to forests facing deep soil desiccation the intensive water stress from the dry deep root zone may have inhibited tree growth decreased precipitation use efficiency and finally threatened the sustainability of apple cultivation in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin which need to receive more attention in future studies 5 conclusion in this study the sap flow density stomatal conductance and lai of apple trees were investigated in plots with shallow soil irrigation and both shallow and deep soil irrigation in line with our hypothesis our results demonstrated that the growing deep roots regulates apple trees transpiration in two opposing aspects it promotes apple tree water use and increase transpiration when there is sufficient available water in deep soil and suppresses apple trees transpiration when the deep soil water is exhausted even when there is enough available

develops a double optimization procedure to locate and select the best recovery machines considering different objective functions the methodology is applied to a real case study which has serial data of water registered volume since 2001 the research shows the leakages influence in the operation points as well as the recovered energy different sustainable indicators are analysed for the different scenarios according to optimized procedures the irlgp index was defined as the ratio between reduction of the leakage volume for each installed power and it reached the annual value of 11 280 8 m3 kw the optimized procedure establishes the significance to consider the leakages when the hydraulic machines are selected their best efficiency points increase to 195 and 205 compared to the ideal scenario without leakages keywords leakages water irrigation networks system sustainability micro hydropower energy recovery 1 introduction hydroelectric micro energy can be a valuable answer to the

extensive information on the historical development methods selection criteria and the results of the installation of pats in water distribution networks as an energy recovery system bonthuys et al 2020 developed an efficient optimization process for energy recovery and reduction of water leaks the procedure proved to be more cost effective and realistic compared to others proposed in the literature a nonlinear programming nlp algorithm for the optimal setting of pats within wdns was extended to the case of leakage reduction cimorelli et al 2020 a multi objective optimization methodology is presented to minimize leakage and minimize the difference between pumping operating costs and revenues generated through energy recovery by strategically locating pats in the network

65 kw which is more than 30 of the daily electricity demand of the water network traditionally pressure management was developed by using pressure reduction valves which allow the reduction of leaks but dissipate excess energy lima et al 2017 compared the use of pats versus prvs indicating that it is possible by installing pats to recover up to 169 360 kwh year as well as reducing leaks these leakages decrease increasing the volumetric performance of the system from 0 73 to 0 9 lima et al 2017 proposed a method that replaces a prv with a pat to produce electrical energy and reduce pressure this method was improved by adding variable speed pumps to control the dynamic operation of networks in order to improve energy recovery and reduce leakage lima et al 2018 this solution enables the recovery above 40 of the gross power potential of an existing prv could be converted to electrical energy using a pat while also controlling pressure lydon et al 2017 to increase this recovery other

evaluated a water system that operates with a flow rate of 350 l s and a pressure of 45 m w c the installation of pats under these operating conditions enables the annual generation of 714670 kwh and the leakages decrease of 3 this reduction saved 248 504 m3 these contributions improved the different sustainability indicators they can help to analyze the management of the water systems sustainability indicators are necessary to determine the efficiency of a system concerning criteria such as i annual energy consumption and cost for each cubic meter of water injected into the network ii the percentage of energy recoverable in the network by energy excesses and iii the reduction of energy consumption for each cubic meter of water leaked the recommended indicators that are analyzed in the water distribution networks are shown in table 1 several sustainability indicators for pressurized water systems were proposed by mejía et al 2012 rosado et al 2020 developed a proposal for a

distribution networks in which the savings can support the electricity use of more than 20 average american households corresponding to an annual reduction of 177 tons of co2 emissions the indicators depend on the network topology and therefore there are different between them it implies one indicator cannot be adapted exclusively sustainable development goals sdgs acknowledge the inter linkages

emissions contributing to the objective 13 bruce et al 2018 of the sdg this research aims to establish a methodology which optimizes the location and selection of the machine considering the influence of the leakages in the selection of the machine as well as its influence on the location when leaks are considered the novelty focuses on the characterization of the operation points for different leakages values as well as the double application of the simulated annealing to optimize the location as well as the selection of the recovery systems to develop the study the methodology proposes an internal iterative procedure which allows the estimation of the leakages in each line and consumption point according to measured volume data i e injected and registered by the water managers the methodology was applied to the real irrigation network it is located on the township called vallada in the province of valencia spain 2 methodology the proposed optimization procedure is divided into six different phases in which each one contains different steps fig 1 the model needs different inputs to develop the optimization procedure and there are two simulated annealing procedures includes in this methodology these optimization procedures are applied on localization of the recovery systems in the different ones and define the best machine and its regulation control 2 1 optimization stages fig 1 shows the proposed methodology which is divided into five different stages network model i leakages calibration ii energy balance iii location optimization iv selection optimization v and definition of the best solution vi 2 1 1 network model the first stage is a preliminary phase in which the network model is developed according to the available information this should define both the topology of the water systems as well as the demand base and the consumption patterns the model is simulated to check the flow and pressure in all lines and nodes when the model is correct the model is ready to be calibrated considering leaks the model uses the calibrated methodology which estimates the flow over time considering the consumed volume in the irrigation points as well as the irrigation needs and consumption trends of the farmers pérez sánchez et al 2016 2017 2 1 2 leakages calibration the second step proposes a calibration strategy to consider the leakages in the water systems the method is applied when the water managers have information on the water meters of the consumption therefore the proposed method establishes a balance of the water volumes the first step is the development of the implemented volume analysis establishing the following continuity balance step ii a 1 v i v m v l where v i is the injected volume in the network in m3 v m is the total measured volume by water meters in the consumption nodes in m3 and v l is the total leakages volume in the water system in m3 if this data volume is known the different volume performance of the network can be defined according to the following equations 2 η l v l v i 3 η m v m v i where η l is the leakage performance of the water system and η m is the measured volume performance of the water system the leaks can be divided into two types which are called apparent and real losses almandoz et al 2005 in which the real leakages are assigned in the distribution lines while the apparent losses are assigned to the irrigation consumption points these leakages enable the definition of the following ratio 4 η al v al v l 5 η rl v rl v l where η al is the ratio between apparent leakages and total leakages v al is the total volume of the apparent losses in m3 η rl is the ratio between real leakages and total leakages v rl is the total volume of the real losses in m3 the apparent losses are the uncontrolled leakeages in the water systems which cannot be measured almandoz et al 2005 the calibration model distributes the leakages once the performances i e η al η rl and η l are known this distribution establishes the different criteria as a function of the leakage type step ii b the model determines the different emitter coefficients assigned to the lines and consumption points in different iterations minimizing the error between simulated leakage volume and leakage volume of the water system the model considers the following equation to evaluate the leakage in each element i e line or tap 5 q l ij k j p ij n where q l ij is the leakage flow for the element j i e line or consumption point at the time i p ij is the pressure in the element j at the time i if the element is a line the chosen pressure is the average pressure value of the line p ij p ij n is the leakage exponent and k j is the global emitter coefficient using eq 5 the leakage volume is estimated by the following expression 6 v l j i 1 i t q l ij δ t i 1 i t k j p ij n δ t where t is the interval time in s v l j is the leakage volume for the element in m3 assuming the k j is constant in all annual simulations it is defined by the following expression through iterative procedure 7 k j v l j i 1 i t p ij n δ t the definition of the calibration of the leakages is based on the estimation of the parameter k j assuming that the total leakage volume is distributed between all elements of the network it assumed the leakage volume of each element i e line or tap will be proportional to some variables which are related to network characteristics in this case the leakage volume of each element v l j can be determined by the following expression 8 v l j δ j v l δ j η l v i where δ j is the distributed coefficient assigned to each element of the network the addition of all distributed coefficients is equal to 1 δ j is estimated by the following expressions which difference if δ j is for a line eq 9 or consumption point eq 10 9 δ j l j τ j j 1 j k l j τ j where l j is the length of the line j in m τ j is the weighted coefficient which is novel concerning other published researches k is the number of lines of the model it depends on the material of the line k is the number of pipes eq 10 establishes the proposed expression to estimate the distributed coefficient which weighs the apparent losses in the consumption points in this case the distribution coefficient is based on the ratio between consumed volume in the consumption point and total consumed volume 10 δ j v t j j 1 j m v t j where v t j is the total consumed volume of the irrigation points j including both measured invoiced for irrigation as well as the leakage volume no invoiced m is the number of consumption points of the model the iterations to assign the different distributed coefficients finalizes when the error is minimized in this distribution when this error is minimum compared between simulated and measured volume the model is ready to be used in the optimization procedure step ii d when the water managers do not know the leakage performance the proposed methodology develops a preliminary analysis of leaks step ii c step ii b develops a series of simulations to obtain ranges of values and define the scenarios correctly the model supposes the calculus of the real leakages in the lines it enables the estimation of the real leakage performance η rl and establish the n exponent in this hypothesis the leaked volume is not known and the methodology assigned different leakage parameters to the lines following the alignment of the other published researches germanopoulos 1985 giustolisi et al 2008 the following expression is used 11 q l ij β j l j p ij n where β j is the leakage coefficient which characterizes the pipe in terms of age diameter material thickness among others in this case the model does not need to iterate since the used emitter coefficient in epanet is 12 k j β j l j β j varied between 10 4 and 10 7 as a function of the material cement steel or pvc maskit and ostfeld 2014 it grows over time and this increase depends on the material different scenarios are defined in this case which weighted the β j value besides n exponent is defined in the calibration model estimating the value through of normalized valued which oscillates between 0 5 and 1 5 according to published researches maskit and ostfeld 2014 step ii b enables the estimation of the η rl and n exponent 2 1 3 energy balance once phases i and ii occour the energy balance can be established to know the energy audit and therefore the available operational points in each line and consumption point this energy balance is crucial since it should consider the minimum hydraulic requirements table 2 shows the equations used to establish the energy balance and define the operation points i e flow and theoretical head which are the main input to develop the first optimization

net present value npv represents the cumulative sum of all revenues minus all costs expected over the life of the project input 6 and input 7 enable the development of step iv a this step establishes an ordered list of the elements according to each objective function once the ordered list is established the procedure is ahead to step iv b the optimization procedure is based on simulated annealing defined by pérez sánchez et al 2018 the installation of different recovery systems provides a significant number of possible combinations in this situation the simulated annealing method is particularly suitable since it satisfies the basic requirements for its application dougherty and marryott 1991 these requirements are i clear configuration of the decision variables ii definition of the target variables iii procedure for generating new system configurations iv control parameters and analogous cooling scheme and v algorithm completion criteria in this case the algorithm searches for the best locations for the recovery systems based on the defined objective functions as well as the number of established recovery systems the optimization process maximizes the established objective functions this process is shown in steps iv b and iv c once the objective function to be considered is selected generating a list in descending order of the elements that enter the optimization according to the energy balances performed and the chosen objective function the control parameters of the algorithm are defined and they are the initial temperature t i the final temperature t f cooling ratio α and number of transitions for each temperature step l 0 these parameters can be set by a previous sensitivity analysis the transition temperature t t is calculated according to a geometrical relation according to 20 t t α t t 1 when the control parameters are defined the maximum number of recovery systems n should be determined the range of this parameter is between 2 and the maximum number of elements i e lines and nodes of the water system in the initial step of the procedure step iv b the initial configuration should be considered this configuration begins by considering two recovery systems m in the two first elements of the list hereafter the simulated procedure steps iv c develops a new combination between different elements for each value of the m recovery system when the optimization process finishes the methodology establishes the best location for this value of m step iv d if the m value is lower than n then the procedure comes back from step iv b in which the new configuration for the m 1 recovery system is developed the final result of this stage step iv e is the knowledge of the optimum configuration for the n recovery system output 5 this output is input 9 which is used in step v 2 1 5 selection optimization of the machines the main goal of this stage is the definition of the most suitable machine or machines it implies the selection of the machine the definition of the maximum number of machines in each recovery system if needed and the best strategy to regulate according to the chosen objective variables these inputs are previously defined and the methodology used a database that used 110 different pats the machines are defined according to specific speed n st head number and discharge number these values allow the definition of the dimensionless parameters of the machines included in the database to define the machine the dimensionless best efficiency point bep is used through the 110 tested machines it considers different values of impeller diameter and rotational speed both values enable the definition of the generated best efficiency point of the theoretical machine when the bep is known the characteristic curves are defined by the methodology proposed by pérez sánchez et al 2020b once the characteristic curve is estimated the variable operation strategy zone is defined the machine operates under variable rotational speed and the best efficiency head beh best power head bph and best power flow bpf is estimated this prediction of the variation of the rotational speed is developed according to the proposed methodology by ávila et al 2021 considering these curves the algorithm developed the optimization by iterations using different regulation strategies rs these strategies can be i nominal rotational speed nr ii beh iii bph iv bpf and v operational area considering the maximum and minimum recoverable head the use of an optimization procedure is necessary because there are different variables i the possibility to use a different number of machines which can be installed in serial or parallel in the same recovery system ii different regulation strategies iii and different possible number of recovery systems installed in the network it implies a high number of combinations in this case the methodology proposes the use of the simulated annealing again the initial step of this stage v a includes the definition of the problem which indicates the number of recovery systems and their location in the water network as a function of the objective function input 9 which is the result of the previous optimization procedure step iv besides the water managers should be defined the different regulation strategies defined the inputs the procedure continues to step v b in which the definition of the initial configuration is established in each recovery system an ordered list of the possible machines is developed according to the objective function establishing the initial operation rules when the machine is chosen an iterative procedure analyses whether there are other operation rules which will be better to improve the objective function finally step v b the best machine and operation rules getting the initial configuration which is used in the following step v c step v b repeated the procedure for each recovery system step v c includes the definition of the control parameters which are defined similarly to stage iv a new configuration of the operation is developed in each iteration in which a recovery system is chosen randomly and another machine is checked in that recovery system the beginning probability of the machine is proportional to the value of the objective function keeping the ordered list the beginning probability of the upstream recovery systems is greater than downstream systems in the first iterations this probability decreases when the calculus procedure advances once the machine and strategy are optimized the procedure continues to step v d in which the energy and feasibility analysis is developed developing iterations to reach the best solution in the combination of the n located recovery machines the used database and the regulation strategy as well as considering the chosen scenario the feasibility analysis is developed considering the recovered energy e tr reduction of the

operation of the recovery systems carravetta et al 2014b garcía et al 2019 the annual costs ac refer to the annual operating costs of the recovery systems over the life of the system giudicianni et al 2020 the annual incomes ai refer to the annual incomes generated by the facility through the sale of energy or self consumption benefits the incomes also consider the reduction of leakages and therefore the benefit for the water saving in addition they may include other types of benefits due to reduced leakage and reduced co2 emissions the residual income ri is a concept that takes into account the possible income from the sale of the different elements once their function in the facility has ended 2 1 6 best solution the final step is the development of the best solution through an iterative procedure in which the different sustainable indicators are analysed to consider the best recovery system these indicators are shown in table 1 and the optimization procedure calculates them in each iterative procedure of the selection of the machine 2 2 materials and case study the proposed methodology was applied using a database of a total number of 110 pumps working as turbines the dimensionless best efficiency point characteristic of the machine and rotational speed is shown in rosado et al 2020 using this database which classifies the recovery systems considering their specific speed 7826 synthetic machines are generated through turbine generators published by pérez sánchez et al 2018 when the simulated annealing is applied a previous selection is developed considering the available operational points in this line this first selection enables the decrease of computational times and an improvement of the final selected machine the research applies the proposed methodology to a real water system the case study is located on vallada spain and it is an irrigation pressurized system which was built in 2001 the network supplies around 230 ha the crop is citric tree mainly and the water resources are got from a well which is pumped to a reservoir the pipelines of the network are built on asbestos cement pipes 10 780 m and polyvinyl chloride 11015 m the diameter oscillated between 90 and 450 mm and the total length of the main pipes and branches is around 22 km there are 222 irrigation consumption points the base demand was assigned considering the different farms facilities the adopted plantation frame was 4 6 squared meter plantation frame and the flow rate of the dripper used was 4 l h applying the irrigation needs of the citric tree for each fig 2 table 3 shows the recorded data of the water consumption injected to the grid and measured as well as the leakages of the system from 2001 to 2020 the present research proposes the establishment of four different scenarios to group the years in similar ranges of leakages these scenarios are s0 from 2001 to 2005 s1 from 2006 to 2010 s2 from 2011 to 2015 s3 from 2016 to 2020 s0 is considered the ideal situation which has no leakages s1 considers an average of leakages of 4 98 therefore it considers a total leakage performance equal to 5 s2 has an average of leakages of the 13 75 this scenario was approached to 15 finally s3 approaches the leakages at 25 since the real data operated between 2016 and 2020 the average leakages was 22 61 the serial data shows the lack of maintenance in the network and therefore the increase of the potential leaks in the system epanet toolkit rossman 2000 was used fot the modeling with consumption patterns which were applied in each irrigation point were defined considering both consumed volume as well as the irrigation area of each tap and defining the base demand of the irrigation point according to irrigation needs of the crop the model calibration was developed establishing different leakages scenarios these scenarios were considering the previous scenario in table 3 they consider leakages equal to 0 s0 5 s1 15 s2 25 s3 35 s4 and 50 s5 s4 and s5 are future scenarios considering the water managers will not be maintained and the leakages increase according to the observed trend between 2001 and 2020 s4 and s5 are hypothetical and they showed the trend of the systems if the water managers will not apply corrective actions to improve the water systems and reduce the leakages s4 and s5 are included to analyse the influence of the leakages in the recovery energy and the selection of the hydraulic systems 3 results once the model is developed used epanet toolkit step i the methodology established a preliminary leakages model step ii c it defines the real and apparent leakages performance since there is not this information registered by the water managers this analysis enabled the estimation of the real and apparent losses it enables the assignment of the exponent n both lines and irrigation consumption points considering the scenario step ii b as a function of the registered volume data and total leakages performances step ii a table 3 the η r and η a values are defined through an iterative procedure in which the methodology analyse different values of n and compare with the real losses in step ii c these n values were obtained to adjust the leakages volume in each scenario by an iterative procedure in which the n and β are calibrated to minimize the error between registered data and simulated values table 4 shows the calibration values which were obtained for this case study fig 3a shows the different values of the energies balance in taps as a function of the analysed scenario previously to analyse the optimization procedure the figure shows the annual total energy values for friction theoretical recoverable and required energy all energy values were considered and there is no direct relationship between different values since the theoretical recoverable energy required energy as well as friction energy depending on topology and characteristic of the network i e length the diameter of pipes level of the consumption points level of nodes and head of the reservoir among others the annual friction energy oscillates between 10 255 and 13 426 kwh this increase is trivial since when the flow increases the friction losses increase on squared growth in this case the annual friction energy increased 4 1 in the most unfavorable scenario s5 compared to the ideal situation s0 the annual required energy which is necessary to satisfy the minimum pressure requirements is also increased to compensate for the flow and friction losses it oscillated between 78 968 and 94 716 kwh for the s0 and s5 respectively this increase represented around 20 compared to s0 ideal scenario without leakages finally the annual theoretical recoverable energy which is available to be recovered partially when the recovery system is installed and their efficiency is considered was between 152 906 and 182 264 kwh for s0 and s5 respectively the annual energy recoverable also increased 26 2 when s5 is analysed fig 3b shows the analysis of the percentage of leakages reduction as a function of the number of recovery machines installed these results were obtained when the objective function was the reduction of the leakages it is observed the reduction oscillated between 0 15 and 0 37 when the number of recovery machines changed between 1 and 10 respectively the figure shows not much difference in the reduction of the leakages when the different scenarios are considered when simulations are extended increasing the number of recovery machines the maximum decrease of leakages was 0 41 for s1 0 44 for s2 and s3 and 0 43 for s4 and s5 the hypothetical number of recovery systems was 204 for these results the optimization procedure was developed for the three objective functions i e theoretical recoverable reduction of leakages and net present values table 5 shows the different results when these functions were optimized the optimization procedure considered the following combinations 204 when n was 1 20 706 for n equal to 2 1394 204 when n was 3 70 058 751 when n was 5 the possible combinations were 2802 350 040 9 2945 1010 for n equal to 6 2 6291012 when n was 7 6 4739 1013 for n equal to 8 1 40991015 for n equal to 9 and 2 7493 1016 the iterations oscillated between 140 and 2640 depending of the combinations and the simulated parameters for the optimization of the locations were initial temperature was 10 final temperature was 0 001 the cooling rate was 0 9 and the transition change was 10 these parameters were defined previously through sensitive analysis the simulated parameters were changed when the optimization of the selection was applied the following parameters were used initial temperature was 10 final temperature was 0 001 the cooling rate was 0 5 and the transition change was 10 table 5 shows that the use of three number of recovery systems n allows the potential recovery of around 0 8 of the available energy in all scenarios in which the theoretical recoverable energy increases proportionally with the leakages values if the objective function is the reduction of the leakages the reduction range oscillates between 0 37 and 0 66 when the n varies between 1 and 3 the leakages decrease is around 0 8 when the procedure is optimized using ten recovery systems although this solution is not feasible if the npv values are analysed finally when the npv function is analysed it shows feasibility between s1 and s5 although this feasibility reduces according to n and it increases when there is a high percentage de leakages in the network since the circulating flow is higher besides the npv function considers both recovered energy as well as the reduction of the leakages for the decrease of the pressure when pats operate in the network the installations of pat systems enable the reduction of the leakages and therefore there is a benefit by the cost of the water that does not leak due to recovery systems therefore the third function considers economic energy and technical indicators to locate the recovery systems in the network the optimization procedure enables the preselection of the machine according to theoretical operational points to develop the second procedure of the optimization step v in this case the machine is chosen to optimize its operating in terms of flow head and efficiency the procedure chooses the best machine for each scenario in one of the defined lines which were established by the location optimization procedure the model develops an iterative procedure to define the best regulation strategy rs to evaluate the recovered energy reduction of leakages and npv values the recovery never reaches 100 of the theoretical recoverable energy because the efficiency of the recovery systems is less than 1 since this study did not consider ideal machines fig 4 shows the influence map in which the selection optimization operates to locate the best machine the color gradient shows the ratio between the variable value and the maximum value therefore the red areas are the best to improve the variable objective fig 4a and b show the results for line 2004 of the network when the recovered energy is maximized in both s1 and s5 all figures show a black cross which indicates the selected machine in each case the selected machines are different showing the regulation strategy specific speed rotational speed of the machine as well as the best efficiency point of the machine this variability of the machine shows the importance of considering the leakages when the recovery systems want to be chosen for example when the s1 is analysed the best efficiency point of the machine is 24 4 l s and 14 21 m w c if s5 is analysed the best efficiency point of the machine increases 195 and 205 particularly 47 7 l s and 30 64 m w c respectively fig 4c and d show the optimized solution to select the best machine both s1 and s5 when the optimized variable is the leakages reduction similar results were obtained in the selection where the bep of the machine varied from 9 27 to 18 65 l s the head in the bep changed from 53 to 35 m w c the regulation strategy rs established on s1 it was nr while the s2 operated under bph fig 4e and f defined the best machine when the npv value was optimized in both scenarios shown s1 and s5 the best regulation strategy was nr in s1 the best efficiency point was 24 42 l s and 19 61 m w c while it increases for s5 in this case the bep was 37 71 l s and 33 94 m w c in addition the analysis of each scenario as well as of each combination of installed recovery systems n allows to know the recovered energy the reduction of leaks as well as the npv analysis as a function of the number of machines installed in each recovery system nm and their characterization of them using specific speed nst impeller diameter d rotational speed n and best efficiency point table 6 shows an example of the information selection obtained in the optimized procedure when the s2 was analysed under the hypothesis of the npv function the table shows annual recoverable energy values above 32 000 kwh and annual leakages decrease above 18 000 m3 in some configurations with different recovery systems n the inclusion of the pats in water systems is developed to improve the sustainability indicators fig 5 shows the influence of the pats in the improvement of these indicators defined in table 1 depending on the scenario analysed fig 5a shows four indexes ied showed values between 0 042 and 0 046 increasing in the s5 mainly iec decreased 40 between s0 and s5 it shows the decrease of unit cost when pats are used in the irrigation system iefw and iaefw showed similar trends with decreases equal to 40 1 and 45 4 ier showed annual values between 29 010 and 57 543 kwh fig 5b another index which is related to ier is the irlgp this index shows the reduction of leaks in the system considered the installed recovery power if irlgp is observed in fig 5b the zero value is defined for the ideal situation s0 the rest values for the different scenarios were 265 3 s1 1207 6 s2 7584 5 s3 7584 6 s4 and 11 280 8 s5 m3 kw this index is too significant since it shows the influence of leakage reduction when recovery systems are installed and therefore it demonstrates the advantage of incorporating micro hydropower systems in the network related to environmental indexes cdrpe and cdrbl were applied considering the conversion parameter from kwh to kgco2 reduction in this case the research considered the value 0 49 kg kwh defined by marchis et al 2016 cdrpe showed the same trend of erp and cdrbl decreased from 4 38 to 0 24 kgco2 emissions for each cubic meter of water saved by leakages 4 conclusions the present research represents a new step forward in improving the sustainability of irrigation systems the new optimized procedure was developed in which three novelties were introduced a double simulated annealing procedure was introduced to determine the location of the recovery system considering three different objective functions and the selection of the best machine as well as the best regulation strategy the regulation strategy considered the operation of the machines in different work modes between them the recovery systems can operate under beh bpf and bph using the modified affinity laws the methodology uses a database in which there are 7826 pats which were defined using the dimensionless numbers generated by 110 tested machines the second novelty shown in this research is the need to consider evaluate and estimate the leaks in the network to carry out a correct selection of the machines in the different recovery systems leaks can cause significant variations of the best efficiency point to choose the machine mainly in terms of flow the particular case study in which the methodology was applied showed a variation around 200 in terms of flow and head related to the best efficiency point of the machine these values show the significance of the leakages consideration in the new future energy balances there are no published studies that consider the variation of the operating points of the machines besides tool is presented that combines all aspects of analysis within the water distribution systems that affect the efficiency of the system developing a novel methodology applicable to any type of network as a third novelty the research allows the characterization of the sustainability indicators in the selection of the machines and therefore includes the analysis of the sustainability indicators in each iteration besides the methodology operates with different scenarios in which different leakages values could be considered as a function of the serial data and future scenarios the methodology enables the fit of the calibrated leakages model the applicability enables the use of this tool by water managers improving the efficiency of the water systems the leakages management as well as the use of renewable energies system will open new research trends which are focused on reach new targets of the sustainable development goals inside of the water systems finally the proposal was applied to a real irrigation system the calibration model was developed considering serial data of twenty years in which five different scenarios were developed defining different leakages levels in one of them the application of the methodology shows the great influence of the leakages reduction when the recovery systems were installed in the water networks the annual recoverable energy values above 32 000 kwh and annual leakages decrease above 18 000 m3 in the best configurations using three recovery systems which are configurated with three pat each one the irlgp index was defined as the ratio between reduction of the leakage volume for each installed power and it reached the annual value of 11 280 8 m3 kw and cdrbl decreased from 4 38 to 0 24 kgco2 emissions for each cubic meter of water saved by leakages future works should be focused on apply the measurement of sustainable indicators to the different supply systems and develop new

9878,the use of pumps working as turbines is a new solution which has been recently analysed to improve the water management in the different water systems the improvement of sustainability involved with this use should be considered in these networks and it focuses on the reduction of the consumption energy as well as the reduction of leakages both variables have a great influence on the rest of economical technical and environmental indicators of network behavior becoming key in their improvement in this line the research develops a methodology which includes the estimation of the leakages in the different junctions and pipes as a function of the injected and registered volume data in the water the present methodology proposes different operation scenarios according to leakages and it develops a double optimization procedure to locate and select the best recovery machines considering different objective functions the methodology is applied to a real case study which has serial data of water registered volume since 2001 the research shows the leakages influence in the operation points as well as the recovered energy different sustainable indicators are analysed for the different scenarios according to optimized procedures the irlgp index was defined as the ratio between reduction of the leakage volume for each installed power and it reached the annual value of 11 280 8 m3 kw the optimized procedure establishes the significance to consider the leakages when the hydraulic machines are selected their best efficiency points increase to 195 and 205 compared to the ideal scenario without leakages keywords leakages water irrigation networks system sustainability micro hydropower energy recovery 1 introduction hydroelectric micro energy can be a valuable answer to the

extensive information on the historical development methods selection criteria and the results of the installation of pats in water distribution networks as an energy recovery system bonthuys et al 2020 developed an efficient optimization process for energy recovery and reduction of water leaks the procedure proved to be more cost effective and realistic compared to others proposed in the literature a nonlinear programming nlp algorithm for the optimal setting of pats within wdns was extended to the case of leakage reduction cimorelli et al 2020 a multi objective optimization methodology is presented to minimize leakage and minimize the difference between pumping operating costs and revenues generated through energy recovery by strategically locating pats in the network which can act analogously to conventional prvs tricarico et al 2014 morani et al 2020 established a study to define the optimal location of a pat within a distribution network in order to minimize installation costs and maximize the production of energy and water savings moazeni and khazaei 2021 developed two mixed integer nonlinear programming models to find the optimal number and location of pats and to minimize the cost of power generation in water and power systems the results showed that it is feasible to replace prv by pats the installation of three pats generates a total power of 479 65 kw which is more than 30 of the daily electricity demand of the water network traditionally pressure management was developed by using pressure reduction valves which allow the reduction of leaks but dissipate excess energy lima et al 2017 compared the use of pats versus prvs indicating that it is possible by installing pats to recover up to 169 360 kwh year as well as reducing leaks these leakages decrease increasing the volumetric performance of the system from 0 73 to 0 9 lima et al 2017 proposed a method that replaces a prv with a pat to produce electrical energy and reduce pressure this method was improved by adding variable speed pumps to control the dynamic operation of networks in order to improve energy recovery and reduce leakage lima et al 2018 this solution enables the recovery above 40 of the gross power potential of an existing prv could be converted to electrical energy using a pat while also controlling pressure lydon et al 2017 to increase this recovery other

bonthuys et al 2019 conducted an analysis within the polokwane central district metered area in which it identified a recoverable energy potential of 2 3 gwh resulting in a 3 3 and 4 2 annual reduction in water leakage patelis et al 2017 studied the energy recovery in kozani greece the possibility of installing 7 pats in different districts of the city with flow rates ranging between 14 l s and 79 l s and pressures between 55 and 71 m w c was evaluated using this hypothesis annual energy recovery of 328500 kwh possible decreasing the leakages between 18 and 65 nguyen et al 2020 evaluated a water system that operates with a flow rate of 350 l s and a pressure of 45 m w c the installation of pats under these operating conditions enables the annual generation of 714670 kwh and the leakages decrease of 3 this reduction saved 248 504 m3 these contributions improved the different sustainability indicators they can help to analyze the management of the water systems sustainability indicators are necessary to determine the efficiency of a system concerning criteria such as i annual energy consumption and cost for each cubic meter of water injected into the network ii the percentage of energy recoverable in the network by energy excesses and iii the reduction of energy consumption for each cubic meter of water leaked the recommended indicators that are analyzed in the water distribution networks are shown in table 1 several sustainability indicators for pressurized water systems were proposed by mejía et al 2012 rosado et al 2020 developed a proposal for a recovery system based on the installation of pats in different points it enables the annual theoretical generation of 847 301 kwh in this case study some results of the sustainability indicators mentioned in table 2 are shown macias ávila et al 2021 defined some results of the sustainability indicators iaae ier erp iefw and irlgp are shown for 10 water distribution networks in which there are installed pats recovery systems in these studies the annual energy consumption in the analyzed distribution networks ranges from 141 794 to 1583 106 kwh the annual energy recovery varies from 28 470 to 714 670 kwh and the energy recovery values were found between 3 and 58 telci and aral 2018 demonstrated the economic and environmental impacts when energy recovery systems are installed in water distribution networks in which the savings can support the electricity use of more than 20 average american households corresponding to an annual reduction of 177 tons of co2 emissions the indicators depend on the network topology and therefore there are different between them it implies one indicator cannot be adapted exclusively sustainable development goals sdgs acknowledge the inter linkages between human wellbeing economic prosperity and a healthy environment and hence they are associated with a wide range of topical issues that include the securities of water energy and food resources poverty eradication economic development climate change health among others mabhaudhi et al 2021 the implementation of pats in water distribution systems is related to objective 9 kynčlová et al 2020

allowing the generation of electricity in a renewable affordable reliable and modern way as indicated by goal 7 nhamo et al 2019 affordable and clean energy and reducing environmental indices emissions contributing to the objective 13 bruce et al 2018 of the sdg this research aims to establish a methodology which optimizes the location and selection of the machine considering the influence of the leakages in the selection of the machine as well as its influence on the location when leaks are considered the novelty focuses on the characterization of the operation points for different leakages values as well as the double application of the simulated annealing to optimize the location as well as the selection of the recovery systems to develop the study the methodology proposes an internal iterative procedure which allows the estimation of the leakages in each line and consumption point according to measured volume data i e injected and registered by the water managers the methodology was applied to the real irrigation network it is located on the township called vallada in the province of valencia spain 2 methodology the proposed optimization procedure is divided into six different phases in which each one contains different steps fig 1 the model needs different inputs to develop the optimization procedure and there are two simulated annealing procedures includes in this methodology these optimization procedures are applied on localization of the recovery systems in the different ones and define the best machine and its regulation control 2 1 optimization stages fig 1 shows the proposed methodology which is divided into five different stages network model i leakages calibration ii energy balance iii location optimization iv selection optimization v and definition of the best solution vi 2 1 1 network model the first stage is a preliminary phase in which the network model is developed according to the available information this should define both the topology of the water systems as well as the demand base and the consumption patterns the model is simulated to check the flow and pressure in all lines and nodes when the model is correct the model is ready to be calibrated considering leaks the model uses the calibrated methodology which estimates the flow over time considering the consumed volume in the irrigation points as well as the irrigation needs and consumption trends of the farmers pérez sánchez et al 2016 2017 2 1 2 leakages calibration the second step proposes a calibration strategy to consider the leakages in the water systems the method is applied when the water managers have information on the water meters of the consumption therefore the proposed method establishes a balance of the water volumes the first step is the development of the implemented volume analysis establishing the following continuity balance step ii a 1 v i v m v l where v i is the injected volume in the network in m3 v m is the total measured volume by water meters in the consumption nodes in m3 and v l is the total leakages volume in the water system in m3 if this data volume is known the different volume performance of the network can be defined according to the following equations 2 η l v l v i 3 η m v m v i where η l is the leakage performance of the water system and η m is the measured volume performance of the water system the leaks can be divided into two types which are called apparent and real losses almandoz et al 2005 in which the real leakages are assigned in the distribution lines while the apparent losses are assigned to the irrigation consumption points these leakages enable the definition of the following ratio 4 η al v al v l 5 η rl v rl v l where η al is the ratio between apparent leakages and total leakages v al is the total volume of the apparent losses in m3 η rl is the ratio between real leakages and total leakages v rl is the total volume of the real losses in m3 the apparent losses are the uncontrolled leakeages in the water systems which cannot be measured almandoz et al 2005 the calibration model distributes the leakages once the performances i e η al η rl and η l are known this distribution establishes the different criteria as a function of the leakage type step ii b the model determines the different emitter coefficients assigned to the lines and consumption points in different iterations minimizing the error between simulated leakage volume and leakage volume of the water system the model considers the following equation to evaluate the leakage in each element i e line or tap 5 q l ij k j p ij n where q l ij is the leakage flow for the element j i e line or consumption point at the time i p ij is the pressure in the element j at the time i if the element is a line the chosen pressure is the average pressure value of the line p ij p ij n is the leakage exponent and k j is the global emitter coefficient using eq 5 the leakage volume is estimated by the following expression 6 v l j i 1 i t q l ij δ t i 1 i t k j p ij n δ t where t is the interval time in s v l j is the leakage volume for the element in m3 assuming the k j is constant in all annual simulations it is defined by the following expression through iterative procedure 7 k j v l j i 1 i t p ij n δ t the definition of the calibration of the leakages is based on the estimation of the parameter k j assuming that the total leakage volume is distributed between all elements of the network it assumed the leakage volume of each element i e line or tap will be proportional to some variables which are related to network characteristics in this case the leakage volume of each element v l j can be determined by the following expression 8 v l j δ j v l δ j η l v i where δ j is the distributed coefficient assigned to each element of the network the addition of all distributed coefficients is equal to 1 δ j is estimated by the following expressions which difference if δ j is for a line eq 9 or consumption point eq 10 9 δ j l j τ j j 1 j k l j τ j where l j is the length of the line j in m τ j is the weighted coefficient which is novel concerning other published researches k is the number of lines of the model it depends on the material of the line k is the number of pipes eq 10 establishes the proposed expression to estimate the distributed coefficient which weighs the apparent losses in the consumption points in this case the distribution coefficient is based on the ratio between consumed volume in the consumption point and total consumed volume 10 δ j v t j j 1 j m v t j where v t j is the total consumed volume of the irrigation points j including both measured invoiced for irrigation as well as the leakage volume no invoiced m is the number of consumption points of the model the iterations to assign the different distributed coefficients finalizes when the error is minimized in this distribution when this error is minimum compared between simulated and measured volume the model is ready to be used in the optimization procedure step ii d when the water managers do not know the leakage performance the proposed methodology develops a preliminary analysis of leaks step ii c step ii b develops a series of simulations to obtain ranges of values and define the scenarios correctly the model supposes the calculus of the real leakages in the lines it enables the estimation of the real leakage performance η rl and establish the n exponent in this hypothesis the leaked volume is not known and the methodology assigned different leakage parameters to the lines following the alignment of the other published researches germanopoulos 1985 giustolisi et al 2008 the following expression is used 11 q l ij β j l j p ij n where β j is the leakage coefficient which characterizes the pipe in terms of age diameter material thickness among others in this case the model does not need to iterate since the used emitter coefficient in epanet is 12 k j β j l j β j varied between 10 4 and 10 7 as a function of the material cement steel or pvc maskit and ostfeld 2014 it grows over time and this increase depends on the material different scenarios are defined in this case which weighted the β j value besides n exponent is defined in the calibration model estimating the value through of normalized valued which oscillates between 0 5 and 1 5 according to published researches maskit and ostfeld 2014 step ii b enables the estimation of the η rl and n exponent 2 1 3 energy balance once phases i and ii occour the energy balance can be established to know the energy audit and therefore the available operational points in each line and consumption point this energy balance is crucial since it should consider the minimum hydraulic

available operation points are known when the energy balance is developed input 6 the objectives functions input 7 are defined to develop the first optimization procedure the proposed objective functions are i theoretical recovered energy ψ 1 e tr which establishes the maximization of the theoretical recovered energy in the system ii reduction of the leakages in the network ψ 2 v l and iii net present value npv represents the cumulative sum of all revenues minus all costs expected over the life of the project input 6 and input 7 enable the development of step iv a this step establishes an ordered list of the elements according to each objective function once the ordered list is established the procedure is ahead to step iv b the optimization procedure is based on simulated annealing defined by pérez sánchez et al 2018 the installation of different recovery systems provides a significant number of possible combinations in this situation the simulated annealing method is particularly suitable since it satisfies the basic requirements for its application dougherty and marryott 1991 these requirements are i clear configuration of the decision variables ii definition of the target variables iii procedure for generating new system configurations iv control parameters and analogous cooling scheme and v algorithm completion criteria in this case the algorithm searches for the best locations for the recovery systems based on the defined objective functions as well as the number of established recovery systems the optimization process maximizes the established objective functions this process is shown in steps iv b and iv c once the objective function to be considered is selected generating a list in descending order of the elements that enter the optimization according to the energy balances performed and the chosen objective function the control parameters of the algorithm are defined and they are the initial temperature t i the final temperature t f cooling ratio α and number of transitions for each temperature step l 0 these parameters can be set by a previous sensitivity analysis the transition temperature t t is calculated according to a geometrical relation according to 20 t t α t t 1 when the control parameters are defined the maximum number of recovery systems n should be determined the range of this parameter is between 2 and the maximum number of elements i e lines and nodes of the water system in the initial step of the procedure step iv b the initial configuration should be considered this configuration begins by considering two recovery systems m in the two first elements of the list hereafter the simulated procedure steps iv c develops a new combination between different elements for each value of the m recovery system when the optimization process finishes the methodology establishes the best location for this value of m step iv d if the m value is lower than n then the procedure comes back from step iv b in which the new configuration for the m 1 recovery system is developed the final result of this stage step iv e is the knowledge of the optimum configuration for the n recovery system output 5 this output is input 9 which is used in step v 2 1 5 selection optimization of the machines the main goal of this stage is the definition of the most suitable machine or machines it implies the selection of the machine the definition of the maximum number of machines in each recovery system if needed and the best strategy to regulate according to the chosen objective variables these inputs are previously defined and the methodology used a database that used 110 different pats the machines are defined according to specific speed n st head number and discharge number these values allow the definition of the dimensionless parameters of the machines included in the database to define the machine the dimensionless best efficiency point bep is used through the 110 tested machines it considers different values of impeller diameter and rotational speed both values enable the definition of the generated best efficiency point of the theoretical machine when the bep is known the characteristic curves are defined by the methodology proposed by pérez sánchez et al 2020b once the characteristic curve is estimated the variable operation strategy zone is defined the machine operates under variable rotational speed and the best efficiency head beh best power head bph and best power flow bpf is estimated this prediction of the variation of the rotational speed is developed according to the proposed methodology by ávila et al 2021 considering these curves the algorithm developed the optimization by iterations using different regulation strategies rs these strategies can be i nominal rotational speed nr ii beh iii bph iv bpf and v operational area considering the maximum and minimum recoverable head the use of an optimization procedure is necessary because there are different variables i the possibility to use a different number of machines which can be installed in serial or parallel in the same recovery system ii different regulation strategies iii and different possible number of recovery systems installed in the network it implies a high number of combinations in this case the methodology proposes the use of the simulated annealing again the initial step of this stage v a includes the definition of the problem which indicates the number of recovery systems and their location in the water network as a function of the objective function input 9 which is the result of the previous optimization procedure step iv besides the water managers should be defined the different regulation strategies defined the inputs the procedure continues to step v b in which the definition of the initial configuration is established in each recovery system an ordered list of the possible machines is developed according to the objective function establishing the initial operation rules when the machine is chosen an iterative procedure analyses whether there are other operation rules which will be better to improve the objective function finally step v b the best machine and operation rules getting the initial configuration which is used in the following step v c step v b repeated the procedure for each recovery system step v c includes the definition of the control parameters which are defined similarly to stage iv a new configuration of the operation is developed in each iteration in which a recovery system is chosen randomly and another machine is checked in that recovery system the beginning probability of the machine is proportional to the value of the objective function keeping the ordered list the beginning probability of the upstream recovery systems is greater than downstream systems in the first iterations this probability decreases when the calculus procedure advances once the machine and strategy are optimized the procedure continues to step v d in which the energy and feasibility analysis is developed developing iterations to reach the best solution in the combination of the n located recovery machines the used database and the regulation strategy as well as considering the chosen scenario the feasibility analysis is developed considering the recovered energy e tr reduction of the

operation of the recovery systems carravetta et al 2014b garcía et al 2019 the annual costs ac refer to the annual operating costs of the recovery systems over the life of the system giudicianni et al 2020 the annual incomes ai refer to the annual incomes generated by the facility through the sale of energy or self consumption benefits the incomes also consider the reduction of leakages and therefore the benefit for the water saving in addition they may include other types of benefits due to reduced leakage and reduced co2 emissions the residual income ri is a concept that takes into account the possible income from the sale of the different elements once their function in the facility has ended 2 1 6 best solution the final step is the development of the best solution through an iterative procedure in which the different sustainable indicators are analysed to consider the best recovery system these indicators are shown in table 1 and the optimization procedure calculates them in each iterative procedure of the selection of the machine 2 2 materials and case study the proposed methodology was applied using a database of a total number of 110 pumps working as turbines the dimensionless best efficiency point characteristic of the machine and rotational speed is shown in rosado et al 2020 using this database which classifies the recovery systems considering their specific speed 7826 synthetic machines are generated through turbine generators published by pérez sánchez et al 2018 when the simulated annealing is applied a previous selection is developed considering the available operational points in this line this first selection enables the decrease of computational times and an improvement of the final selected machine the research applies the proposed methodology to a real water system the case study is located on vallada spain and it is an irrigation pressurized system which was built in 2001 the network supplies around 230 ha the crop is citric tree mainly and the water resources are got from a well which is pumped to a reservoir the pipelines of the network are built on asbestos cement pipes 10 780 m and polyvinyl chloride 11015 m the diameter oscillated between 90 and 450 mm and the total length of the main pipes and branches is around 22 km there are 222 irrigation consumption points the base demand was assigned considering the different farms facilities the adopted plantation frame was 4 6 squared meter plantation frame and the flow rate of the dripper used was 4 l h applying the irrigation needs of the citric tree for each fig 2 table 3 shows the recorded data of the water consumption injected to the grid and measured as well as the leakages of the system from 2001 to 2020 the present research proposes the establishment of four different scenarios to group the years in similar ranges of leakages these scenarios are s0 from 2001 to 2005 s1 from 2006 to 2010 s2 from 2011 to 2015 s3 from 2016 to 2020 s0 is considered the ideal situation which has no leakages s1 considers an average of leakages of 4 98 therefore it considers a total leakage performance equal to 5 s2 has an average of leakages of the 13 75 this scenario was approached to 15 finally s3 approaches the leakages at 25 since the real data operated between 2016 and 2020 the average leakages was 22 61 the serial data shows the lack of maintenance in the network and therefore the increase of the potential leaks in the system epanet toolkit rossman 2000 was used fot the modeling with consumption patterns which were applied in each irrigation point were defined considering both consumed volume as well as the irrigation area of each tap and defining the base demand of the irrigation point according to irrigation needs of the crop the model calibration was developed establishing different leakages scenarios these scenarios were considering the previous scenario in table 3 they consider leakages equal to 0 s0 5 s1 15 s2 25 s3 35 s4 and 50 s5 s4 and s5 are future scenarios considering the water managers will not be maintained and the leakages increase according to the observed trend between 2001 and 2020 s4 and s5 are hypothetical and they showed the trend of the systems if the water managers will not apply corrective actions to improve the water systems and reduce the leakages s4 and s5 are included to analyse the influence of the leakages in the recovery energy and the selection of the hydraulic systems 3 results once the model is developed used epanet toolkit step i the methodology established a preliminary leakages model step ii c it defines the real and apparent leakages performance since there is not this information registered by the water managers this analysis enabled the estimation of the real and apparent losses it enables the assignment of the exponent n both lines and irrigation consumption points considering the scenario step ii b as a function of the registered volume data and total leakages performances step ii a table 3 the η r and η a values are defined through an iterative procedure in which the methodology analyse different values of n and compare with the real losses in step ii c these n values were obtained to adjust the leakages volume in each scenario by an iterative procedure in which the n and β are calibrated to minimize the error between registered data and simulated values table 4 shows the calibration values which were obtained for this case study fig 3a shows the different values of the energies balance in taps as a function of the analysed scenario previously to analyse the optimization procedure the figure shows the annual total energy values for friction theoretical recoverable and required energy all energy values were considered and there is no direct relationship between different values since the theoretical recoverable energy required energy as well as friction energy depending on topology and characteristic of the network i e length the diameter of pipes level of the consumption points level of nodes and head of the reservoir among others the annual friction energy oscillates between 10 255 and 13 426 kwh this increase is trivial since when the flow increases the friction losses increase on squared growth in this case the annual friction energy increased 4 1 in the most unfavorable scenario s5 compared to the ideal situation s0 the annual required energy which is necessary to satisfy the minimum pressure requirements is also increased to compensate for the flow and friction losses it oscillated between 78 968 and 94 716 kwh for the s0 and s5 respectively this increase represented around 20 compared to s0 ideal scenario without leakages finally the annual theoretical recoverable energy which is available to be recovered partially when the recovery system is installed and their efficiency is considered was between 152 906 and 182 264 kwh for s0 and s5 respectively the annual energy recoverable also increased 26 2 when s5 is analysed fig 3b shows the analysis of the percentage of leakages reduction as a function of the number of recovery machines installed these results were obtained when the objective function was the reduction of the leakages it is observed the reduction oscillated between 0 15 and 0 37 when the number of recovery machines changed between 1 and 10 respectively the figure shows not much difference in the reduction of the leakages when the different scenarios are considered when simulations are extended increasing the number of recovery machines the maximum decrease of leakages was 0 41 for s1 0 44 for s2 and s3 and 0 43 for s4 and s5 the hypothetical number of recovery systems was 204 for these results the optimization procedure was developed for the three objective functions i e theoretical recoverable reduction of leakages and net present values table 5 shows the different results when these functions were optimized the optimization procedure considered the following combinations 204 when n was 1 20 706 for n equal to 2 1394 204 when n was 3 70 058 751 when n was 5 the possible combinations were 2802 350 040 9 2945 1010 for n equal to 6 2 6291012 when n was 7 6 4739 1013 for n equal to 8 1 40991015 for n equal to 9 and 2 7493 1016 the iterations oscillated between 140 and 2640 depending of the combinations and the simulated parameters for the optimization of the locations were initial temperature was 10 final temperature was 0 001 the cooling rate was 0 9 and the transition change was 10 these parameters were defined previously through sensitive analysis the simulated parameters were changed when the optimization of the selection was applied the following parameters were used initial temperature was 10 final temperature was 0 001 the cooling rate was 0 5 and the transition change was 10 table 5 shows that the use of three number of recovery systems n allows the potential recovery of around 0 8 of the available energy in all scenarios in which the theoretical recoverable energy increases proportionally with the leakages values if the objective function is the reduction of the leakages the reduction range oscillates between 0 37 and 0 66 when the n varies between 1 and 3 the leakages decrease is around 0 8 when the procedure is optimized using ten recovery systems although this solution is not feasible if the npv values are analysed finally when the npv function is analysed it shows feasibility between s1 and s5 although this feasibility reduces according to n and it increases when there is a high percentage de leakages in the network since the circulating flow is higher besides the npv function considers both recovered energy as well as the reduction of the leakages for the decrease of the pressure when pats operate in the network the installations of pat systems enable the reduction of the leakages and therefore there is a benefit by the cost of the water that does not leak due to recovery systems therefore the third function considers economic energy and technical indicators to locate the recovery systems in the network the optimization procedure enables the preselection of the machine according to theoretical operational points to develop the second procedure of the optimization step v in this case the machine is chosen to optimize its operating in terms of flow head and efficiency the procedure chooses the best machine for each scenario in one of the defined lines which were established by the location optimization procedure the model develops an iterative procedure to define the best regulation strategy rs to evaluate the recovered energy reduction of leakages and npv values the recovery never reaches 100 of the theoretical recoverable energy because the efficiency of the recovery systems is less than 1 since this study did not consider ideal machines fig 4 shows the influence map in which the selection optimization operates to locate the best machine the color gradient shows the ratio between the variable value and the maximum value therefore the red areas are the best to improve the variable objective fig 4a and b show the results for line 2004 of the network when the recovered energy is maximized in both s1 and s5 all figures show a black cross which indicates the selected machine in each case the selected machines are different showing the regulation strategy specific speed rotational speed of the machine as well as the best efficiency point of the machine this variability of the machine shows the importance of considering the leakages when the recovery systems want to be chosen for example when the s1 is analysed the best efficiency point of the machine is 24 4 l s and 14 21 m w c if s5 is analysed the best efficiency point of the machine increases 195 and 205 particularly 47 7 l s and 30 64 m w c respectively fig 4c and d show the optimized solution to select the best machine both s1 and s5 when the optimized variable is the leakages reduction similar results were obtained in the selection where the bep of the machine varied from 9 27 to 18 65 l s the head in the bep changed from 53 to 35 m w c the regulation strategy rs established on s1 it was nr while the s2 operated under bph fig 4e and f defined the best machine when the npv value was optimized in both scenarios shown s1 and s5 the best regulation strategy was nr in s1 the best efficiency point was 24 42 l s and 19 61 m w c while it increases for s5 in this case the bep was 37 71 l s and 33 94 m w c in addition the analysis of each scenario as well as of each combination of installed recovery systems n allows to know the recovered energy the reduction of leaks as well as the npv analysis as a function of the number of machines installed in each recovery system nm and their characterization of them using specific speed nst impeller diameter d rotational speed n and best efficiency point table 6 shows an example of the information selection obtained in the optimized procedure when the s2 was analysed under the hypothesis of the npv function the table shows annual recoverable energy values above 32 000 kwh and annual leakages decrease above 18 000 m3 in some configurations with different recovery systems n the inclusion of the pats in water systems is developed to improve the sustainability indicators fig 5 shows the influence of the pats in the improvement of these indicators defined in table 1 depending on the scenario analysed fig 5a shows four indexes ied showed values between 0 042 and 0 046 increasing in the s5 mainly iec decreased 40 between s0 and s5 it shows the decrease of unit cost when pats are used in the irrigation system iefw and iaefw showed similar trends with decreases equal to 40 1 and 45 4 ier showed annual values between 29 010 and 57 543 kwh fig 5b another index which is related to ier is the irlgp this index shows the reduction of leaks in the system considered the installed recovery power if irlgp is observed in fig 5b the zero value is defined for the ideal situation s0 the rest values for the different scenarios were 265 3 s1 1207 6 s2 7584 5 s3 7584 6 s4 and 11 280 8 s5 m3 kw this index is too significant since it shows the influence of leakage reduction when recovery systems are installed and therefore it demonstrates the advantage of incorporating micro hydropower systems in the network related to environmental indexes cdrpe and cdrbl were applied considering the conversion parameter from kwh to kgco2 reduction in this case the research considered the value 0 49 kg kwh defined by marchis et al 2016 cdrpe showed the same trend of erp and cdrbl decreased from 4 38 to 0 24 kgco2 emissions for each cubic meter of water saved by leakages 4 conclusions the present research represents a new step forward in improving the sustainability of irrigation systems the new optimized procedure was developed in which three novelties were introduced a double simulated annealing procedure was introduced to determine the location of the recovery system considering three different objective functions and the selection of the best machine as well as the best regulation strategy the regulation strategy considered the operation of the machines in different work modes between them the recovery systems can operate under beh bpf and bph using the modified affinity laws the methodology uses a database in which there are 7826 pats which were defined using the dimensionless numbers generated by 110 tested machines the second novelty shown in this research is the need to consider evaluate and estimate the leaks in the network to carry out a correct selection of the machines in the different recovery systems leaks can cause significant variations of the best efficiency point to choose the machine mainly in terms of flow the particular case study in which the methodology was applied showed a variation around 200 in terms of flow and head related to the best efficiency point of the machine these values show the significance of the leakages consideration in the new future energy balances there are no published studies that consider the variation of the operating points of the machines besides tool is presented that combines all aspects of analysis within the water distribution systems that affect the efficiency of the system developing a novel methodology applicable to any type of network as a third novelty the research allows the characterization of the sustainability indicators in the selection of the machines and therefore includes the analysis of the sustainability indicators in each iteration besides the methodology operates with different scenarios in which different leakages values could be considered as a function of the serial data and future scenarios the methodology enables the fit of the calibrated leakages model the applicability enables the use of this tool by water managers improving the efficiency of the water systems the leakages management as well as the use of renewable energies system will open new research trends which are focused on reach new targets of the sustainable development goals inside of the water systems finally the proposal was applied to a real irrigation system the calibration model was developed considering serial data of twenty years in which five different scenarios were developed defining different leakages levels in one of them the application of the methodology shows the great influence of the leakages reduction when the recovery systems were installed in the water networks the annual recoverable energy values above 32 000 kwh and annual leakages decrease above 18 000 m3 in the best configurations using three recovery systems which are configurated with three pat each one the irlgp index was defined as the ratio between reduction of the leakage volume for each installed power and it reached the annual value of 11 280 8 m3 kw and cdrbl decreased from 4 38 to 0 24 kgco2 emissions for each cubic meter of water saved by leakages future works should be focused on apply the measurement of sustainable indicators to the different supply systems and develop new

9879,drip fertigation is beneficial to improve crop grain yield gy water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue but it is not clear whether drip fertigation can improve economic benefit and how much water and nitrogen should be applied for wheat maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone regions a two year 2018 2020 winter wheat summer maize rotation field experiment including twelve drip fertigation treatments complete combination design of three irrigation rf rain fed di deficit irrigation 75 etc and fi full irrigation 100 etc and four nitrogen levels n0 no nitrogen n1 85 kg ha 1 for wheat and 90 kg ha 1 for maize n2 170 kg ha 1 for wheat and 150 kg ha 1 for maize and n3 255 kg ha 1 for wheat and 210 kg ha 1 for maize and a conventional practice con was conducted to explore the response of gy nue wp and net income to different water and nitrogen levels in the guanzhong plain of china the results showed that water and nitrogen application levels had significant effects on gy nue wp and net income of winter wheat and summer maize for winter wheat din2 the combination of irrigation and nitrogen achieved the highest gy 9 2 t ha 1 two year average wp 2 11 kg m 3 and net income 11 839 cny ha 1 for summer maize the highest gy 11 1 t ha 1 wp 2 32 kg m 3 and net income 14 859 cny ha 1 were observed at din3 rfn3 and din2 respectively for winter wheat summer maize rotation system the highest gy 20 2 t ha 1 winter wheat summer maize two year average and net income 26 698 cny ha 1 were observed at din2 and the highest wp of 2 15 kg m 3 was obtained at rfn3 but had insignificant difference with din2 2 13 kg m 3 p 0 05 therefore deficit irrigation coupled with 320 kg n ha 1 170 kg ha 1 for wheat 150 kg ha 1 for maize was considered as the best drip fertigation strategy for achieving high gy wp and net income in winter wheat summer maize rotation system moreover the response surface methodology was used to determine the optimal water consumption and nitrogen application rate based on binary quadratic regression analysis the results showed that the gy and net income can synchronously achieve 95 100 maximum values when the water consumption ranged from 434 to 496 mm and 458 500 mm and the nitrogen application rate ranged from 165 to 211 kg ha 1 and 187 250 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively keywords drip fertigation deficit irrigation nitrogen use efficiency net income response surface methodology 1 introduction the winter wheat summer maize rotation is the primary agricultural production system extensively planted in the central and northern china yang et al 2014 this rotation system can make full use of resources such as light heat and arable land which is of great significance to ensure national food security li et al 2020 the winter wheat summer maize rotation system produced approximately 30 of the national maize and 45 of the national wheat zhang et al 2021 accounting for 25 total national food production of china yang et al 2014 however the shortage of water resources and the low use efficiency of water and fertilizer caused by unreasonable irrigation and excessive nitrogen application have restricted the sustainable development of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china kang et al 2017 ju et al 2006 ju et al 2009 the guanzhong plain is one of the main planting areas of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china the annual precipitation in this region ranges from 350 mm to 900 mm but the water requirement of winter wheat summer maize rotation system is about 900 mm liu et al 2002 therefore annual precipitation cannot meet the water demand of winter wheat and summer maize with a considerable gap of about 200 550 mm and the large inter annual and seasonal variation of precipitation the water requirement of winter wheat is 450 500 mm liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2002 but the average precipitation in winter wheat growing season is approximately 30 of the annual precipitation yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2003 only 25 40 of the water demand si et al 2020 previous research reported that more than 60 of precipitation falls in the summer maize growing season which could basically meet the water requirement of summer maize 423 mm reported by liu et al 2002 but the seasonal droughts are prone to occur because of the uneven precipitation distribution during the growth period of summer maize for example shen et al 2020 reported that the yield loss of summer maize caused by drought in the guanzhong plain was around 0 40 during 1970 2015 sometimes even up to 80 therefore a reasonable irrigation scheduling is essential to increase the annual yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the guanzhong plain fertilizer is another important factor that affects the growth of winter wheat and summer maize which provide the necessary nutrients for crop growth the contribution of nitrogen fertilizer to grain yield increases even reached 30 50 erisman et al 2008 previous studies have reported that the annual nitrogen fertilizer demand for winter wheat summer maize rotation is totally about 330 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2015 while the actual application rate of nitrogen was about totally 550 600 kg ha 1 in this region for these two crops zhang et al 2006 zhao et al 2006 which is far beyond the nitrogen demand of winter wheat and summer maize excessive nitrogen application not only increase the risk of environmental pollution such as nitrate leaching n2o and no emissions zhang et al 2019 wei et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 but also reduce nitrogen use efficiency gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 a number of studies have investigated the optimal nitrogen application rate of winter wheat summer maize or winter wheat summer maize rotation system for instance ru et al 2015 reported that nitrogen application rate for winter wheat and summer maize should be in the range of 250 300 kg ha 1 and 150 200 kg ha 1 respectively yang et al 2017 suggested that the appropriate nitrogen fertilizer rate for winter wheat and summer maize in the guanzhong plain were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively jia et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 reported that there were insignificant yield losses for winter wheat with 210 kg n ha 1 and for summer maize with 180 kg n ha 1 compared to traditional nitrogen application 270 kg ha 1 in the annual fertilizer management 28 of nitrogen reduction can synchronously achieve high grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency jia et al 2011 yang et al 2011 xu et al 2020 reported that the appropriate n application rates in guanzhong plain were 140 kg n ha 1 for maize with irrigation 90 mm at the seedling stage in wet and normal years and two irrigations at the seedling and jointing stages in dry years and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat coupled with two three and four irrigations applied in wet normal and dry years respectively however previous studies were carried out under the conventional nitrogen application condition broadcast an irrigation amount of 90 mm may cause leaching losses of nitrate nitrogen yang et al 2015 lu et al 2021a in addition the absorption of nitrogen by crop is affected by water supply an appropriate water and nitrogen management can significantly improve nitrogen uptake and grain yield while controlled the nitrate leaching depth and amount gheysari et al 2009 sui et al 2018 therefore the suitable nitrogen application amount is largely influenced by the distribution and amount of precipitation and irrigation during crop growth season drip fertigation an advanced water and fertilizer management technology can timely and accurately supply water and nitrogen to root zone match the distribution of water nutrients and crop roots yan et al 2021 li et al 2018 and thus promote the absorption of water and nutrients by crop jha et al 2017 previous research have reported that drip fertigation can maximize the coupling effect of water and fertilizer and achieve high crop yield and water and fertilizer use efficiencies yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore the optimal water and nitrogen application amount under drip fertigation condition are likely different from under traditional water and nitrogen management although drip fertigation could increase grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income previous studies mainly focused on economic crops wang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and staple crops in arid and semi arid regions yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 few studies were conducted on staple crops in semi humid and drought prone region due to the higher economic inputs especially for winter wheat summer maize rotation system no tillage sowing of summer maize realizes the annual use of drip fertigation system one drip line can continuously serve winter wheat and summer maize in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system which significantly reduced the input cost therefore more efforts are needed to comprehensively investigate the effects of drip fertigation on the grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone region the objective of this study was to 1 evaluate the economic feasibility of drip fertigation in winter wheat summer maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone areas 2 determine optimal water and nitrogen application amount of winter wheat and summer maize under drip fertigation condition in the semi humid and drought prone areas this study will give scientific recommendations to simultaneously maximize grain yield and economic benefit for drip fertigated winter wheat summer maize rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the

922 plants ha 1 row spacing of 60 cm and plant spacing of 23 5 cm the summer maize was planted next to the old drip tapes namely one drip line irrigate one row of summer maize because of prevention in advance no disease or pests occurred during two year growing seasons 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological variables during the experimental periods the meteorological data was recorded by a standard automatic weather station located 30 m from the experiment field including air temperature relative humidity wind speed 2 m solar radiation and precipitation these meteorological variables were used to calculate daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 2 3 2 soil water content soil samples were collected from 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape the soil samples at each location were collected at depth of 0 120 cm with 20 cm increments from each plot at the time of winter wheat and summer maize sowing and harvest the average soil water content of three replicates was used to present the soil water content of each treatment the soil water content was determined by using the gravimetric method 2 3 3 aboveground biomass at maturity three 0 2 m long rows of winter wheat and three representative summer maize were sampled at harvest from each plot the winter wheat was separated into stem leaf glume and grain the summer maize was separated into stem leaf kernel cob and husk each component was placed into an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at 75 c to a constant weight the aboveground biomass was the total oven dried weight of each component 2 3 4 grain yield at the maturity of winter wheat and summer maize three areas of 1 m2 winter wheat and 50 maize plants five groups each group contains 10 consecutive maize plants in the middle of each plot were harvested by hand respectively the grains were then manually removed from the spikes or cobs the dry grain was weighed and grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize was calculated on 13 and 14 moisture content respectively li et al 2021 mansouri far et al 2010 2 4 data calculations 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated according to the reference of fernández et al 2020 pereira et al 2012 and kijne et al 2003 as follows w p g y e t where gy is grain yield kg ha 1 et is actual crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 the actual crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to the soil water balance equation et p i sw r d where p and i are precipitation and irrigation amounts mm respectively sw is the difference of water stored in the soil between at the beginning and the end of the considered period r and d are the water runoff and deep drainage respectively since each plot was very flat and surrounded by ridges the r was ignored the d also was considered to be the zero because the soil has a good water holding capacity and there was a slight amount of precipitation or irrigation over the field capacity 2 4 2 nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as follows n u e g y t g y 0 n where g y t is grain yield kg ha 1 with irrigation and nitrogen treatments g y 0 is grain yield kg ha 1 of rain fed combined no nitrogen application treatment n is the amount of nitrogen applied as fertilizer kg ha 1 2 4 3 economic analysis the cost of main equipment including main pipeline fertilizer pump and others of field drip fertigation system was 3 750 cny ha 1 and the economic life was 3 years 6 seasons the cost of drip tape was 2 500 cny ha 1 with an economic life of one year therefore the total cost of drip fertigation system was 1 875 3750 6 2500 2 cny ha 1 per season the cost of mechanical energy for rotary tillage planting and harvesting of winter wheat were 1 000 cny ha 1 800 cny ha 1 and 800 cny ha 1 respectively in summer maize season the cost of mechanical energy were mainly from sowing of 800 cny ha 1 and harvesting of 1 000 cny ha 1 including threshing because we used the no till practice therefore the cost of mechanical energy for winter wheat and summer maize were 2 600 cny ha 1 and 1 800 cny ha 1 respectively the prices of seeds pesticides fertilizers water labor expenditures and sales price of grains are based on market prices the net income was computed by subtracting all the production costs from gross profit uygan et al

21 839 cny ha 1 and 5 904 22 273 cny ha 1 but the net income ranged from 1 306 11 712 cny ha 1 and 2 807 11 966 cny ha 1 which indicated that unreasonable management of irrigation and nitrogen led to the decrease of net income and even loss table 4 the two year average net income of winter wheat of rf di and fi were 3 415 cny ha 1 7 817 cny ha 1 and 7 003 cny ha 1 respectively the net income of di

from 16 675 45 852 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 16 788 44 594 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 the net income ranged from 675 to 27 372 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 788 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 the two year average net income of rf di and fi were 13 288 cny ha 1 18 904 cny ha 1 and 17 186 cny ha 1 respectively indicating that irrigation could significantly increase net income under drip fertigation and di could improve net income of winter wheat summer maize rotation system through increasing grain yield fig 4 and decrease input of irrigation table 4 the two year average net income of rfn3 din3 and fin3 were 19 465 cny ha 1 25 670 cny ha 1 and 24 590 cny ha 1 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system increased by 16 6 53 8 and 47 3 compared with con treatment respectively the treatment of din2 achieved the maximum net income of 27 372 cny ha 1 and 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the two year average net income of din2 was increased by 99 5 38 1 and 59 9 for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation system respectively compared with con treatment 3 4 optimization of water consumption and nitrogen amount based on crop yield and net income the gathered data of 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 was comprehensively analyzed to explore the optimal amount of water consumption and nitrogen application to achieve high yield and high economic benefit in this study water consumption and nitrogen application amount were treated as independent variables and the grain yield and net income were considered as the response variables the binary quadratic regression equation was established using mathenatica 9 0 software based on the least squares method table 5 the water consumption and nitrogen application amount were calculated by binary quadratic regression equation when the grain yield and net income of winter wheat and summer maize respectively reached the maximum values table 5 the fitting results showed that the r2 ranged from 0 926 to 0 942 and all of the p value of regression equations reached highly significant level p 0 01 for winter wheat the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the maximum grain yield 9 6 t ha 1 was 496 mm and 221 kg ha 1 respectively and the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the largest net income 12 153 cny ha 1 was 481 mm and 211 kg ha 1 respectively for summer maize the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the maximum grain yield 11 7 t ha 1 was 502 mm and 259 kg ha 1 respectively and the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the largest net income 15 807 cny ha 1 was 500 mm and 250 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 in the practice it was difficult to obtain the maximum grain yield and net income simultaneously therefore the 95 100 maximum values of the grain yield and net income was set as acceptable interval of high yield and high economic benefit in this study the results showed that the grain yield and net income of winter wheat could reach 95 100 of the maximum values simultaneously with the water consumption of 434 496 mm and the nitrogen application amount of 165 211 kg ha 1 fig 6a and b when water consumption and nitrogen application amount ranged from 458 to 500 mm and 187 250 kg ha 1 summer maize could obtain 95 100 of the maximum grain yield and net income fig 6c and d 4 discussion the purpose of irrigation and fertilization management is to increase crop grain yield reduce the input of water and fertilizer as much as possible on the premise of ensuring high grain yield and finally obtain the maximum economic benefit in this study although 90 mm water was irrigated at jointing stage of summer maize for con treatment fig 2 the two year average grain yield of rfn3 was significantly higher than that of con for summer maize fig 4 the reason may be that split n fertilization provided better adjustment of nitrogen to crop nitrogen demand at various growth stages which enhanced nitrogen uptake efficiency and grain yield li et al 2019 yolcu öner çetin 2015 the similar result also was concluded by wang et al 2016 who reported that split n fertilization significantly increased the crop nitrogen uptake from fertilizers and the 3 splits and 2 splits nitrogen application obtained higher nitrogen recovery efficiency than applying total nitrogen before sowing however the grain yield of winter wheat had insignificant difference between rfn3 and con the reason may be explained by the fact that the restriction of water shortage to grain yield of rfn3 was equal to the improvement of split n fertigation in this study the two year average biomass of winter wheat in di and fi increased by 18 3 and 10 9 fig 3 and the average grain yield increased by 33 8 and 38 6 compared with rf treatment fig 4 respectively this result showed that irrigation could increase the aboveground biomass and grain yield of winter wheat in semi humid and drought prone regions which was consistent with the previous results cetin et al 2015 the similar result also was concluded by song et al 2016 who reported that irrigation at overwintering and jointing stages of winter wheat could significantly prolong the total time of dry matter accumulation increase the dry matter of winter wheat from 10 8 t ha 1 of rain fed treatment to 13 8 t ha 1 of irrigation treatment and the yield of irrigation increase by 6 0 32 7 compared with rain fed treatment our study also conclude that the grain yield of summer maize of di and fi increased by 8 3 and 9 7 compared with rf in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 but only increased by 0 4 and 2 7 in 2019 2020 growing season p 0 05 the reason may be due to the abundant and relatively uniform distributed precipitation occurred in 2019 2020 growing season fig 1 the similar result was also concluded by chen et al 2019 who reported that high grain yield and water productivity can be achieved without irrigation in wet years in the guanzhong plain in this study the average grain yield of di was significantly higher than that of rf but showing insignificant difference with fi fig 4 however yan et al 2021 reported that deficit irrigation 75 etc significantly reduced maize grain yield one of the reasons may be that the crop evapotranspiration in arid areas ningxia of china is higher than that in the semi humid and drought prone regions yangling of china allen et al 1998 another reason may be that clay loam soil in our study has a higher water retention capacity than sandy soil in their study site in addition our experiment was conducted under no tillage conditions and straw residues about 20 cm can significantly inhibit soil evaporation yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2005 in this study the water productivity of con was significantly lower than drip fertigation fig 5 one of the reasons was drip split n significantly increased crops grain yield and realized multi small amount irrigation which significantly increased water productivity jha et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 another reason was that drip irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast avoid irrigation events before precipitation and seasonal droughts shen et al 2020 cao et al 2019 at the same time drip irrigation can reduce evaporation loss and enhance water productivity and grain yield by injecting irrigation water into crop root zone li et al 2018 despite higher investment piping and labour of drip fertigation than traditional irrigation and fertilization practices con our two year average net income of drip fertigation mean value of rfn3 din3 and fin3 was 9 146 cny ha 1 14 096 cny ha 1 and 23 242 cny ha 1 for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation which increased by 54 1 31 0 and 39 2 compared with con fig 4 and table 4 respectively thus the increase of benefit associated with increased grain yield outpaced the investment of drip fertigation in this study the highest net income two year average was 11 839 cny ha 1 14 859 cny ha 1 and 26 698 cny ha 1 obtained at din2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation respectively this can be well explained that din2 treatment improves crops grain yield compared with lower irrigation and nitrogen treatment fig 4 and reduces irrigation and nitrogen inputs compared with higher irrigation and nitrogen treatment fig 2 many researchers have established the relationships between crop yield water productivity net income and irrigation and fertilizer inputs yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in this study the relationships between crop yield net income and water consumption and nitrogen application amount were established our results showed that 95 100 maximum grain yield and net income corresponding the water consumption intervals were 434 496 mm and 458 500 mm and the nitrogen application rates were 165 211 kg ha 1 and 187 250 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively this result was consistent with liu et al 2002 who suggested that the water requirement is about 900 mm for winter wheat summer maize rotation system similar nitrogen application amount also was reported by zhao et al 2015 who reported that 150 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 180 kg n ha 1 for summer maize could obtain more than 18 t ha 1 grain yield in winter wheat summer maize rotation system yang et al 2017 also suggested that the suitable nitrogen application rates for high grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively those results can support our results that 170 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can achieve the higher annual grain yield without significant difference with high nitrogen 255 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and 210 kg ha 1 for summer maize however qiang et al 2019 suggested that the summer maize could achieve maximum grain yield with a nitrogen application rate of 149 kg ha 1 under rain fed conditions this inconsistency with our results may be that drip fertigation significantly improves the crop grain yield which increased the nitrogen demand of crops li et al 2019 compared to the result reported by yang et al 2017 our result increased the ratio 53 of fertilization in winter wheat season the reason was that the precipitation mainly falls in summer maize season and intensively precipitation could increase the risk of nitrate leaching losses yang et al 2015 lu et al 2021 xue et al 2012 reported that 55 of total nitrogen applied in winter wheat and 45 of total nitrogen applied in summer maize obtained the highest grain yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation system resulting in higher nitrogen use efficiency therefore properly increasing nitrogen application amount in winter wheat season and reducing nitrogen in high temperature and rainy summer maize season could reduce the risk of nitrate leaching and increase grain yield 5 conclusion this study showed that the drip nitrogen fertigation under rain fed conditions can achieve crop yield similar to or higher than that of traditional water and nitrogen management con in the sub humid and drought prone regions deficit drip irrigation 75 etc based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast combined with appropriate nitrogen application rate 170 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg ha 1 for summer maize is beneficial to maintain high grain yield and improve crop water productivity and net income the two year average grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income of din2 was increased by 49 9 52 5 185 7 and 99 5 for winter wheat increased by 30 1 41 7 137 8 and 38 1 for summer maize respectively compared with con treatment the response surface methodology can well determine the interval of water consumption and nitrogen application corresponding to higher crop yield and net income this

9879,drip fertigation is beneficial to improve crop grain yield gy water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue but it is not clear whether drip fertigation can improve economic benefit and how much water and nitrogen should be applied for wheat maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone regions a two year 2018 2020 winter wheat summer maize rotation field experiment including twelve drip fertigation treatments complete combination design of three irrigation rf rain fed di deficit irrigation 75 etc and fi full irrigation 100 etc and four nitrogen levels n0 no nitrogen n1 85 kg ha 1 for wheat and 90 kg ha 1 for maize n2 170 kg ha 1 for wheat and 150 kg ha 1 for maize and n3 255 kg ha 1 for wheat and 210 kg ha 1 for maize and a conventional practice con was conducted to explore the response of gy nue wp and net income to different water and nitrogen levels in the guanzhong plain of china the results showed that water and nitrogen application levels had significant effects on gy nue wp and net income of winter wheat and summer maize for winter wheat din2 the combination of irrigation and nitrogen achieved the highest gy 9 2 t ha 1 two year average wp 2 11 kg m 3 and net income 11 839 cny ha 1 for summer maize the highest gy 11 1 t ha 1 wp 2 32 kg m 3 and net income 14 859 cny ha 1 were observed at din3 rfn3 and din2 respectively for winter wheat summer maize rotation system the highest gy 20 2 t ha 1 winter wheat summer maize two year average and net income 26 698 cny ha 1 were observed at din2 and the highest wp of 2 15 kg m 3 was obtained at rfn3 but had insignificant difference with din2 2 13 kg m 3 p 0 05 therefore deficit irrigation coupled with 320 kg n ha 1 170 kg ha 1 for wheat 150 kg ha 1 for maize was considered as the best drip fertigation strategy for achieving high gy wp and net income in winter wheat summer maize rotation system moreover the response surface methodology was used to determine the optimal water consumption and nitrogen application rate based on binary quadratic regression analysis the results showed that the gy and net income can synchronously achieve 95 100 maximum values when the water consumption ranged from 434 to 496 mm and 458 500 mm and the nitrogen application rate ranged from 165 to 211 kg ha 1 and 187 250 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively keywords drip fertigation deficit irrigation nitrogen use efficiency net income response surface methodology 1 introduction the winter wheat summer maize rotation is the primary agricultural production system extensively planted in the central and northern china yang et al 2014 this rotation system can make full use of resources such as light heat and arable land which is of great significance to ensure national food security li et al 2020 the winter wheat summer maize rotation system produced approximately 30 of the national maize and 45 of the national wheat zhang et al 2021 accounting for 25 total national food production of china yang et al 2014 however the shortage of water resources and the low use efficiency of water and fertilizer caused by unreasonable irrigation and excessive nitrogen application have restricted the sustainable development of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china kang et al 2017 ju et al 2006 ju et al 2009 the guanzhong plain is one of the main planting areas of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china the annual precipitation in this region ranges from 350 mm to 900 mm but the water requirement of winter wheat summer maize rotation system is about 900 mm liu et al 2002 therefore annual precipitation cannot meet the water demand of winter wheat and summer maize with a considerable gap of about 200 550 mm and the large inter annual and seasonal variation of precipitation the water requirement of winter wheat is 450 500 mm liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2002 but the average precipitation in winter wheat growing season is approximately 30 of the annual precipitation yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2003 only 25 40 of the water demand si et al 2020 previous research reported that more than 60 of precipitation falls in the summer maize growing season which could basically meet the water requirement of summer maize 423 mm reported by liu et al 2002 but the seasonal droughts are prone to occur because of the uneven precipitation distribution during the growth period of summer maize for example shen et al 2020 reported that the yield loss of summer maize caused by drought in the guanzhong plain was around 0 40 during 1970 2015 sometimes even up to 80 therefore a reasonable irrigation scheduling is essential to increase the annual yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the guanzhong plain fertilizer is another important factor that affects the growth of winter wheat and summer maize which provide the necessary nutrients for crop growth the contribution of nitrogen fertilizer to grain yield increases even reached 30 50 erisman et al 2008 previous studies have reported that the annual nitrogen fertilizer demand for winter wheat summer maize rotation is totally about 330 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2015 while the actual application rate of nitrogen was about totally 550 600 kg ha 1 in this region for these two crops zhang et al 2006 zhao et al 2006 which is far beyond the nitrogen demand of winter wheat and summer maize excessive nitrogen application not only increase the risk of environmental pollution such as nitrate leaching n2o and no emissions zhang et al 2019 wei et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 but also reduce nitrogen use efficiency gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 a number of studies have investigated the optimal nitrogen application rate of winter wheat summer maize or winter wheat summer maize rotation system for instance ru et al 2015 reported that nitrogen application rate for winter wheat and summer maize should be in the range of 250 300 kg ha 1 and 150 200 kg ha 1 respectively yang et al 2017 suggested that the appropriate nitrogen fertilizer rate for winter wheat and summer maize in the guanzhong plain were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively jia et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 reported that there were insignificant yield losses for winter wheat with 210 kg n ha 1 and for summer maize with 180 kg n ha 1 compared to traditional nitrogen application 270 kg ha 1 in the annual fertilizer management 28 of nitrogen reduction can synchronously achieve high grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency jia et al 2011 yang et al 2011 xu et al 2020 reported that the appropriate n application rates in guanzhong plain were 140 kg n ha 1 for maize with irrigation 90 mm at the seedling stage in wet and normal years and two irrigations at the seedling and jointing stages in dry years and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat coupled with two three and four irrigations applied in wet normal and dry years respectively however previous studies were carried out under the conventional nitrogen application condition broadcast an irrigation amount of 90 mm may cause leaching losses of nitrate nitrogen yang et al 2015 lu et al 2021a in addition the absorption of nitrogen by crop is affected by water supply an appropriate water and nitrogen management can significantly improve nitrogen uptake and grain yield while controlled the nitrate leaching depth and amount gheysari et al 2009 sui et al 2018 therefore the suitable nitrogen application amount is largely influenced by the distribution and amount of precipitation and irrigation during crop growth season drip fertigation an advanced water and fertilizer management technology can timely and accurately supply water and nitrogen to root zone match the distribution of water nutrients and crop roots yan et al 2021 li et al 2018 and thus promote the absorption of water and nutrients by crop jha et al 2017 previous research have reported that drip fertigation can maximize the coupling effect of water and fertilizer and achieve high crop yield and water and fertilizer use efficiencies yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore the optimal water and nitrogen application amount under drip fertigation condition are likely different from under traditional water and nitrogen management although drip fertigation could increase grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income previous studies mainly focused on economic crops wang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and staple crops in arid and semi arid regions yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 few studies were conducted on staple crops in semi humid and drought prone region due to the higher economic inputs especially for winter wheat summer maize rotation system no tillage sowing of summer maize realizes the annual use of drip fertigation system one drip line can continuously serve winter wheat and summer maize in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system which significantly reduced the input cost therefore more efforts are needed to comprehensively investigate the effects of drip fertigation on the grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone region the objective of this study was to 1 evaluate the economic feasibility of drip fertigation in winter wheat summer maize rotation system in semi humid and drought prone areas 2 determine optimal water and nitrogen application amount of winter wheat and summer maize under drip fertigation condition in the semi humid and drought prone areas this study will give scientific recommendations to simultaneously maximize grain yield and economic benefit for drip fertigated winter wheat summer maize rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the

treatments twelve drip fertigation treatments and a conventional management con and each treatment was replicated three times each sub plot area was 25 2 m2 3 6 m 7 m separated by a border area to prevent neighbouring water and nitrogen effects the winter wheat and summer maize field drip fertigation experiment was a complete combination design of three irrigation levels and four nitrogen fertilizer levels three irrigation levels were rain fed rf deficit irrigation di 75 etc and full irrigation fi 100 etc respectively etc was the crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated as etc kc et0 kc is the crop coefficient which was set as 0 6 and 0 4 from the emergence to jointing 1 2 and 1 1 from the jointing to milk stage and 0 6 and 0 4 from the milk stage to harvest for summer maize and winter wheat respectively allen et al 1998 wang et al 2020 gao et al 2009 the et0 reference crop evapotranspiration fig 1 was calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 yan et al 2020 based on the preliminary experiment and soil characteristics the upper and lower irrigation limits were set as 90 and 65 of field capacity in this study the target percentage of wetted soil volume was assumed to be 60 and the soil moistening layer depth was selected as 60 cm lu et al 2021b therefore irrigation amount was set as 30 mm for fi treatment 100 etc and 22 5 mm for di treatment 75 etc when the accumulative etc close to or reached 30 mm after last irrigation including more than 30 mm precipitation and no precipitation occurs including light rain 10 mm sunny cloudy and overcast based on precipitation forecast in the next three days irrigation was carried out in other words irrigation will not be performed when there is a precipitation forecast of more than 10 mm in the next three days irrigation amount was controlled by a water meter the detailed irrigation scheduling based on etc and precipitation forecast was shown in fig 2 nitrogen levels for winter wheat include n0 no nitrogen application n1 85 kg n ha 1 n2 170 kg n ha 1 and n3 255 kg n ha 1 twenty percent of the total nitrogen was surface broadcast as base fertilizer before sowing and 80

four nitrogen fertilisation levels include n0 no nitrogen application n1 90 kg ha 1 n2 150 kg ha 1 and n3 210 kg ha 1 the nitrogen was applied using a drip fertigation system according to the following schedule 20 30 30 and 20 at sowing seedling jointing and grain filling stage of summer maize respectively the conventional management of irrigation and nitrogen was used as control con following the typical local practices border irrigation for the con treatment 127 5 kg n ha 1 was applied at sowing and jointing stage in the winter wheat season and 105 kg n ha 1 was applied with precipitation at sowing and jointing stage in summer maize season respectively the details about nitrogen application are presented in table 1 ca h2po4 2 h2o and kcl were used as phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizer all treatments received 120 kg p ha 1 and 90 kg k ha 1 for wheat 90 kg p ha 1 and 60 kg k ha 1 for maize the drip fertigation system was arranged after the winter wheat planted the drip tapes were arranged at 60 cm apart along the winter wheat rows namely one drip line serves three rows of winter wheat the emitter discharge was 2 0 l h 1 and the emitter spacing was 30 cm the winter wheat seed cv xiaoyan 22 triticum aestivum l was sown at a rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 the winter wheat was sown manually with a row spacing of 20 cm on october 10 2018 and october 12 2019 and both were harvested on june 4 of 2019 and 2020 respectively winter wheat was manually harvested leaving about 20 cm stubbles in the field the summer maize cv zhengdan 958 zea mays l was planted on june 9 2019 and june 7 2020 by a manual maize planter after winter wheat harvest without tilling the soil and harvested on september 25 2019 and 2020 the summer maize was planted at a planting density of 70 922 plants ha 1 row spacing of 60 cm and plant spacing of 23 5 cm the summer maize was planted next to the old drip tapes namely one drip line irrigate one row of summer maize because of prevention in advance no disease or pests occurred during two year growing seasons 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological variables during the experimental periods the meteorological data was recorded by a standard automatic weather station located 30 m from the experiment field including air temperature relative humidity wind speed 2 m solar radiation and precipitation these meteorological variables were used to calculate daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 2 3 2 soil water content soil samples were collected from 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape the soil samples at each location were collected at depth of 0 120 cm with 20 cm increments from each plot at the time of winter wheat and summer maize sowing and harvest the average soil water content of three replicates was used to present the soil water content of each treatment the soil water content was determined by using the gravimetric method 2 3 3 aboveground biomass at maturity three 0 2 m long rows of winter wheat and three representative summer maize were sampled at harvest from each plot the winter wheat was separated into stem leaf glume and grain the summer maize was separated into stem leaf kernel cob and husk each component was placed into an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at 75 c to a constant weight the aboveground biomass was the total oven dried weight of each component 2 3 4 grain yield at the maturity of winter wheat and summer maize three areas of 1 m2 winter wheat and 50 maize plants five groups each group contains 10 consecutive maize plants in the middle of each plot were harvested by hand respectively the grains were then manually removed from the spikes or cobs the dry grain was weighed and grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize was calculated on 13 and 14 moisture content respectively li et al 2021 mansouri far et al 2010 2 4 data calculations 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated according to the reference of fernández et al 2020 pereira et al 2012 and kijne et al 2003 as follows w p g y e t where gy is grain yield kg ha 1 et is actual crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 the actual crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to the soil water balance equation et p i sw r d where p and i are precipitation and irrigation amounts mm respectively sw is the difference of water stored in the soil between at the beginning and the end of the considered period r and d are the water runoff and deep drainage respectively since each plot was very flat and surrounded by ridges the r was ignored the d also was considered to be the zero because the soil has a good water holding capacity and there was a slight amount of precipitation or irrigation over the field capacity 2 4 2 nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as follows n u e g y t g y 0 n where g y t is grain yield kg ha 1 with irrigation and nitrogen treatments g y 0 is grain yield kg ha 1 of rain fed combined no nitrogen application treatment n is the amount of nitrogen applied as fertilizer kg ha 1 2 4 3 economic analysis the cost of main equipment including main pipeline fertilizer pump and others of field drip fertigation system was 3 750 cny ha 1 and the economic life was 3 years 6 seasons the cost of drip tape was 2 500 cny ha 1 with an economic life of one year therefore the total cost of drip fertigation system was 1 875 3750 6 2500 2 cny ha 1 per season the cost of mechanical energy for rotary tillage planting and harvesting of winter wheat were 1 000 cny ha 1 800 cny ha 1 and 800 cny ha 1 respectively in summer maize season the cost of mechanical energy were mainly from sowing of 800 cny ha 1 and harvesting of 1 000 cny ha 1 including threshing because we used the no till practice therefore the cost of mechanical energy for winter wheat and summer maize were 2 600 cny ha 1 and 1 800 cny ha 1 respectively the prices of seeds pesticides fertilizers water labor expenditures and sales price of grains are based on market prices the net income was computed by subtracting all the production costs from gross profit uygan et al 2021 as follows net income pg ic fc pc lc ec o where pg is the gross profit cny ha 1 ic is the irrigation water cost cny ha 1 fc is the fertilizer cost cny ha 1 pc is drip fertigation system cost cny

etc 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using spss 21 0 spss inc chicago usa and the difference between the treatment was evaluated using least significant difference lsd multiple comparison tests at the p 0 05 level the response surface methodology was used to determine the water consumption and nitrogen application amount which allowed the graphical visualization of responses of grain yield and net income to water consumption and nitrogen rate the surfaces were overlapped to find appropriate water consumption and nitrogen ranges for more than 95 grain yield and net income liyana pathirana et al 2005 wang et al 2018 3 results 3 1 aboveground biomass and grain yield the year showed insignificant effects on aboveground biomass and grain yield of winter wheat

and there was insignificant difference between n3 and n2 at same irrigation levels the wp of n0 was significantly lower than in the other three nitrogen treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the winter wheat wp of di was significantly higher than that of rf and fi at the same nitrogen levels in 2019 2020 but insignificant difference was found among rf di and fi treatments at the same nitrogen levels in 2018 2019 fig 5a and b the maximum wp of winter wheat was 2 19 kg m 3 and 2 03 kg m 3 obtained at din2 treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the summer maize wp of rf was significantly higher than that of fi at the same nitrogen levels with insignificant difference between rf and di during two growing seasons fig 5c and d the maximum wp of summer maize was 2 50 kg m 3 and 2 20 kg m 3 obtained at rfn2 and rfn3 treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the wp of winter wheat summer maize rotation system ranged from 0 81 to 2 31 kg m 3 and 0 79 2 01 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the highest wp was 2 28 kg m 3 and 2 00 kg m 3 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system obtained at din2 and rfn3 treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively but there was insignificant difference among din3 din2 rfn3 and rfn2 treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons fig 5e and f the two year average wp of din2 was increased by 52 5 and 41 7 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively compared with con treatment 3 3 economic benefit in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons the gross profit of winter wheat ranged from 7 291 21 839 cny ha 1 and 5 904 22 273 cny ha 1 but the net income ranged from 1 306 11 712 cny ha 1 and 2 807 11 966 cny ha 1 which indicated that unreasonable management of irrigation and nitrogen led to the decrease of net income and even loss table 4 the two year average net income of winter wheat of rf di and fi were 3 415 cny ha 1 7 817 cny ha 1 and 7 003 cny ha 1 respectively the net income of di and fi increased by 128 9 and 105 1 compared with rf treatment respectively compared with con treatment the two year average gross profit of winter wheat of rfn3 din3 and fin3 increased by 10 9 45 3 and 43 0 and the two year average net income increased by 6 2 82 6 and 73 6 respectively table 4 for summer maize the gross profit ranged from 9 027 24 013 cny ha 1 and 10 884 22 967 cny ha 1 and the net income ranged from 1 264 15 660 cny ha 1 and 3 481 14 464 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the two year average net income of rfn3 din3 and fin3 were 13 162 cny ha 1 14 838 cny ha 1 and 14 289 cny ha 1 respectively which increased by 22 3 37 9 and 32 8 compared with con 10 760 cny ha 1 respectively table 4 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system the gross profit ranged from 16 675 45 852 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 16 788 44 594 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 the net income ranged from 675 to 27 372 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 788 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 the two year average net income of rf di and fi were 13 288 cny ha 1 18 904 cny ha 1 and 17 186 cny ha 1 respectively indicating that irrigation could significantly increase net income under drip fertigation and di could improve net income of winter wheat summer maize rotation system through increasing grain yield fig 4 and decrease input of irrigation table 4 the two year average net income of rfn3 din3 and fin3 were 19 465 cny ha 1 25 670 cny ha 1 and 24 590 cny ha 1 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system increased by 16 6 53 8 and 47 3 compared with con treatment respectively the treatment of din2 achieved the maximum net income of 27 372 cny ha 1 and 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the two year average net income of din2 was increased by 99 5 38 1 and 59 9 for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation system respectively compared with con treatment 3 4 optimization of water consumption and nitrogen amount based on crop yield and net income the gathered data of 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 was comprehensively analyzed to explore the optimal amount of water consumption and nitrogen application to achieve high yield and high economic benefit in this study water consumption and nitrogen application amount were treated as independent variables and the grain yield and net income were considered as the response variables the binary quadratic regression equation was established using mathenatica 9 0 software based on the least squares method table 5 the water consumption and nitrogen application amount were calculated by binary quadratic regression equation when the grain yield and net income of winter wheat and summer maize respectively reached the maximum values table 5 the fitting results showed that the r2 ranged from 0 926 to 0 942 and all of the p value of regression equations reached highly significant level p 0 01 for winter wheat the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the maximum grain yield 9 6 t ha 1 was 496 mm and 221 kg ha 1 respectively and the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the largest net income 12 153 cny ha 1 was 481 mm and 211 kg ha 1 respectively for summer maize the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the maximum grain yield 11 7 t ha 1 was 502 mm and 259 kg ha 1 respectively and the water consumption and nitrogen application amount corresponding to the largest net income 15 807 cny ha 1 was 500 mm and 250 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 in the practice it was difficult to obtain the maximum grain yield and net income simultaneously therefore the 95 100 maximum values of the grain yield and net income was set as acceptable interval of high yield and high economic benefit in this study the results showed that the grain yield and net income of winter wheat could reach 95 100 of the maximum values simultaneously with the water consumption of 434 496 mm and the nitrogen application amount of 165 211 kg ha 1 fig 6a and b when water consumption and nitrogen application amount ranged from 458 to 500 mm and 187 250 kg ha 1 summer maize could obtain 95 100 of the maximum grain yield and net income fig 6c and d 4 discussion the purpose of irrigation and fertilization management is to increase crop grain yield reduce the input of water and fertilizer as much as possible on the premise of ensuring high grain yield and finally obtain the maximum economic benefit in this study although 90 mm water was irrigated at jointing stage of summer maize for con treatment fig 2 the two year average grain yield of rfn3 was significantly higher than that of con for summer maize fig 4 the reason may be that split n fertilization provided better adjustment of nitrogen to crop nitrogen demand at various growth stages which enhanced nitrogen uptake efficiency and grain yield li et al 2019 yolcu öner çetin 2015 the similar result also was concluded by wang et al 2016 who reported that split n fertilization significantly increased the crop nitrogen uptake from fertilizers and the 3 splits and 2 splits nitrogen application obtained higher nitrogen recovery efficiency than applying total nitrogen before sowing however the grain yield of winter wheat had insignificant difference between rfn3 and con the reason may be explained by the fact that the restriction of water shortage to grain yield of rfn3 was equal to the improvement of split n fertigation in this study the two year average biomass of winter wheat in di and fi increased by 18 3 and 10 9 fig 3 and the average grain yield increased by 33 8 and 38 6 compared with rf treatment fig 4 respectively this result showed that irrigation could increase the aboveground biomass and grain yield of winter wheat in semi humid and drought prone regions which was consistent with the previous results cetin et al 2015 the similar result also was concluded by song et al 2016 who reported that irrigation at overwintering and jointing stages of winter wheat could significantly prolong the total time of dry matter accumulation increase the dry matter of winter wheat from 10 8 t ha 1 of rain fed treatment to 13 8 t ha 1 of irrigation treatment and the yield of irrigation increase by 6 0 32 7 compared with rain fed treatment our study also conclude that the grain yield of summer maize of di and fi increased by 8 3 and 9 7 compared with rf in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 but only increased by 0 4 and 2 7 in 2019 2020 growing season p 0 05 the reason may be due to the abundant and relatively uniform distributed precipitation occurred in 2019 2020 growing season fig 1 the similar result was also concluded by chen et al 2019 who reported that high grain yield and water productivity can be achieved without irrigation in wet years in the guanzhong plain in this study the average grain yield of di was significantly higher than that of rf but showing insignificant difference with fi fig 4 however yan et al 2021 reported that deficit irrigation 75 etc significantly reduced maize grain yield one of the reasons may be that the crop evapotranspiration in arid areas ningxia of china is higher than that in the semi humid and drought prone regions yangling of china allen et al 1998 another reason may be that clay loam soil in our study has a higher water retention capacity than sandy soil in their study site in addition our experiment was conducted under no tillage conditions and straw residues about 20 cm can significantly inhibit soil evaporation yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2005 in this study the water productivity of con was significantly lower than drip fertigation fig 5 one of the reasons was drip split n significantly increased crops grain yield and realized multi small amount irrigation which significantly increased water productivity jha et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 another reason was that drip irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast avoid irrigation events before precipitation and seasonal droughts shen et al 2020 cao et al 2019 at the same time drip irrigation can reduce evaporation loss and enhance water productivity and grain yield by injecting irrigation water into crop root zone li et al 2018 despite higher investment piping and labour of drip fertigation than traditional irrigation and fertilization practices con our two year average net income of drip fertigation mean value of rfn3 din3 and fin3 was 9 146 cny ha 1 14 096 cny ha 1 and 23 242 cny ha 1 for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation which increased by 54 1 31 0 and 39 2 compared with con fig 4 and table 4 respectively thus the increase of benefit associated with increased grain yield outpaced the investment of drip fertigation in this study the highest net income two year average was 11 839 cny ha 1 14 859 cny ha 1 and 26 698 cny ha 1 obtained at din2 treatment for winter wheat summer maize and winter wheat summer maize rotation respectively this can be well explained that din2 treatment improves crops grain yield compared with lower irrigation and nitrogen treatment fig 4 and reduces irrigation and nitrogen inputs compared with higher irrigation and nitrogen treatment fig 2 many researchers have established the relationships between crop yield water productivity net income and irrigation and fertilizer inputs yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in this study the relationships between crop yield net income and water consumption and nitrogen application amount were established our results showed that 95 100 maximum grain yield and net income corresponding the water consumption intervals were 434 496 mm and 458 500 mm and the nitrogen application rates were 165 211 kg ha 1 and 187 250 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively this result was consistent with liu et al 2002 who suggested that the water requirement is about 900 mm for winter wheat summer maize rotation system similar nitrogen application amount also was reported by zhao et al 2015 who reported that 150 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 180 kg n ha 1 for summer maize could obtain more than 18 t ha 1 grain yield in winter wheat summer maize rotation system yang et al 2017 also suggested that the suitable nitrogen application rates for high grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively those results can support our results that 170 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can achieve the higher annual grain yield without significant difference with high nitrogen 255 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and 210 kg ha 1 for summer maize however qiang et al 2019 suggested that the summer maize could achieve maximum grain yield with a nitrogen application rate of 149 kg ha 1 under rain fed conditions this inconsistency with our results may be that drip fertigation significantly improves the crop grain yield which increased the nitrogen demand of crops li et al 2019 compared to the result reported by yang et al 2017 our result increased the ratio 53 of fertilization in winter wheat season the reason was that the precipitation mainly falls in summer maize season and intensively precipitation could increase the risk of nitrate leaching losses yang et al 2015 lu et al 2021 xue et al 2012 reported that 55 of total nitrogen applied in winter wheat and 45 of total nitrogen applied in summer maize obtained the highest grain yield of winter wheat summer maize rotation system resulting in higher nitrogen use efficiency therefore properly increasing nitrogen application amount in winter wheat season and reducing nitrogen in high temperature and rainy summer maize season could reduce the risk of nitrate leaching and increase grain yield 5 conclusion this study showed that the drip nitrogen fertigation under rain fed conditions can achieve crop yield similar to or higher than that of traditional water and nitrogen management con in the sub humid and drought prone regions deficit drip irrigation 75 etc based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast combined with appropriate nitrogen application rate 170 kg ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg ha 1 for summer maize is beneficial to maintain high grain yield and improve crop water productivity and net income the two year average grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and net income of din2 was increased by 49 9 52 5 185 7 and 99 5 for winter wheat increased by 30 1 41 7 137 8 and 38 1 for summer maize respectively compared with con treatment the response surface methodology can well determine the interval of water consumption and nitrogen application corresponding to higher crop yield and net income this
