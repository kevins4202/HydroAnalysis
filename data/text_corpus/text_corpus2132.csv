10660,integrated groundwater management is a major challenge for industrial agricultural and domestic activities in some agricultural production systems optimized water table management represents a significant factor to improve crop yields and water use therefore predicting water table depth wtd becomes an important means to enable real time planning and management of groundwater resources this study proposes a decision tree based modelling approach for wtd forecasting as a function of precipitation previous wtd values and evapotranspiration with applications in groundwater resources management for cranberry farming firstly two decision tree based models namely random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgb were parameterized and compared to predict the wtd up to 48 h ahead for a cranberry farm located in québec canada secondly the importance of the predictor variables was analyzed to determine their influence on wtd simulation results wtd measurements at three observation wells within a cranberry field for the growing period from july 8 2017 to august 30 2017 were used for training and testing the models statistical parameters such as the mean squared error coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient were used to measure models performance the results show that the xgb model outperformed the rf model for all predictions of wtd and was accordingly selected as the optimal model among the predictor variables the antecedent wtd was the most important for water table depth simulation followed by the precipitation based on the most important variables and optimal model the prediction error for entire wtd range was within 5 cm for 1 12 24 36 and 48 h predictions the xgb models can provide useful information on the wtd dynamics and a rigorous simulation for irrigation planning and management in cranberry fields keywords random forest extreme gradient boosting machine learning groundwater level evapotranspiration precipitation 1 introduction integrated groundwater management is a challenge for industrial agricultural and domestic activities one concern is the impact of these activities on groundwater quality and quantity rodriguez galiano et al 2014 furthermore groundwater resources are growingly threatened by climate change and variability ghose et al 2010 which may lead to a decrease in the level of groundwater as a result of decreasing precipitation and increasing atmospheric temperature lee et al 2014 taylor et al 2013 in québec groundwater is the source of economically exploitable water due to its quality and availability ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2019 however its vulnerability is increasing because the agricultural sector is extensively withdrawing water to meet the current demand godfray et al 2010 for cranberry production particularly large volumes of water are extracted from aquifer and used for irrigation cranberry vanderleest et al 2016 samson et al 2016 soil moisture management harvest and winter flooding and frost protection kennedy et al 2017 these water uses result in a water requirement for cranberry production is on average around 2233 mm yr 1 kennedy et al 2017 notwithstanding its water requirements cranberry is highly sensitive to variations in soil water during the fruit growing season caron et al 2016 as an example pelletier et al 2015b reported that a reduction of up to 50 in yield is due to hypoxic stress when the water table is close to the soil surface 25 cm furthermore they reported that cranberry yield decreased by 8 for each wtd step of 10 cm for a range between 60 120 cm below the soil surface it is therefore important to establish water management methods to reduce the excessive use of groundwater in cranberry fields many studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of hydrologic processes and reduce water consumption in cranberry fields these studies sought to develop a comprehensive knowledge of water management strategies necessary to optimize water consumption of cranberry crops for instance pelletier et al 2015a and caron et al 2016 showed that to optimize cranberry yield without excess of water irrigation must be applied when root zone soil matric potential is between 7 5 and 4 kpa the control of the water table depth has also been used as an irrigation strategy to optimize cranberry yield this strategy has resulted in a reduction of 77 of sprinkler water use and in a maximum yield for a water table depth of 60 cm pelletier et al 2015b the cranberry fruit development stage from mid june to early september is the most hydric stress sensitive stage in cranberry crop growth pelletier et al 2015a 2015b however july flowering period and august fruit formation are recognized as the most critical months in the growing season jeranyama 2018 in cranberry fields irrigation is commonly applied through overheard sprinkler systems drawing water from a semi closed water circulation system gumiere et al 2014 vanderleest et al 2016 and its scheduling often requires advance notice of up to 48 h however despite the improvement in water resources management in cranberry fields no study has been conducted to predict water table depths as a function of predicted meteorological conditions predicting water table depth at different time intervals using time series is an essential tool in water resources planning kisi et al 2012 nowadays numerous machine learning models have been developed to predict water table depth these models have been grouped into empirical time series models and physical descriptive models nayak et al 2006 the physical models require an adequate definition of aquifer parameters to describe the soil subsurface spatial variability taormina et al 2012 therefore the implementation of the physically based modelling approach requires an enormous amount of precise data which is difficult to obtain because of cost and time constraints coulibaly et al 2001 nayak et al 2006 a potential solution is a data driven empirical model susceptible to provide useful results without costly calibration time daliakopoulos et al 2005 among the data driven empirical models artificial neural networks ann and decision trees are the most popular artificial neural networks ann have been used to model the dynamics of a nonlinear system for which the water table depth represents the dependent variable coulibaly et al 2001 nayak et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 coulibaly et al 2001 and sethi et al 2010 applied ann models to satisfactorily predict the influence of meteorological conditions on groundwater level ghose et al 2010 used ann and predicted water table depth fluctuations with an error of 10 however despite their performance in modelling groundwater hydrology ann present the possible inconveniences of being stuck in a local minimum and of overfitting during the training step besides their inability to work with missing and correlated data leads to complex and less precise models with long calibration time maier et al 2010 decision tree based models represent a solution to several of the ann drawbacks and are more suitable for application on small sized datasets breiman 2001 furthermore they allow for the presentation of more understandable results as well as development of models of varying complexity and accuracy they can model non linear phenomena and do not need prior statistical assumptions elimination of outliers or data transformation lin et al 2006 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 these features are keys to their widespread use in the field of bioinformatics where decisions are often needed to be made using small size data samples yang et al 2010 stiglic et al 2012 however they have been used in other fields as well song and ying 2015 for instance roe et al 2005 have introduced adecision tree based model as an alternative to ann to identify particles in subatomic physics rodriguez galiano et al 2014 developed a decision tree based models to predict groundwater pollution due to nitrate the results show that decision trees can successfully be used to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities li et al 2016 have compared a decision tree based model and ann in predicting a lake water level the results demonstrate that the decision tree model has superior predictive capabilities with fewer parameters and training time singh et al 2014 have successfully applied decision tree based models in predicting the influence of seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities on groundwater hydrochemistry wang et al 2018 developed a custom decision tree based model as a predictive tool for groundwater level suitable for situations where low dimensional input data are available additional examples for the application of decision trees in hydrology can be found in tyralis et al 2019 other data driven techniques such as genetic programming gp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis have also been used for groundwater depth forecasting kisi et al 2012 however these latter require large amount of well formatted data kisi et al 2012 based on the predictive power of decision tree models the objective of this paper is to develop and compare decision tree based models to forecast the water table depth in cranberry fields as a function of meteorological conditions precipitation and evapotranspiration over a time period of up to 48 h ahead as an initial investigation we limited the study to the most critical months of the cranberry growing season i e july and august 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on a cranberry farm near québec city québec canada 46 14 n 72 02 w in summer the study area is characterized by a warm and humid climate the normal total rainfall in june is 48 0 mm in july 75 0 mm in august 86 4 mm and 70 6 mm in september the average temperature is 17 1 in june 19 6 in july 18 4 in august and 13 3 in september station arthabaska environment canada 2019 the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 this study site covers approximately 18 ha 40 m wide x450 m long of the pilgrim cranberries variety during construction the top 30 cm of soil of the field was excavated and replaced with sand to create favorable conditions for cranberry growth and production this cranberry field is equipped with a subsurface drainage system of four drainage pipes spacing 10 m at an average depth of 65 cm below the soil surface these subsurface drains flow out into a water level control structure at the south end of the site the control structure is used to maintain a water table depth of 60 cm by adding water by gravity or by pumping from a reservoir to the subsurface and open drains because this specific depth would keep the root zone soil matric potential between 7 5 and 4 kpa which ensures that cranberries receive an adequate water supply caron et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 water table depth wtd were measured using a monitoring system consisting of a submersible pressure transducer tdh80 transducersdirect inc ellington court cincinnati ohio usa and a datalogger st 4 hortau inc lévis québec canada equipped with a built in global positioning system gps chip the system automatically reads and corrects the water pressure measurements for atmospheric pressure the pressure transducers were inserted into the three observation wells p1 p2 and p3 shown in fig 1 the observation wells are made of pvc pipes inserted vertically and at the mid spacing between two subsurface drains being in the middle of the field and in the north and south sides measurements from these three wells represents the range of possible water table depths in the cranberry field data were collected every 15 min and sent wirelessly to hortau s data management online platform https irrolis hortau net the water pressure measurements in the observation wells were converted to water level and then to water table depth in cm in reference to ground surface level which have an almost horizontal surface the ground surface level is the reference due to the fact that cranberry field have constructed with zero slope missing depth values of water table were interpolated from existing measurements with the help of cubic spline a time series interpolation technique moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 hourly water table depth values used in this study were the averages of the 15 minute measurements 2 2 2 precipitation precipitations were measured every 15 min using a rain gauge watchdog 1120 rain gauge from spectrum technology inc il usa combined with a st 4 hortau datalogger lévis québec in summer sprinkler irrigation is used for cooling crops in the study area this rain gauge also measured the amount of irrigation water the total precipitation used in this study was a combination of irrigation water and rainfall for modeling wtd hourly precipitation values used were the sums of the 15 minute rain gauge measurements 2 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was estimated using the formula of baier and robertson 1965 1 e t d a y 2 40 0 065 t m a x 0 083 t

and minimum tmin air temperatures measured by hortau s weather station which includes the watchdog 2900 et from spectrum technology inc il usa daily et were disaggregated into hourly values with the ratio of hourly r h to daily r d extraterrestrial radiation 2 e t h o u r e t d a y r h r d the extraterrestrial radiation for the daily and hourly periods were estimated using the equations of allen

3 overview of decision trees algorithms decision tree based algorithms are one of the most powerful techniques used to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data and build predictive models lin et al 2006 they are suitable for supervised learning when the problem is either classification the model output is a categorical variable or regression the model output is a continuous or time series variable these algorithms recursively partition the training sample over its input variable space and fit a simple function to each resulting partition lin et al 2006 the resulting partitions are directly affected by the size and quality of the data insufficient data may lead to overfitting lin et al 2006 kotsiantis 2013 however several methods have been developed to address this problem among those methods the ensemble decision trees which consist in creating a collection of prediction or classification models named weak learners that are combined to make a strong learner have proven effective in improving the prediction and classification accuracy luna et al 2019 boosting and bagging are the two most widely used techniques to create ensemble trees models dietterich 2000 kotsiantis and pintelas 2004 naghibi et al 2016 bagging bootstrap aggregating works by training homogeneous weak learners using bootstrap subsets with replacement of the original dataset in parallel and combines them according to a deterministic averaging process the end goal is to reduce the resulting model variance overfitting boosting also works by using homogeneous weak learners but train them in a sequential manner using an adaptive approach whereby each subsequent weak learner is trained with a new subset of the data that includes observations not correctly handled by the previous learners the end goal is to reduce the resulting model bias by forcing the weak system learner to focus on the harder samples xiao et al 2013 these two techniques have motivated the development of a variety of machine learning algorithms or methods these include a random forests rf breiman 2001 implements the bagging technique and is recognized as the most prominent algorithm for application in a wide range of classification and regression problems lindner et al 2014 and b adaptive boosting adaboost freund and schapire 1997 and gradient boosting machine friedman 2001 that implement the boosting technique the gradient boosting machine algorithms also known as gradient boosted regression tree or gradient tree boosting have the potential to effectively capture complex non linear relationships between two variables y x and have shown considerable success in various practical applications natekin and knoll 2013 they have been widely used because of their efficiency accuracy and interpretability ke et al 2017 prominent implementations include light gradient boosting machine lightgbm ke et al 2017 and extreme gradient boosting xgb chen and guestrin 2016 the latter being increasingly recognized for its performance among all the categories of boosting algorithms sharma and juneja 2019 and is highly recommended for prediction of naturally occurring phenomena fan et al 2018 we further discuss the xgb boosting based and rf bagging based methods below as they represent two methods that have excellent performance in prediction sandri and zuccolotto 2006 genuer et al 2010 guo et al 2011 sharma and juneja 2019 furthermore predictors importance can be estimated which is essential in this study for identifying the significant influencing factors for water table depth variations these methods are suitable for both classification and regression problems through classification and regression trees respectively however we will focus on the regression trees technique as we are dealing with continuous variables this technique depicted in fig 2 imposes a set of hierarchically structured restrictions and is sequentially applied to a root node up to a terminal node of the decision tree breiman et al 1984 2 3 1 random forest random forest is a supervised machine learning method consisting of multiple building blocks named decision trees that outputs an ensemble of predictive models of the same phenomenon rodriguez galiano et al 2014 each decision tree in the forest is grown with a different bootstrap subset of the original dataset that is randomly sampled with replacement lin et al 2006 the default sampling scheme for random forests is bootstrapping where 100 of the observations are sampled with replacement boehmke greenwell 2019 rf builds each tree by making them grow from about two thirds ⅔ of each bootstrap sample inbag about one third ⅓ is excluded from the bootstrap sample out of bag for a non biased estimation of the regression error when the trees are added to the forest a prediction of the out of bag oob data is generated for each tree these predictions are subsequently averaged to obtain an estimation of the oob error rate this error estimation technique is often used to estimate the generalization error of rf models and to select appropriate tuning parameters janitza and hornung 2018 such as the number of candidate predictors that should be randomly drawn for a node split which is an important step in the tree growing process breiman 2001 the rf generalization error depends therefore on the weight of the individual trees and the correlation between them the building of a regression tree follows a recursive binary partition approach starting at the root node and divides the non correlated variables into two new branches fig 2 represents the random forest architecture extracted from guo et al 2011 this recursive division is performed on the dependent variable as a function of the most significant independent variable that creates the best ensembles of homogeneous training data clusters each node is then divided using the most homogeneous among the subsets of predictive variables selected randomly at the node this division process continues up to when the predefined stop condition is reached this stop condition is important as it influences the performance of the model or tree and is often defined by the number of observations at the terminal node nodesize the resulting rf model is in the case of a regression an average of the predictions from all decision trees for rf the three following parameters must be defined the number of trees to generate the forest ntree this parameter is a determinant factor for the predictions performed with rf the higher the value of ntree the smaller the root mean square error scornet 2017 the number of the randomly selected variables at each node mtry among the set of predictive variables the minimum number of observations at the terminal nodes of the trees nodesize the default value that always provides good results in regression is nodesize 1 breiman 2002 2 3 2 extreme gradient boosting xgb is a supervised machine learning method proposed by chen guestrin 2016 that uses a recursive partitioning procedure although with a different construction strategy than rf trees in xgb are grown in a sequential and stagewise manner by a fitting a decision tree to the training data subset b fitting a loss function a measure of the difference between observed and fitted values to the residuals of the precedent tree and c adding the loss function and precedent tree to create the next tree xgb uses the second partial derivatives of the loss function to minimize the loss function to obtain more accurate trees the final prediction of xgb is the sum of the weighted contribution of all decision trees used to maximize the predictive accuracy of xgb the following parameters must be defined see chen et al 2015 for full details the learning rate is the rate at which the model learns pattern in training data this parameter controls the model overfitting by retarding its convergence it determines the contribution of each tree in the ensemble of models godinho et al 2018 the tree complexity max depth is the number of splits which must be performed in each tree it determines the size of the tree the nrounds parameter control the maximum number of iterations the subsamples ratio of features colsample bytree control the ratio of the number of predictive variables supplied to a tree similar to mtry in rf the minimal loss reduction gamma is required to make additional splits on a tree terminal node this is a tuning parameter to prevent overfitting the minimum sum of weights min child weight refers to the minimum number of observations required at a terminal node similar to nodesize in rf in regression tree the fraction of randomly selected observations subsample that is needed from the training data to build each tree 2 4 model development 2 4 1 input selection as mentioned above we selected the random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithms to map the relationship between the water table depth and factors affecting the groundwater level these models were programmed in r programming language r core team 2018 version 3 4 4 the rf algorithm is from the randomforest package breiman and cutler 2018 liaw and wiener 2002 and the xgb model is from the xgboost package chen et al 2015 as inputs to the models we considered precipitation p evapotranspiration et and wtd of the observation wells p1 p2 and p3 the models were built with a combination of input variables for each observation wells separately lag times of input variables were generated by means of the sliding window method which allowed to restructure these time series dataset p et and wtd as a supervised learning problem by using a size of the lag d equal to 24 this size of lag d 24 was chosen to consider the influence of the water table depth over the previous 24 h time period on the predictions we construct the decision tree models that map an input window of width d into an individual output value y these models predict the water table depth y i t j w i t h j t h e t i m e s t e p f o r e c a s t using the window x i t j x i t j 1 x i t x i t d 1 x i t d for the precipitation and evapotranspiration and y i t y i t d 1 y i t d for the antecedent water table value multi step forecast of 1 12 24 36 and 48 time steps were used for forecasting water table depth in each observation well p1 p2 and p3 according to the number of time steps to be forecasted t 1 t 12 t 24 t 36 a n d t 48 the number of input features was between 77 and 171 and one output value to predict for each training pattern 2 4 2 data splitting the experimental dataset consisted of 1280 hourly observations for each variable p et and wtd ranging from the 8 july 2017 to 30 august 2017 which is the cranberry growth period this dataset has been split by the holdout method using the createdatapartition caret package function kuhn 2008 in two subsets a training subset which contained 70 of data randomly selected for each dataset and the remaining 30 were used as test subset for each step ahead prediction this data division was repeated 30 times using a uniform distribution this allows the models to be trained and validated with a total of 30 different training and test subsets for each training pattern t 1 t 12 and to reduce the variability of their results 2 4 3 model calibration and validation the calibration procedure aims to optimize a set of model parameter values that enable the model to map the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a given dataset wu et al 2014 for the rf model two parameters ntree and mtry have been settled using results and recommendations from the literature in regression problems the default value for mtry is one third of the total number of variables liaw and wiener 2002 we have used a value of 1000 for the number of trees ntree this value is based on the study of rodriguez galiano et al 2014 which showed that ntree value of 1000 results in low and stable generalization error for the xgb model we have optimized the parameters using a sequential procedure first we used the default parameters max depth md 6 subsample ss 1 min child weight mw 1 gamma γ 0 and colsample bytree csbt 0 8 for introducing a random selection of features to supply to a tree the learning rate lr value was set to 0 009 because low values of lr lr 0 1 improve the model predictive accuracy elith et al 2008 the starting value of the number of iterations nrounds was set to 3500 because low value of l r require a high number of iterations freeman et al 2016 elith et al 2008 recommend models with at least 1000 iterations to obtain xgb models with balanced learning rate and number of iterations nrounds then we performed a k fold cross validation with k 5 at each boosting iteration to identify the optimal number of iterations subsequently the tree complexity was optimized using different values for max depth md 3 4 5 6 at each training pattern the gamma parameter has been activated or not to prevent overfitting the gamma values were 5 or 10 based on the difference between training error and test error the model was adjusted and trained using the training data to determine the optimal parameter values that minimize the training and testing error the test data were used to assess the generalization ability of the trained model an essential step to evaluate the model quality and accuracy with data that were not used in the training step 2 4 4 importance of predictor variables rf and xgb provide estimates of features importance from the trained model which allows for the comparison of input variables predictive power to this end rf uses two parameters mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in node impurity the first parameter is based on how the accuracy decreases when the variable is excluded the mean decrease in node impurity measures the reduction of heterogeneity defined from the gini criteria breiman 2001 the gini importance is a measure of the contribution of each variable in the node splitting process the impurity importance for each variable is computed by the sum of all impurity decrease measures of all nodes in the forest at which a split on these variables has been conducted normalized by the number of trees nembrini et al 2018 xgb also outputs the contribution score of the input variables to evaluate their significance in the final prediction model the relative importance of a variable is determined by a measure of its relevance squared based on the number of times it was selected in the splitting process weighted by the squared improvement to the model of each split and averaged over all trees friedman and meulman 2003 in this study to determine the features importance in the rf model the mean decrease in node impurity parameter was used this parameter enables the rf model to estimate the features importance in the same way as the xgb model rf provides the absolute importance of the predictors in the construction of the decision trees within the model however the xgb model estimates the relative importance of each predictor variable the relative influence of each variable of xgb model is scaled so that the sum adds to 100 with higher numbers indicating a stronger influence on the response elith et al 2008 to compare importance scores of the two models we scaled the predictor variables importance of the rf model to have a sum of 100 2 5 performance criteria three statistical evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the models rf and xgb predictive power and efficiency the root mean square error rmse 5 r m s e i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 6 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 and the coefficient of determination 7 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i 2 i 1 n y ˆ i 2 n where y i are the observed data y ˆ i are the simulated data y i is the mean of observed values and n the number of observations for a model to yield a good fit between simulated and observed data the rmse should be close to zero and nse and r2 close to one in this study rmse and nse statistics are used to measure the model performance for forecasting water table depth whereas r2 is used to analyze the linear regression goodness of fit between observed and simulated data a model which systematically over or underpredicts all the time will still result in good r2 values close to one even if all predictions were wrong krause et al 2005 thus the intercept and the slope of the regression are provided as an additional information for which r2 is calculated for a model goodness of fit the intercept and gradient should be close to zero and one respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater movement observed water table depths in the wells p1 p2 and p3 precipitation p and evapotranspiration et are shown from july 8 to august 30 2017 in fig 3 mean water table depth below the soil surface was 66 5 55 3 and 67 3 cm with a coefficient of variation of 10 31 16 84 and 13 25 for p1 p2 and p3 respectively the mean precipitation rate standard deviation was 0 17 0 70 mm h 1 and the mean evapotranspiration rate was 0 16 0 17 mm h 1 the difference in water table depth responses to precipitation from well to well may be due to the difference in soil hydraulic properties and natural drainage of underlying soil layers although the fluctuations of groundwater level are affected by soil water holding capacity sharda et al 2006 singh et al 2019 cranberry fields are typically highly constructed and accordingly their soil texture is often assumed to be uniform or is characterized by minor variations under unsaturated conditions gumiere et al 2014 furthermore the data driven models adopted in this paper are site specific thus including soil texture is assumed to have minimal impact on the results fig 3a shows an agreement between individual rainfall and water table depth variation the water table levels increased after a significant rainfall or irrigation events most of the recharge due to precipitation appears to take place within few hours of rainfall or irrigation we found that the average wtd at all three wells at time t is positively correlated with average precipitation fig 4 with a certain lag time the maximum correlation coefficient is 0 62 for a 24 h lag this high correlation between the wtd and precipitation can be attributed to the high permeability k s a t 19 41 c m h 1 of the sandy soil and the shallow unconfined aquifer in this study area contrarily during periods of zero precipitation rainfall and irrigation the water table decreased due to drainage effect of the site and evapotranspiration the maximum correlation coefficient between the three well average wtd and mean evapotranspiration is 0 16 for a 27 h lag fig 4 therefore water table depth was weakly correlated to evapotranspiration the deeper water table recorded for hours without precipitation fig 3a means that the soil profile is under drainage conditions as found by bigah et al 2019 in the studied cranberry fields the observed water table depth variations are the result of a dynamic equilibrium between recharge due to significant precipitation and the discharge drainage and evapotranspiration resulting in changes in groundwater storage chen et al 2002 3 2 models parameterization during the calibration stage the rf and xgb parameters were adjusted to minimize the overtraining risk of decision trees algorithms for rf the values of mtry was 1 3 m ntree was 1000 and nodesize was one where m is the total number input variables the parameters that showed the best xgb model are given in table 1 these parameters resulted in the best performance of the xgb model during training and test period 3 3 comparison of rf and xgb models the predictive performance statistics of rf and xgb models for water table depth forecasting from 1 48 hours ahead are shown in table 2 and table 3 the rmse statistics which is a measure of residual variances between observed and simulated data was good with low values during training 2 cm and testing 5 cm also the nse statistics which is a measure of the hydrological models predictive power indicated that models accuracy was high nse 0 7 in forecasting water table depth during calibration and validation period according to table 2 and table 3 the rf model yielded better rmse and nse scores than xgb in 1 h prediction however for 12 24 26 and 48 hour prediction the predictive performance of xgb model was superior to that of rf in terms of rmse and nse the lower rmse value and higher nse value during both training and testing stages show that the xgb model had better calibration capability than the rf model for the data used xgb predictive accuracy is higher than that of the rf for two reasons firstly the xgb calibration is more rigorous and has more parameters that improve the generalization error against the simpler rf model secondly predictive accuracy of decision trees algorithms is adaptively optimized by the boosting algorithm elith et al 2008 in the boosting stage decision trees are fitted iteratively to the training data using appropriate methods to gradually increase emphasis on observations modelled poorly by the existing collection of trees this operation had no equivalence in rf model water table depths for p1 and p3 are generally in good agreement because they are located closer to the south or north side of the field and that the ends of the fields are prone to lateral percolation which explains why they are lower than wtd in p2 which is in the center of the field highest wtd in p2 might also be due to drain silting and clogging which has been often observed in these fields pelletier et al 2016 since these fields are practically horizontal they should exhibit similar water table depths if the subsurface drainage system is working well the growers should remediate to this situation and then manage the whole field as a uniform irrigation unit considering the large number of fields in a typical cranberry farm it is not practical to divide the irrigation management units further than the fields for1 h prediction it was found that the performance of both models was better than prediction from 12 to 48 h the models predictive accuracy gradually decreases as the prediction time increases these results are consistent with the findings of nayak et al 2006 which showed that the performance of any model was better for shorter times ahead but becomes worse as the prediction time increases in general all models displayed good performances in terms of rmse and nse during calibration and validation steps which indicates that both methods were fully trained with the two month data of cranberry growth to provide satisfactory forecasting however xgb was the optimal model chosen to establish the hourly water depth prediction at prediction times of 1 48 hours for the three wells 3 4 predictive variables relative importance fig 5 shows the results of the predictor variables relative importance obtained from the rf and xgb models for each of the observation wells p1 p2 and p3 antecedent water table depths values were the most important predictor in the rf model with mean relative importance between 98 and 56 for forecasting 1 12 24 36 and 48 h ahead water table depth the effect of precipitation was also considerable with a mean relative importance between 0 72 and 34 as the prediction time increases wtd importance scores evolve in a manner that is inversely proportional with precipitation the relative evapotranspiration importance was small with mean relative importance between 0 98 and 10 18 for all forecast time steps probably because et does not vary much from hour to hour compared to precipitation the same results were obtained using the xgb model with different ranks of importance for both models the water table depth fluctuation is mainly due to the potential recharge precipitation and historical water table depth the wtd was the most frequently selected predictor variable because it was strongly autocorrelated the autocorrelation coefficient acc of wtd was high acc 0 99 for t 1 and acc 0 48 for t 48 which shows that the antecedent wtd values are useful and should be considered for forecasting the target variable also the wtd fluctuation in this site is affected quickly by the precipitation because of the unconfined and shallow water table fig 5 shows that hourly oscillations in water table depth due to evapotranspiration in the xgb and rf models is not as evident as it is for precipitation suggesting that the et is not important because it is relatively stable in time nonetheless the recharge rate of water table is one of the significant factors affecting the groundwater level and it can be approximated as a function of precipitation and evapotranspiration in table 4 we compare the xgb model using all the predictive variables model i p et and wtd against one for which we removed et model ii for simplicity we only display model performance during the test period there was no significant difference between the two forecasting models p 0 980 p 0 997 and p 0 972 respectively for observation wells p1 p2 and p3 in the remaining of this paper the xgb model was consequently trained without evapotranspiration in order to simplify and accelerate its fitting and prediction 3 5 predicting water table depth once the most sensitive variables were determined we used xgb to forecast water table depth at lead time prediction of 24 36 and 48 h we consider only these time steps because they are more helpful for water management of cranberry fields fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the xgb model used only for well p1 during the testing period according to this graph the water table depth forecast for 24 h is less dispersed compared to the lead time prediction the 36 and 48 h predictions of water table depth are increasingly dispersed because the model tends to overestimate the observed dataset as the prediction time increases however the model accuracy increases slightly between 36 and 48 h predictions in terms of r2 the 48 h prediction values were overall closer to the observed values because the xgb model probably fitted better some water table depth and rainfall events for much longer prediction horizons in general the xgb model showed good performances in terms of r2 for all times ahead it was found that there is a wider dispersion around the regression line when the water table is close to the soil surface 50 cm when the water table was relatively deep 50 cm the xgb model provides satisfactory forecasting resulting in less deviation from the regression line to analyze the magnitude of prediction errors we have calculated the differences between the observed and simulated water table depths these differences presented in fig 7 is an assessment of the parametrized model that reveals the prediction error magnitude the results demonstrate that the model underestimates the high depths of the water table positive values and overestimated the shallow water table depths negative values in forecasting extreme events as found by wang et al 2018 the prediction error for the entire water table depth range is within 5 cm for 24 36 and 48 h forecast in addition we found that the prediction errors are very high in extreme occurrences the prediction errors were found to deteriorate during 36 and 48 h lead forecast for the low values of water table depth prediction errors between 25 and 30 cm in this case the xgb model was more susceptible to overestimate the shallow water table when precipitation relative importance exceeds 40 in cranberry fields the groundwater level was kept to 60 cm below the ground surface level for production purposes the low water table depth between 15 and 30 cm are rather rare because this is a rare event caused by heavy rainfall the xgb model could probably not learn a meaningful prediction for this range therefore wtd forecasting should be trained from similar weather events rainy dry to take into account a rapid drop or rise in groundwater wang et al 2018 4 conclusions two decision tree models were applied to forecast the water table depth in cranberry fields the rf and xgb models were trained and compared to perform 1 12 24 36 and 48 h ahead predictions using the historical observations of wtd precipitation and evapotranspiration as predictor variables it was found that the xgb model had superior predictive ability to produce accurate water table depth simulations for the longer periods than rf in terms of rmse and nse the xgb model was retained as the optimal model which was used to calculate the error for water table depth predictions at each observation well p1 p2 and p3 the results were moderate and within an acceptable error 5 cm we have noticed that the predictive skill of the models is lower for extreme events as our dataset includes a small number of extreme events occurrences over the period of study the issue with these methods is that they are unable to extrapolate beyond the range of values they are calibrated for therefore the models must be re trained with datasets that contain a larger range of possible values to obtain a more practical model the prediction error for the shallow water table depth between 15 and 30 cm was found to deteriorate during 36 and 48 h lead forecast nevertheless the proposed models show the satisfactory results for water table depths forecasting and offer a powerful and useful tool for water resource management of cranberry fields furthermore the importance of predictor variables was evaluated to analyze the relationship between the target variable water table depth and the set of predictors for each observation well the results indicated that the previous water depth was the most appropriate predictor to forecast the water table depths the precipitation had also important effect on the water table depth fluctuation in contrast evapotranspiration was the predictor that had no significant effect on the water table dynamics the developed models were a practical technique to represent the water flow pattern in cranberry fields the definition of other hydrological parameters such as the aquifer hydraulic conductivity storage coefficients variation and drainage rate can be essential to produce accurate water table depth simulations the xgb model offers for cranberry growers a powerful tool that can accurately simulate the water table depth it could be used as an efficient decision tool in precision irrigation of cranberry fields which provides information useful on the wtd variation dynamic for

10660,integrated groundwater management is a major challenge for industrial agricultural and domestic activities in some agricultural production systems optimized water table management represents a significant factor to improve crop yields and water use therefore predicting water table depth wtd becomes an important means to enable real time planning and management of groundwater resources this study proposes a decision tree based modelling approach for wtd forecasting as a function of precipitation previous wtd values and evapotranspiration with applications in groundwater resources management for cranberry farming firstly two decision tree based models namely random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgb were parameterized and compared to predict the wtd up to 48 h ahead for a cranberry farm located in québec canada secondly the importance of the predictor variables was analyzed to determine their influence on wtd simulation results wtd measurements at three observation wells within a cranberry field for the growing period from july 8 2017 to august 30 2017 were used for training and testing the models statistical parameters such as the mean squared error coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient were used to measure models performance the results show that the xgb model outperformed the rf model for all predictions of wtd and was accordingly selected as the optimal model among the predictor variables the antecedent wtd was the most important for water table depth simulation followed by the precipitation based on the most important variables and optimal model the prediction error for entire wtd range was within 5 cm for 1 12 24 36 and 48 h predictions the xgb models can provide useful information on the wtd dynamics and a rigorous simulation for irrigation planning and management in cranberry fields keywords random forest extreme gradient boosting machine learning groundwater level evapotranspiration precipitation 1 introduction integrated groundwater management is a challenge for industrial agricultural and domestic activities one concern is the impact of these activities on groundwater quality and quantity rodriguez galiano et al 2014 furthermore groundwater resources are growingly threatened by climate change and variability ghose et al 2010 which may lead to a decrease in the level of groundwater as a result of decreasing precipitation and increasing atmospheric temperature lee et al 2014 taylor et al 2013 in québec groundwater is the source of economically exploitable water due to its quality and availability ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2019 however its vulnerability is increasing because the agricultural sector is extensively withdrawing water to meet the current demand godfray et al 2010 for cranberry production particularly large volumes of water are extracted from aquifer and used for irrigation cranberry vanderleest et al 2016 samson et al 2016 soil moisture management harvest and winter flooding and frost protection kennedy et al 2017 these water uses result in a water requirement for cranberry production is on average around 2233 mm yr 1 kennedy et al 2017 notwithstanding its water requirements cranberry is highly sensitive to variations in soil water during the fruit growing season caron et al 2016 as an example pelletier et al 2015b reported that a reduction of up to 50 in yield is due to hypoxic stress when the water table is close to the soil surface 25 cm furthermore they reported that cranberry yield decreased by 8 for each wtd step of 10 cm for a range between 60 120 cm below the soil surface it is therefore important to establish water management methods to reduce the excessive use of groundwater in cranberry fields many studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of hydrologic processes and reduce water consumption in cranberry fields these studies sought to develop a comprehensive knowledge of water management strategies necessary to optimize water consumption of cranberry crops for instance pelletier et al 2015a and caron et al 2016 showed that to optimize cranberry yield without excess of water irrigation must be applied when root zone soil matric potential is between 7 5 and 4 kpa the control of the water table depth has also been used as an irrigation strategy to optimize cranberry yield this strategy has resulted in a reduction of 77 of sprinkler water use and in a maximum yield for a water table depth of 60 cm pelletier et al 2015b the cranberry fruit development stage from mid june to early september is the most hydric stress sensitive stage in cranberry crop growth pelletier et al 2015a 2015b however july flowering period and august fruit formation are recognized as the most critical months in the growing season jeranyama 2018 in cranberry fields irrigation is commonly applied through overheard sprinkler systems drawing water from a semi closed water circulation system gumiere et al 2014 vanderleest et al 2016 and its scheduling often requires advance notice of up to 48 h however despite the improvement in water resources management in cranberry fields no study has been conducted to predict water table depths as a function of predicted meteorological conditions predicting water table depth at different time intervals using time series is an essential tool in water resources planning kisi et al 2012 nowadays numerous machine learning models have been developed to predict water table depth these models have been grouped into empirical time series models and physical descriptive models nayak et al 2006 the physical models require an adequate definition of aquifer parameters to describe the soil subsurface spatial variability taormina et al 2012 therefore the implementation of the physically based modelling approach requires an enormous amount of precise data which is difficult to obtain because of cost and time constraints coulibaly et al 2001 nayak et al 2006 a potential solution is a data driven empirical model susceptible to provide useful results without costly calibration time daliakopoulos et al 2005 among the data driven empirical models artificial neural networks ann and decision trees are the most popular artificial neural networks ann have been used to model the dynamics of a nonlinear system for which the water table depth represents the dependent variable coulibaly et al 2001 nayak et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 coulibaly et al 2001 and sethi et al 2010 applied ann models to satisfactorily predict the influence of meteorological conditions on groundwater level ghose et al 2010 used ann and predicted water table depth fluctuations with an error of 10 however despite their performance in modelling groundwater hydrology ann present the possible inconveniences of being stuck in a local minimum and of overfitting during the training step besides their inability to work with missing and correlated data leads to complex and less precise models with long calibration time maier et al 2010 decision tree based models represent a solution to several of the ann drawbacks and are more suitable for application on small sized datasets breiman 2001 furthermore they allow for the presentation of more understandable results as well as development of models of varying complexity and accuracy they can model non linear phenomena and do not need prior statistical assumptions elimination of outliers or data transformation lin et al 2006 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 these features are keys to their widespread use in the field of bioinformatics where decisions are often needed to be made using small size data samples yang et al 2010 stiglic et al 2012 however they have been used in other fields as well song and ying 2015 for instance roe et al 2005 have introduced adecision tree based model as an alternative to ann to identify particles in subatomic physics rodriguez galiano et al 2014 developed a decision tree based models to predict groundwater pollution due to nitrate the results show that decision trees can successfully be used to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities li et al 2016 have compared a decision tree based model and ann in predicting a lake water level the results demonstrate that the decision tree model has superior predictive capabilities with fewer parameters and training time singh et al 2014 have successfully applied decision tree based models in predicting the influence of seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities on groundwater hydrochemistry wang et al 2018 developed a custom decision tree based model as a predictive tool for groundwater level suitable for situations where low dimensional input data are available additional examples for the application of decision trees in hydrology can be found in tyralis et al 2019 other data driven techniques such as genetic programming gp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis have also been used for groundwater depth forecasting kisi et al 2012 however these latter require large amount of well formatted data kisi et al 2012 based on the predictive power of decision tree models the objective of this paper is to develop and compare decision tree based models to forecast the water table depth in cranberry fields as a function of meteorological conditions precipitation and evapotranspiration over a time period of up to 48 h ahead as an initial investigation we limited the study to the most critical months of the cranberry growing season i e july and august 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on a cranberry farm near québec city québec canada 46 14 n 72 02 w in summer the study area is characterized by a warm and humid climate the normal total rainfall in june is 48 0 mm in july 75 0 mm in august 86 4 mm and 70 6 mm in september the average temperature is 17 1 in june 19 6 in july 18 4 in august and 13 3 in september station arthabaska environment canada 2019 the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 this study site covers approximately 18 ha 40 m wide x450 m long of the pilgrim cranberries variety during construction the top 30 cm of soil of the field was excavated and replaced with sand to create favorable conditions for cranberry growth and production this cranberry field is equipped with a subsurface drainage system of four drainage pipes spacing 10 m at an average depth of 65 cm below the soil surface these subsurface drains flow out into a water level control structure at the south end of the site the control structure is used to maintain a water table depth of 60 cm by adding water by gravity or by pumping from a reservoir to the subsurface and open drains because this specific depth would keep the root zone soil matric potential between 7 5 and 4 kpa which ensures that cranberries receive an adequate water supply caron et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 water table depth wtd were measured using a monitoring system consisting of a submersible pressure transducer tdh80 transducersdirect inc ellington court cincinnati ohio usa and a datalogger st 4 hortau inc lévis québec canada equipped with a built in global positioning system gps chip the system automatically reads and corrects the water pressure measurements for atmospheric pressure the pressure transducers were inserted into the three observation wells p1 p2 and p3 shown in fig 1 the observation wells are made of pvc pipes inserted vertically and at the mid spacing between two subsurface drains being in the middle of the field and in the north and south sides measurements from these three wells represents the range of possible water table depths in the cranberry field data were collected every 15 min and sent wirelessly to hortau s data management online platform https irrolis hortau net the water pressure measurements in the observation wells were converted to water level and then to water table depth in cm in reference to ground surface level which have an almost horizontal surface the ground surface level is the reference due to the fact that cranberry field have constructed with zero slope missing depth values of water table were interpolated from existing measurements with the help of cubic spline a time series interpolation technique moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 hourly water table depth values used in this study were the averages of the 15 minute measurements 2 2 2 precipitation precipitations were measured every 15 min using a rain gauge watchdog 1120 rain gauge from spectrum technology inc il usa combined with a st 4 hortau datalogger lévis québec in summer sprinkler irrigation is used for cooling crops in the study area this rain gauge also measured the amount of irrigation water the total precipitation used in this study was a combination of irrigation water and rainfall for modeling wtd hourly precipitation values used were the sums of the 15 minute rain gauge measurements 2 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was estimated using the formula of baier and robertson 1965 1 e t d a y 2 40 0 065 t m a x 0 083 t

and minimum tmin air temperatures measured by hortau s weather station which includes the watchdog 2900 et from spectrum technology inc il usa daily et were disaggregated into hourly values with the ratio of hourly r h to daily r d extraterrestrial radiation 2 e t h o u r e t d a y r h r d the extraterrestrial radiation for the daily and hourly periods were estimated using the equations of allen

3 overview of decision trees algorithms decision tree based algorithms are one of the most powerful techniques used to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data and build predictive models lin et al 2006 they are suitable for supervised learning when the problem is either classification the model output is a categorical variable or regression the model output is a continuous or time series variable these algorithms recursively partition the training sample over its input variable space and fit a simple function to each resulting partition lin et al 2006 the resulting partitions are directly affected by the size and quality of the data insufficient data may lead to overfitting lin et al 2006 kotsiantis 2013 however several methods have been developed to address this problem among those methods the ensemble decision trees which consist in creating a collection of prediction or classification models named weak learners that are combined to make a strong learner have proven effective in improving the prediction and classification accuracy luna et al 2019 boosting and bagging are the two most widely used techniques to create ensemble trees models dietterich 2000 kotsiantis and pintelas 2004 naghibi et al 2016 bagging bootstrap aggregating works by training homogeneous weak learners using bootstrap subsets with replacement of the original dataset in parallel and combines them according to a deterministic averaging process the end goal is to reduce the resulting model variance overfitting boosting also works by using homogeneous weak learners but train them in a sequential manner using an adaptive approach whereby each subsequent weak learner is trained with a new subset of the data that includes observations not correctly handled by the previous learners the end goal is to reduce the resulting model bias by forcing the weak system learner to focus on the harder samples xiao et al 2013 these two techniques have motivated the development of a variety of machine learning algorithms or methods these include a random forests rf breiman 2001 implements the bagging technique and is recognized as the most prominent algorithm for application in a wide range of classification and regression problems lindner et al 2014 and b adaptive boosting adaboost freund and schapire 1997 and gradient boosting machine friedman 2001 that implement the boosting technique the gradient boosting machine algorithms also known as gradient boosted regression tree or gradient tree boosting have the potential to effectively capture complex non linear relationships between two variables y x and have shown considerable success in various practical applications natekin and knoll 2013 they have been widely used because of their efficiency accuracy and interpretability ke et al 2017 prominent implementations include light gradient boosting machine lightgbm ke et al 2017 and extreme gradient boosting xgb chen and guestrin 2016 the latter being increasingly recognized for its performance among all the categories of boosting algorithms sharma and juneja 2019 and is highly recommended for prediction of naturally occurring phenomena fan et al 2018 we further discuss the xgb boosting based and rf bagging based methods below as they represent two methods that have excellent performance in prediction sandri and zuccolotto 2006 genuer et al 2010 guo et al 2011 sharma and juneja 2019 furthermore predictors importance can be estimated which is essential in this study for identifying the significant influencing factors for water table depth variations these methods are suitable for both classification and regression problems through classification and regression trees respectively however we will focus on the regression trees technique as we are dealing with continuous variables this technique depicted in fig 2 imposes a set of hierarchically structured restrictions and is sequentially applied to a root node up to a terminal node of the decision tree breiman et al 1984 2 3 1 random forest random forest is a supervised machine learning method consisting of multiple building blocks named decision trees that outputs an ensemble of predictive models of the same phenomenon rodriguez galiano et al 2014 each decision tree in the forest is grown with a different bootstrap subset of the original dataset that is randomly sampled with replacement lin et al 2006 the default sampling scheme for random forests is bootstrapping where 100 of the observations are sampled with replacement boehmke greenwell 2019 rf builds each tree by making them grow from about two thirds ⅔ of each bootstrap sample inbag about one third ⅓ is excluded from the bootstrap sample out of bag for a non biased estimation of the regression error when the trees are added to the forest a prediction of the out of bag oob data is generated for each tree these predictions are subsequently averaged to obtain an estimation of the oob error rate this error estimation technique is often used to estimate the generalization error of rf models and to select appropriate tuning parameters janitza and hornung 2018 such as the number of candidate predictors that should be randomly drawn for a node split which is an important step in the tree growing process breiman 2001 the rf generalization error depends therefore on the weight of the individual trees and the correlation between them the building of a regression tree follows a recursive binary partition approach starting at the root node and divides the non correlated variables into two new branches fig 2 represents the random forest architecture extracted from guo et al 2011 this recursive division is performed on the dependent variable as a function of the most significant independent variable that creates the best ensembles of homogeneous training data clusters each node is then divided using the most homogeneous among the subsets of predictive variables selected randomly at the node this division process continues up to when the predefined stop condition is reached this stop condition is important as it influences the performance of the model or tree and is often defined by the number of observations at the terminal node nodesize the resulting rf model is in the case of a regression an average of the predictions from all decision trees for rf the three following parameters must be defined the number of trees to generate the forest ntree this parameter is a determinant factor for the predictions performed with rf the higher the value of ntree the smaller the root mean square error scornet 2017 the number of the randomly selected variables at each node mtry among the set of predictive variables the minimum number of observations at the terminal nodes of the trees nodesize the default value that always provides good results in regression is nodesize 1 breiman 2002 2 3 2 extreme gradient boosting xgb is a supervised machine learning method proposed by chen guestrin 2016 that uses a recursive partitioning procedure although with a different construction strategy than rf trees in xgb are grown in a sequential and stagewise manner by a fitting a decision tree to the training data subset b fitting a loss function a measure of the difference between observed and fitted values to the residuals of the precedent tree and c adding the loss function and precedent tree to create the next tree xgb uses the second partial derivatives of the loss function to minimize the loss function to obtain more accurate trees the final prediction of xgb is the sum of the weighted contribution of all decision trees used to maximize the predictive accuracy of xgb the following parameters must be defined see chen et al 2015 for full details the learning rate is the rate at which the model learns pattern in training data this parameter controls the model overfitting by retarding its convergence it determines the contribution of each tree in the ensemble of models godinho et al 2018 the tree complexity max depth is the number of splits which must be performed in each tree it determines the size of the tree the nrounds parameter control the maximum number of iterations the subsamples ratio of features colsample bytree control the ratio of the number of predictive variables supplied to a tree similar to mtry in rf the minimal loss reduction gamma is required to make additional splits on a tree terminal node this is a tuning parameter to prevent overfitting the minimum sum of weights min child weight refers to the minimum number of observations required at a terminal node similar to nodesize in rf in regression tree the fraction of randomly selected observations subsample that is needed from the training data to build each tree 2 4 model development 2 4 1 input selection as mentioned above we selected the random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithms to map the relationship between the water table depth and factors affecting the groundwater level these models were programmed in r programming language r core team 2018 version 3 4 4 the rf algorithm is from the randomforest package breiman and cutler 2018 liaw and wiener 2002 and the xgb model is from the xgboost package chen et al 2015 as inputs to the models we considered precipitation p evapotranspiration et and wtd of the observation wells p1 p2 and p3 the models were built with a combination of input variables for each observation wells separately lag times of input variables were generated by means of the sliding window method which allowed to restructure these time series dataset p et and wtd as a supervised learning problem by using a size of the lag d equal to 24 this size of lag d 24 was chosen to consider the influence of the water table depth over the previous 24 h time period on the predictions we construct the decision tree models that map an input window of width d into an individual output value y

well p1 p2 and p3 according to the number of time steps to be forecasted t 1 t 12 t 24 t 36 a n d t 48 the number of input features was between 77 and 171 and one output value to predict for each training pattern 2 4 2 data splitting the experimental dataset consisted of 1280 hourly observations for each variable p et and wtd ranging from the 8 july 2017 to 30 august 2017 which is the cranberry growth period this dataset has been split by the holdout method using the createdatapartition caret package function kuhn 2008 in two subsets a training subset which contained 70 of data randomly selected for each dataset and the remaining 30 were used as test subset for each step ahead prediction this data division was repeated 30 times using a uniform distribution this allows the models to be trained and validated with a total of 30 different training and test subsets for each training pattern t 1 t 12 and to reduce the variability of their results 2 4 3 model calibration and validation the calibration procedure aims to optimize a set of model parameter values that enable the model to map the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a given dataset wu et al 2014 for the rf model two parameters ntree and mtry have been settled using results and recommendations from the literature in regression problems the default value for mtry is one third of the total number of variables liaw and wiener 2002 we have used a value of 1000 for the number of trees ntree this value is based on the study of rodriguez galiano et al 2014 which showed that ntree value of 1000 results in low and stable generalization error for the xgb model we have optimized the parameters using a sequential procedure first we used the default parameters max depth md 6 subsample ss 1 min child weight mw 1 gamma γ 0 and colsample bytree csbt 0 8 for introducing a random selection of features to supply to a tree the learning rate lr value was set to 0 009 because low values of lr lr 0 1 improve the model predictive accuracy elith et al 2008 the starting value of the number of iterations nrounds was set to 3500 because low value of l r require a high number of iterations freeman et al 2016 elith et al 2008 recommend models with at least 1000 iterations to obtain xgb models with balanced learning rate and number of iterations nrounds then we performed a k fold cross validation with k 5 at each boosting iteration to identify the optimal number of iterations subsequently the tree complexity was optimized using different values for max depth md 3 4 5 6 at each training pattern the gamma parameter has been activated or not to prevent overfitting the gamma values were 5 or 10 based on the difference between training error and test error the model was adjusted and trained using the training data to determine the optimal parameter values that minimize the training and testing error the test data were used to assess the generalization ability of the trained model an essential step to evaluate the model quality and accuracy with data that were not used in the training step 2 4 4 importance of predictor variables rf and xgb provide estimates of features importance from the trained model which allows for the comparison of input variables predictive power to this end rf uses two parameters mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in node impurity the first parameter is based on how the accuracy decreases when the variable is excluded the mean decrease in node impurity measures the reduction of heterogeneity defined from the gini criteria breiman 2001 the gini importance is a measure of the contribution of each variable in the node splitting process the impurity importance for each variable is computed by the sum of all impurity decrease measures of all nodes in the forest at which a split on these variables has been conducted normalized by the number of trees nembrini et al 2018 xgb also outputs the contribution score of the input variables to evaluate their significance in the final prediction model the relative importance of a variable is determined by a measure of its relevance squared based on the number of times it was selected in the splitting process weighted by the squared improvement to the model of each split and averaged over all trees friedman and meulman 2003 in this study to determine the features importance in the rf model the mean decrease in node impurity parameter was used this parameter enables the rf model to estimate the features importance in the same way as the xgb model rf provides the absolute importance of the predictors in the construction of the decision trees within the model however the xgb model estimates the relative importance of each predictor variable the relative influence of each variable of xgb model is scaled so that the sum adds to 100 with higher numbers indicating a stronger influence on the response elith et al 2008 to compare importance scores of the two models we scaled the predictor variables importance of the rf model to have a sum of 100 2 5 performance criteria three statistical evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the models rf and xgb predictive power and efficiency the root mean square error rmse 5 r m s e i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 6 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 and the coefficient of determination 7 r 2 1 i 1

fit between simulated and observed data the rmse should be close to zero and nse and r2 close to one in this study rmse and nse statistics are used to measure the model performance for forecasting water table depth whereas r2 is used to analyze the linear regression goodness of fit between observed and simulated data a model which systematically over or underpredicts all the time will still result in good r2 values close to one even if all predictions were wrong krause et al 2005 thus the intercept and the slope of the regression are provided as an additional information for which r2 is calculated for a model goodness of fit the intercept and gradient should be close to zero and one respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater movement observed water table depths in the wells p1 p2 and p3 precipitation p and evapotranspiration et are shown from july 8 to august 30 2017 in fig 3 mean water table depth below the soil surface was 66 5 55 3 and 67 3 cm with a coefficient of variation of 10 31 16 84 and 13 25 for p1 p2 and p3 respectively the mean precipitation rate standard deviation was 0 17 0 70 mm h 1 and the mean evapotranspiration rate was 0 16 0 17 mm h 1 the difference in water table depth responses to precipitation from well to well may be due to the difference in soil hydraulic properties and natural drainage of underlying soil layers although the fluctuations of groundwater level are affected by soil water holding capacity sharda et al 2006 singh et al 2019 cranberry fields are typically highly constructed and accordingly their soil texture is often assumed to be uniform or is characterized by minor variations under unsaturated conditions gumiere et al 2014 furthermore the data driven models adopted in this paper are site specific thus including soil texture is assumed to have minimal impact on the results fig 3a shows an agreement between individual rainfall and water table depth variation the water table levels increased after a significant rainfall or irrigation events most of the recharge due to precipitation appears to take place within few hours of rainfall or irrigation we found that the average wtd at all three wells at time t is positively correlated with average precipitation fig 4 with a certain lag time the maximum correlation coefficient is 0 62 for a 24 h lag this high correlation between the wtd and precipitation can be attributed to the high permeability k s a t 19 41 c m h 1 of the sandy soil and the shallow unconfined aquifer in this study area contrarily during periods of zero precipitation rainfall and irrigation the water table decreased due to drainage effect of the site and evapotranspiration the maximum correlation coefficient between the three well average wtd and mean evapotranspiration is 0 16 for a 27 h lag fig 4 therefore water table depth was weakly correlated to evapotranspiration the deeper water table recorded for hours without precipitation fig 3a means that the soil profile is under drainage conditions as found by bigah et al 2019 in the studied cranberry fields the observed water table depth variations are the result of a dynamic equilibrium between recharge due to significant precipitation and the discharge drainage and evapotranspiration resulting in changes in groundwater storage chen et al 2002 3 2 models parameterization during the calibration stage the rf and xgb parameters were adjusted to minimize the overtraining risk of decision trees algorithms for rf the values of mtry was 1 3 m ntree was 1000 and nodesize was one where m is the total number input variables the parameters that showed the best xgb model are given in table 1 these parameters resulted in the best performance of the xgb model during training and test period 3 3 comparison of rf and xgb models the predictive performance statistics of rf and xgb models for water table depth forecasting from 1 48 hours ahead are shown in table 2 and table 3 the rmse statistics which is a measure of residual variances between observed and simulated data was good with low values during training 2 cm and testing 5 cm also the nse statistics which is a measure of the hydrological models predictive power indicated that models accuracy was high nse 0 7 in forecasting water table depth during calibration and validation period according to table 2 and table 3 the rf model yielded better rmse and nse scores than xgb in 1 h prediction however for 12 24 26 and 48 hour prediction the predictive performance of xgb model was superior to that of rf in terms of rmse and nse the lower rmse value and higher nse value during both training and testing stages show that the xgb model had better calibration capability than the rf model for the data used xgb predictive accuracy is higher than that of the rf for two reasons firstly the xgb calibration is more rigorous and has more parameters that improve the generalization error against the simpler rf model secondly predictive accuracy of decision trees algorithms is adaptively optimized by the boosting algorithm elith et al 2008 in the boosting stage decision trees are fitted iteratively to the training data using appropriate methods to gradually increase emphasis on observations modelled poorly by the existing collection of trees this operation had no equivalence in rf model water table depths for p1 and p3 are generally in good agreement because they are located closer to the south or north side of the field and that the ends of the fields are prone to lateral percolation which explains why they are lower than wtd in p2 which is in the center of the field highest wtd in p2 might also be due to drain silting and clogging which has been often observed in these fields pelletier et al 2016 since these fields are practically horizontal they should exhibit similar water table depths if the subsurface drainage system is working well the growers should remediate to this situation and then manage the whole field as a uniform irrigation unit considering the large number of fields in a typical cranberry farm it is not practical to divide the irrigation management units further than the fields for1 h prediction it was found that the performance of both models was better than prediction from 12 to 48 h the models predictive accuracy gradually decreases as the prediction time increases these results are consistent with the findings of nayak et al 2006 which showed that the performance of any model was better for shorter times ahead but becomes worse as the prediction time increases in general all models displayed good performances in terms of rmse and nse during calibration and validation steps which indicates that both methods were fully trained with the two month data of cranberry growth to provide satisfactory forecasting however xgb was the optimal model chosen to establish the hourly water depth prediction at prediction times of 1 48 hours for the three wells 3 4 predictive variables relative importance fig 5 shows the results of the predictor variables relative importance obtained from the rf and xgb models for each of the observation wells p1 p2 and p3 antecedent water table depths values were the most important predictor in the rf model with mean relative importance between 98 and 56 for forecasting 1 12 24 36 and 48 h ahead water table depth the effect of precipitation was also considerable with a mean relative importance between 0 72 and 34 as the prediction time increases wtd importance scores evolve in a manner that is inversely proportional with precipitation the relative evapotranspiration importance was small with mean relative importance between 0 98 and 10 18 for all forecast time steps probably because et does not vary much from hour to hour compared to precipitation the same results were obtained using the xgb model with different ranks of importance for both models the water table depth fluctuation is mainly due to the potential recharge precipitation and historical water table depth the wtd was the most frequently selected predictor variable because it was strongly autocorrelated the autocorrelation coefficient acc of wtd was high acc 0 99 for t 1 and acc 0 48 for t 48 which shows that the antecedent wtd values are useful and should be considered for forecasting the target variable also the wtd fluctuation in this site is affected quickly by the precipitation because of the unconfined and shallow water table fig 5 shows that hourly oscillations in water table depth due to evapotranspiration in the xgb and rf models is not as evident as it is for precipitation suggesting that the et is not important because it is relatively stable in time nonetheless the recharge rate of water table is one of the significant factors affecting the groundwater level and it can be approximated as a function of precipitation and evapotranspiration in table 4 we compare the xgb model using all the predictive variables model i p et and wtd against one for which we removed et model ii for simplicity we only display model performance during the test period there was no significant difference between the two forecasting models p 0 980 p 0 997 and p 0 972 respectively for observation wells p1 p2 and p3 in the remaining of this paper the xgb model was consequently trained without evapotranspiration in order to simplify and accelerate its fitting and prediction 3 5 predicting water table depth once the most sensitive variables were determined we used xgb to forecast water table depth at lead time prediction of 24 36 and 48 h we consider only these time steps because they are more helpful for water management of cranberry fields fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the xgb model used only for well p1 during the testing period according to this graph the water table depth forecast for 24 h is less dispersed compared to the lead time prediction the 36 and 48 h predictions of water table depth are increasingly dispersed because the model tends to overestimate the observed dataset as the prediction time increases however the model accuracy increases slightly between 36 and 48 h predictions in terms of r2 the 48 h prediction values were overall closer to the observed values because the xgb model probably fitted better some water table depth and rainfall events for much longer prediction horizons in general the xgb model showed good performances in terms of r2 for all times ahead it was found that there is a wider dispersion around the regression line when the water table is close to the soil surface 50 cm when the water table was relatively deep 50 cm the xgb model provides satisfactory forecasting resulting in less deviation from the regression line to analyze the magnitude of prediction errors we have calculated the differences between the observed and simulated water table depths these differences presented in fig 7 is an assessment of the parametrized model that reveals the prediction error magnitude the results demonstrate that the model underestimates the high depths of the water table positive values and overestimated the shallow water table depths negative values in forecasting extreme events as found by wang et al 2018 the prediction error for the entire water table depth range is within 5 cm for 24 36 and 48 h forecast in addition we found that the prediction errors are very high in extreme occurrences the prediction errors were found to deteriorate during 36 and 48 h lead forecast for the low values of water table depth prediction errors between 25 and 30 cm in this case the xgb model was more susceptible to overestimate the shallow water table when precipitation relative importance exceeds 40 in cranberry fields the groundwater level was kept to 60 cm below the ground surface level for production purposes the low water table depth between 15 and 30 cm are rather rare because this is a rare event caused by heavy rainfall the xgb model could probably not learn a meaningful prediction for this range therefore wtd forecasting should be trained from similar weather events rainy dry to take into account a rapid drop or rise in groundwater wang et al 2018 4 conclusions two decision tree models were applied to forecast the water table depth in cranberry fields the rf and xgb models were trained and compared to perform 1 12 24 36 and 48 h ahead predictions using the historical observations of wtd precipitation and evapotranspiration as predictor variables it was found that the xgb model had superior predictive ability to produce accurate water table depth simulations for the longer periods than rf in terms of rmse and nse the xgb model was retained as the optimal model which was used to calculate the error for water table depth predictions at each observation well p1 p2 and p3 the results were moderate and within an acceptable error 5 cm we have noticed that the predictive skill of the models is lower for extreme events as our dataset includes a small number of extreme events occurrences over the period of study the issue with these methods is that they are unable to extrapolate beyond the range of values they are calibrated for therefore the models must be re trained with datasets that contain a larger range of possible values to obtain a more practical model the prediction error for the shallow water table depth between 15 and 30 cm was found to deteriorate during 36 and 48 h lead forecast nevertheless the proposed models show the satisfactory results for water table depths forecasting and offer a powerful and useful tool for water resource management of cranberry fields furthermore the importance of predictor variables was evaluated to analyze the relationship between the target variable water table depth and the set of predictors for each observation well the results indicated that the previous water depth was the most appropriate predictor to forecast the water table depths the precipitation had also important effect on the water table depth fluctuation in contrast evapotranspiration was the predictor that had no significant effect on the water table dynamics the developed models were a practical technique to represent the water flow pattern in cranberry fields the definition of other hydrological parameters such as the aquifer hydraulic conductivity storage coefficients variation and drainage rate can be essential to produce accurate water table depth simulations the xgb model offers for cranberry growers a powerful tool that can accurately simulate the water table depth it could be used as an efficient decision tool in precision irrigation of cranberry fields which provides information useful on the wtd variation dynamic for

allen et al 1998 morison et al 2008 most of the water absorbed gets evaporated from plant soil residue surfaces by absorbing heat from the surroundings the latent heat of evaporation thereby indirectly cooling the crop environment to safe limits within which most of the metabolic activities take place the crop environmental demand for water for meeting this et demand is normally quantified at a potential rate of et demand of the atmosphere potential evapotranspiration pet and calculated from weather data penman 1948 the pet definition assumes a crop that does not exert any resistance to water flow from the soil crop canopy surface that is evaporation of water is only limited by the energy available for converting the state of water from liquid to vapor however in nature many crop environmental factors resist water loss at pet rate through plant stomatal control and other soil residue related resistances to evaporation losses so the concept of pet by itself restricts its applications in estimating etc or irrigation water requirements for calculations of pet monteith 1965 offered a single layer an extended grass covered soil penman monteith p m combination equation this concept was extended to partial canopy soil by shuttleworth and wallace s w 1985 further extended to include the effects of surface residue on soil evaporation by farahani and ahuja 1996 calculation of pet for a crop in a natural environment by means of the original p m and the s w equations requires crop growth information on a daily or hourly basis besides the weather data to compute aerodynamic and canopy resistances the values of these resistances differ with the plant species varieties and cultivars climate soil water and nutrient status and crop management practices

study had been used by anapalli et al 2019 for comparing water use efficiencies of soybean and corn with those of cotton in this study we used the data collected during both 2017 and 2018 for developing an average crop kc for cotton for irrigation scheduling applications the soil type was a tunica clay clayey over loamy montmorillonitic non acid thermic vertic halaquepet with a depth of about 1 2 m and land formed to maintain a 1 slope the field was tilled at least three times per season to break clay pans bury crop residue and kill weeds this was followed by another tillage operation to form ridges for planting crops and furrows to facilitate furrow irrigations in both 2017 and 2018 cotton cv delta pine land 152 was planted at an average density of 103 740 seeds per ha on ridges with a 77 cm row spacing the crop was planted on may 2 2017 and may 10 2018 and fertilizer was applied at a rate of 140 kg n ha 1 as needed in the region the plant growth regulator mepiquat chloride was applied 3 4 times per year after the first square growth stage to control plant height and excessive vegetative growth the site is characterized by a sub tropical humid climate with warm summers and mild winters receiving on average about 1300 mm yr 1 of rainfall may to august is the core cotton growing season during which on average about 30 390 mm of the annual rainfall was received anapalli et al 2016a 2016b the crops were furrow irrigated with water delivered through polyethylene pipes at the top of the furrows roughly 30 mm of water was provided at each irrigation event irrigations were scheduled based on soil water content applied when plant available water in the soil fell below about 60 of its maximum value as measured three irrigations each occurred in both 2017 and 2018 resulting in a seasonal total of 90 mm of water each year plant heights were monitored every week for positioning the flux senors constantly in the constant flux layer turbulance above the plant canopy leaf area index lai was measured every other week using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa cotton phenological growth stages were recorded following oosterhuis 1990 table 1 being an indeterminate plant species phenological stages of cotton often overlapped so each phenological stage was measured when roughly 50 of the plants exceeded that particular stage irrespective of many plants have already reached the next stage crops were harvested 26 and 29 days after open boll stage respectively in 2017 and 2018 all crop growth measurements were repeated over 15 20 random locations across the fields seed cotton was harvested using 12 row mechanical cotton pickers 2 2 eddy covariance quantification of etc in the ec measurements speed of vertical eddy

analyzer irga li cor inc ne usa and recorded at 10 hz on a licor data logger these sensors were mounted on a telescopic height adjustable tower ec tower and the sensor height was constantly maintained at twice the canopy height above the plant canopy starting at an initial height of 1 2 m above ground at planting this arrangement allowed us to maintain the ec sensors constantly in the constant flux layer above the plant canopy which was assumed to occur at about twice the crop height above the plant canopy burba and anderson 2005 the ec tower was established in the middle of the 250 ha cotton field with less than 1 slope resulting in the fetch of the sensors on the towers to be over 200 m in all directions the eddy flux data collected were processed using the eddypro v 6 1 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software the output of the eddypro software runs and micrometeorological data collected were averaged or accumulated at 30 min intervals these flux outputs carried quality flags between 0 highest quality and 2 lowest quality flux data with a quality flag of 2 and statistical outliers beyond 3 5 standard deviations based on a 14 day running window were removed from further analysis wagle and kakani 2014 anapalli et al 2019 also latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes were cleaned to limit them within the reliable range from 200 to 800 w m 2 and 200 to 500 w m 2 respectively anapalli et al 2018b wagle et al 2015 sun et al 2010 the gaps in the flux and micrometeorological data were filled using the reddyproc package available online from the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgcjena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocwebrpackage in brief the gap filling using this package considered methods similar to falge et al 2001 but also considered the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2005 for identifying the path for analysis three different conditions were identified 1 rg is missing 2 ta or vpd are missing but rg is available 3 only the data of direct interest is missing but the meteorological data are available for total solar radiation rg air

window similar meteorological conditions are present when rg does not deviate by more than 50 w m 2 ta by 2 5 c and vpd by 5 0 hpa if no similar meteorological conditions are present within the starting time window of 7 days the size of the window is increased to 14 days case 2 the same lut approach is taken but similar meteorological conditions can only be defined via rg within a time window of 7 days case 3 the missing value is replaced by the average value at the same time of the day 1 h i e by the mean diurnal course mdc in this case the window size starts on the same day thus it is a linear interpolation of available data at adjacent hours if after these steps the values could not be filled the procedure is repeated with increased window sizes until the value can be filled

water vapor through the stomatal opening in the plant epidermal cells the process known as transpiration water is also lost due to direct evaporation from soil residue and plant surfaces and the combined loss of water to air from a crop soil residue system is termed et rosenberg et al 1983 allen et al 1998 morison et al 2008 farahani et al 2008 irmak et al 2014 hence the rate and amount of

22 c at sowing compared to 2018 28 c measured at 8 cm soil depth the plants reached the first square first flower first boll and first cracked open boll in 36 59 77 and 106 days after emergence dae in 2017 and 33 57 78 and 100 dae in 2018 these phenological stages within a season in both the years exhibited considerable overlap with each other owing to the indeterminate growth habits of the cotton plants however all the stages were recorded only when at least 50 of the plants exceeded that stage from visual observation crops were harvested on 132 and 129 dae in 2017 and 2018 respectively harvested cotton lint yield in 2017 was 1269 kg ha 1 and in 2018 was 1569 kg ha 1 maximum lai measured was 3 9 and 4 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively at around the first flower stage fig 2 however these lai measurements did not reflect the growth potential of the cotton variety used in both the years for as practiced in the region the plant growth regulator mepiquat chloride was applied to stimulate boll formation by controlling biomass spent on increasing plant height and excessive vegetative growth it was applied when the crop reached around lai 2 5 that coincide with the first flower stage of the crop 3 3 checking energy balance closure ebc in the flux measurements the ec method has hitherto achieved wide acceptance as a cutting edge science based method for quantifying mass energy and momentum transfer between the soil plant canopies and the atmosphere foken et al 2006 mauder et al 2007 in the ec system et is quantified by measuring the covariance between the speed of vertical eddy transport within the horizontal wind flow and the water vapor density in the eddy air stream a considerable amount of computing and modeling is required for solving the ec theory for quantifying et so in order to have confidence in the derived flux data it is important to check if the energy fluxes out of the system balance the heat inputs into the system known as ebc we computed the ebc using a linear regression between half hourly heat input rn go sbm sph and turbulent out fluxes h le at 30 minute intervals where rn is net solar radiation go is soil heat flux and sbm and sph are energy stored in the biomass and energy used in photosynthesis respectively liu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 anapalli et al 2018a 2019 these terms were computed following anapalli et al 2018b 2019 the ebc obtained in 2017 and 2018 respectively were 84 and 76 slope of the regression line between energy inputs and outputs expressed as percentages ebc reported in the literature differed considerably between studies and varied from 70 to 100 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 anderson and wang 2014 liu et al 2017 many attempts to close the energy balance did not result in a complete ebc from an analysis of data from sugarcane fields in hawaii usa anderson and wang 2004 reported better ebc between 90 and 92 when computed on a daily basis following this procedure we arrived at ebc of 92 and 89 respectively in 2017 and 2018 ebc at 92 and 89 in 2017 and 2018 show that the cotton et estimated in this study can potentially have errors between 8 and 11 3 4 diurnal variations in etc diurnal patterns of etc in both 2017 and 2018 were similar to the measured diurnal patterns of rg figs 3 4 in general evaporative loss of water started around sunrise about 6 00 am peaked between 1 and 2 pm and then deceased to near zero values after sunset at around 8 00 pm fig 3 the highest value of etc was observed in july when crop growth also was highest as reflected in higher measured lai fig 2 in both 2017 and 2018 lai measured in july and august were above 3 5 fig 2 measured rg in july was around 880 w m 2 in both years fig 4 in 2018 peak rg measured was slightly higher at 890 w m 2 in general etc in 2018 was higher than in 2017 though the lai measured showed slightly lower values in 2018 fig 2 this enhanced etc in 2018 appears more due to increased rg received at the crop surface possibly owing to occurrences of lesser cloud cover in the sky compared to 2017 or some other factors not measured in this experiment this enhanced etc cannot be attributed to enhanced lai in 2018 fig 2 compared to 2017 the measured enhanced etc in 2018 was well reflected in the enhanced air temperatures fig 5 daily peak values of monthly averaged diurnal etc were 0 10 0 16 0 24 0 17 and 0 16 mm per half hour in the months of may june july august and september respectively in 2017 and 0 14 018 0 25 0 28 0 19 mm per half hour in 2018 fig 2 a c 3 3 5 etc at daily to seasonal scales measured etc exhibited a high amount of variations across days during the crop seasons in both 2017 and 2018 fig 2 these day to day variations in the amount of etc were mainly due to the realized within season weather variabilities fig 1 another important factor causing these variations was the frequent rainfall and subsequent soil wetting and drying cycles figs 1e j 2 b d in both years half hourly etc time series showed highest correlation with rg r2 0 85 in 2017 and 0 78 in 2018 and least correlation with tair r2 0 28 in 2017 and 0 44 in 2018 figs 6 7 in 2017 monthly averaged daily etc values ranged between 2 5 mm in may and 4 0 mm in july average daily etc during the whole crop growth period was 3 0 mm table 2 measured etc in both june and august was 2 9 mm these variations in etc were mainly due to both the growth patterns of the crop within the seasons and the realized variabilities in weather figs 1 4 measured lai increased with crop growth to values above 3 0 observed canopy closure eventually decreasing with the onset of leaf senescence in august culminating into total senescence in september fig 2 recorded rg at the location in both 2017 and 2018 followed the cotton lai growth pattern owing to the apparent movement of the sun north and south with seasons rg increased from the cooler spring season in may to warmer summer months of june july and august and declined with time in the cooler fall season in september fig 4 in 2017 the total seasonal 127 days etc was 367 mm with a seasonal average daily etc of 3 0 mm table 2 in 2018 measured monthly averaged daily etc varied between 2 3 mm in may and 4 4 mm in august table 2 average etc for may june and september was 5 3 5 5 and 5 4 mm respectively with a seasonal average daily etc of 3 4 mm the enhanced etc in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to higher ta ts and rg fig 1a b d i in general seasonal and monthly averaged daily etr and eto did not differ substantially between 2017 and 2018 table 2 seasonal averaged daily etr was 5 4 mm monthly values ranged from 4 8 to 5 8 mm in 2017 and 5 5 mm monthly values ranged from 4 6 to 6 0 mm in 2018 similarly seasonally averaged daily eto was 4 4 mm monthly averages were between 3 9 and 4 9 mm in 2017 and 4 5 mm monthly averages were between 3 7 and 5 1 mm in 2018 measured seasonal 130 days etc was 367 mm in 2017 and 430 mm in 2018 fig 2b d the two year average seasonal total etc etr and eto was 402 664 and 546 mm respectively table 2 on a seasonal basis the measured etc was 39 less than etr between months it varied between 29 and 56 and 22 less than eto between months it varied between 11 and 37 table 3 the seasonal values of etr were more than eto by 18 in 2017 and 17 in 2018 3 6 measured kc for cotton use of a kc value from literature and a reference crop et calculated from commonly measured weather data at a location of interest provide a simple but reasonably accurate method of obtaining crop irrigation water requirements for scheduling irrigations for conserving limited water resources hunsaker 1999 farahani et al 2008 when allen et al 1998 published kc values for a variety of cereal and tree crops across the world the applicability of those values in computing irrigation water requirements across locations soils and climates was reported to lead to different degrees of error in computed irrigation schedules howell et al 2004 karam et al 2007 farahani et al 2008 farg et al 2012 payero and irmak 2013 irmak et al 2013 on a seasonal scale averaged across 2017 and 2018 etr values were 18 higher than eto and the computed kcr values were also 18 higher than kco table 4 fig 8 calculated kcr in both 2017 and 2018 ranged between 0 19 and 0 99 fig 8a c in general both kcr and kco increased with increasing leaf expansion growth increase in lai fig 8a c in general the kc curves in 2017 and 2018 followed a similar pattern and overlapped substantially when plotted against both days after planting dap and growing degree days above 15 5 c gdd therefore to obtain a general kc curve for cotton at the location we merged the two year data and an average kc curve was constructed for kcr and kco fig 8b d two year average kcr was 0 36 0 59 0 74 0 82 0 77 and 0 63 respectively at the emergence first square first flower first boll first open boll and harvest stages of cotton respectively fig 8d kco at similar stages of cotton growth was 0 46 0 71 0 89 0 99 0 91 and 0 73 respectively fig 8b the kcr and kco during the early vegetative growth stages of a cotton plant that is from seedling emergence to first square growth stage is lower than other stages and followed the lai pattern during this stage lai varied from 0 to 2 with bare soil exposed to the atmosphere for evaporative loss of water from the system as such soil evaporation was a major contributor to etc which was modified by intermittent wet and dry events following rainfall and irrigations and water stored in the surface soil fig 2b d with increase in lai with crop growth the contribution of soil evaporation to etc declined and transpiration from the crop dominated the water flux out of the system with deeper roots and enhanced lai leading to a closed canopy during the mid season etc also peaked with similar increase reflected in the calculated kco and kcr values at the end of the crop season leaf senescence sets in which again brings down the etc so kco and kcr as well allen et al 1998 based on various sources of data allen et al 1998 presented kco of various field and orchard crops however kco for cotton presented in this study represented only the middle and end growth stages of the crop so making it very difficult for its use in irrigation scheduling for the whole crop growth period planting to physiological maturity of the crop kco representing the mid season growth stage of cotton ranged from 0 9 to 1 2 about 24 higher than the kco values obtained in our study in a lysimetric study with cotton in a mediterranean region of northern syria farahani et al 2008 found the allen et al 1998 tabulated values to be 24 higher than what they computed based on this finding they expressed the need for caution in the blind application of allen et al 1998 tabulated values for managing limited water for irrigations the kco computed in this study was 24 less than allen et al 1998 values however based on lysimetric experiments ko et al 2009 reported kco between 0 2 and 1 5 greater than allen et al 1998 values for cotton in a semiarid climate in texas usa in this experiment instead of computing eto for a hypothetical grass reference crop a lysimeter was used for measuring eto and these measured values were further used for deriving kco however allen et al 1998 and asce ewri 2005 defined kc for not real but hypothetical grass or alfalfa crops these crops are characterized by given constant canopy and soil resistances to water vapor losses from these cropping systems so in this study we used allen et al 1998 for eto and asce ewri 2005 for etr 4 conclusions water resources in aquifers across the globe are declining due to unsustainable water withdrawals for irrigated agriculture for sustaining irrigated agriculture for producing sufficient food fiber and fuel for an increasing population it is critical that irrigations are applied based on location specific crop water demands for achievable production goals crop water demands vary across space and time during the crop season depending on the realized weather and other dynamic crop soil atmospheric conditions in this study we quantified etc of cotton cv delta pine land 1522 across two cropping seasons 2017 and 2018 in silty clay soil in the humid climate of the mississippi delta this information was used for generating kc that linked actual location specific dynamic cotton etc demands with reference crop et grass or alfalfa reference crops computed from weather data collected locally computed kco varied between 0 5 and 0 99 and kcr varied between 0 45 and 0 8 seasonal consumptive use water requirements etc for cotton in the ms delta was 367 mm in 2017 and 439 mm in 2018 with an average of 402 mm computed seasonal etr and eto were 664 and 546 mm respectively on average computed etr were 18 more than eto there is a need for collecting more data and extending the study presented here for deriving long term

the ec experiment an open path infrared gas analyzer and a sonic 3 d anemometer were deployed in the constant flux layer above the cotton canopy for collecting crop canopy water flux data using the

agriculture it is critical that irrigation we apply is based on accurate information on location specific etc demands shiklomanov 2000 the etc at specific locations is dynamic and depends mainly on the weather crop type and variety and soil properties among many other crop characteristics farahani et al 2008 li et al 2008 irmak et al 2012 2013 2014 anapalli et al 2018b 2019 when crop growth and productivity mainly depend on the water available for meeting their etc demands about 1 of the water absorbed by the plant from the soil is only used in its metabolic activities rosenberg et al 1983 allen et al 1998 morison et al 2008 most of the water absorbed gets evaporated from plant soil residue surfaces by absorbing heat from the surroundings the latent heat of evaporation thereby indirectly cooling the crop environment to safe limits within which most of the metabolic activities take place the crop environmental demand for water for meeting this et demand is normally quantified at a potential rate of et demand of the atmosphere potential evapotranspiration pet and calculated from weather data penman 1948 the pet definition assumes a crop that does not exert any resistance to water flow from the soil crop canopy surface that is evaporation of water is only limited by the energy available for converting the state of water from liquid to vapor however in nature many crop environmental factors resist water loss at pet rate through plant stomatal control and other soil residue related resistances to evaporation losses so the concept of pet by itself restricts its applications in estimating etc or irrigation water requirements for calculations of pet monteith 1965 offered a single layer an extended grass covered soil penman monteith p m combination equation this concept was extended to partial canopy soil by shuttleworth and wallace s w 1985 further extended to include the effects of surface residue on soil evaporation by farahani and ahuja 1996 calculation of pet for a crop in a natural environment by means of the original p m and the s w equations requires crop growth information on a daily or hourly basis besides the weather data to compute aerodynamic and canopy resistances the values of these resistances differ with the plant species varieties and cultivars climate soil water and nutrient status and crop management practices that are difficult to quantify accurately for water management applications therefore for irrigation water management doorenbos and pruit 1977 offered a two step approach to etc et is initially calculated for a single reference crop etref a hypothetical crop with known canopy soil resistances and then modified with experimentally real world obtained crop coefficients kc to estimate etc of

kco for a variety of field and tree crops fully irrigated short grass 0 12 m tall kco and alfalfa 0 50 m tall kcr with full canopy cover are two mainly accepted reference crops the asce ewri 2005 presented etr computation methods and kc values for a variety of plants and conditions when allen et al 1998 provide kco for many crops including cotton those values were reported to be inadequate in calculating optimum irrigation water requirements for optimum crop production irmak et al 2013 reported significant differences between the allen et al 1998 and measured kco using lysimeters for soybean in south central nebraska s soil climate and management practices in a lysimetric study with cotton in the mediterranean region of northern syria farahani et al 2008 reported 24 lower mid season cotton kco than allen et al 1998 tabulated values in various studies using either ec or lysimeters with various field crops karam et al 2007 farg et al 2012 payero and irmak 2013 and sánchez et al 2015 also reported significantly lower kco in experiments compared to allen et al 1998 in various climates across the world considering these findings we conclude that in general there is a need for developing location specific crop soil climate specific kc for crops and their cultivars for limited irrigation water management for limited water irrigation management in water scarce environments allen et al 1998 also proposed a dual kc approach for etc estimation a basal crop coefficient kcb representing the plant transpiration contribution to etc and a ks representing the soil surface evaporation during the initial growth of a crop with partial canopy covered dry soil surfaces however in the humid climate of the mississippi delta with plenty of spring rainfall during the initial growth period of the crop plant growth is not normally affected by dry soil surface so a single kc is still preferred for optimum growth benefits of the crops anapalli et al 2016a b for

developing and disseminating irrigation schedules based on location specific crop etc demands and water supply scenarios can help in conserving the msrvaa for sustainable irrigated agricultural

alfalfa reference crop et data 2 materials and methods 2 1 cotton experiment the experiments for this study were conducted in 2017 and 2018 on a commercial producer s 250 ha field located about 1 km from the usda agricultural research service crop production systems research unit s farm at stoneville mississippi usa 33 42 n 90 55 w 32 m elevation above sea level the data collected in 2017 in this study had been used by anapalli et al 2019 for comparing water use efficiencies of soybean and corn with those of cotton in this study we used the data collected during both 2017 and 2018 for developing an average crop kc for cotton for irrigation scheduling applications the soil type was a tunica clay clayey over loamy montmorillonitic non acid thermic vertic halaquepet with a depth of about 1 2 m and land formed to maintain a 1 slope the field was tilled at least three times per season to break clay pans bury crop residue and kill weeds this was followed by another tillage operation to form ridges for planting crops and furrows to facilitate furrow irrigations in both 2017 and 2018 cotton cv delta pine land 152 was planted at an average density of 103 740 seeds per ha on ridges with a 77 cm row spacing the crop was planted on may 2 2017 and may 10 2018 and fertilizer was applied at a rate of 140 kg n ha 1 as needed in the region the plant growth regulator mepiquat chloride was applied 3 4 times per year after the first square growth stage to control plant height and excessive vegetative growth the site is characterized by a sub tropical humid climate with warm summers and mild winters receiving on average about 1300 mm yr 1 of rainfall may to august is the core cotton growing season during which on average about 30 390 mm of the annual rainfall was received anapalli et al 2016a 2016b the crops were furrow irrigated with water delivered through polyethylene pipes at the top of the furrows roughly 30 mm of water was provided at each irrigation event irrigations were scheduled based on soil water content applied when plant available water in the soil fell below about 60 of its maximum value as measured three irrigations each occurred in both 2017 and 2018 resulting in a seasonal total of 90 mm of water each year plant heights were monitored every week for positioning the flux senors constantly in the constant flux layer turbulance above the plant canopy leaf area index lai was measured every other week using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa cotton phenological growth stages were recorded following oosterhuis 1990 table 1 being an indeterminate plant species phenological stages of cotton often overlapped so each phenological stage was measured when roughly 50 of the plants exceeded that particular stage irrespective of many plants have already reached the next stage crops were harvested 26 and 29 days after open boll stage respectively in 2017 and 2018 all crop growth measurements were repeated over 15 20 random locations across the fields seed cotton was harvested using 12 row mechanical cotton pickers 2 2 eddy covariance quantification of etc in the ec measurements speed of vertical eddy transport and sonic temperature were measured using a gill new wind master sonic anemometer gill instruments lymington uk and vapor density in the eddies using a li 7500 rs open path infrared gas analyzer irga li cor inc ne usa and recorded at 10 hz on a licor data logger these sensors were mounted on a telescopic height adjustable tower ec tower and the sensor height was constantly maintained at twice the canopy height above the plant canopy starting at an initial height of 1 2 m above ground at planting this arrangement allowed us to maintain the ec sensors constantly in the constant flux layer above the plant canopy which was assumed to occur at about twice the crop height above the plant canopy burba and anderson 2005 the ec tower was established in the middle of the 250 ha cotton field with less than 1 slope resulting in the fetch of the sensors on the towers to be over 200 m in all directions the eddy flux data collected were processed using the eddypro v 6 1 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software the output of the eddypro software runs and micrometeorological data collected were averaged or accumulated at 30 min intervals these flux outputs carried quality flags between 0 highest quality and 2 lowest quality flux data with a quality flag of 2 and statistical outliers beyond 3 5 standard deviations based on a 14 day running window were removed from further analysis wagle and kakani 2014 anapalli et al 2019 also latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes were cleaned to limit them within the reliable range from 200 to 800 w m 2 and 200 to 500 w m 2 respectively anapalli et al 2018b wagle et al 2015 sun et al 2010 the gaps in the flux and micrometeorological data were filled using the reddyproc package available online from the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgcjena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocwebrpackage in brief the gap filling using this package considered methods similar to falge et al 2001 but also considered the co variation of fluxes with meteorological variables and the temporal auto correlation of the fluxes reichstein et al 2005 for identifying the path for analysis three different conditions were identified 1 rg is missing 2 ta or vpd are missing but rg is available 3 only the data of direct interest is missing but the meteorological data are available for total solar radiation rg air temperature ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd case 1 the missing value is replaced by the average value under similar meteorological conditions i e with a look up table lut within a certain time window similar meteorological conditions are present when rg does not deviate by more than 50 w m 2 ta by 2 5 c and vpd by 5 0 hpa if no similar meteorological conditions are present within the starting time window of 7 days the size of the window is increased to 14 days case 2 the same lut approach is taken but similar meteorological conditions can only be defined via rg within a time window of 7 days case 3 the missing value is replaced by the average value at the same time of the day 1 h i e by the mean diurnal course mdc in this case the window size starts on the same day thus it is a linear interpolation of available data at adjacent hours if after these steps the values could not be filled the procedure is repeated with increased window sizes until the value can be filled

kc kc for cotton was computed using eq 1 the daily eto and etr were computed using the allen et al 1998 and asce ewri 2005 computation procedures respectively weather data collected at 2 m height from a standard weather station maintained by the mississippi state university within 1 km from the experiment location were used for estimating eto and etr and kc half hour etc from the ec system was accumulated over a 24 h period for use in the calculation of daily kc values 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather in crop fields about 99 of the water taken up by plant roots is lost to the air as water vapor through the stomatal opening in the plant epidermal cells the process known as transpiration water is also lost due to direct evaporation from soil residue and plant surfaces and the combined loss of water to air from a crop soil residue system is termed et rosenberg et al 1983 allen et al 1998 morison et al 2008 farahani et al 2008 irmak et al 2014 hence the rate and amount of

further declined to 24 c at harvest in september fig 1g in 2017 daily maximum ta tx varied from 32 c in may to a seasonal maximum value of 35 c in august and 29 c at harvest in september daily tx in

hpa fig 1c in 2018 half hour average vpd varied between 9 38 hpa during the crop season fig 1h the temperature at 8 cm soil depth increased from 24 c to 36 c in august and decreased to 27 c at harvest in september fig 1d i rainfall received during the crop growth period in 2017 132 days from may 2 to september 23 and 2018 129 days from may 10 to september 23 were 719 mm and 542 mm respectively fig 1e j these rainfalls were fairly uniform through the crop growing period enabling the crop to grow without substantial water stress by providing just 30 mm irrigation three times in each of the two years the number of rainy days during the crop growth period in 2017 was 63 days and in 2018 was 49 days 3 2 cotton performance in the experiments cotton seeds were sown on may 2 in 2017 and may 10 in 2018 and both these days were preceded with enough rainfall 78 mm in the 2 week period before planting in 2017 and 113 mm in 2 week period in 2018 for the seeds to imbibe sufficient moisture sprout and emerge from the soil and establish fairly uniform crop stands thereby establishing a uniform crop stand across the fetch area for the ec flux instruments anapalli et al 2018b 2019 burba and anderson 2005 foken 2008 cotton seeds emerged from the soil after 12 days in 2017 and after 9 days in 2018 table 1 the three day delay for seedling emergence in 2017 was due to lower soil temperatures 22 c at sowing compared to 2018 28 c measured at 8 cm soil depth the plants reached the first square first flower first boll and first cracked open boll in 36 59 77 and 106 days after emergence dae in 2017 and 33 57 78 and 100 dae in 2018 these phenological stages within a season in both the years exhibited considerable overlap with each other owing to the indeterminate growth habits of the cotton plants however all the stages were recorded only when at least 50 of the plants exceeded that stage from visual observation crops were harvested on 132 and 129 dae in 2017 and 2018 respectively harvested cotton lint yield in 2017 was 1269 kg ha 1 and in 2018 was 1569 kg ha 1 maximum lai measured was 3 9 and 4 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively at around the first flower stage fig 2 however these lai measurements did not reflect the growth potential of the cotton variety used in both the years for as practiced in the region the plant growth regulator mepiquat chloride was applied to stimulate boll formation by controlling biomass spent on increasing plant height and excessive vegetative growth it was applied when the crop reached around lai 2 5 that coincide with the first flower stage of the crop 3 3 checking energy balance closure ebc in the flux measurements the ec method has hitherto achieved wide acceptance as a cutting edge science based method for quantifying mass energy and momentum transfer between the soil plant canopies and the atmosphere foken et al 2006 mauder et al 2007 in the ec system et is quantified by measuring the covariance between the speed of vertical eddy transport within the horizontal wind flow and the water vapor density in the eddy air stream a considerable amount of computing and modeling is required for solving the ec theory for quantifying et so in order to have confidence in the derived flux data it is important to check if the energy fluxes out of the system balance the heat inputs into the system known as ebc we computed the ebc using a linear regression between half hourly heat input rn go sbm sph and turbulent out fluxes h le at 30 minute intervals where rn is net solar radiation go is soil heat flux and sbm and sph are energy stored in the biomass and energy used in photosynthesis respectively liu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 anapalli et al 2018a 2019 these terms were computed following anapalli et al 2018b 2019 the ebc obtained in 2017 and 2018 respectively were 84 and 76 slope of the regression line between energy inputs and outputs expressed as percentages ebc reported in the literature differed considerably between studies and varied from 70 to 100 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 anderson and wang 2014 liu et al 2017 many attempts to close the energy balance did not result in a complete ebc from an analysis of data from sugarcane fields in hawaii usa anderson and wang 2004 reported better ebc between 90 and 92 when computed on a daily basis following this procedure we arrived at ebc of 92 and 89 respectively in 2017 and 2018 ebc at 92 and 89 in 2017 and 2018 show that the cotton et estimated in this study can potentially have errors between 8 and 11 3 4 diurnal variations in etc diurnal patterns of etc in both 2017 and 2018 were similar to the measured diurnal patterns of rg figs 3 4 in general evaporative loss of water started around sunrise about 6 00 am peaked between 1 and 2 pm and then deceased to near zero values after sunset at around 8 00 pm fig 3 the highest value of etc was observed in july when crop growth also was highest as reflected in higher measured lai fig 2 in both 2017 and 2018 lai measured in july and august were above 3 5 fig 2 measured rg in july was around 880 w m 2 in both years fig 4 in 2018 peak rg measured was slightly higher at 890 w m 2 in general etc in 2018 was higher than in 2017 though the lai measured showed slightly lower values in 2018 fig 2 this enhanced etc in 2018 appears more due to increased rg received at the crop surface possibly owing to occurrences of lesser cloud cover in the sky compared to 2017 or some other factors not measured in this experiment this enhanced etc cannot be attributed to enhanced lai in 2018 fig 2 compared to 2017 the measured enhanced etc in 2018 was well reflected in the enhanced air temperatures fig 5 daily peak values of monthly averaged diurnal etc were 0 10 0 16 0 24 0 17 and 0 16 mm per half hour in the months of may june july august and september respectively in 2017 and 0 14 018 0 25 0 28 0 19 mm per half hour in 2018 fig 2 a c 3 3 5 etc at daily to seasonal scales measured etc exhibited a high amount of variations across days during the crop seasons in both 2017 and 2018 fig 2 these day to day variations in the amount of etc were mainly due to the realized within season weather variabilities fig 1 another important factor causing these variations was the frequent rainfall and subsequent soil wetting and drying cycles figs 1e j 2 b d in both years half hourly etc time series showed highest correlation with rg r2 0 85 in 2017 and 0 78 in 2018 and least correlation with tair r2 0 28 in 2017 and 0 44 in 2018 figs 6 7 in 2017 monthly averaged daily etc values ranged between 2 5 mm in may and 4 0 mm in july average daily etc during the whole crop growth period was 3 0 mm table 2 measured etc in both june and august was 2 9 mm these variations in etc were mainly due to both the growth patterns of the crop within the seasons and the realized variabilities in weather figs 1 4 measured lai increased with crop growth to values above 3 0 observed canopy closure eventually decreasing with the onset of leaf senescence in august culminating into total senescence in september fig 2 recorded rg at the location in both 2017 and 2018 followed the cotton lai growth pattern owing to the apparent movement of the sun north and south with seasons rg increased from the cooler spring season in may to warmer summer months of june july and august and declined with time in the cooler fall season in september fig 4 in 2017 the total seasonal 127 days etc was 367 mm with a seasonal average daily etc of 3 0 mm table 2 in 2018 measured monthly averaged daily etc varied between 2 3 mm in may and 4 4 mm in august table 2 average etc for may june and september was 5 3 5 5 and 5 4 mm respectively with a seasonal average daily etc of 3 4 mm the enhanced etc in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to higher ta ts and rg fig 1a b d i in general seasonal and monthly averaged daily etr and eto did not differ substantially between 2017 and 2018 table 2 seasonal averaged daily etr was 5 4 mm monthly values ranged from 4 8 to 5 8 mm in 2017 and 5 5 mm monthly values ranged from 4 6 to 6 0 mm in 2018 similarly seasonally averaged daily eto was 4 4 mm monthly averages were between 3 9 and 4 9 mm in 2017 and 4 5 mm monthly averages were between 3 7 and 5 1 mm in 2018 measured seasonal 130 days etc was 367 mm in 2017 and 430 mm in 2018 fig 2b d the two year average seasonal total etc etr and eto was 402 664 and 546 mm respectively table 2 on a seasonal basis the measured etc was 39 less than etr between months it varied between 29 and 56 and 22 less than eto between months it varied between 11 and 37 table 3 the seasonal values of etr were more than eto by 18 in 2017 and 17 in 2018 3 6 measured kc for cotton use of a kc value from literature and a reference crop et calculated from commonly measured weather data at a location of interest provide a simple but reasonably accurate method of obtaining crop irrigation water requirements for scheduling irrigations for conserving limited water resources hunsaker 1999 farahani et al 2008 when allen et al 1998 published kc values for a variety of cereal and tree crops across the world the applicability of those values in computing irrigation water requirements across locations soils and climates was reported to lead to different degrees of error in computed irrigation schedules howell et al 2004 karam et al 2007 farahani et al 2008 farg et al 2012 payero and irmak 2013 irmak et al 2013 on a seasonal scale averaged across 2017 and 2018 etr values were 18 higher than eto and the computed kcr values were also 18 higher than kco table 4 fig 8 calculated kcr in both 2017 and 2018 ranged between 0 19 and 0 99 fig 8a c in general both kcr and kco increased with increasing leaf expansion growth increase in lai fig 8a c in general the kc curves in 2017 and 2018 followed a similar pattern and overlapped substantially when plotted against both days after planting dap and growing degree days above 15 5 c gdd therefore to obtain a general kc curve for cotton at the location we merged the two year data and an average kc curve was constructed for kcr and kco fig 8b d two year average kcr was 0 36 0 59 0 74 0 82 0 77 and 0 63 respectively at the emergence first square first flower first boll first open boll and harvest stages of cotton respectively fig 8d kco at similar stages of cotton growth was 0 46 0 71 0 89 0 99 0 91 and 0 73 respectively fig 8b the kcr and kco during the early vegetative growth stages of a cotton plant that is from seedling emergence to first square growth stage is lower than other stages and followed the lai pattern during this stage lai varied from 0 to 2 with bare soil exposed to the atmosphere for evaporative loss of water from the system as such soil evaporation was a major contributor to etc which was modified by intermittent wet and dry events following rainfall and irrigations and water stored in the surface soil fig 2b d with increase in lai with crop growth the contribution of soil evaporation to etc declined and transpiration from the crop dominated the water flux out of the system with deeper roots and enhanced lai leading to a closed canopy during the mid season etc also peaked with similar increase reflected in the calculated kco and kcr values at the end of the crop season leaf senescence sets in which again brings down the etc so kco and kcr as well allen et al 1998 based on various sources of data allen et al 1998 presented kco of various field and orchard crops however kco for cotton presented in this study represented only the middle and end growth stages of the crop so making it very difficult for its use in irrigation scheduling for the whole crop growth period planting to physiological maturity of the crop kco representing the mid season growth stage of cotton ranged from 0 9 to 1 2 about 24 higher than the kco values obtained in our study in a lysimetric study with cotton in a mediterranean region of northern syria farahani et al 2008 found the allen et al 1998 tabulated values to be 24 higher than what they computed based on this finding they expressed the need for caution in the blind application of allen et al 1998 tabulated values for managing limited water for irrigations the kco computed in this study was 24 less than allen et al 1998 values however based on lysimetric experiments ko et al 2009 reported kco between 0 2 and 1 5 greater than allen et al 1998 values for cotton in a semiarid climate in texas usa in this experiment instead of computing eto for a hypothetical grass reference crop a lysimeter was used for measuring eto and these measured values were further used for deriving kco however allen et al 1998 and asce ewri 2005 defined kc for not real but hypothetical grass or alfalfa crops these crops are characterized by given constant canopy and soil resistances to water vapor losses from these cropping systems so in this study we used allen et al 1998 for eto and asce ewri 2005 for etr 4 conclusions water resources in aquifers across the globe are declining due to unsustainable water withdrawals for irrigated agriculture for sustaining irrigated agriculture for producing sufficient food fiber and fuel for an increasing population it is critical that irrigations are applied based on location specific crop water demands for achievable production goals crop water demands vary across space and time during the crop season depending on the realized weather and other dynamic crop soil atmospheric conditions in this study we quantified etc of cotton cv delta pine land 1522 across two cropping seasons 2017 and 2018 in silty clay soil in the humid climate of the mississippi delta this information was used for generating kc that linked actual location specific dynamic cotton etc demands with reference crop et grass or alfalfa reference crops computed from weather data collected locally computed kco varied between 0 5 and 0 99 and kcr varied between 0 45 and 0 8 seasonal consumptive use water requirements etc for cotton in the ms delta was 367 mm in 2017 and 439 mm in 2018 with an average of 402 mm computed seasonal etr and eto were 664 and 546 mm respectively on average computed etr were 18 more than eto there is a need for collecting more data and extending the study presented here for deriving long term climate averaged etc and kc values for cotton which can be used with better confidence across different climates and soils in the mississippi delta region for irrigation scheduling applications

10662,increasing both grain yield and water use efficiency wue nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp of winter wheat is crucial to realize the sustainable development of agricultural production in the north china plain ncp this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that a trade off between yield and efficiency could reduce water and nitrogen inputs of winter wheat in the ncp wheat yield wue and npfp under three production levels i e the potential high yield and high efficiency hh and on farm and their gaps were investigated with apsim wheat model the results showed that simulated potential yields were close to observed potential yields with rmse of 1150 kg ha 1 nrmse of 12 and simulated on farm yields followed with observed yields with rmse of 576 kg ha 1 nrmse of 8 8 simulated yield gap between the potential and on farm yields was 2565 kg ha 1 averaged across the ncp from 1981 to 2015 with the highest yield gap in the central part of ncp and the eastern shandong province and the corresponding gaps of wue and npfp were 0 45 kg m 3 and 10 9 kg n kg 1 with a large spatial difference to narrow the gaps about 33 mm additional irrigation and 5 kg n ha 1 reductions from the current irrigation 242 mm and n fertilizer 267 kg n ha 1 application amounts were needed across the ncp wue and npfp could be increased by 29 and 43 from the on farm to the potential levels however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by 0 96 kg m 3 60 and 19 3 kg kg 1 77 across the ncp irrigation and nitrogen fertilization amounts could be reduced by averaged 127 mm and 89 kg ha 1 from current averaged irrigation and nitrogen fertilization amounts across the ncp especially the irrigation schedule at on farm level should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp our results suggested an explicit potential for wheat yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management in the ncp keywords apsim wheat water use efficiency nitrogen partial factor productivity high yield and high efficiency on farm yield 1 introduction wheat as the third leading grain crop in china after maize and rice accounts for approximately 11 of the total grain planting area and more than 17 of the total grain yield in china fao 2013 north china plain ncp one of the most important wheat production regions in china provided 50 of the nation s wheat grain wang et al 2012 despite the improved yield with cultivar renewal and advanced agronomic managements there still existed a large gap between the potential yield i e without stresses of water nutrients insect pests and diseases and actual yield of winter wheat in the ncp especially at the regional scale lu and fan 2013 liu et al 2016 with various approaches including crop growth models liu et al 2013 lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 bai et al 2019 potential productivity models zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 bai et al 2019 field experiments liu et al 2011a b dai et al 2013 and household survey liang et al 2011 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the yield gaps between the potential yield and actual yield of winter wheat have been investigated in the ncp ranging from 1140 to 7515 kg ha 1 water and nitrogen fertilizer were recognized as two main limiting factors in achieving potential yield of winter wheat in the ncp li et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 although average annual precipitation ranged from 300 to 1000 mm across the ncp wang et al 2010 cao et al 2014 over 70 of precipitation falls in the maize growing season 200 300 mm irrigation water is needed during wheat growing season wang et al 2008 yuan and shen 2013 in addition the total nitrogen requirement of winter wheat is about 160 kg ha 1 cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b which is not met by soil n supply without supplemental nitrogen fertilizer across the region liu et al 2006 cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b to achieve high yield of winter wheat even three to five times of irrigation with 180 300 mm was applied in some regions zhang et al 2005 2017 li 2015b excessive irrigation has threatened the sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp chen et al 2010a b especially due to the lack of surface water resource increasing groundwater use for irrigation caused a rapid decline of groundwater levels hu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 zhong et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in addition the irrigation time is also not appropriate for not meeting crop water requirement during the key growth period of winter wheat zhang et al 2005 2018a another serious challenge in the ncp is the increasing negative impacts of agriculture management on environment such as soil hardness water contamination and greenhouse gas emissions liu and diamond 2005 wang et al 2008 2017 thangarajan et al 2018 in some regions annual nitrogen input of wheat was around 500 600 kg ha 1 n exceeding the crop n requirement of 200 300 kg n ha 1 in the region which resulted in high n losses to soil and atmosphere cui et al 2008 fang et al 2013 therefore in order to realize the sustainable development of wheat production and protect the environment the optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management schedule should be identified by considering a balance between yield and water nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat especially at the regional scale with different soil and climate conditions however most researches on better wheat management in the ncp recommended optimal water and nitrogen management based on limited field experiments and at limited study sites li et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 sui et al 2015 zhang et al 2018c high spatial differences in climate soil and water and nitrogen fertilizer management practices used by local farmers caused that the results from limited sites could not be extrapolated to the whole region lv et al 2017 revealed that the irrigation amounts simulated by wheatgrow model ranged from 160 to 400 mm for wheat to reach the potential yield across the ncp household survey data showed that the nitrogen fertilizer amounts of farmers ranged from 100 to 335 kg ha 1 with a large spatial difference in the ncp liu et al 2011b huang et al 2018 fang et al 2013 recommended that irrigation amounts should be at 60 80 of the current irrigation level and nitrogen fertilizer should be only at 40 60 of the current nitrogen fertilization rate to minimiz n leaching without compromising crop yield one important issue is most of these studies focus on narrowing yield gaps by improving water and nitrogen management while few focuses on narrowing the gaps of wue and npfp between different yield levels narrowing both yield gaps and wue npfp gaps are needed to target a balance between crop yield and resource use efficiency by quantifying their responses to various crop water and n management across a wider range of soil and climate conditions therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the yield gaps and wue npfp gaps of winter wheat under different water and nitrogen management practices across a wide range of climate and soil conditions 2 investigate the limitation degree of water and nitrogen on achieving high yield and high water and nitrogen use efficiency and 3 recommend appropriate irrigation and nitrogen fertilization management practices across the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area climate crop and soil data forty six representative meteorological sites were selected from the forty

different yield levels apsim model version 7 7 tested well and applied widely in the ncp was used to simulate three levels of wheat yield i e potential yield high yield and high efficiency yield and on farm yield from 1981 to 2015 chen et al 2010a b zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the three levels of wheat yield were defined as the potential yield was simulated as the yield of winter wheat without stresses of water nutrients insect pests and diseases the amounts of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application were output by apsim model to represent water and nitrogen requirement during winter wheat growth period across the ncp under the potential condition simulated potential yield was compared with high yield record of winter wheat from regional high yield experiments and household survey conducted in the ncp during 2007 2015 table s1 on farm yield was simulated based on current water and nitrogen management practices from regional statistical data table s2 wu 2018 in general farmers applied nitrogen fertilizer at sowing and jointing respectively however irrigation times were dependent on local available water resources with four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering respectively in shandong province and henan province except xinyang and zhumadian fan 2011 jie 2015 guo 2018 zhang 2018 yao 2019 and three irrigations at overwintering jointing

with higher water and nitrogen use efficiency in comparison with potential yield lobell et al 2009 to screen the optimal water and nitrogen management practices for the high yield and high efficiency level four irrigation scenarios were used in reference to actual irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedule no irrigation was applied during the wheat growing period one irrigation for 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm was applied at sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively two irrigations for each 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm were applied at any two growth stages of sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively three irrigations for each 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm were applied at any three growth stages of sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively two nitrogen fertilization scenarios were used as 1 one n application sowing stage of total

li et al 2016a b sun et al 2016 winter wheat was planted in early to late october based on observed average sowing date from 1980 to 2015 at each agro meteorological site and harvested at its physiological maturity date bai et al 2019 summer maize was planted in late june after harvesting winter wheat and harvested before sowing winter wheat sowing depths of winter wheat and summer maize were set as 40 mm and 50 mm respectively planting densities of winter wheat and summer maize were set as 400 plants m 2 and 6 75 plants m 2 maize grew with one irrigation of 60 mm at sowing and without nitrogen stress to mimic actual production condition and reduce the impact of maize season on wheat season all the simulation scenarios were run continuously from 1980 to 2015 i e without resetting initial soil condition at each sowing of winter wheat and summer maize the yield and efficiency gaps of winter wheat between simulated yield levels by apsim wheat model were calculated as 1

the number of observations 3 results 3 1 comparison between observed and simulated yield under different yield levels fig 2 showed that rmse and nrmse between simulated potential yields and observed high yield records were 1150 kg ha 1 and 12 in 24 cities of ncp from 2007 to 2015 rmse and nrmse between simulated and surveyed on farm wheat yield were 576 kg ha 1 and 8 8 in 36 cities of ncp from 2009 to 2014 therefore simulated potential and on farm yields could be used to represent roughly high yield level and on farm yield level across the ncp 3 2 yield gaps of winter wheat in the ncp simulated yield gap between yp and yf ranged from 1743 to 3745 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 3 a with the average of 2565 kg ha 1 simulated yield gap between yhh and yf ranged from 72 to 1773 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 3b with the average of 736 kg ha 1 the higher yield gaps occurred in the central part of ncp and the eastern shandong province while the lower yield gaps were mainly in tianjin city the southwestern hebei province the central shandong province and most of henan province 3 3 water and nitrogen use efficiency gaps of winter wheat in the ncp averaged wuep f and wuehh f were 0 45 kg m 3 and 0 96 kg m 3 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 4 a c the area with higher wuep f 0 5 kg m 3 were primarily distributed in the northeastern hebei province the central shandong province the southwestern and eastern henan province while higher wuehh f 1 0 kg m 3 occurred in the southern and northeastern hebei province most regions of shandong province and the southern and eastern henan province averaged npfpp f and npfphh f were 10 9 kg kg 1 and 19 3 kg kg 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 4b d the areas with higher npfpp f 10 kg kg 1 predominantly comprised most of hebei province the western shandong province and the southwestern and northern henan province while higher npfphh f 20 kg kg 1 was in the central hebei province the northwest and south parts of shandong province the north and south parts of henan province 3 4 limitation degrees of water and nitrogen on yield and efficiency of winter wheat to narrow the yield gap between potential and on farm levels irrigation amounts need to be increased by averaged 33 mm while nitrogen fertilizer application amounts need to be decreased by averaged 5 kg ha 1 based on current average irrigation 242 mm and nitrogen fertilizer 267 kg n ha 1 application rates across the ncp fig 5 a b and fig s1a c wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 29 and 43 across the ncp fig 5c d sole water limitation mainly occurred in the southwestern hebei province the northern and southern shandong province and the north part of henan province while sole nitrogen limitation mainly occurred in the southeastern and western henan province both water and nitrogen limitation occurred in the northern hebei province the southeastern shandong province and the central henan province however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by 60 and 77 fig 5g h with reduced irrigation by 127 mm and n fertilizer by 89 kg ha 1 from the current on farm management practices across the ncp fig 5e f and fig s1b d especially the irrigation schedule under on farm level should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp 4 discussion a large number of studies found large yield gap existed across the ncp lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 water and nitrogen are the most important limiting factors in achieving the potential yield mueller et al 2012 li et al 2014 showed that the average yield gap between potential and on farm yields varied from 1140 kg ha 1 to 6809 kg ha 1 across the ncp in 1981 2010 with the highest yield gap in the eastern ncp due to inferior soil condition in our study simulated potential yield was the highest yield by meeting the demand of water and nitrogen during the wheat growing period however potential yield was difficult to obtain across the ncp therefore high yield records from regional high yield experiments and household survey were used to compare with simulated potential yield simulated on farm yields were based on actual water and nitrogen management practices from regional statistical data however simulated on farm yield at the site scale could not be compared with regional statistical on farm yield directly due to different scales therefore observed on farm yields from household survey were used to compare with simulated on farm yields overall simulated potential and on farm yields could be used to represent roughly high yield level and on farm yield level across the ncp we concluded that simulated yield gap between potential and on farm levels ranged from 1743 to 3745 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp with average of 2565 kg ha 1 with higher yield gap in the central part of ncp the eastern shandong province and lower yield gap in tianjin city the southwestern hebei province the central shandong province and most of henan province moreover to narrow the yield gap between potential and actual yields of winter wheat irrigation amounts need to be increased by averaged 33 mm while nitrogen fertilizer application amounts need to be decreased by averaged 5 kg ha 1 based on current average irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts of 242 mm and 267 kg ha 1 across the ncp meanwhile due to the increase in winter wheat yield wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 0 45 kg m 3 29 and 10 9 kg kg 1 43 across the ncp the increases in wue and npfp from on farm level to the potential level were similar to previous studies huang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 obviously it is possible to improve wheat yield wue and npfp simultaneously however continuous increase in application amounts of water and nitrogen fertilizer is not feasible for sustainable development of agriculture production in the ncp liu et al 2011b zhang et al 2013 and other regions cui et al 2010 ji et al 2014 even in current irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedules excessive use of water and nitrogen fertilizer has caused serious environmental problems jiru and van ranst 2010 sui et al 2015 mon et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a realizing crop yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management is very important for sustainable agricultural productions in these regions our results found that if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 0 96 kg m 3 60 and 19 3 kg kg 1 77 across the ncp in combination of a 11 increase from the on farm yield level accordingly irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts could be reduced by averaged 127 mm and 89 kg ha 1 from current average irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts across the ncp together with the adjustment of the irrigation time under on farm yield level from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering the decline in irrigation amounts and times has an important significance for water saving agriculture in the ncp previous experimental studies found that jointing and flowering were the most sensitive growth periods to water stress and two irrigations with 120 150 mm at the two stages could meet growth requirement of winter wheat in the ncp which supported our results zhang et al 2003 2008 2018a li et al 2010 dong et al 2011 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 moreover applying irrigation and fertilization management for high yield and high efficiency level could also increase the economic income of farmers according to the cost benefit data of agriculture in the ncp li 2019 from on farm yield level to high yield and high efficiency level the economic income could be increased roughly by 2997 yuan ha 1 including the increase in income of 1251 yuan ha 1 from yield increase plus saving agricultural input of 1746 yuan ha 1 from the declines in amounts of irrigation fertilization and labor which was slightly higher than that from on farm yield level to potential yield level table s3 obviously high yield and high efficiency level could obtain higher economic income with a lower environmental cost compared with the potential and on farm yield levels moreover the actual cost of irrigation included primarily the expense of power equipment for pumping the water and cost of labor tang et al 2019 if water price was considered the economic income under high yield and high efficiency level would be higher zhao et al 2017 therefore irrigation and fertilization management for high yield and high efficiency will be beneficial for both the environmental protection and economic income of local farmers the high yield and high efficiency level 80 potential yield level showed both lower n application rate by 53 and irrigation amounts by 54 compared with the local farmer applications across the ncp however if environmental impact costs were considered the optimal n application rate can be further reduced by 20 30 in the north china plain zhang et al 2018c our results showed that yield and nfpp could be increased by averaged 11 and 77 across the ncp from on farm level to high yield and high efficiency level it is worth noting that the nitrogen fertilization amounts should be reduced significantly in the most parts of henan and hebei province and the western shandong province partly due to higher soil nitrogen content in these regions fig 6 a on the other hand wue could increase by 60 from on farm level to high yield and high efficiency level averaged across the ncp especially the irrigation amounts should be decreased significantly in the southeastern henan province and the eastern shandong province because of the higher growing season precipitation in these areas fig 6b these study results provided more information on better irrigation and n management for wheat considering high variations in spatial and climate across the ncp compared with previous experiment survey and simulation studies e g yang et al 2006 chen et al 2010a b ma et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a this study focused on the impacts of water and nitrogen management to narrow the gaps in crop yield and resource use efficiency however other factors including cultivar sowing density crop rotation patterns organic nutrient inputs improved seed quality and insect pest management would also make significant contributions to reduce yield and efficiency gaps zhang et al 2005 2019 zhou et al 2007 subedi and ma 2009 han and ren 2011 liang et al 2011 in this study we focused on the yield and efficiency gaps caused by water and nitrogen in the ncp therefore only three wheat varieties were used across the ncp to eliminate the yield difference caused by different varieties although these varieties are representative varieties in each region of ncp li 2015a yield and efficiency gaps would change with different varieties used across the ncp which need to be further investigated for example the yield of winter wheat could be increased significantly 5 0 19 4 if with improved cultivars zhang et al 2007 li et al 2016b moreover farmers irrigation scheme would change according to different precipitation year type e g wet normal and dry zheng et al 2020 the above uncertainties associated with model inputs and processes can impact the levels in crop yield and water nitrogen use efficiency but would not change the main results and conclusions associated with water and nitrogen management across the region in total our study results provided a sound reference for irrigation and nitrogen fertilization management across the ncp to improve yield and resource use efficiency and reduce environmental cost 5 conclusion simulated average yield gap between the potential and on farm yields was 2565 kg ha 1 from 1981 to 2015 the yield gap could be closed by increasing the irrigation amounts the north part of henan province and the southwest part of hebei province northern and southern shandong province and the nitrogen application amounts the southeastern and western henan province and both of irrigation and nitrogen amounts the central part of henan province the northern hebei province and the southeastern shandong province wue and npfp could be increased by 0 45 kg m 3 29 and 10 9 kg kg 1 43 across the ncp albeit with a large spatial difference however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential yield by the optimal water and nitrogen management in the region the total irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts could be decreased by 1 55 1010 m3 and 1 67 106 tonnes accounting for 54 and 53 of current irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts by farmers in the ncp moreover optimal water and nitrogen management could reduce environmental impacts such as n leaching n2o emission usage of ground water and surface water pollution the simulated irrigation schedule showed great effects on wue of wheat across the region especially the irrigation schedule should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp our results suggested an explicit potential for wheat yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management in

10662,increasing both grain yield and water use efficiency wue nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp of winter wheat is crucial to realize the sustainable development of agricultural production in the north china plain ncp this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that a trade off between yield and efficiency could reduce water and nitrogen inputs of winter wheat in the ncp wheat yield wue and npfp under three production levels i e the potential high yield and high efficiency hh and on farm and their gaps were investigated with apsim wheat model the results showed that simulated potential yields were close to observed potential yields with rmse of 1150 kg ha 1 nrmse of 12 and simulated on farm yields followed with observed yields with rmse of 576 kg ha 1 nrmse of 8 8 simulated yield gap between the potential and on farm yields was 2565 kg ha 1 averaged across the ncp from 1981 to 2015 with the highest yield gap in the central part of ncp and the eastern shandong province and the corresponding gaps of wue and npfp were 0 45 kg m 3 and 10 9 kg n kg 1 with a large spatial difference to narrow the gaps about 33 mm additional irrigation and 5 kg n ha 1 reductions from the current irrigation 242 mm and n fertilizer 267 kg n ha 1 application amounts were needed across the ncp wue and npfp could be increased by 29 and 43 from the on farm to the potential levels however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by 0 96 kg m 3 60 and 19 3 kg kg 1 77 across the ncp irrigation and nitrogen fertilization amounts could be reduced by averaged 127 mm and 89 kg ha 1 from current averaged irrigation and nitrogen fertilization amounts across the ncp especially the irrigation schedule at on farm level should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp our results suggested an explicit potential for wheat yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management in the ncp keywords apsim wheat water use efficiency nitrogen partial factor productivity high yield and high efficiency on farm yield 1 introduction wheat as the third leading grain crop in china after maize and rice accounts for approximately 11 of the total grain planting area and more than 17 of the total grain yield in china fao 2013 north china plain ncp one of the most important wheat production regions in china provided 50 of the nation s wheat grain wang et al 2012 despite the improved yield with cultivar renewal and advanced agronomic managements there still existed a large gap between the potential yield i e without stresses of water nutrients insect pests and diseases and actual yield of winter wheat in the ncp especially at the regional scale lu and fan 2013 liu et al 2016 with various approaches including crop growth models liu et al 2013 lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 bai et al 2019 potential productivity models zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 bai et al 2019 field experiments liu et al 2011a b dai et al 2013 and household survey liang et al 2011 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the yield gaps between the potential yield and actual yield of winter wheat have been investigated in the ncp ranging from 1140 to 7515 kg ha 1 water and nitrogen fertilizer were recognized as two main limiting factors in achieving potential yield of winter wheat in the ncp li et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 although average annual precipitation ranged from 300 to 1000 mm across the ncp wang et al 2010 cao et al 2014 over 70 of precipitation falls in the maize growing season 200 300 mm irrigation water is needed during wheat growing season wang et al 2008 yuan and shen 2013 in addition the total nitrogen requirement of winter wheat is about 160 kg ha 1 cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b which is not met by soil n supply without supplemental nitrogen fertilizer across the region liu et al 2006 cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b to achieve high yield of winter wheat even three to five times of irrigation with 180 300 mm was applied in some regions zhang et al 2005 2017 li 2015b excessive irrigation has threatened the sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp chen et al 2010a b especially due to the lack of surface water resource increasing groundwater use for irrigation caused a rapid decline of groundwater levels hu et al 2005 wang et al 2010 zhong et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in addition the irrigation time is also not appropriate for not meeting crop water requirement during the key growth period of winter wheat zhang et al 2005 2018a another serious challenge in the ncp is the increasing negative impacts of agriculture management on environment such as soil hardness water contamination and greenhouse gas emissions liu and diamond 2005 wang et al 2008 2017 thangarajan et al 2018 in some regions annual nitrogen input of wheat was around 500 600 kg ha 1 n exceeding the crop n requirement of 200 300 kg n ha 1 in the region which resulted in high n losses to soil and atmosphere cui et al 2008 fang et al 2013 therefore in order to realize the sustainable development of wheat production and protect the environment the optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management schedule should be identified by considering a balance between yield and water nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat especially at the regional scale with different soil and climate conditions however most researches on better wheat management in the ncp recommended optimal water and nitrogen management based on limited field experiments and at limited study sites li et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 sui et al 2015 zhang et al 2018c high spatial differences in climate soil and water and nitrogen fertilizer management practices used by local farmers caused that the results from limited sites could not be extrapolated to the whole region lv et al 2017 revealed that the irrigation amounts simulated by wheatgrow model ranged from 160 to 400 mm for wheat to reach the potential yield across the ncp household survey data showed that the nitrogen fertilizer amounts of farmers ranged from 100 to 335 kg ha 1 with a large spatial difference in the ncp liu et al 2011b huang et al 2018 fang et al 2013 recommended that irrigation amounts should be at 60 80 of the current irrigation level and nitrogen fertilizer should be only at 40 60 of the current nitrogen fertilization rate to minimiz n leaching without compromising crop yield one important issue is most of these studies focus on narrowing yield gaps by improving water and nitrogen management while few focuses on narrowing the gaps of wue and npfp between different yield levels narrowing both yield gaps and wue npfp gaps are needed to target a balance between crop yield and resource use efficiency by quantifying their responses to various crop water and n management across a wider range of soil and climate conditions therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the yield gaps and wue npfp gaps of winter wheat under different water and nitrogen management practices across a wide range of climate and soil conditions 2 investigate the limitation degree of water and nitrogen on achieving high yield and high water and nitrogen use efficiency and 3 recommend appropriate irrigation and nitrogen fertilization management practices across the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area climate crop and soil data forty six representative meteorological sites were selected from the forty

different yield levels apsim model version 7 7 tested well and applied widely in the ncp was used to simulate three levels of wheat yield i e potential yield high yield and high efficiency yield and on farm yield from 1981 to 2015 chen et al 2010a b zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the three levels of wheat yield were defined as the potential yield was simulated as the yield of winter wheat without stresses of water nutrients insect pests and diseases the amounts of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application were output by apsim model to represent water and nitrogen requirement during winter wheat growth period across the ncp under the potential condition simulated potential yield was compared with high yield record of winter wheat from regional high yield experiments and household survey conducted in the ncp during 2007 2015 table s1 on farm yield was simulated based on current water and nitrogen management practices from regional statistical data table s2 wu 2018 in general farmers applied nitrogen fertilizer at sowing and jointing respectively however irrigation times were dependent on local available water resources with four irrigations at sowing overwintering

level four irrigation scenarios were used in reference to actual irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedule no irrigation was applied during the wheat growing period one irrigation for 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm was applied at sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively two irrigations for each 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm were applied at any two growth stages of sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively three irrigations for each 0 140 mm with an interval of 5 mm were applied at any three growth stages of sowing overwintering turning green jointing flowering and grain filling respectively two nitrogen fertilization scenarios were used as 1 one n application sowing stage of total

simulated yield levels continuous simulations of winter wheat and summer maize rotation from 1981 to 2015 at the 46 study sites were run with three local wheat varieties jimai 22 in beijing tianjin

li et al 2016a b sun et al 2016 winter wheat was planted in early to late october based on observed average sowing date from 1980 to 2015 at each agro meteorological site and harvested at its physiological maturity date bai et al 2019 summer maize was planted in late june after harvesting winter wheat and harvested before sowing winter wheat sowing depths of winter wheat and summer maize were set as 40 mm and 50 mm respectively planting densities of winter wheat and summer maize were set as 400 plants m 2 and 6 75 plants m 2 maize grew with one irrigation of 60 mm at sowing and without nitrogen stress to mimic actual production condition and reduce the impact of maize season on wheat season all the simulation scenarios were run continuously from 1980 to 2015 i e without resetting initial soil condition at each sowing of winter wheat and summer maize the yield and efficiency gaps of winter wheat between simulated yield levels by apsim wheat model were calculated as 1

the number of observations 3 results 3 1 comparison between observed and simulated yield under different yield levels fig 2 showed that rmse and nrmse between simulated potential yields and observed high yield records were 1150 kg ha 1 and 12 in 24 cities of ncp from 2007 to 2015 rmse and nrmse between simulated and surveyed on farm wheat yield were 576 kg ha 1 and 8 8 in 36 cities of ncp from 2009 to 2014 therefore simulated potential and on farm yields could be used to represent roughly high yield level and on farm yield level across the ncp 3 2 yield gaps of winter wheat in the ncp simulated yield gap between yp and yf ranged from 1743 to 3745 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 3 a with the average of 2565 kg ha 1 simulated yield gap between yhh and yf ranged from 72 to 1773 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 3b with the average of 736 kg ha 1 the higher yield gaps occurred in the central part of ncp and the eastern shandong province while the lower yield gaps were mainly in tianjin city the southwestern hebei province the central shandong province and most of henan province 3 3 water and nitrogen use efficiency gaps of winter wheat in the ncp averaged wuep f and wuehh f were 0 45 kg m 3 and 0 96 kg m 3 during 1981 2015 across the ncp fig 4 a c the area with higher wuep f 0 5 kg m 3 were primarily distributed in the northeastern hebei province the

comprised most of hebei province the western shandong province and the southwestern and northern henan province while higher npfphh f 20 kg kg 1 was in the central hebei province the northwest and south parts of shandong province the north and south parts of henan province 3 4 limitation degrees of water and nitrogen on yield and efficiency of winter wheat to narrow the yield gap between potential and on farm levels irrigation amounts need to be increased by averaged 33 mm while nitrogen fertilizer application amounts need to be decreased by averaged 5 kg ha 1 based on current average irrigation 242 mm and nitrogen fertilizer 267 kg n ha 1 application rates across the ncp fig 5 a b and fig s1a c wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 29 and 43 across the ncp fig 5c d sole water limitation mainly occurred in the southwestern hebei province the northern and southern shandong province and the north part of henan province while sole nitrogen limitation mainly occurred in the southeastern and western henan province both water and nitrogen limitation occurred in the northern hebei province the southeastern shandong province and the central henan province however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by 60 and 77 fig 5g h with reduced irrigation by 127 mm and n fertilizer by 89 kg ha 1 from the current on farm management practices across the ncp fig 5e f and fig s1b d especially the irrigation schedule under on farm level should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp 4 discussion a large number of studies found large yield gap existed across the ncp lu and fan 2013 lv et al 2017 water and nitrogen are the most important limiting factors in achieving the potential yield mueller et al 2012 li et al 2014 showed that the average yield gap between potential and on farm yields varied from 1140 kg ha 1 to 6809 kg ha 1 across the ncp in 1981 2010 with the highest yield gap in the eastern ncp due to inferior soil condition in our study simulated potential yield was the highest yield by meeting the demand of water and nitrogen during the wheat growing period however potential yield was difficult to obtain across the ncp therefore high yield records from regional high yield experiments and household survey were used to compare with simulated potential yield simulated on farm yields were based on actual water and nitrogen management practices from regional statistical data however simulated on farm yield at the site scale could not be compared with regional statistical on farm yield directly due to different scales therefore observed on farm yields from household survey were used to compare with simulated on farm yields overall simulated potential and on farm yields could be used to represent roughly high yield level and on farm yield level across the ncp we concluded that simulated yield gap between potential and on farm levels ranged from 1743 to 3745 kg ha 1 during 1981 2015 across the ncp with average of 2565 kg ha 1 with higher yield gap in the central part of ncp the eastern shandong province and lower yield gap in tianjin city the southwestern hebei province the central shandong province and most of henan province moreover to narrow the yield gap between potential and actual yields of winter wheat irrigation amounts need to be increased by averaged 33 mm while nitrogen fertilizer application amounts need to be decreased by averaged 5 kg ha 1 based on current average irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts of 242 mm and 267 kg ha 1 across the ncp meanwhile due to the increase in winter wheat yield wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 0 45 kg m 3 29 and 10 9 kg kg 1 43 across the ncp the increases in wue and npfp from on farm level to the potential level were similar to previous studies huang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 obviously it is possible to improve wheat yield wue and npfp simultaneously however continuous increase in application amounts of water and nitrogen fertilizer is not feasible for sustainable development of agriculture production in the ncp liu et al 2011b zhang et al 2013 and other regions cui et al 2010 ji et al 2014 even in current irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedules excessive use of water and nitrogen fertilizer has caused serious environmental problems jiru and van ranst 2010 sui et al 2015 mon et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a realizing crop yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management is very important for sustainable agricultural productions in these regions our results found that if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential wue and npfp could be increased by averaged 0 96 kg m 3 60 and 19 3 kg kg 1 77 across the ncp in combination of a 11 increase from the on farm yield level accordingly irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts could be reduced by averaged 127 mm and 89 kg ha 1 from current average irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts across the ncp together with the adjustment of the irrigation time under on farm yield level from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering the decline in irrigation amounts and times has an important significance for water saving agriculture in the ncp previous experimental studies found that jointing and flowering were the most sensitive growth periods to water stress and two irrigations with 120 150 mm at the two stages could meet growth requirement of winter wheat in the ncp which supported our results zhang et al 2003 2008 2018a li et al 2010 dong et al 2011 sun et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 moreover applying irrigation and fertilization management for high yield and high efficiency level could also increase the economic income of farmers according to the cost benefit data of agriculture in the ncp li 2019 from on farm yield level to high yield and high efficiency level the economic income could be increased roughly by 2997 yuan ha 1 including the increase in income of 1251 yuan ha 1 from yield increase plus saving agricultural input of 1746 yuan ha 1 from the declines in amounts of irrigation fertilization and labor which was slightly higher than that from on farm yield level to potential yield level table s3 obviously high yield and high efficiency level could obtain higher economic income with a lower environmental cost compared with the potential and on farm yield levels moreover the actual cost of irrigation included primarily the expense of power equipment for pumping the water and cost of labor tang et al 2019 if water price was considered the economic income under high yield and high efficiency level would be higher zhao et al 2017 therefore irrigation and fertilization management for high yield and high efficiency will be beneficial for both the environmental protection and economic income of local farmers the high yield and high efficiency level 80 potential yield level showed both lower n application rate by 53 and irrigation amounts by 54 compared with the local farmer applications across the ncp however if environmental impact costs were considered the optimal n application rate can be further reduced by 20 30 in the north china plain zhang et al 2018c our results showed that yield and nfpp could be increased by averaged 11 and 77 across the ncp from on farm level to high yield and high efficiency level it is worth noting that the nitrogen fertilization amounts should be reduced significantly in the most parts of henan and hebei province and the western shandong province partly due to higher soil nitrogen content in these regions fig 6 a on the other hand wue could increase by 60 from on farm level to high yield and high efficiency level averaged across the ncp especially the irrigation amounts should be decreased significantly in the southeastern henan province and the eastern shandong province because of the higher growing season precipitation in these areas fig 6b these study results provided more information on better irrigation and n management for wheat considering high variations in spatial and climate across the ncp compared with previous experiment survey and simulation studies e g yang et al 2006 chen et al 2010a b ma et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a this study focused on the impacts of water and nitrogen management to narrow the gaps in crop yield and resource use efficiency however other factors including cultivar sowing density crop rotation patterns organic nutrient inputs improved seed quality and insect pest management would also make significant contributions to reduce yield and efficiency gaps zhang et al 2005 2019 zhou et al 2007 subedi and ma 2009 han and ren 2011 liang et al 2011 in this study we focused on the yield and efficiency gaps caused by water and nitrogen in the ncp therefore only three wheat varieties were used across the ncp to eliminate the yield difference caused by different varieties although these varieties are representative varieties in each region of ncp li 2015a yield and efficiency gaps would change with different varieties used across the ncp which need to be further investigated for example the yield of winter wheat could be increased significantly 5 0 19 4 if with improved cultivars zhang et al 2007 li et al 2016b moreover farmers irrigation scheme would change according to different precipitation year type e g wet normal and dry zheng et al 2020 the above uncertainties associated with model inputs and processes can impact the levels in crop yield and water nitrogen use efficiency but would not change the main results and conclusions associated with water and nitrogen management across the region in total our study results provided a sound reference for irrigation and nitrogen fertilization management across the ncp to improve yield and resource use efficiency and reduce environmental cost 5 conclusion simulated average yield gap between the potential and on farm yields was 2565 kg ha 1 from 1981 to 2015 the yield gap could be closed by increasing the irrigation amounts the north part of henan province and the southwest part of hebei province northern and southern shandong province and the nitrogen application amounts the southeastern and western henan province and both of irrigation and nitrogen amounts the central part of henan province the northern hebei province and the southeastern shandong province wue and npfp could be increased by 0 45 kg m 3 29 and 10 9 kg kg 1 43 across the ncp albeit with a large spatial difference however if on farm yield only attained 80 of the potential yield by the optimal water and nitrogen management in the region the total irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts could be decreased by 1 55 1010 m3 and 1 67 106 tonnes accounting for 54 and 53 of current irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application amounts by farmers in the ncp moreover optimal water and nitrogen management could reduce environmental impacts such as n leaching n2o emission usage of ground water and surface water pollution the simulated irrigation schedule showed great effects on wue of wheat across the region especially the irrigation schedule should be adjusted from three or four irrigations at sowing overwintering jointing and flowering to two irrigations at jointing and flowering across the ncp our results suggested an explicit potential for wheat yield and water nitrogen efficiency win win by optimizing water and nitrogen management in

10663,although agricultural irrigation technology in china has been steadily improved for decades the realized water conservation in the agricultural sector is not as good as expected this paper examines whether water rights trading can encourage agricultural water conservation through technology improvement our fixed effects model specification confirms that water rights trading has a moderation effect on agricultural water conservation via technology improvement we further identify that the moderation effect is driven by two forces which we label as the revenue driven effect and industrial water pressure driven effect in general the revenue effect drives farmers to improve the technology however the pressure from industrial water demand has more pronounced effects than the revenue driven channel under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment farmers tend actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use even if there is no revenue driven effects in addition this paper reveals the existence of bottleneck on the moderated technology improvement due to the reduced capacity on water rights supply in the agricultural sector keywords water rights trading moderation effect irrigation technology agricultural water conservation 1 introduction one critical constraint for sustainable development is water shortage various policies related to water conservation have been implemented worldwide to save water in china agricultural water use accounts for about 62 of the total water use saving agricultural water is not only a necessary way to ensure the steady development of the agricultural sector but also the key to the construction of a water saving society however deeper industrialization and urbanization together with the increasing severity of global climate change makes it increasingly difficult to save agricultural water use policy mandates such as the central document no 1 2011 and 13th five year plan for double control of total water consumption and intensity 2016 have been issued by the central government of china to conserve water use in the agricultural sector where the improvement of irrigation technology and utilization efficiency is the key for sustainable water resource management however although china s agricultural irrigation technology has progressing steadily in recent decades the resulting water conservation in the agricultural sector is not as good as expected one reason is the existence of rebound effect gómez and pérez blanco 2014 song et al 2018 ward and pulido 2008 water saving technologies would increase the agricultural land use leading to an increase in agricultural water use the other reason is due to the technology gap between china and the world s advanced level in 2016 china s water productivity in terms of grain yield per cu m water was less than 1 2 kg m3 while the world s advanced level was about 2 kg m3 it implies the existence of technology lag between china and the world leading countries water rights trading is used by some countries to improve irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use for example san diego city and california s largest irrigation district signed an agreement on sharing water resources in 2003 and paid farmers an annual payment at the agreed price to encourage them to save water thus promoting the reduction of agricultural water use yan et al 2017 the agricultural irrigation water efficiency was also improved after south australia initiated trading in the water market kuehne 2006 the world bank and international food policy and research institute state that chile s 1981 water code can result in pareto efficiency and thus recommend the water code as a successful model for international water resources management reform particularly for developing countries delorit et al 2019 several provinces in china zhejiang gansu ningxia inner mongolia and fujian have initiated the trading of water rights step by step since 2000 in 2014 ministry of water resources selected seven provinces including ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu guangdong henan as the pilot regions to carry out water rights trading in 2016 the national water rights trading platform was established with the aim of developing water market at a larger scale according to the government document decision on several major issues of comprehensive deepening reform water rights trading is used as an economic incentive instrument to achieve water conservation therefore this paper investigates whether water rights trading can improve irrigation technology and ultimately achieve the goal of agricultural water conservation considering irrigation water use accounts for about 90 of total agricultural water use and data availability agricultural water use in this paper refers to the planting irrigation water use in agriculture while other sub sectors such as fishing graziery are not considered we extend the traditional environmental impact assessment framework to analyze the nexus between technology improvement and agricultural water use the moderation effect results show that water rights trading saves agricultural water use by improving irrigation technology we further identify two types of driving forces that contribute to the moderation effect the revenue driven effect and industrial water pressure driven effects farmers seek to update the technology driven by revenue effect and pressure effect the pressure effect plays a bigger role than that of revenue effect this paper also reveals that the moderation effect faces bottleneck for the technology improvement due to the reduced capacity of water rights supply in the agricultural sector the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the literature review section 3 presents the specification of benchmark model and moderation model section 4 discusses the main results and robustness check section 5 explores the driving forces and promotion bottleneck problem of moderation effect in the final section we conclude the paper with policy implications 1 1 literature review the literature on the relationship between water rights trading technology improvement and agricultural water use can be summarized from the following two aspects the first is the relationship between technology improvement and agricultural water use some scholars believe that technology improvement can reduce agricultural water for instance liu et al 2017 wang and zhao 2008 li et al 2014 jin et al 2018 xue and hao 2012 tong et al 2014 find that efficiency related technological progress can achieve zero or negative growth of agricultural water use heumesser et al 2012 believe that investment and subsidies for efficient water saving projects would reduce surface water use in maker field in australia graveline et al 2014 also find that a 4 increase in efficient water saving irrigation area results in a 2 decrease in total agricultural water use on the contrary other scholars believe that agricultural water tends to increase with the technological progress due to the existence of rebound effect so technology improvement will not effectively conserve agricultural water use for example gómez and pérez blanco 2014 conclude that higher irrigation technology results in agricultural water use and thus the existence of rebound effect song et al 2018 find that the average rebound effect of agricultural water in china was 61 49 based on the provincial panel data from 1998 to 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 uncover that agricultural water demand is inelastic and agricultural water use does not change with the improvement of irrigation technology ward and pulido 2008 show that adopting water saving technologies would increase the land use for agricultural production leading to an increase in agricultural water use fang et al 2020 find evidence for the existence of rebound effect on agricultural water use the second aspect is the relationship between water rights trading and technology improvement some studies show that water rights trading can improve irrigation technology for instance liu et al 2008 show that farmers were encouraged to adopt efficient irrigation technology and sell the reduced water use only if water rights can be traded between agriculture and industries otherwise they had no intension to save water liu 2014 wang et al 2017 kahil et al 2015 calatrava and garrido 2005 gómez limón and martinez 2006 gohar and ward 2010 have also empirically tested that the existence of water market would encourage farmers to improve technology especially in the context of severe climate change however there is no unanimous conclusion on the water saving technical impact of water rights trading yang and zhu 2018 zhang et al 2013 conclude that water rights trading has little influence on the agricultural sector due to the limited transaction scope and size gómez limón and riesgo 2004 kuehne and bjornlund 2006 both argue that the water saving effect of water rights trading is not as expected in consideration of the differences in water resource endowment soil climate conditions and irrigation facilities between regions to sum up the relationship between water rights trading technology improvement and agricultural water use is uncertain in particular to promote the water saving effect of technology improvement it is necessary to explore whether water rights trading can become an effective moderation factor in china to save agricultural water use by improving irrigation technology therefore this paper firstly constructs an empirical model to examine the impact of technology improvement on agricultural water conservation secondly from the perspective of moderation effect this paper verifies whether water rights trading will play an important role in the agricultural water saving by improving the technology level in particular we consider two types of driving factors of the moderation effect the internal effect induced from the farmers willingness to improve revenue driven and external effect induced from local industrial economic development pressure driven furthermore we test the potential bottleneck on technology improvement moderated by water rights trading 2 the model 2 1 benchmark model development we build our benchmark model based on the environmental impact assessment framework developed by ehrlich and holdren 1971 to analyze the impact of technology improvement on agricultural water use the framework divides the impact of economic and social activities on the environment or resource into three primary factors population prosperity per capita gdp and technology as follows 1 i p a t p g d p p i g d p in eq 1 i refers to resource consumption p is the total population a is per capita output t is the resource consumption per unit output which represents the level of technology since agricultural water consumption is affected by the size of irrigation land rather than population we revise eq 1 by replacing population with irrigation area and the revised impact assessment model is described as follows 2 w a t e r a r e a i r r g d p a a r e a a g d p w a t e r g d p a i n n in eq 2 water is agricultural water use area represents the effective irrigation area gdpa represents the total agricultural output g d p a a r e a and w a t e r g d p a are the total agricultural output per mu and agricultural water intensity respectively the above three items can respectively represent the impact of irrigation area irr agricultural productivity agdp and irrigation technology inn on agricultural water use thus the benchmark model simplified form can be established as follows 3 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t μ i υ t ε i t we define w i t as the agricultural water use in year t t 1 2 t of region i i 1 2 n μ i represents the individual fixed effect and υ t represents the time fixed effect in addition other factors such as precipitation crop planting structure urbanization rate etc can also affect the agricultural water use therefore a set of additional control variables x i t are added into eq 3 as follows 4 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t where α 0 is the intercept term α 1 α 2 α 3 are the coefficients to be estimated ε i t is the random error term satisfying zero mean and homoscedasticity hypothesis eq 4 is our benchmark model specification 2 2 moderation model of water rights trading we postulate that water rights trading encourages the technology improvement and thus affect the water use by following the structure of shen and lee 2006 the model in eq 4 is thus revised as follows to model the moderation effect of water rights trading on agricultural water use via technology improvement the intersection term of technology level and the indicator of water rights trading t r a i t is introduced into the benchmark model eq 4 the moderation model of water rights trading is as follows 5 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t α 1 ρ 0 ρ 1 t r a i t combining the two equations we have 6 w i t α 0 ρ 0 i n n i t ρ 1 i n n i t t r a i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t the model proposed above indicates that water rights trading has a moderation effect by amplifying or weakening the effects of irrigation technology on agricultural water use in the model ρ 0 and ρ 1 are the key explanatory coefficients representing the impact of irrigation technology level on agricultural water use and the moderation effect of water rights trading respectively 2 3 data in this paper we estimate the effect of water rights trading on agricultural water use in china during 1998 2016 due to missing data from tibet taiwan hong kong and macau our dataset covers 30 provinces the model includes dependent variable agricultural water use two key independent variables technology level and water rights trading indicator and a set of control variables such as the total agricultural output per mu effective irrigation area precipitation crop planting structure urbanization rate for the indicator of water rights trading tra we define it as a dummy variable similar to guo and xiong 2017 and ying et al 2019 according to the report analysis on water rights system construction in typical areas of taihu basin china s provinces and regions have successively implemented water rights trading from 1998 to 2016 this paper therefore divides 30 provinces in china into pilot regions and non pilot regions for water rights trading pilot regions include zhejiang gansu ningxia inner mongolia fujian jiangxi hubei henan xinjiang guangdong shanxi hebei and beijing which belong to the treated group in our model and the remaining 17 non pilot provinces belong to the control group provinces in the treated group start water rights trading in different years zhejiang s water rights trading started in 2000 gansu in 2002 ningxia inner mongolia and fujian in 2003 jiangxi hubei henan xinjiang and guangdong in 2014 shanxi hebei and beijing in 2016 the dummy variable for water rights trading is defined in a way as shown in table 1 the indicator of irrigation technology inn is represented by agricultural water use efficiency which is estimated by super efficiency slacks based measure sbm model the details of the model description data and the estimated results to proxy inn are shown as appendix a according to eq 3 agdp is equal to the total agricultural output divided by the effective irrigation area other control variables such as effective irrigation area precipitation structure and urbanization are selected according to tong 2014 and jin 2018 all of those data come from china rural statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook and all the variables and the descriptive statistical results are shown in table 2 2 4 empirical results the estimation results of benchmark model and moderation effect model are shown in table 3 our benchmark model shows that irrigation technology has a statistically significant impact on agricultural water conservation with coefficient of 0 25 implying that a 1 increase in technology efficiency level leads to a 0 22 reduction in agricultural water use the results show that land and agricultural output factors have positive impacts on agricultural water use with coefficients of 0 52 and 0 21 respectively therefore a 1 increase in the effective irrigation area and agricultural output per mu will lead to a 0 52 and 0 21 increase in agricultural water use a 1 increase in planting structure leads to a 0 006 increase in agricultural water use precipitation as a substituting water source to irrigation can effectively save agricultural water use with the elasticity of 0 034 since the panel data often suffers from problems such as heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation the paper uses fixed effect regression with adjusted t value by newey and west 1987 standard error s e for quantitative analysis the estimated result of moderation effect model 6 shows that the implementation of water rights trading will have a positive role in agricultural water saving by promoting technology improvement with coefficient of 0 153 that is water rights trading significantly encourage farmers to improve irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use we also adopt the other approaches to estimate model 6 for robustness check fixed effect regression with adjusted t value by driscoll kraay 1998 s e and the feasible generalized least squares fgls approach in order to avoid the problem of cross section dependence in panel data other than heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation from the results of column 4 and 5 in table 4 we can see that the results are similar with the one presented before implying the results obtained using fixed effect regression with newey and west s e are consistent and robust one may argue there exists a potential endogeneity because regions with higher water use could be induced to initiate water rights trading therefore we use the logit model to test that the provinces that implement water rights trading are an exogenous choice the index tra is the dependent variable in the model the independent variables include lagged terms of w control variables in model 4 industrial water consumption indwater reservoir capacity reservior and water conservancy infrastructure infrastruture according to the literature from the results of whole period and different sub periods shown in appendix b we can find that agricultural water use w is not the main factor in affecting whether water right trading is carried out or not therefore it can be inferred that there exists no endogeneity issue related to the water right trading index in our model 2 5 further analysis we have shown that water rights trading affects agricultural water use through the channel of technology in this section we study through which mechanism water rights trading reduces agricultural water use 2 6 the driving forces why does water rights trading reduce agricultural water use with the help of irrigation technology the driving forces of the moderation effect may come from two aspects on the one hand when water resource becomes tradable in the market farmers will sell the amount of water saved for profits a higher level of irrigation technology implies more profits from water trading which we label as revenue driven effect on the other hand water demand pressure from local industries will influence the moderation effect of water rights trading under the dual constraints of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment local government may push farmers to improve irrigation technology and convert the saved agricultural water into industrial water for industrial development which we call industrial water pressure driven effect 2 6 1 the revenue driven effect as we do not have data on detailed trading records we test the revenue driven effect indirectly by investigating the heterogenous effects of income we postulate that farmers of different income levels response to the trading revenue differently and then divide all provinces into two groups high and low income regions according to average farmer income of provinces if the revenue is the major driver for farmers to improve the technology we will find that the moderation effect of low income region is higher than that of high income region in this connection we generate a dummy variable i1 that equals 1 if a province belongs to the high income region above the national median and 0 for low income region below the national median we re estimate model 6 by including the interaction of i1 with moderation term inn tra the results are reported in column 2 of table 4 we find that the coefficient of the interaction term is statistically significant showing that the high income region presents stronger impact compared to low income regions which indicates that revenue driven mechanism is weak and only for high income region 2 6 2 the pressure driven effect severe industrial water pressure may force farmers to save water for trading by local government we test the pressure driven effect by examining the heterogenous effect of water pressure two factors are used to reflect water pressure industrial water consumption and water endowment all provinces are divided into high moderate and low pressure regions as shown in fig 1 by comparing the magnitude of moderation effect in these three regions we can confirm whether industrial water pressure driven mechanism exists or not that is if moderation effect of high pressure region is higher than other regions or low pressure region is lower than other regions the driver of pressure exists to prove this we construct a dummy variable i2 which equals to 1 if a province belongs to high or moderate pressure regions and 0 otherwise to compare low pressure region with others alternatively we also generate a dummy variable i3 that equals 1 with the high pressure regions and 0 otherwise to compare high pressure region with others we introduce i2 and i3 into model 6 respectively and take the interaction of it with the moderation term the results are reported in column 3 4 of table 4 it shows that high pressure regions have a higher moderation effect coefficient is 0 134 and statistically significant compared to moderate and low pressure regions similarly compared to the low pressure regions high and moderate pressure regions still have a higher moderation effect with significant coefficient of 0 09 apparently the above two results both indicate that industrial water pressure driven mechanisms exist significantly the result is consistent with the research of liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 who have proposed that the existence of water rights trading in inner mongolia and ningxia was exactly due to the large shortage of water resources in the energy and chemical industries so the local government actively carried out the water rights conversion from agriculture to industry for alleviating the pressure of industrial water use and promoting the agricultural water use efficiency 2 6 3 re examination of revenue driven effect the above analysis verifies the industrial water pressure driven effect only the revenue driven effect is not confirmed we now explore whether the unexpected result is because the industrial water pressure effect suppresses the revenue effect thus causing a false conclusion for revenue driven effect in fact from fig 1 we find ten high income provinces which have above median industrial water consumption and nine high income provinces with below median water endowment that is all the high income provinces circled in fig 1 are located in either high or moderate pressure of industrial water while most of low income provinces under lower industrial water pressure we also get the similar results from the significant correlation coefficient 0 214 of income and industrial water consumption and significant correlation coefficient 0 251 of income and water endowment it is likely that all the high income provinces are affected by the powerful effect of industrial water pressure in order to eliminate the potential cross impact we select the provinces under the same industrial water pressure moderate pressure 1 1 considering that high pressure areas mainly include high income provinces while low pressure areas are all low income provinces due to the unequal number of high and low income provinces in these two areas this paper only chooses the moderate pressure areas areas as a new sample to re estimate the true effect of revenue driven we construct a dummy variable i4 which equals to 1 if the province is low income region under moderate pressure and 0 otherwise the results are reported in column 5 of table 5 it shows that low income regions have a higher moderation effect coefficient is 0 310 and statistically significant compared to high income regions under similar industrial water pressure revenue driven will positively promote the moderation effect of water rights trading this implies that farmers tend to improve their irrigation technology to trade water rights for revenue the result is consistent with the research of liu et al 2008 who have shown that farmers were encouraged to adopt efficient irrigation technology and sell the reduced water use only if water rights can be traded otherwise they will continue to consume the amount of water that has been saved to sum up the moderation effect of water rights trading will depend more on the industrial water pressure than the revenue effect under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment even if there is no revenue driven farmers will actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use furthermore regardless of industrial water pressure driven effect revenue driven will also produce the moderation effect of agricultural water saving to some extent implying that revenue effect is also a factor for farmers to consider whether to save water or not 2 7 bottleneck on moderated technology improvement the above analysis reveals that water rights trading pushes farmers to improve irrigation technology and conserve water via the active revenue driven effect and passive pressure driven effect in this section we discuss the potential problem may crowd out the moderation effect as tian and hu 2019 mentioned the implementation of the water market between sectors depends on the capacity of water rights supply in the agricultural sector it is likely that without sufficient agricultural water rights supply capacity water rights trading cannot be realized successfully regardless of the revenue driven and pressure driven effects therefore we argue the moderation effect of water rights trading will be restricted by the agricultural water rights supply capacity thus presenting the promotion bottleneck problem the capacity of water rights supply can be proxied by the technology levels the lower technology level means more space for agricultural water efficiency improvement thus leading to the larger water rights supply capacity tian and hu 2019 since the agricultural water rights supply capacity is mainly affected by the technology efficiency level we now test the bottleneck problem by investigating the heterogenous effect for regions with high and low tech levels we construct a dummy variable i5 which equals to 1 if a province belongs to low tech regions and 0 otherwise we introduce i5 into model 6 and take interaction of it with the moderation term the results are reported in column 6 of table 4 it shows that the moderation effect in low tech regions is higher than high tech regions coefficient is 0 233 and statistically significant indicating that the moderation effect of water rights trading on agricultural water saving will be mitigated with the decrease of agricultural water rights supply capacity therefore the nonlinear characteristic of moderation effect with respect to technology reveals that there exists a limit on the moderated effect of water rights trading measures on improving the agricultural water rights supply capacity is necessary to sustain the moderation effects 3 conclusion and policy implication this paper explores whether water rights trading can save water use in the agricultural sector by constructing water rights trading indicator and revising the environmental assessment framework we study if farmers are encouraged to improve the irrigation technology for water conservation we find that water rights trading has positive moderation effect on agricultural water conservation the moderation effect will depend more on the influence of industrial water pressure than revenue under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment farmers will actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use in addition due to the limited water rights supply capacity in agricultural sector this paper also reveals the moderation effect will be mitigated with the improvement of irrigation technology thus leading to the promotion bottleneck problem targeting on the water conservation and sustainability development of agricultural sector in china several policy implications can be derived from our analysis as follows firstly increasing the extra revenue brought by water rights trading since revenue factor is considered as a motivated approach to promote irrigation technology it is necessary to increase the farmers profit from water market by adjusting the current water pricing to the complete market value so as to promote the agricultural water conservation secondly further expanding the pilot regions for water rights trading especially heilongjiang jilin jiangsu anhui provinces due to the lower irrigation water efficiency i e larger agricultural water rights supply capacity and higher industrial water pressure in those regions the water market will have a greater effect in agricultural water conservation compared to other regions finally gradually improving the capacity of water rights supply in agricultural sector the key point is to improve irrigation technology from the engineering measures to non engineering measures technology improvement should be not only reflected in the process of water transmission and irrigation but also in the process of water management therefore economic means such as agricultural water pricing reform hu and wang 2018 can be used to promote agricultural water conservation so as to effectively control water waste phenomenon caused by low water price in addition intelligent irrigation technology li et al 2017 based on crop precision irrigation should be actively developed to break technology bottleneck and sustain the moderation effect of water rights trading on agricultural water conservation

10663,although agricultural irrigation technology in china has been steadily improved for decades the realized water conservation in the agricultural sector is not as good as expected this paper examines whether water rights trading can encourage agricultural water conservation through technology improvement our fixed effects model specification confirms that water rights trading has a moderation effect on agricultural water conservation via technology improvement we further identify that the moderation effect is driven by two forces which we label as the revenue driven effect and industrial water pressure driven effect in general the revenue effect drives farmers to improve the technology however the pressure from industrial water demand has more pronounced effects than the revenue driven channel under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment farmers tend actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use even if there is no revenue driven effects in addition this paper reveals the existence of bottleneck on the moderated technology improvement due to the reduced capacity on water rights supply in the agricultural sector keywords water rights trading moderation effect irrigation technology agricultural water conservation 1 introduction one critical constraint for sustainable development is water shortage various policies related to water conservation have been implemented worldwide to save water in china agricultural water use accounts for about 62 of the total water use saving agricultural water is not only a necessary way to ensure the steady development of the agricultural sector but also the key to the construction of a water saving society however deeper industrialization and urbanization together with the increasing severity of global climate change makes it increasingly difficult to save agricultural water use policy mandates such as the central document no 1 2011 and 13th five year plan for double control of total water consumption and intensity 2016 have been issued by the central government of china to conserve water use in the agricultural sector where the improvement of irrigation technology and utilization efficiency is the key for sustainable water resource management however although china s agricultural irrigation technology has progressing steadily in recent decades the resulting water conservation in the agricultural sector is not as good as expected one reason is the existence of rebound effect gómez and pérez blanco 2014 song et al 2018 ward and pulido 2008 water saving technologies would increase the agricultural land use leading to an increase in agricultural water use the other reason is due to the technology gap between china and the world s advanced level in 2016 china s water productivity in terms of grain yield per cu m water was less than 1 2 kg m3 while the world s advanced level was about 2 kg m3 it implies the existence of technology lag between china and the world leading countries water rights trading is used by some countries to improve irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use for example san diego city and california s largest irrigation district signed an agreement on sharing water resources in 2003 and paid farmers an annual payment at the agreed price to encourage them to save water thus promoting the reduction of agricultural water use yan et al 2017 the agricultural irrigation water efficiency was also improved after south australia initiated trading in the water market kuehne 2006 the world bank and international food policy and research institute state that chile s 1981 water code can result in pareto efficiency and thus recommend the water code as a successful model for international water resources management reform particularly for developing countries delorit et al 2019 several provinces in china zhejiang gansu ningxia inner mongolia and fujian have initiated the trading of water rights step by step since 2000 in 2014 ministry of water resources selected seven provinces including ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu guangdong henan as the pilot regions to carry out water rights trading in 2016 the national water rights trading platform was established with the aim of developing water market at a larger scale according to the government document decision on several major issues of comprehensive deepening reform water rights trading is used as an economic incentive instrument to achieve water conservation therefore this paper investigates whether water rights trading can improve irrigation technology and ultimately achieve the goal of agricultural water conservation considering irrigation water use accounts for about 90 of total agricultural water use and data availability agricultural water use in this paper refers to the planting irrigation water use in agriculture while other sub sectors such as fishing graziery are not considered we extend the traditional environmental impact assessment framework to analyze the nexus between technology improvement and agricultural water use the moderation effect results show that water rights trading saves agricultural water use by improving irrigation technology we further identify two types of driving forces that contribute to the moderation effect the revenue driven effect and industrial water pressure driven effects farmers seek to update the technology driven by revenue effect and pressure effect the pressure effect plays a bigger role than that of revenue effect this paper also reveals that the moderation effect faces bottleneck for the technology improvement due to the reduced capacity of water rights supply in the agricultural sector the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the literature review section 3 presents the specification of benchmark model and moderation model section 4 discusses the main results and robustness check section 5 explores the driving forces and promotion bottleneck problem of moderation effect in the final section we conclude the paper with policy implications 1 1 literature review the literature on the relationship between water rights trading technology improvement and agricultural water use can be summarized from the following two aspects the first is the relationship between technology improvement and agricultural water use some scholars believe that technology improvement can reduce agricultural water for instance liu et al 2017 wang and zhao 2008 li et al 2014 jin et al 2018 xue and hao 2012 tong et al 2014 find that efficiency related technological progress can achieve zero or negative growth of agricultural water use heumesser et al 2012 believe that investment and subsidies for efficient water saving projects would reduce surface water use in maker field in australia graveline et al 2014 also find that a 4 increase in efficient water saving irrigation area results in a 2 decrease in total agricultural water use on the contrary other scholars believe that agricultural water tends to increase with the technological progress due to the existence of rebound effect so technology improvement will not effectively conserve agricultural water use for example gómez and pérez blanco 2014 conclude that higher irrigation technology results in agricultural water use and thus the existence of rebound effect song et al 2018 find that the average rebound effect of agricultural water in china was 61 49 based on the provincial panel data from 1998 to 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 uncover that agricultural water demand is inelastic and agricultural water use does not change with the improvement of irrigation technology ward and pulido 2008 show that adopting water saving technologies would increase the land use for agricultural production leading to an increase in agricultural water use fang et al 2020 find evidence for the existence of rebound effect on agricultural water use the second aspect is the relationship between water rights trading and technology improvement some studies show that water rights trading can improve irrigation technology for instance liu et al 2008 show that farmers were encouraged to adopt efficient irrigation technology and sell the reduced water use only if water rights can be traded between agriculture and industries otherwise they had no intension to save water liu 2014 wang et al 2017 kahil et al 2015 calatrava and garrido 2005 gómez limón and martinez 2006 gohar and ward 2010 have also empirically tested that the existence of water market would encourage farmers to improve technology especially in the context of severe climate change however there is no unanimous conclusion on the water saving technical impact of water rights trading yang and zhu 2018 zhang et al 2013 conclude that water rights trading has little influence on the agricultural sector due to the limited transaction scope and size gómez limón and riesgo 2004 kuehne and bjornlund 2006 both argue that the water saving effect of water rights trading is not as expected in consideration of the differences in water resource endowment soil climate conditions and irrigation facilities between regions to sum up the relationship between water rights trading technology improvement and agricultural water use is uncertain in particular to promote the water saving effect of technology improvement it is necessary to explore whether water rights trading can become an effective moderation factor in china to save agricultural water use by improving irrigation technology therefore this paper firstly constructs an empirical model to examine the impact of technology improvement on agricultural water conservation secondly from the perspective of moderation effect this paper verifies whether water rights trading will play an important role in the agricultural water saving by improving the technology level in particular we consider two types of driving factors of the moderation effect the internal effect induced from the farmers willingness to improve revenue driven and external effect induced from local industrial economic development pressure driven furthermore we test the potential bottleneck on technology improvement moderated by water rights trading 2 the model 2 1 benchmark model development we build our benchmark model based on the environmental impact assessment framework developed by ehrlich and holdren 1971 to analyze the impact of technology improvement on agricultural water use the framework divides the impact of economic and social activities on the environment or resource into three primary factors population prosperity per capita gdp and technology as follows 1 i p a t p g d p p i g d p in eq 1 i refers to resource consumption p is the total population a is per capita output t is the resource consumption per unit output which represents the level of technology since agricultural water consumption is affected by the size of irrigation land rather than population we revise eq 1 by replacing population with irrigation area and the revised impact assessment model is described as follows 2 w a t e r a r e a i r r g d p a a r e a a g d p w a t e r g d p a i n n in eq 2 water is agricultural water use area represents the effective irrigation area gdpa represents the total agricultural output g d p a a r e a and w a t e r g d p a are the total agricultural output per mu and agricultural water intensity respectively the above three items can respectively represent the impact of irrigation area irr agricultural productivity agdp and irrigation technology inn on agricultural water use thus the benchmark model simplified form can be established as follows 3 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t μ i υ t ε i t we define w i t as the agricultural water use in year t t 1 2 t of region i i 1 2 n μ i represents the individual fixed effect and υ t represents the time fixed effect in addition other factors such as precipitation crop planting structure urbanization rate etc can also affect the agricultural water use therefore a set of additional control variables x i t are added into eq 3 as follows 4 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t where α 0 is the intercept term α 1 α 2 α 3 are the coefficients to be estimated ε i t is the random error term satisfying zero mean and homoscedasticity hypothesis eq 4 is our benchmark model specification 2 2 moderation model of water rights trading we postulate that water rights trading encourages the technology improvement and thus affect the water use by following the structure of shen and lee 2006 the model in eq 4 is thus revised as follows to model the moderation effect of water rights trading on agricultural water use via technology improvement the intersection term of technology level and the indicator of water rights trading t r a i t is introduced into the benchmark model eq 4 the moderation model of water rights trading is as follows 5 w i t α 0 α 1 i n n i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t α 1 ρ 0 ρ 1 t r a i t combining the two equations we have 6 w i t α 0 ρ 0 i n n i t ρ 1 i n n i t t r a i t α 2 a g d p i t α 3 i r r i t λ x i t μ i υ t ε i t the model proposed above indicates that water rights trading has a moderation effect by amplifying or weakening the effects of irrigation technology on agricultural water use in the model ρ 0 and ρ 1 are the key explanatory coefficients representing the impact of irrigation technology level on agricultural water use and the moderation effect of water rights trading respectively 2 3 data in this paper we estimate the effect of water rights trading on agricultural water use in china during 1998 2016 due to missing data from tibet taiwan hong kong and macau our dataset covers 30 provinces the model includes dependent variable agricultural water use two key independent variables technology level and water rights trading indicator and a set of control variables such as the total agricultural output per mu effective irrigation area precipitation crop planting structure urbanization rate for the indicator of water rights trading tra we define it as a dummy variable similar to guo and xiong 2017 and ying et al 2019 according to the report analysis on water rights system construction in typical areas of taihu basin china s provinces and regions have successively implemented water rights trading from 1998 to 2016 this paper therefore divides 30 provinces in china into pilot regions and non pilot regions for water rights trading pilot regions include zhejiang gansu ningxia inner mongolia fujian jiangxi hubei henan xinjiang guangdong shanxi hebei and beijing which belong to the treated group in our model and the remaining 17 non pilot provinces belong to the control group provinces in the treated group start water rights trading in different years zhejiang s water rights trading started in 2000 gansu in 2002 ningxia inner mongolia and fujian in 2003 jiangxi hubei henan xinjiang and guangdong in 2014 shanxi hebei and beijing in 2016 the dummy variable for water rights trading is defined in a way as shown in table 1 the indicator of irrigation technology inn is represented by agricultural water use efficiency which is estimated by super efficiency slacks based measure sbm model the details of the model description data and the estimated results to proxy inn are shown as appendix a according to eq 3 agdp is equal to the total agricultural output divided by the effective irrigation area other control variables such as effective irrigation area precipitation structure and urbanization are selected according to tong 2014 and jin 2018 all of those data come from china rural statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook and all the variables and the descriptive statistical results are shown in table 2 2 4 empirical results the estimation results of benchmark model and moderation effect model are shown in table 3 our benchmark model shows that irrigation technology has a statistically significant impact on agricultural water conservation with coefficient of 0 25 implying that a 1 increase in technology efficiency level leads to a 0 22 reduction in agricultural water use the results show that land and agricultural output factors have positive impacts on agricultural water use with coefficients of 0 52 and 0 21 respectively therefore a 1 increase in the effective irrigation area and agricultural output per mu will lead to a 0 52 and 0 21 increase in agricultural water use a 1 increase in planting structure leads to a 0 006 increase in agricultural water use precipitation as a substituting water source to irrigation can effectively save agricultural water use with the elasticity of 0 034 since the panel data often suffers from problems such as heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation the paper uses fixed effect regression with adjusted t value by newey and west 1987 standard error s e for quantitative analysis the estimated result of moderation effect model 6 shows that the implementation of water rights trading will have a positive role in agricultural water saving by promoting technology improvement with coefficient of 0 153 that is water rights trading significantly encourage farmers to improve irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use we also adopt the other approaches to estimate model 6 for robustness check fixed effect regression with adjusted t value by driscoll kraay 1998 s e and the feasible generalized least squares fgls approach in order to avoid the problem of cross section dependence in panel data other than heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation from the results of column 4 and 5 in table 4 we can see that the results are similar with the one presented before implying the results obtained using fixed effect regression with newey and west s e are consistent and robust one may argue there exists a potential endogeneity because regions with higher water use could be induced to initiate water rights trading therefore we use the logit model to test that the provinces that implement water rights trading are an exogenous choice the index tra is the dependent variable in the model the independent variables include lagged terms of w control variables in model 4 industrial water consumption indwater reservoir capacity reservior and water conservancy infrastructure infrastruture according to the literature from the results of whole period and different sub periods shown in appendix b we can find that agricultural water use w is not the main factor in affecting whether water right trading is carried out or not therefore it can be inferred that there exists no endogeneity issue related to the water right trading index in our model 2 5 further analysis we have shown that water rights trading affects agricultural water use through the channel of technology in this section we study through which mechanism water rights trading reduces agricultural water use 2 6 the driving forces why does water rights trading reduce agricultural water use with the help of irrigation technology the driving forces of the moderation effect may come from two aspects on the one hand when water resource becomes tradable in the market farmers will sell the amount of water saved for profits a higher level of irrigation technology implies more profits from water trading which we label as revenue driven effect on the other hand water demand pressure from local industries will influence the moderation effect of water rights trading under the dual constraints of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment local government may push farmers to improve irrigation technology and convert the saved agricultural water into industrial water for industrial development which we call industrial water pressure driven effect 2 6 1 the revenue driven effect as we do not have data on detailed trading records we test the revenue driven effect indirectly by investigating the heterogenous effects of income we postulate that farmers of different income levels response to the trading revenue differently and then divide all provinces into two groups high and low income regions according to average farmer income of provinces if the revenue is the major driver for farmers to improve the technology we will find that the moderation effect of low income region is higher than that of high income region in this connection we generate a dummy variable i1 that equals 1 if a province belongs to the high income region above the national median and 0 for low income region below the national median we re estimate model 6 by including the interaction of i1 with moderation term inn tra the results are reported in column 2 of table 4 we find that the coefficient of the interaction term is statistically significant showing that the high income region presents stronger impact compared to low income regions which indicates that revenue driven mechanism is weak and only for high income region 2 6 2 the pressure driven effect severe industrial water pressure may force farmers to save water for trading by local government we test the pressure driven effect by examining the heterogenous effect of water pressure two factors are used to reflect water pressure industrial water consumption and water endowment all provinces are divided into high moderate and low pressure regions as shown in fig 1 by comparing the magnitude of moderation effect in these three regions we can confirm whether industrial water pressure driven mechanism exists or not that is if moderation effect of high pressure region is higher than other regions or low pressure region is lower than other regions the driver of pressure exists to prove this we construct a dummy variable i2 which equals to 1 if a province belongs to high or moderate pressure regions and 0 otherwise to compare low pressure region with others alternatively we also generate a dummy variable i3 that equals 1 with the high pressure regions and 0 otherwise to compare high pressure region with others we introduce i2 and i3 into model 6 respectively and take the interaction of it with the moderation term the results are reported in column 3 4 of table 4 it shows that high pressure regions have a higher moderation effect coefficient is 0 134 and statistically significant compared to moderate and low pressure regions similarly compared to the low pressure regions high and moderate pressure regions still have a higher moderation effect with significant coefficient of 0 09 apparently the above two results both indicate that industrial water pressure driven mechanisms exist significantly the result is consistent with the research of liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 who have proposed that the existence of water rights trading in inner mongolia and ningxia was exactly due to the large shortage of water resources in the energy and chemical industries so the local government actively carried out the water rights conversion from agriculture to industry for alleviating the pressure of industrial water use and promoting the agricultural water use efficiency 2 6 3 re examination of revenue driven effect the above analysis verifies the industrial water pressure driven effect only the revenue driven effect is not confirmed we now explore whether the unexpected result is because the industrial water pressure effect suppresses the revenue effect thus causing a false conclusion for revenue driven effect in fact from fig 1 we find ten high income provinces which have above median industrial water consumption and nine high income provinces with below median water endowment that is all the high income provinces circled in fig 1 are located in either high or moderate pressure of industrial water while most of low income provinces under lower industrial water pressure we also get the similar results from the significant correlation coefficient 0 214 of income and industrial water consumption and significant correlation coefficient 0 251 of income and water endowment it is likely that all the high income provinces are affected by the powerful effect of industrial water pressure in order to eliminate the potential cross impact we select the provinces under the same industrial water pressure moderate pressure 1 1 considering that high pressure areas mainly include high income provinces while low pressure areas are all low income provinces due to the unequal number of high and low income provinces in these two areas this paper only chooses the moderate pressure areas areas as a new sample to re estimate the true effect of revenue driven we construct a dummy variable i4 which equals to 1 if the province is low income region under moderate pressure and 0 otherwise the results are reported in column 5 of table 5 it shows that low income regions have a higher moderation effect coefficient is 0 310 and statistically significant compared to high income regions under similar industrial water pressure revenue driven will positively promote the moderation effect of water rights trading this implies that farmers tend to improve their irrigation technology to trade water rights for revenue the result is consistent with the research of liu et al 2008 who have shown that farmers were encouraged to adopt efficient irrigation technology and sell the reduced water use only if water rights can be traded otherwise they will continue to consume the amount of water that has been saved to sum up the moderation effect of water rights trading will depend more on the industrial water pressure than the revenue effect under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment even if there is no revenue driven farmers will actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use furthermore regardless of industrial water pressure driven effect revenue driven will also produce the moderation effect of agricultural water saving to some extent implying that revenue effect is also a factor for farmers to consider whether to save water or not 2 7 bottleneck on moderated technology improvement the above analysis reveals that water rights trading pushes farmers to improve irrigation technology and conserve water via the active revenue driven effect and passive pressure driven effect in this section we discuss the potential problem may crowd out the moderation effect as tian and hu 2019 mentioned the implementation of the water market between sectors depends on the capacity of water rights supply in the agricultural sector it is likely that without sufficient agricultural water rights supply capacity water rights trading cannot be realized successfully regardless of the revenue driven and pressure driven effects therefore we argue the moderation effect of water rights trading will be restricted by the agricultural water rights supply capacity thus presenting the promotion bottleneck problem the capacity of water rights supply can be proxied by the technology levels the lower technology level means more space for agricultural water efficiency improvement thus leading to the larger water rights supply capacity tian and hu 2019 since the agricultural water rights supply capacity is mainly affected by the technology efficiency level we now test the bottleneck problem by investigating the heterogenous effect for regions with high and low tech levels we construct a dummy variable i5 which equals to 1 if a province belongs to low tech regions and 0 otherwise we introduce i5 into model 6 and take interaction of it with the moderation term the results are reported in column 6 of table 4 it shows that the moderation effect in low tech regions is higher than high tech regions coefficient is 0 233 and statistically significant indicating that the moderation effect of water rights trading on agricultural water saving will be mitigated with the decrease of agricultural water rights supply capacity therefore the nonlinear characteristic of moderation effect with respect to technology reveals that there exists a limit on the moderated effect of water rights trading measures on improving the agricultural water rights supply capacity is necessary to sustain the moderation effects 3 conclusion and policy implication this paper explores whether water rights trading can save water use in the agricultural sector by constructing water rights trading indicator and revising the environmental assessment framework we study if farmers are encouraged to improve the irrigation technology for water conservation we find that water rights trading has positive moderation effect on agricultural water conservation the moderation effect will depend more on the influence of industrial water pressure than revenue under the dual pressure of high industrial water consumption and low water endowment farmers will actively promote irrigation technology and reduce agricultural water use in addition due to the limited water rights supply capacity in agricultural sector this paper also reveals the moderation effect will be mitigated with the improvement of irrigation technology thus leading to the promotion bottleneck problem targeting on the water conservation and sustainability development of agricultural sector in china several policy implications can be derived from our analysis as follows firstly increasing the extra revenue brought by water rights trading since revenue factor is considered as a motivated approach to promote irrigation technology it is necessary to increase the farmers profit from water market by adjusting the current water pricing to the complete market value so as to promote the agricultural water conservation secondly further expanding the pilot regions for water rights trading especially heilongjiang jilin jiangsu anhui provinces due to the lower irrigation water efficiency i e larger agricultural water

wang 2018 can be used to promote agricultural water conservation so as to effectively control water waste phenomenon caused by low water price in addition intelligent irrigation technology li et al

10664,water shortage caused by large variations in the amount frequency and timing of rainfall during the crop cycle is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting crop production in this context environmental variability represents a significant challenge for farmers as optimal management practices vary from season to season the aim of this study was to optimize wheat triticum aestivum l management practices considering rainfall variability in the west sandy pampas of argentina this region is characterized by a high annual rainfall variability with predominant summer rainfall and probable deficits during winter and early spring in analogy with many other regions around the world two commercial cultivars commonly used by farmers with different time to flowering lf late flowering ef early flowering under three initial soil water conditions well watered moderately watered and dry conditions at three sowing dates were simulated with ceres wheat for a series of 39 years wheat yield was higher for the lf than the ef cultivar under average lf 5437 vs ef 5112 kg ha 1 and no water restriction years lf 7915 vs ef 6956 kg ha 1 while the opposite was observed in dry years ef 4128 vs lf 3255 kg ha 1 reductions in grain yield were associated with reductions in grain number mainly explained by a lower partitioning to reproductive organs principally limited by water shortage the lf cultivar used more water than the ef cultivar before anthesis depleting soil water reserves p 0 05 and losing the yield potential advantage in dry years genotypic differences were more evident under initial soil well watered conditions 16 compared to moderately watered 13 or dry conditions 9 therefore cultivar selection could partially compensate the deleterious impacts of water

stress pattern in these regions take place early in the cycle during the vegetative stages additionally in the west sandy pampas of argentina as most of the argentine crop area is under the influence of el niño southern oscillation phenomenon enso which significantly contributes to rainfall variability podestá et al 1999 environmental variability presents significant challenges for farmers as optimal management practices vary from season to season depending on the timing and amount of rainfall considering that non water related factors such as management practices are more limiting for yield than water supply rattalino edreira et al 2018 and that the yield gap or difference between yield in no water restriction environments and actual yield of wheat in the sandy pampas is around 40 aramburu merlos et al 2015 it becomes relevant to explore and apply a scenario dependent management in order to close or at least reduce the gap with water limited yield potential a possible way to mitigate the negative impact of water shortage on grain yield is to conserve soil water by reducing crop water uptake at early stages vegetative phases when water stress is present a reduce water uptake during vegetative phases will allow to overcome the water deficit window for use it during the critical phases of pre flowering and seed growth gholipoor et al 2013 kholová et al 2010 a simple way to achieve that would be to adjust crop cycle length considering the expected rainfall variability provided by good predictive models stone et al 1996 phenology is the most important attribute

and connor 1991 in this way it is possible to hypothesize that late flowering lf cultivars with long vegetative phases will consume more water than early flowering ef cultivars under no water restrictions it is expected that lf cultivars will produce more aerial biomass and thereby have more yield potential than ef ones however under water restrictions ef cultivars would have an advantage

of the sandy pampas is predominantly concentrated in autumn and late spring with the lowest records during winter june july and august fig 1 a rainfall variability across years ranged from 56 6 to 155 2 per month being highest in winter and lowest in summer mean rainfall during sowing dates i e may june and july were 44 3 18 9 and 24 6 mm respectively with a huge annual variability coefficient of variation 112 2 155 2 and 140 1 respectively fig 1a these variations usually lead to different scenarios at sowing time such as well watered moderately watered or dry initial soil water conditions in the subsequent months from august to december mean rainfalls showed increases from 30 4 august to 108 0 mm november and a reduction in annual variability from 123 9 august to 60 6 november in addition to the high annual rainfall variability this region is characterized by important gaps between rainfall and evapotranspiration with negative values during winter and positive or negative values depending on the year variability during autumn spring and summer on average during every month the deficit i e differences between rainfall and evapotranspiration is from 22 to 64 mm per month except for march and april in which the gap has positive values of 40 and 5 mm respectively fig 1b variability across years can reduce or increase the deficit making this region challenging for wheat production winter temperatures at the time of sowing are mild and typically vary from a daily mean temperature of 7 5 12 3 c in the coolest months maximum temperatures being around 30 c during december and january fig 1a overall the region of the sandy pampas shows high inter annual rainfall variability during the winter crop cycle highlighting the need to optimize wheat management depending on the scenario 3 2 model evaluation observed vs predicted yield to determine the prediction capacity of the ceres wheat model simulated data were correlated to observed data obtained in the same region during different growing seasons considering the obtained nrmse values 1 and 12 in fig 2 a and b respectively the model provided a good estimation of time to anthesis and grain yield in the testing period using independent data obtained from different farms and or field experiments for the same ef and lf cultivars used in this study fig 2 a b observed anthesis time was expressed in julian days ranging from 280 7th october to 307 3rd november phenology comparisons indicated a close match between simulated and observed data with an rmse 3 34 days fig 2a all observed deviations being lower than 5 of simulated values fig 2a observed yield ranged from 1905 to 7303 kg ha 1 mostly over 3500 kg ha 1 model performance was robust with simulated yields reflecting observed yields well across the diverse set of conditions fig 2b the inaccuracy parameter in simulated yield was fairly low with an rmse for predicted versus observed yield of 649 5 kg ha 1 fig 2b this means that in most cases the relationship between simulated and observed values was within the 15 deviation fig 2b in short the model ceres wheat showed to be a reliable tool to test different combinations of management practices in the evaluated region 3 3 inter annual yield variability averaging across years the duration of the emergence anthesis phase in the lf cultivar was 139 127 and 115 days for early intermediate and late sowing dates while for the ef it was 103 93 and 83 days respectively due to the shift in the sowing dates between cultivars anthesis date was synchronized for the cultivars and thereby the range of anthesis time between cultivars varied from 2 to 5 days being slightly earlier in the ef than in the lf cultivar finally grain filling duration was on average four days longer for the ef 53 days than for the lf 49 days but cultivars reached physiological maturity almost on the same date anthesis synchronization allowed the comparison of cultivar yield strategies considering annual rainfall variability simulated grain yield ranged from 545 to 7915 kg ha 1 and from 936 to 6957 kg ha 1 for the lf and the ef cultivars respectively maximum yields were always reached for the lf cultivar regardless of the management practice fig 3 regardless of the sowing date and the initial soil water conditions the lf cultivar showed on average a significantly higher p 0 05 yield than the ef cultivar 4649 vs 4371 kg ha 1 respectively however under the lowest yielding conditions 10th percentile in dry soils at sowing ef outperformed lf yielding on average 2316 and 1744 kg ha 1 respectively similar behavior was observed for the worst environmental conditions i e the driest years when the crop was sown in moderately watered conditions 3922 vs 2967 kg ha 1 for the ef and lf cultivars respectively however under well watered conditions at sowing the lf cultivar slightly outperformed the ef cultivar 4800 vs 4661 kg ha 1 for the lf and ef cultivars respectively overall the lf cultivar showed higher yield than the ef cultivar but also a higher variability mainly under dry and moderately watered soil conditions at sowing where the yields of the lf cultivar were lower than the ef when the growing season was extremely dry throughout the crop cycle fig 3 initial soil water conditions had a direct impact on yield variability especially when the crop was sown under dry soil conditions and to a much lesser extent when sown under well watered conditions fig 3 in initial dry soil conditions the lf cultivar showed the highest but also the lowest yields confirming the highest inter annual variability fig 3 for the same initial soil condition i e dr the ef cultivar however showed lower maximum yield than the lf cultivar but the lowest yield observed in the ef cultivar was higher than the lf cultivar suggesting that when the crop is sown under dr conditions the performance of the ef cultivar was better than the lf in the poorest scenarios in general associated with dry years throughout the crop cycle fig 3 thus yield reductions were observed under dry years for example 1986 or 2005 fig s1 with poor yield performance for the lf compared to the ef cultivar fig s1 yield reductions as well as yield variability were higher in the driest growing scenarios under poor initial soil water conditions while both yield reduction and its variation were mitigated or reduced under initial well watered soil conditions fig 4 and s2 regardless of initial soil water conditions the lf cultivar always showed higher yield variability than the ef cultivar fig s2 hence under scenarios with normal to high rainfall lf cultivars were usually the best option due to their higher attainable yield compared to ef conversely under dry scenarios see examples in fig s1 and especially under dry initial conditions at sowing ef cultivars appear to be the best option due to better yield performance and lower yield variability compared to lf fig 4 changes in sowing dates did not significantly modify grain yield in none of the initial soil water conditions in which the model was used figs 3 and 4 overall and as stated above grain yield variability was principally affected by initial soil water conditions and to a lesser extent by the growth cycle length 3 4 grain yield components variations in grain yield were explored in terms of its numerical components i e grain number and grain weight yield variations were explained by changes in grain number yield 270 0 37 grain number r2 0 80 p 0 01 which varied from 1681 to 20736 grains m 2 and from 2474 to 19680 grains m 2 for the lf and ef cultivars respectively table 2 as described for yield variations in grain number were related to changes in the initial soil water conditions being higher under ww and lower under dr soil conditions table 2 no significant changes in grain weight were observed between cultivars or initial soil water conditions table 2 grain yield variations were also explored in terms of their physiological components cumulated biomass and harvest index both traits were positively correlated with grain yield fig 5 cumulated biomass was on average significantly higher in lf than in the ef cultivar table 2 ranging from 4078 to 17248 kg dm ha 1 and from 3761 to 14434 kg dm ha 1 for lf and ef respectively fig 5a c biomass was affected by the initial soil water conditions being higher under ww and lower under dr soil conditions as observed for grain number and grain yield fig 5a c as opposed to that observed in biomass harvest index was significantly higher for the ef table s2 than the lf cultivar ranging from 0 15 to 0 48 and from 0 08 to 0 45 for the ef and lf respectively fig 5 b d harvest index like yield was negatively affected under initial dr soil conditions with the strongest impact observed under dry scenarios fig 5b d thus under stressful environments the ef cultivar showed a better capacity to partition biomass to the spike and thereby yield more than the lf cultivar 3 5 why did the ef outyield the lf cultivar in dry scenarios to figure out why the ef cultivar over yielded the lf in poor environments especially low initial water content at sowing four years with less than 200 mm of rainfall during the crop cycle years 1974 1975 1994 and 2009 were selected during these years rainfall from sowing to physiological maturity was averaging sowing dates 168 171 187 and 190 mm in 1974 1994 1975 and 2009 respectively in these growing seasons grain yield of ef cultivar was higher than that of lf averaging 4128 vs 3255 kg ha 1 in dry scenarios yield differences were maintained across initial soil water conditions with 18 25 and 22 higher yield for the ef than the lf cultivar under ww mw and dr initial soil water conditions respectively the lf cultivar accumulated more biomass than the ef p 0 05 averaging 11022 and 10315 kg dm ha 1 respectively differences in cumulated biomass were associated with the amount of water transpired by each cultivar p 0 001 table s2 which was higher in the lf than the ef cultivar averaging 220 and 202 mm respectively transpiration varied across initial soil water conditions p 0 001 table s2 being higher under better initial soil water conditions and showing 8 difference between cultivars regardless of soil conditions table s2 the distribution of total transpiration differed between cultivars on average the lf and ef cultivars registered 81 and 68 of the total transpired water from sowing to anthesis while from anthesis to physiological maturity transpired water was 19 and 32 respectively fig 6 a comparing cultivars from sowing to anthesis across initial soil water conditions lf transpired 16 13 and 9 more than the ef cultivar under ww mw and dr initial soil water conditions while the opposite was observed during the grain filling stage fig 6a due to the lower transpiration during the vegetative phase the ef cultivar saved more water in the soil at anthesis stage than the lf cultivar regardless of the initial soil water condition fig 6b thus during the grain filling period the ef cultivar had more available water to support grain growth than the lf cultivar overall in dry seasons higher plant transpiration during vegetative stages was related to the production of more biomass however this did not result in higher yield due to soil water depletion with a concomitant impact on partition p 0 001 and thereby on grain number p 0 01 and grain weight p 0 05 for the lf compared to the ef cultivar 4 discussion water deficit is a major challenge for agriculture in the context of climate change combined with an increased need for food lobell et al 2011 a large effort is therefore required to increase agricultural production especially under reduced water availability via the adaptation of cropping systems van ittersum et al 2013 and the design of new plant varieties schoppach et al 2016 detailed climatic characterizations and the response of crop management to different climate scenarios seem necessary to achieve this goal under rainfed conditions one of the indicators used to assess the impact of water deficit is the variance of rainfall rather than the actual rainfall value ipcc 2014 a stable low rainfall in a dry area has fewer consequences for agriculture at least when measured in relative terms than a dry year in temperate climates reidsma et al 2010 the present study focused on an environment with an early water stress pattern and with great variability among years leading to dry seasons principally during winter and early spring this rainfall pattern negatively impacts wheat yield in different regions around the world senapati et al 2018 touzy et al 2019 highlighting the need of the farmers to adjust management practices in order to face early water deficits water deficit affects both source and sink strengths in wheat leading to source and sink limited yield reductions of variable magnitude depending on crop phenology duration and intensity of the water stress farooq et al 2014 tardieu et al 2018 environmental conditions around 20 days pre and 10 days post anthesis are considered critical for grain yield determination savin and slafer 1991 as during that period the potential grain number per unit area fischer 1985 and potential grain weight calderini et al 2001 are defined thus reductions in crop growth during pre flowering period due to water shortage impact directly on grain yield in mediterranean environments with predominant winter rainfall and then progressive drying wheat rapidly develops canopy reducing evaporative losses from the soil surface passioura and angus 2010 however there is a trade off where high water uptake during vegetative growth may determine water deficit during late floral development and grain filling gholipoor et al 2013 schoppach et al 2017 on the other hand in environments with scarce precipitations during late winter and beginning of spring combined with a high inter annual rainfall variability the growth of winter crops such as wheat could be affected resulting in lower growth rates due to water shortage as a consequence transpiration and biomass accumulation are reduced leading to smaller plants with lower grain number per unit area and thereby lower grain yield different management practices could be applied to face this problem attia et al 2016 nouri et al 2017 in this study using simulation model ceres wheat we combined sowing dates and cultivars with different cycle lengths early and late flowering under different weather and initial soil moisture conditions as expected important differences in yield were observed in both early and late flowering time varieties in different years mostly associated with the water availability during the year however the results of the present study did not show significant effects on yield when sowing dates were modified probably because rainfalls within each year did not substantially vary between sowing dates these results differed from those observed under mediterranean environments where sowing dates had a stronger impact over final yield rainfall in this type of environments is concentrated at the beginning of the crop cycle while in the present study the main water deficit is concentrated during the tillering phase up to the middle of stem elongation stage anderson et al 2005 sharma et al 2008 zeleke and nendel 2016 modifying the crop cycle duration is another way to regulate water uptake during vegetative stages thus given the rainfall variability of the west pampas with predominant winter and early spring deficits an efficient use of water during early stages of the crop cycle is essential to avoid yield losses the results of the present study show that in well watered years the lf cultivar with higher yield potential showed the highest yields due to a higher resource capture resulting in more biomass compared to the ef sharma et al 2008 however in dry scenarios the lf cultivar showed to be more sensitive to water stress than the ef depleting soil water reserves up to flowering zeleke and nendel 2016 thus a shorter vegetative phase as that of the ef cultivar was directly associated with a reduced water uptake up to the beginning of the critical period preserving the soil water for the highly sensitive stages in which the number of grains per unit area is defined farooq et al 2014 the results obtained in the present study allowed to confirm the hypothesis that lf cultivar with long vegetative phases consumed more water than ef under no water restrictions lf produced more aerial biomass and thereby had more yield potential than ef ones however under water restrictions and especially with low water content in the soil at sowing the ef cultivar has advantage preserving more available water for the critical period where yield is mostly defined the use of the crop model dssat ceres wheat provided us a rational framework to test and compare different wheat management practices in a series of years in order to optimize management for target scenarios and even future climatic conditions crop growth models have already proved to be a useful tool for optimizing management practices in wheat attia et al 2016 nouri et al 2017 and other species aramburu merlos et al 2015 mercau et al 2007 parent et al 2018 this tool is being increasingly implemented by advisors and farmers and therefore this type of studies has become very useful for planning crop management 5 conclusions water deficit is a major challenge for agriculture in the context of climate change modifying the crop cycle duration is the way to regulate water uptake during vegetative stages preserving more water for the reproductive stages in which yield is defined thus under low water availability at sowing early flowering cultivars with short vegetative phase are more suitable than late flowering cultivars as the former preserve more water for the reproductive phases during which grain number is defined i e critical period simulation models as used in the present study are a powerful tool to optimize crop management practice for different

10664,water shortage caused by large variations in the amount frequency and timing of rainfall during the crop cycle is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting crop production in this context environmental variability represents a significant challenge for farmers as optimal management practices vary from season to season the aim of this study was to optimize wheat triticum aestivum l management practices considering rainfall variability in the west sandy pampas of argentina this region is characterized by a high annual rainfall variability with predominant summer rainfall and probable deficits during winter and early spring in analogy with many other regions around the world two commercial cultivars commonly used by farmers with different time to flowering lf late flowering ef early flowering under three initial soil water conditions well watered moderately watered and dry conditions at three sowing dates were simulated with ceres wheat for a series of 39 years wheat yield was higher for the lf than the ef cultivar under average lf 5437 vs ef 5112 kg ha 1 and no water restriction years lf 7915 vs ef 6956 kg ha 1 while the opposite was observed in dry years ef 4128 vs lf 3255 kg ha 1 reductions in grain yield were associated with reductions in grain number mainly explained by a lower partitioning to reproductive organs principally limited by water shortage the lf cultivar used more water than the ef cultivar before anthesis depleting soil water reserves p 0 05 and losing the yield potential advantage in dry years genotypic differences were more evident under initial soil well watered conditions 16 compared to moderately watered 13 or dry conditions 9 therefore cultivar selection could partially compensate the deleterious impacts of water deficit on wheat yield under early water stress pattern environments these results highlight the relevance of design management practices under variable water scenarios in order to reduce yield gaps

of the sandy pampas is predominantly concentrated in autumn and late spring with the lowest records during winter june july and august fig 1 a rainfall variability across years ranged from 56 6 to 155 2 per month being highest in winter and lowest in summer mean rainfall during sowing dates i e may june and july were 44 3 18 9 and 24 6 mm respectively with a huge annual variability coefficient of variation 112 2 155 2 and 140 1 respectively fig 1a these variations usually lead to different scenarios at sowing time such as well watered moderately watered or dry initial soil water conditions in the subsequent months from august to december mean rainfalls showed increases from 30 4 august to 108 0 mm november and a reduction in annual variability from 123 9 august to 60 6 november in addition to the high annual rainfall variability this region is characterized by important gaps between rainfall and evapotranspiration with negative values during winter and positive or negative values depending on the year variability during autumn spring and summer on average during every month the deficit i e differences between rainfall and evapotranspiration is from 22 to 64 mm per month except for march and april in which the gap has positive values of 40 and 5 mm respectively fig 1b variability across years can reduce or increase the deficit making this region challenging for wheat production winter temperatures at the time of sowing are mild and typically vary from a daily mean temperature of 7 5 12 3 c in the coolest months maximum temperatures being around 30 c during december and january fig 1a overall the region of the sandy pampas shows high inter annual rainfall variability during the winter crop cycle highlighting the need to optimize wheat management depending on the scenario 3 2 model evaluation observed vs predicted yield to determine the prediction capacity of the ceres wheat model simulated data were correlated to observed data obtained in the same region during different growing seasons considering the obtained nrmse values 1 and 12 in fig 2 a and b respectively the model provided a good estimation of time to anthesis and grain yield in the testing period using independent data obtained from different farms and or field experiments for the same ef and lf cultivars used in this study fig 2 a b observed anthesis time was expressed in julian days ranging from 280 7th october to 307 3rd november phenology comparisons indicated a close match between simulated and observed data with an rmse 3 34 days fig 2a all observed deviations being lower than 5 of simulated values fig 2a observed yield ranged from 1905 to 7303 kg ha 1 mostly over 3500 kg ha 1 model performance was robust with simulated yields reflecting observed yields well across the diverse set of conditions fig 2b the inaccuracy parameter in simulated yield was fairly low with an rmse for predicted versus observed yield of 649 5 kg ha 1 fig 2b this means that in most cases the relationship between simulated and observed values was within the 15 deviation fig 2b in short the model ceres wheat showed to be a reliable tool to test different combinations of management practices in the evaluated region 3 3 inter annual yield variability averaging across years the duration of the emergence anthesis phase in the lf cultivar was 139 127 and 115 days for early intermediate and late sowing dates while for the ef it was 103 93 and 83 days respectively due to the shift in the sowing dates between cultivars anthesis date was synchronized for the cultivars and thereby the range of anthesis time between cultivars varied from 2 to 5 days being slightly earlier in the ef than in the lf cultivar finally grain filling duration was on average four days longer for the ef 53 days than for the lf 49 days but cultivars reached physiological maturity almost on the same date anthesis synchronization allowed the comparison of cultivar yield strategies considering annual rainfall variability simulated grain yield ranged from 545 to 7915 kg ha 1 and from 936 to 6957 kg ha 1 for the lf and the ef cultivars respectively maximum yields were always reached for the lf cultivar regardless of the management practice fig 3 regardless of the sowing date and the initial soil water conditions the lf cultivar showed on average a significantly higher p 0 05 yield than the ef cultivar 4649 vs 4371 kg ha 1 respectively however under the lowest yielding conditions 10th percentile in dry soils at sowing ef outperformed lf yielding on average 2316 and 1744 kg ha 1 respectively similar behavior was observed for the worst environmental conditions i e the driest years when the crop was sown in moderately watered conditions 3922 vs 2967 kg ha 1 for the ef and lf cultivars respectively however under well watered conditions at sowing the lf cultivar slightly outperformed the ef cultivar 4800 vs 4661 kg ha 1 for the lf and ef cultivars respectively overall the lf cultivar showed higher yield than the ef cultivar but also a higher variability mainly under dry and moderately watered soil conditions at sowing where the yields of the lf cultivar were lower than the ef when the growing season was extremely dry throughout the crop cycle fig 3 initial soil water conditions had a direct impact on yield variability especially when the crop was sown under dry soil conditions and to a much lesser extent when sown under well watered conditions fig 3 in initial dry soil conditions the lf cultivar showed the highest but also the lowest yields confirming the highest inter annual variability fig 3 for the same initial soil condition i e dr the ef cultivar however showed lower maximum yield than the lf cultivar but the lowest yield observed in the ef cultivar was higher than the lf cultivar suggesting that when the crop is sown under dr conditions the performance of the ef cultivar was better than the lf in the poorest scenarios in general associated with dry years throughout the crop cycle fig 3 thus yield reductions were observed under dry years for example 1986 or 2005 fig s1 with poor yield performance for the lf compared to the ef cultivar fig s1 yield reductions as well as yield variability were higher in the driest growing scenarios under poor initial soil water conditions while both yield reduction and its variation were mitigated or reduced under initial well watered soil conditions fig 4 and s2 regardless of initial soil water conditions the lf cultivar always showed higher yield variability than the ef cultivar fig s2 hence under scenarios with normal to high rainfall lf cultivars were usually the best option due to their higher attainable yield compared to ef conversely under dry scenarios see examples in fig s1 and especially under dry initial conditions at sowing ef cultivars appear to be the best option due to better yield performance and lower yield variability compared to lf fig 4 changes in sowing dates did not significantly modify grain yield in none of the initial soil water conditions in which the model was used figs 3 and 4 overall and as stated above grain yield variability was principally affected by initial soil water conditions and to a lesser extent by the growth cycle length 3 4 grain yield components variations in grain yield were explored in terms of its numerical components i e grain number and grain weight yield variations were explained by changes in grain number yield 270 0 37 grain number r2 0 80 p 0 01 which varied from 1681 to 20736 grains m 2 and from 2474 to 19680 grains m 2 for the lf and ef cultivars respectively table 2 as described for yield variations in grain number were related to changes in the initial soil water conditions being higher under ww and lower under dr soil conditions table 2 no significant changes in grain weight were observed between cultivars or initial soil water conditions table 2 grain yield variations were also explored in terms of their physiological components cumulated biomass and harvest index both traits were positively correlated with grain yield fig 5 cumulated biomass was on average significantly higher in lf than in the ef cultivar table 2 ranging from 4078 to 17248 kg dm ha 1 and from 3761 to 14434 kg dm ha 1 for lf and ef respectively fig 5a c biomass was affected by the initial soil water conditions being higher under ww and lower under dr soil conditions as observed for grain number and grain yield fig 5a c as opposed to that observed in biomass harvest index was significantly higher for the ef table s2 than the lf cultivar ranging from 0 15 to 0 48 and from 0 08 to 0 45 for the ef and lf respectively fig 5 b d harvest index like yield was negatively affected under initial dr soil conditions with the strongest impact observed under dry scenarios fig 5b d thus under stressful environments the ef cultivar showed a better capacity to partition biomass to the spike and thereby yield more than the lf cultivar 3 5 why did the ef outyield the lf cultivar in dry scenarios to figure out why the ef cultivar over yielded the lf in poor environments especially low initial water content at sowing four years with less than 200 mm of rainfall during the crop cycle years 1974 1975 1994 and 2009 were selected during these years rainfall from sowing to physiological maturity was averaging sowing dates 168 171 187 and 190 mm in 1974 1994 1975 and 2009 respectively in these growing seasons grain yield of ef cultivar was higher than that of lf averaging 4128 vs 3255 kg ha 1 in dry scenarios yield differences were maintained across initial soil water conditions with 18 25 and 22 higher yield for the ef than the lf cultivar under ww mw and dr initial soil water conditions respectively the lf cultivar accumulated more biomass than the ef p 0 05 averaging 11022 and 10315 kg dm ha 1 respectively differences in cumulated biomass were associated with the amount of water transpired by each cultivar p 0 001 table s2 which was higher in the lf than the ef cultivar averaging 220 and 202 mm respectively transpiration varied across initial soil water conditions p 0 001 table s2 being higher under better initial soil water conditions and showing 8 difference between cultivars regardless of soil conditions table s2 the distribution of total transpiration differed between cultivars on average the lf and ef cultivars registered 81 and 68 of the total transpired water from sowing to anthesis while from anthesis to physiological maturity transpired water was 19 and 32 respectively fig 6 a comparing cultivars from sowing to anthesis across initial soil water conditions lf transpired 16 13 and 9 more than the ef cultivar under ww mw and dr initial soil water conditions while the opposite was observed during the grain filling stage fig 6a due to the lower transpiration during the vegetative phase the ef cultivar saved more water in the soil at anthesis stage than the lf cultivar regardless of the initial soil water condition fig 6b thus during the grain filling period the ef cultivar had more available water to support grain growth than the lf cultivar overall in dry seasons higher plant transpiration during vegetative stages was related to the production of more biomass however this did not result in higher yield due to soil water depletion with a concomitant impact on partition p 0 001 and thereby on grain number p 0 01 and grain weight p 0 05 for the lf compared to the ef cultivar 4 discussion water deficit is a major challenge for agriculture in the context of climate change combined with an increased need for food lobell et al 2011 a large effort is therefore required to increase agricultural production especially under reduced water availability via the adaptation of cropping systems van ittersum et al 2013 and the design of new plant varieties schoppach et al 2016 detailed climatic characterizations and the response of crop management to different climate scenarios seem necessary to achieve this goal under rainfed conditions one of the indicators used to assess the impact of water deficit is the variance of rainfall rather than the actual rainfall value ipcc 2014 a stable low rainfall in a dry area has fewer consequences for agriculture at least when measured in relative terms than a dry year in temperate climates reidsma et al 2010 the present study focused on an environment with an early water stress pattern and with great variability among years leading to dry seasons principally during winter and early spring this rainfall pattern negatively impacts wheat yield in different regions around the world senapati et al 2018 touzy et al 2019 highlighting the need of the farmers to adjust management practices in order to face early water deficits water deficit affects both source and sink strengths in wheat leading to source and sink limited yield reductions of variable magnitude depending on crop phenology duration and intensity of the water stress farooq et al 2014 tardieu et al 2018 environmental conditions around 20 days pre and 10 days post anthesis are considered critical for grain yield determination savin and slafer 1991 as during that period the potential grain number per unit area fischer 1985 and potential grain weight calderini et al 2001 are defined thus reductions in crop growth during pre flowering period due to water shortage impact directly on grain yield in mediterranean environments with predominant winter rainfall and then progressive drying wheat rapidly develops canopy reducing evaporative losses from the soil surface passioura and angus 2010 however there is a trade off where high water uptake during vegetative growth may determine water deficit during late floral development and grain filling gholipoor et al 2013 schoppach et al 2017 on the other hand in environments with scarce precipitations during late winter and beginning of spring combined with a high inter annual rainfall variability the growth of winter crops such as wheat could be affected resulting in lower growth rates due to water shortage as a consequence transpiration and biomass accumulation are reduced leading to smaller plants with lower grain number per unit area and thereby lower grain yield different management practices could be applied to face this problem attia et al 2016 nouri et al 2017 in this study using simulation model ceres wheat we combined sowing dates and cultivars with different cycle lengths early and late flowering under different weather and initial soil moisture conditions as expected important differences in yield were observed in both early and late flowering time varieties in different years mostly associated with the water availability during the year however the results of the present study did not show significant effects on yield when sowing dates were modified probably because rainfalls within each year did not substantially vary between sowing dates these results differed from those observed under mediterranean environments where sowing dates had a stronger impact over final yield rainfall in this type of environments is concentrated at the beginning of the crop cycle while in the present study the main water deficit is concentrated during the tillering phase up to the middle of stem elongation stage anderson et al 2005 sharma et al 2008 zeleke and nendel 2016 modifying the crop cycle duration is another way to regulate water uptake during vegetative stages thus given the rainfall variability of the west pampas with predominant winter and early spring deficits an efficient use of water during early stages of the crop cycle is essential to avoid yield losses the results of the present study show that in well watered years the lf cultivar with higher yield potential showed the highest yields due to a higher resource capture resulting in more biomass compared to the ef sharma et al 2008 however in dry scenarios the lf cultivar showed to be more sensitive to water stress than the ef depleting soil water reserves up to flowering zeleke and nendel 2016 thus a shorter vegetative phase as that of the ef cultivar was directly associated with a reduced water uptake up to the beginning of the critical period preserving the soil water for the highly sensitive stages in which the number of grains per unit area is defined farooq et al 2014 the results obtained in the present study allowed to confirm the hypothesis that lf cultivar with long vegetative phases consumed more water than ef under no water restrictions lf produced more aerial biomass and thereby had more yield potential than ef ones however under water restrictions and especially with low water content in the soil at sowing the ef cultivar has advantage preserving more available water for the critical period where yield is mostly defined the use of the crop model dssat ceres wheat provided us a rational framework to test and compare different wheat management practices in a series of years in order to optimize management for target scenarios and even future climatic conditions crop growth models have already proved to be a useful tool for optimizing management practices in wheat attia et al 2016 nouri et al 2017 and other species aramburu merlos et al 2015 mercau et al 2007 parent et al 2018 this tool is being increasingly implemented by advisors and farmers and therefore this type of studies has become very useful for planning crop management 5 conclusions water deficit is a major challenge for agriculture in the context of climate change modifying the crop cycle duration is the way to regulate water uptake during vegetative stages preserving more water for the reproductive stages in which yield is defined thus under low water availability at sowing early flowering cultivars with short vegetative phase are more suitable than late flowering cultivars as the former preserve more water for the reproductive phases during which grain number is defined i e critical period simulation models as used in the present study are a powerful tool to optimize crop management practice for different
