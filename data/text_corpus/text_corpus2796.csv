13980,engineered nanoparticles enps present in natural water systems and wastewater treatment plants due to their wide use in industrial products and consumer goods represent a hazard to human health especially if occur in surface waters used for human consumption different nanoparticles may co exist in the natural waters and until now no works have been developed on the impact of the co existing nanoparticles on water treatment processes thus this work evaluates the removal of different co existing metal based enps tio2 ag and cuo from natural surface waters applying the most used water treatment process coagulation flocculation sedimentation c f s results showed that c f s is effective in the removal of the co existing enps from the studied hydrophilic natural waters low medium turbidity and moderate moderate high natural organic matter content with efficiencies above 93 for tio2 ag and cuo nanoparticles the formation of destabilised nanoparticle organic matter aggregates in c f promoted their precipitation for the lowest turbidity and organic content water ti presented the lowest concentration followed by ag and cu because of titanium properties for the highest turbidity and organic content water the residual cu concentration was the lowest and ag the highest due to the natural water characteristics water characteristics played an important role on the coagulant demand and removal of enps mixture by c f s results also demonstrated that enps mixture did not hampered the treated water quality for turbidity and natural organic matter for the lowest turbidity and natural organic matter water enps appear to contribute to a higher removal of these parameters keywords engineered nanoparticles removal efficiency conventional treatment water treatment water quality 1 introduction over the past decades widespread nanotechnologically enabled materials have raised concerns about environmental protection industrial and municipal wastewater treatment and drinking water production 1 these compounds or products are widely applied in distinct areas such as medicine pharmaceutics cosmetics textiles agriculture energy electronics or environment 2 3 due to their tailoring potential for specific applications 4 however waste streams discharges of inadequately treated wastewaters runoff and releases from contaminated sludge placed in landfills applied as fertiliser or dumped in aquatic environments are important causes of surface water contamination by engineered nanoparticles enps 5 6 enps have already been detected in drinking water sources and even in tap water at concentrations in ng l and μg l range making it a potential risk for humans 7 9 enps appellative properties such as the large surface area to volume ratio and small size provide unique materials with new applications compared to the corresponding bulk materials however these same properties may also result in the enhancement of the bioavailability increasing their toxicity and becoming a threat not only for the well being of the aquatic organisms but also to the security of sources used for drinking water production 10 13 the ingestion of enps through drinking water may pose a direct hazard to human health or an indirect risk due to the release of trace metal ions 14 exposure to ingestible metal enps or metal ions released can result in adverse effects such as kidney damage increased blood pressure gastrointestinal inflammation neurological damage and cancerous implications 15 17 therefore the presence of enps in raw waters raises the question of whether current drinking water treatment plants dwtps are prepared to handle this problem being imperative to evaluate their removal effectiveness conventional coagulation flocculation sedimentation c f s is an important water treatment process dedicated to remove small particles suspended solids natural organic matter nom microorganisms pathogens and some inorganic compounds thus it may also be a valuable process to remove nanoparticles earlier studies already investigated the removal of enps namely zno ag and tio2 by c f s treatment applying aluminium and iron based coagulants to different types of contaminated waters 14 18 22 although some enps removal had been observed efficiency rates showed high variability removals for tio2 enps ranged approximately between 32 and 99 14 19 19 20 21 22 ag enps from approximately 79 to 99 14 18 and zno enps between 0 46 and 99 14 22 the results also demonstrated that enps removal by c f s depends largely on the type of enp the dosage and type of coagulant flocculant and the water matrix but little is known about the removal mechanisms moreover the mentioned studies used mostly synthetic waters for each enps individually optimizing coagulant dose for turbidity and nom removal therefore the present work aims to go further by evaluating the ability of c f s to remove a mixture of enps from natural surface waters the focus was on the optimization of coagulant dose for maximal nanoparticles removal while maintaining a sufficient turbidity and nom removal efficiencies thus the removal of co existing enps mixture and dispersed in natural surface waters was investigated since in natural aquatic systems different enps co exist the aims of this study are 1 evaluate the removal efficiency of different co existing enps in natural waters by c f s 2 understand the enps removal behaviours and mechanisms when different nanoparticles are present in water 3 assess the water quality parameters that may affect or be affected by the enps mixture removal during c f s mainly turbidity and nom and 4 explore the c f s overall performance in the simultaneous presence of different enps three commercial metal based enps were tested ag tio2 and cuo nps tio2 and ag enps were chosen because the former are among the most produced nanomaterials and the latter are globally applied to a larger number of consumer products 23 cuo enps were chosen because they are currently emerging as solution for water treatment 24 27 two natural waters from dams currently used to public supply were chosen based on turbidity and nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural water samples surface waters were collected from two different dams currently used for public water supply portugal waters characteristics are presented in table 1 according to epa 31 classification water is doc moderate if its concentration varies between 2 0 and 4 0 mg c l and moderate high between 4 0 and 8 0 mg c l based on this classification nw1 is a moderate doc

presented in l m mg both waters are classified as hydrophilic since suva254 is below 3 32 suva254 values are 2 10 0 09 and 2 19 0 04 l m mg for nw1 and nw2 respectively according to matilainen et al 33 and edzwald and van benschoten 34 classification waters with suva from 2 to 4 present a mixture of aquatic humics a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nom and a mixture of molecular weights 2 2 characterisation of the metal based enps the characteristics of the commercially available tio2 ag and cuo nanopowders sigma aldrich used in this study are presented in table s1 supplementary information nanoparticles were characterised individually without any purification for hydrodynamic diameter hd and zeta potential zp in the natural waters prior to characterisation measurements nps were added to the natural waters and dispersions were sonicated for 20 min bath sonicator usc500th vwr international a zetasizer nano zs analyser malvern instruments inc uk was used to determine enps hd and zp by dynamic light scattering dls and electrophoretic light scattering els respectively as previously described 28 to ensure the quality of the analyses nps concentration was set at 10 mg l as suggested by the equipment supplier and at least three measurements 50 100 runs each were conducted for each replicate 3 sample more detailed information about characterisation of the same enps namely x ray diffraction xrd patterns uv vis absorbance spectrum transmission electron microscopy tem images the hd and zp variation with ph ionic strength and nature and concentration of nom as well as the sedimentation rate were already published in previous works 21 28 30 2 3 experimental setup and procedure c f s lab scale experiments were performed using a jar test unit to simulate the conventional process typically used in dwtps the jar test unit flocumatic selecta spain consists of four paddles and the experiments were conducted using 800 ml sample at controlled room temperature 21 1 c experimental procedure comprised a 2 min coagulation step at a velocity gradient g of 743 s 1 200 rpm a 20 min flocculation step at g of 24 s 1 20 rpm and ends with 30 min of sedimentation without any mixing the experimental conditions mixing speed and time were established based on the usual c f s operating conditions in dwt prior to coagulant addition nps suspensions were sonicated 20 min placed into 1000 ml jars and stirred 1 min after the sedimentation step supernatant aliquots 200 ml were sampled from the mid depth of water column for further analysis for the c f s experiments a commercial polyaluminium chloride coagulant flocculant wac from elf atochem france with 60 70 relative basicity stock solution with 850 mg l al2o3 was used this coagulant was chosen because it is widely applied in full scale water treatment initial series of c f s tests with incremental coagulant doses between 0 and 5 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 0 and 30 mg l al2o3 nw2 with 1 mg l of each enp tio2 ag and cuo individually were carried out these tests were used not only to determine the optimal coagulant dose to be applied in the following experiments enps mixture as also for comparison purposes the optimal dose was established as the lowest dose corresponding to over 90 removal of individual ti ag and cu which was then used for the experiments with the enps mixture with a total concentration of 1 mg l of nanoparticles ratio 1 1 1 a higher coagulant dose was also tested in the latter experiments for the same conditions a c f s controlled trial was carried out where no coagulant was added 0 0 mg l al2o3 replicates of all the experiments were also performed 2 4 analytical methods metal concentrations namely ti ag cu and al were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry graphite furnace aas aanalyst 800 perkine elmer detection limit 0 350 μg l after acid digestion with 2 nitric acid hno3 using standard methods eaton et al 2005a to ensure the accuracy of the analytical procedure standards were injected at the beginning of the sample quantification and between every ten samples ti ag and cu concentrations were determined in bulk and treated waters and al only in treated water samples were analysed for nom by measuring dissolved organic carbon doc shimadzu toc 5000a analyser 50 ppb 4000 ppm and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 beckman du 640b uv vis spectrophotometer other parameters such as turbidity hach 2100 n turbidity meter of high resolution 0 001 ntu ph at 25 c whatman wtw ph340 m and conductivity crison glp32 conductimeter were also measured based on standard methods of analysis eaton et al 2005b 2 5 statistical analysis linear regression analysis was performed using xlstat add in for microsoft excel to determine the pearson s correlations between enps removal and turbidity uv254 and doc removals figure s2 supplementary information the linear coefficient r p value and equation were obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural waters and nanoparticle characterisation the natural waters used in this study were chosen based on their different turbidities low and medium turbidity respectively 1 91 0 36 ntu nw1 and 63 33 5 37 ntu nw2 and nom table 1 and because they come from dams currently used to produce water for human consumption since in this study the natural waters used present suva values close to 2 hydrophilic and non humic nom with low molecular weight and low aromaticity prevails in the mixture according to supplier information enps individual diameter is 100 nm for tio2 and ag and 50 nm for cuo table s1 supplementary information based on previous studies characterising the same nps tio2 nps individual diameter is around 74 nm 30 ag nps is 41 7 1 1 nm 35 and cuo nps is 33 0 2 6 nm 28 table 1 supplementary information fig 1 shows zp and hd variation for tio2 ag and cuo enps in the studied waters comparing the hd values of the three nanoparticles in fig 1 with the values presented in table s1 supplementary information it is observed that when dispersed in water enps showed a hd larger than the individual size indicating the formation of aggregates due to interaction between nanoparticles and between nps and the mixture of components present in the natural waters such as nom 36 39 following dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory aggregation in aqueous dispersions mainly results from the combination of van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion due to the electric double layer of the counterions 40 42 however interactions such as hydration forces magnetic and hydrophobic interactions not dlvo theory interactions also contribute significantly to the aggregation process 2 43 despite the essential role of nom in the aggregation and stability of enps in water understanding the exact effect of nom is a challenge since it is ubiquitous in natural waters 44 even though it is certain that nom adsorbs to nanoparticles surfaces imparting negative charge and providing charge and steric stabilisation 43 45 fig 1 according to ottofuelling et al 46 nom may reduce or neutralise the positive charge of metal oxides surfaces or even induce a reversal of charge from positive to negative at sufficient nom concentration the latter effect was observed for the cuo enps since these nanoparticles have a ph point of zero charge phpzc around ph 10 28 at phpzc higher aggregates are expected since particles are unstable with little or no charge so repulsive forces between nanoparticles are weaker implying that each collision between primary nanoparticles and aggregates causes particles adherence 47 at ph below phpzc as the ph of nw1 and nw2 table 1 cuo enps are positively charged and stable however when dispersed in the natural waters the zp shift and became negative 18 8 3 4 mv for nw1 and 34 9 3 4 mv for nw2 fig 1 the negatively charged nom neutralises the cuo nanoparticles positive charge favouring the organic matter adsorption onto the nanoparticle surfaces although the increasing of nom content from nw1 to nw2 imparts more negativity to cuo enps surface charge hd remains practically unchanged 400 1 16 2 nm nw1 and 381 0 17 5 nm nw2 fig 1 possibly due to the already installed nom surface coating layer on the cuo particles 44 48 this surface coating increases the effect of steric stabilisation in addition to the effect on surface charge that governs particle interactions in aqueous media causing the particle particle repulsion 44 49 unlike cuo enps tio2 and ag were negatively charged at natural water ph approximately 7 21 35 tio2 enps phpzc is around 5 4 and above this ph these nanoparticles are negatively charged 21 when dispersed in natural waters in the presence of the negatively charged nom the surface charge remains negative resulting in zps between approximately 22 mv nw1 and 28 mv nw2 and hds of around 390 nm nw1 and 348 nm nw2 fig 1 similar results were reported by ottofuelling et al 46 and zhang et al 50 at doc concentrations above 0 4 mg c l and ph above phpzc the organic matter stabilised the tio2 nanoparticles in suspension the nps were covered with organic matter resulting in zeta potentials around 20 mv despite the increase of nom from nw1 to nw2 zp and hd remained practically unchanged possibly due to the already installed surface coating layer of nom onto tio2 nanoparticles which promotes the effect of steric stabilisation the ag enps phpzc is most likely at ph values under 2 6 as demonstrated in previous work 29 and also reported by elzey and grassian 51 therefore when dispersed in the natural waters these enps were more negatively charged that the tio2 with zp around 40 mv nw1 and 43 mv nw2 and hd around 202 nm nw1 and 195 nm nw2 fig 1 the same stabilisation trend observed for tio2 enps were also observed for ag enps fig 1 3 2 enps removal fig 2 shows the enps removal efficiencies by c f s in natural waters nw1 and nw2 using different coagulant doses for the experiments with the enps mixture and each one individually for comparison purposes ti ag and cu removal increases with the increase of coagulant dose for both waters ti ag and cu present some removal without the addition of coagulant around 25 37 nw1 and 48 53 nw2 fig 2 due to the high aggregate s size formed when enps are dispersed in the natural waters fig 1 these results demonstrate the aggregates good settleability which favour the removal of nanoparticles by c f s process the differences between enps removals are due to their specific properties since deposition behaviour is likely determined by a combination between enps properties and physicochemical characteristics of the medium 44 the removal efficiencies increase with the coagulant dose until a plateau is reached and no significant variations are observed in the enps removal rates fig 2 this plateau is achieved at 3 0 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 15 0 mg l al2o3 nw2 corresponding to the optimal coagulant doses for nw1 the plateau remains for the following coagulant doses for nw2 the plateau remains until 20 0 mg l a2o3 afterwards the removal decrease fig 2 as can be observed by enps zp values fig 1 the three nanoparticles are negatively charged between 19 and 40 mv nw1 and 28 and 43 mv nw2 at the beginning of the experiment the addition of the positively charged coagulant to the natural waters induces the enps destabilisation through neutralisation of negative charges by hydrolysed al3 consequently zp increases and approaches zero as showed in table s2 supplementary information at the optimal coagulant dose enps are destabilised with surface charge close to zero promoting their precipitation due to the decrease of the electrostatic repulsion between them 52 zhang et al 2015 showed that in the range of zp between 20 and 20 mv nanoparticles could be destabilised and effectively removed as observed in this study these results indicate that the major mechanism acting in the removal of these enps is charge neutralisation as already demonstrated in a previous study 21 and according to abbott chalew et al 14 and liu et al 53 with the increase in the coagulant dose the zp become more positive table s2 supplementary information which can induce the re stabilization of enps and the consequent decrease in the removal rate due to the excess of positive charges as observed for 25 0 30 0 mg l al2o3 in nw2 the higher enps removals found in nw2 could also be related to higher particulate content higher turbidity that increase the collision frequency of particles enhancing coagulation 54 results also show no need to increase coagulant dose for the removal of enps mixture within the same water since the optimal coagulant dose of 3 0 mg al2o3 l for nw1 and 15 0 mg al2o3 l for nw2 based on the individual enps experiments is highly effective to the simultaneous removal of different enps fig 2 and figures s1 a1 and s1 b1 in supplementary information regarding the enps residual concentrations in nw1 at 3 0 mgal2o3 l 6 5 2 1 μg l 15 0 1 4 μg l and 18 8 8 8 μg l of ti ag and cu respectively figure s1a ti presents the lowest value which can be related to the titanium properties that have been shown to be effective in particle nutrients and organic matter removals zhao et al 2014 in nw2 at 15 0 mgal2o3 l the residual cu concentration is the lowest 2 5 0 7 μg l 6 0 1 4 μg l and 0 5 0 1 μ l of ti ag and cu respectively figures s1 b1 and b2 and the ti effect is not observed possibly due to the water characteristics namely moderate high doc water with medium turbidity table 1 although both waters are hydrophilic their differences between turbidity and nom play an important role on the coagulant demand on the overall c f s performance and consequently on the enps removal abbott chalew et al 2013 honda et al 2014 kinsinger et al 2015 serrão sousa et al 2017 sun et al 2013 for the 4 0 mg l nw1 and 20 mg l al2o3 nw2 the enps residual concentrations are also low with similar values to those obtained for the optimal coagulant dose figures s1 a1 and b1 indicating that coagulant dose can be increased if necessary to improve the removal of other contaminants or naturally occurring substances in surface waters therefore the high removals obtained for ti ag and cu in the mixture above 93 and in the individual enps above 90 experiments for both waters fig 2 demonstrate that c f s is efficient in the simultaneous removal of tio2 ag and cuo enps from hydrophilic surface waters 3 3 turbidity and nom removal despite the high efficiency of c f s in the enps simultaneous removal demonstrated above it is imperative to evaluate if the mixture of enps affects the overall performance of the process and the treated water quality it is also essential to explore the relation between the enps and turbidity and nom removal to corroborate that coagulant dose can be optimised for the enps removal without hampering other target compounds removal therefore fig 3 shows the removal efficiencies of turbidity doc and uv254 absorbance and figure s2 supplementary information the correlation between enps and turbidity doc and uv254 removal efficiencies table 2 presents the turbidity doc uv254 absorbance ph conductivity and aluminium values for the studied natural waters after the c f s treatment the turbidity removal was very high despite the presence of single or multiple enps in both waters fig 3 moreover turbidity removal trend is similar to the enps removal fig 2 independently of the water the presence of enps does not appear to negatively affect turbidity removal indeed in nw1 the presence of enps especially tio2 seems to have a positive impact on turbidity removal despite the highest turbidity removal observed without enps 90 1 5 4 at the al2o3 concentration of 2 0 mg l fig 3a1 as already mentioned the presence of ti based nanoparticles can contribute to high turbidity nutrients and organic matter removals due to the titanium coagulation capacities 55 56 when enps are present higher coagulant doses are needed due to the turbidity increase related to the addition of the enps to the natural waters fig 3a1 in the nw2 neither the ti effect on the turbidity removal nor higher coagulant demand are observed in the presence of enps fig 3a2 most likely due to the water characteristics namely the high turbidity overlaps those effects at higher particulate matter content higher turbidity higher coagulant doses can promote the enmeshment of the particles by sweep flocculation in a mass of amorphous al based coagulant improving turbidity removal 54 which could also be observed in nw2 in addition sun et al 54 concluded that in a nanoparticle system charge neutralisation was the main mechanism for turbidity removal with low alum concentrations and sweep flocculation with high alum doses similarly enps removal from nw2 could also involve the sweep flocculation mechanism however further experiments are necessary to fully understand this mechanism nevertheless at the selected coagulant doses of 3 0 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 15 0 mg l al2o3 nw2 for enps removal the turbidity removal efficiencies are very high around 89 0 93 1 nw1 figure 3a1 and 98 6 99 9 nw2 figure 3a2 similarly to the enps removal higher coagulant doses are not necessary to the turbidity removal in the enps mixture experiments figure 3a the enps mixture does not show a significant impact on the doc removals for both waters fig 3b indeed no significant variations are observed for doc removals in experiments without enps individual enps and enps mixture however the doc removals increase with coagulant dose increase as shown in fig 3b a similar trend is observed for the uv254 absorbance removal fig 3c for the optimal coagulant dose the nom removals range between 21 23 for doc fig 3b1 and 36 42 for uv254 fig 3c1 in nw1 in nw2 removals vary between 33 38 for doc figure 4b2 and 50 54 for uv254 figure 3c2 the doc and uv254 removals are higher in nw2 than in nw1 since more coagulant was applied in the former this is related to the negatively nom charges in natural waters that induce the need of higher coagulant doses to charge neutralisation in fact the increase in coagulant dose in nw1 and nw2 is always followed by an increase in the doc and uv254 absorbance removals as also demonstrated by clavier et al 57 therefore despite the enps presence doc removal efficiencies are within an acceptable range of values for coagulation according to matilainen et al 33 in waters with suva between 2 and 4 l m mg doc removals by al based coagulation ranged between 25 and 50 this indicates that the optimal coagulant doses achieved based on enps removal are suitable for the removal of nom globally uv254nm presents higher removals than doc in both waters suggesting that aromatic organic matter is more efficiently removed the studied linear relationship between turbidity uv254 and doc and enps removal shows strong significant correlations between them with 0 8 r 1 0 p values 0 05 figure s2 supplementary information these high correlations corroborate that enps form aggregates with nom and particulate matter during coagulation and are removed together as a complex for nw1 figure s2a supplementary information a slightly higher correlation between enps and turbidity is observed however in nw2 figure s2b supplementary information the strongest correlation is observed for enps and uv254 removals which can be related to the aromatic compounds content in this water the high correlations between enps removal and these target compounds also demonstrate that the coagulant optimisation based on the enps removal has not a negative impact on the overall performance of c f s 3 4 treated water quality the good c f s performance is also demonstrated by the results presented in table 2 at the end of the c f s treatment for the selected coagulant doses the turbidity of both nw1 and nw2 is low 0 41 0 17 ntu and 0 07 0 02 ntu respectively table 2 these values are under national and international guidelines 4 0 ntu which are applied to the final treated water and not at the end of c f s treatment doc final concentration is 1 50 0 07 mgc l for nw1 and 2 62 0 33 mgc l for nw2 table 2 the former value is similar to the average value of 1 6 mgc l observed in portuguese wtps there is no guideline for doc the latter doc value is above the wtp value however this value is measured in wtp final treated water after filtration and disinfection conductivity and ph do not significantly vary with coagulant doses during the experiments at the optimal doses ph is 7 2 nw1 and 7 5 nw2 which is similar to wtp treated water ph 7 8 and within the guidelines range ph 6 5 9 table 2 conductivity 212 1 μs cm for nw1 and 364 1 μs cm for nw2 is below the guideline of 2500 μs cm aluminium in the treated water is also below the national guideline of 200 μg l for both waters and within the range obtained in wtp final water table 2 wtp al residual concentrations presented a high variability ranged between 13 and 200 μg l with an average value of approximately 66 1 μg l 58 4 conclusions this work shows that conventional treatment c f s can remove mixtures of enps from natural waters during water treatment commercial al based coagulant was able to remove approximately 98 95 and 94 of ti ag and cu respectively from a low turbidity natural water 1 91 0 36 ntu and approximately 99 of ti ag and cu from a medium turbidity natural water 63 33 5 37 ntu for the selected coagulant doses residual concentrations of the co existing enps were 6 5 2 1 and 2 5 0 7 μg ti l 15 0 1 4 and 6 0 1 4 μg ag l and 18 8 8 8 and 0 5 0 1 μg cu l respectively for the lowest turbidity and nom content water nw1 and for the highest turbidity and nom content water nw2 therefore the differences between water characteristics play an important role on the coagulant demand on the overall performance of c f s process and consequently on the enps mixture removal despite both waters are hydrophilic the presence of ag tio2 and cuo mixture did not hamper the removal of c f s target parameters namely turbidity and nom moreover tio2 enps even seem to contribute to a higher removal of these compounds in the low turbidity and nom content water turbidity removals were above 90 and nom removal between 21 38 for doc and 36 54 for uv254 which are within the acceptable range for the efficiency s removals of these parameters by c f s similarly neither the high turbidity nor the high nom content affected the enps mixture removal results also indicated that the major mechanism involved in enps removal by c f s was charge neutralisation however in nw2 sweep flocculation may also be involved but more studies are needed the water quality parameters after c f s were all within the values obtained in water treatment plant which confirmed that enps removal did not hamper c f s overall performance however despite the high enps removal observed residual concentrations of ti cu and ag between approximately 0 5 and 18 8 μg l were still found in c f s treated water the presence of these concentrations that could be associated with enps dissolution may require a subsequent process to ensure the entire removal of nanoparticles in dwtps declaration of competing interest the authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that

enps from approximately 79 to 99 14 18 and zno enps between 0 46 and 99 14 22 the results also demonstrated that enps removal by c f s depends largely on the type of enp the dosage and type of

methods 2 1 natural water samples surface waters were collected from two different dams currently used for public water supply portugal waters characteristics are presented in table 1 according to epa

process typically used in dwtps the jar test unit flocumatic selecta spain consists of four paddles and the experiments were conducted using 800 ml sample at controlled room temperature 21 1 c experimental procedure comprised a 2 min coagulation step at a velocity gradient g of 743 s 1 200 rpm a 20 min flocculation step at g of 24 s 1 20 rpm and ends with 30 min of sedimentation without any mixing the experimental conditions mixing speed and time were established based on the usual c f s operating conditions in dwt prior to coagulant addition nps suspensions were sonicated 20 min placed into 1000 ml jars and stirred 1 min after the sedimentation step supernatant aliquots 200 ml were sampled from the mid depth of water column for further analysis for the c f s experiments a commercial polyaluminium chloride coagulant flocculant wac from elf atochem france with 60 70 relative basicity stock solution with 850 mg l al2o3 was used this coagulant was chosen because it is widely applied in full scale water treatment initial series of c f s tests with incremental coagulant doses between 0 and 5 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 0 and 30 mg l al2o3 nw2 with 1 mg l of each enp tio2 ag and cuo individually were carried out these tests were used not only to determine the optimal coagulant dose to be applied in the following experiments enps mixture as also for comparison purposes the optimal dose was established as the lowest dose corresponding to over 90 removal of individual ti ag and cu which was then used for the experiments with the enps mixture with a total concentration of 1 mg l of nanoparticles ratio 1 1 1 a higher coagulant dose was also tested in the latter experiments for the same conditions a c f s controlled trial was carried out where no coagulant was added 0 0 mg l

were injected at the beginning of the sample quantification and between every ten samples ti ag and cu concentrations were determined in bulk and treated waters and al only in treated water samples

turbidity uv254 and doc removals figure s2 supplementary information the linear coefficient r p value and equation were obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural waters and nanoparticle characterisation the natural waters used in this study were chosen based on their different turbidities low and medium turbidity respectively 1 91 0 36 ntu nw1 and 63 33 5 37 ntu nw2 and nom table 1 and because they come from dams currently used to produce water for human consumption since in this study the natural waters used present suva values close to 2 hydrophilic and non humic nom with low molecular weight and low aromaticity prevails in the mixture according to supplier information enps individual diameter is 100 nm for tio2 and ag and 50 nm for cuo table s1 supplementary information based on previous studies characterising the same nps tio2 nps individual diameter is around 74 nm 30 ag nps is 41 7 1 1 nm 35 and cuo nps is 33 0 2 6 nm 28 table 1 supplementary information fig 1 shows zp and hd variation for tio2 ag and cuo enps in the studied waters comparing the hd values of the three nanoparticles in fig 1 with the values presented in table s1 supplementary information it is observed that when dispersed in water enps showed a hd larger than the individual size indicating the formation of aggregates due to interaction between nanoparticles and between nps and the mixture of components present in the natural waters such as nom 36 39 following dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory aggregation in aqueous dispersions mainly results from the combination of van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion due to the electric double layer of the counterions 40 42 however interactions such as hydration forces magnetic and hydrophobic interactions not dlvo theory interactions also contribute significantly to the aggregation process 2 43 despite the essential role of nom in the aggregation and stability of enps in water understanding the exact effect of nom is a challenge since it is ubiquitous in natural waters 44 even though it is certain that nom adsorbs to nanoparticles surfaces imparting negative charge and providing charge and steric stabilisation 43 45 fig 1 according to ottofuelling et al 46 nom may reduce or neutralise the positive charge of metal oxides surfaces or even induce a reversal of charge from positive to negative at sufficient nom concentration the latter effect was observed for the cuo enps since these nanoparticles have a ph point of zero charge phpzc around ph 10 28 at phpzc higher aggregates are expected since particles are unstable with little or no charge so repulsive forces between nanoparticles are weaker implying that each collision between primary nanoparticles and aggregates causes particles adherence 47 at ph below phpzc as the ph of nw1 and nw2 table 1 cuo enps are positively charged and stable however when dispersed in the natural waters the zp shift and became negative 18 8 3 4 mv for nw1 and 34 9 3 4 mv for nw2 fig 1 the negatively charged nom neutralises the cuo nanoparticles positive charge favouring the organic matter adsorption onto the nanoparticle surfaces although the increasing of nom content from nw1 to nw2 imparts more negativity to cuo enps surface charge hd remains practically unchanged 400 1 16 2 nm nw1 and 381 0 17 5 nm nw2 fig 1 possibly due to the already installed nom surface coating layer on the cuo particles 44 48 this surface coating increases the effect of steric stabilisation in addition to the effect on surface charge that governs particle interactions in aqueous media causing the particle particle repulsion 44 49 unlike cuo enps tio2 and ag were negatively charged at natural water ph approximately 7 21 35 tio2 enps phpzc is around 5 4 and above this ph these nanoparticles are negatively charged 21 when dispersed in natural waters in the presence of the negatively charged nom the surface charge remains negative resulting in zps between approximately 22 mv nw1 and 28 mv nw2 and hds of around 390 nm nw1 and 348 nm nw2 fig 1 similar results were reported by ottofuelling et al 46 and zhang et al 50 at doc concentrations above 0 4 mg c l and ph above phpzc the organic matter stabilised the tio2 nanoparticles in suspension the nps were covered with organic matter resulting in zeta potentials around 20 mv despite the increase of nom from nw1 to nw2 zp and hd remained practically unchanged possibly due to the already installed surface coating layer of nom onto tio2 nanoparticles which promotes the effect of steric stabilisation the ag enps phpzc is most likely at ph values under 2 6 as demonstrated in previous work 29 and also reported by elzey and grassian 51 therefore when dispersed in the natural waters these enps were more negatively charged that the tio2 with zp around 40 mv nw1 and 43 mv nw2 and hd around 202 nm nw1 and 195 nm nw2 fig 1 the same stabilisation trend observed for tio2 enps were also observed for ag enps fig 1 3 2 enps removal fig 2 shows the enps removal efficiencies by c f s in natural waters nw1 and nw2 using different coagulant doses for the experiments with the enps mixture and each one individually for comparison purposes ti ag and cu removal increases with the increase of coagulant dose for both waters ti ag and cu present some removal without the addition of coagulant around 25 37 nw1 and 48 53 nw2 fig 2 due to the high aggregate s size formed when enps are dispersed in the natural waters fig 1 these results demonstrate the aggregates good settleability which favour the removal of nanoparticles by c f s process the differences between enps removals are due to their specific properties since deposition behaviour is likely determined by a combination between enps properties and physicochemical characteristics of the medium 44 the removal efficiencies increase with the coagulant dose until a plateau is reached and no significant variations are observed in the enps removal rates fig 2 this plateau is achieved at 3 0 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 15 0 mg l al2o3 nw2 corresponding to the optimal coagulant doses for nw1 the plateau remains for the following coagulant doses for nw2 the plateau remains until 20 0 mg l a2o3 afterwards the removal decrease fig 2 as can be observed by enps zp values fig 1 the three nanoparticles are negatively charged between 19 and 40 mv nw1 and 28 and 43 mv nw2 at the beginning of the experiment the addition of the positively charged coagulant to the natural waters induces the enps destabilisation through neutralisation of negative charges by hydrolysed al3 consequently zp increases and approaches zero as showed in table s2 supplementary information at the optimal coagulant dose enps are destabilised with surface charge close to zero promoting their precipitation due to the decrease of the electrostatic repulsion between them 52 zhang et al 2015 showed that in the range of zp between 20 and 20 mv nanoparticles could be destabilised and effectively removed as observed in this study these results indicate that the major mechanism acting in the removal of these enps is charge neutralisation as already demonstrated in a previous study 21 and according to abbott chalew et al 14 and liu et al 53 with the increase in the coagulant dose the zp become more positive table s2 supplementary information which can induce the re stabilization of enps and the consequent decrease in the removal rate due to the excess of positive charges as observed for 25 0 30 0 mg l al2o3 in nw2 the higher enps removals found in nw2 could also be related to higher particulate content higher turbidity that increase the collision frequency of particles enhancing coagulation 54 results also show no need to increase coagulant dose for the removal of enps mixture within the same water since the optimal coagulant dose of 3 0 mg al2o3 l for nw1 and 15 0 mg al2o3 l for nw2 based on the individual enps experiments is highly effective to the simultaneous removal of different enps fig 2 and figures s1 a1 and s1 b1 in supplementary information regarding the enps residual concentrations in nw1 at 3 0 mgal2o3 l 6 5 2 1 μg l 15 0 1 4 μg l and 18 8 8 8 μg l of ti ag and cu respectively figure s1a ti presents the lowest value which can be related to the titanium properties that have been shown to be effective in particle nutrients and organic matter removals zhao et al 2014 in nw2 at 15 0 mgal2o3 l the residual cu concentration is the lowest 2 5 0 7 μg l 6 0 1 4 μg l and 0 5 0 1 μ l of ti ag and cu respectively figures s1 b1 and b2 and the ti effect is not observed possibly due to the water characteristics namely moderate high doc water with medium turbidity table 1 although both waters are hydrophilic their differences between turbidity and nom play an important role on the coagulant demand on the overall c f s performance and consequently on the enps removal abbott chalew et al 2013 honda et al 2014 kinsinger et al 2015 serrão sousa et al 2017 sun et al 2013 for the 4 0 mg l nw1 and 20 mg l al2o3 nw2 the enps residual concentrations are also low with similar values to those obtained for the optimal coagulant dose figures s1 a1 and b1 indicating that coagulant dose can be increased if necessary to improve the removal of other contaminants or naturally occurring substances in surface waters therefore the high removals obtained for ti ag and cu in the mixture above 93 and in the individual enps above 90 experiments for both waters fig 2 demonstrate that c f s is efficient in the simultaneous removal of tio2 ag and cuo enps from hydrophilic surface waters 3 3 turbidity and nom removal despite the high efficiency of c f s in the enps simultaneous removal demonstrated above it is imperative to evaluate if the mixture of enps affects the overall performance of the process and the treated water quality it is also essential to explore the relation between the enps and turbidity and nom removal to corroborate that coagulant dose can be optimised for the enps removal without hampering other target compounds removal therefore fig 3 shows the removal efficiencies of turbidity doc and uv254 absorbance and figure s2 supplementary information the correlation between enps and turbidity doc and uv254 removal efficiencies table 2 presents the turbidity doc uv254 absorbance ph conductivity and aluminium values for the studied natural waters after the c f s treatment the turbidity removal was very high despite the presence of single or multiple enps in both waters fig 3 moreover turbidity removal trend is similar to the enps removal fig 2 independently of the water the presence of enps does not appear to negatively affect turbidity removal indeed in nw1 the presence of enps especially tio2 seems to have a positive impact on turbidity removal despite the highest turbidity removal observed without enps 90 1 5 4 at the al2o3 concentration of 2 0 mg l fig 3a1 as already mentioned the presence of ti based nanoparticles can contribute to high turbidity nutrients and organic matter removals due to the titanium coagulation capacities 55 56 when enps are present higher coagulant doses are needed due to the turbidity increase related to the addition of the enps to the natural waters fig 3a1 in the nw2 neither the ti effect on the turbidity removal nor higher coagulant demand are observed in the presence of enps fig 3a2 most likely due to the water characteristics namely the high turbidity overlaps those effects at higher particulate matter content higher turbidity higher coagulant doses can promote the enmeshment of the particles by sweep flocculation in a mass of amorphous al based coagulant improving turbidity removal 54 which could also be observed in nw2 in addition sun et al 54 concluded that in a nanoparticle system charge neutralisation was the main mechanism for turbidity removal with low alum concentrations and sweep flocculation with high alum doses similarly enps removal from nw2 could also involve the sweep flocculation mechanism however further experiments are necessary to fully understand this mechanism nevertheless at the selected coagulant doses of 3 0 mg l al2o3 nw1 and 15 0 mg l al2o3 nw2 for enps removal the turbidity removal efficiencies are very high around 89 0 93 1 nw1 figure 3a1 and 98 6 99 9 nw2 figure 3a2 similarly to the enps removal higher coagulant doses are not necessary to the turbidity removal in the enps mixture experiments figure 3a the enps mixture does not show a significant impact on the doc removals for both waters fig 3b indeed no significant variations are observed for doc removals in experiments without enps individual enps and enps mixture however the doc removals increase with coagulant dose increase as shown in fig 3b a similar trend is observed for the uv254 absorbance removal fig 3c for the optimal coagulant dose the nom removals range between 21 23 for doc fig 3b1 and 36 42 for uv254 fig 3c1 in nw1 in nw2 removals vary between 33 38 for doc figure 4b2 and 50 54 for uv254 figure 3c2 the doc and uv254 removals are higher in nw2 than in nw1 since more coagulant was applied in the former this is related to the negatively nom charges in natural waters that induce the need of higher coagulant doses to charge neutralisation in fact the increase in coagulant dose in nw1 and nw2 is always followed by an increase in the doc and uv254 absorbance removals as also demonstrated by clavier et al 57 therefore despite the enps presence doc removal efficiencies are within an acceptable range of values for coagulation according to matilainen et al 33 in waters with suva between 2 and 4 l m mg doc removals by al based coagulation ranged between 25 and 50 this indicates that the optimal coagulant doses achieved based on enps removal are suitable for the removal of nom globally uv254nm presents higher removals than doc in both waters suggesting that aromatic organic matter is more efficiently removed the studied linear relationship between turbidity uv254 and doc and enps removal shows strong significant correlations between them with 0 8 r 1 0 p values 0 05 figure s2 supplementary information these high correlations corroborate that enps form aggregates with nom and particulate matter during coagulation and are removed together as a complex for nw1 figure s2a supplementary information a slightly higher correlation between enps and turbidity is observed however in nw2 figure s2b supplementary information the strongest correlation is observed for enps and uv254 removals which can be related to the aromatic compounds content in this water the high correlations between enps removal and these target compounds also demonstrate that the coagulant optimisation based on the enps removal has not a negative impact on the overall performance of c f s 3 4 treated water quality the good c f s performance is also demonstrated by the results presented in table 2 at the end of the c f s treatment for the selected coagulant doses the turbidity of both nw1 and nw2 is low 0 41 0 17 ntu and 0 07 0 02 ntu respectively table 2 these values are under national and international guidelines 4 0 ntu which are applied to the final treated water and not at the end of c f s treatment doc final concentration is 1 50 0 07 mgc l for nw1 and 2 62 0 33 mgc l for nw2 table 2 the former value is similar to the average value of 1 6 mgc l observed in portuguese wtps there is no guideline for doc the latter doc value is above the wtp value however this value is measured in wtp final treated water after filtration and disinfection conductivity and ph do not significantly vary with coagulant doses during the experiments at the optimal doses ph is 7 2 nw1 and 7 5 nw2 which is similar to wtp treated water ph 7 8 and within the guidelines range ph 6 5 9 table 2 conductivity 212 1 μs cm for nw1 and 364 1 μs cm for nw2 is below the guideline of 2500 μs cm aluminium in the treated water is also below the national guideline of 200 μg l for both waters and within the range obtained in wtp final water table 2 wtp al residual concentrations presented a high variability ranged between 13 and 200 μg l with an average value of approximately 66 1 μg l 58 4 conclusions this work shows that conventional treatment c f s can remove mixtures of enps from natural waters during water treatment commercial al based coagulant was able to remove approximately 98 95 and 94 of ti ag and cu respectively from a low turbidity natural water 1 91 0 36 ntu and approximately 99 of ti ag and cu from a medium turbidity natural water 63 33 5 37 ntu for the selected coagulant doses residual concentrations of the co existing enps were 6 5 2 1 and 2 5 0 7 μg ti l 15 0 1 4 and 6 0 1 4 μg ag l and 18 8 8 8 and 0 5 0 1 μg cu l respectively for the lowest turbidity and nom content water nw1 and for the highest turbidity and nom content water nw2 therefore the differences between water characteristics play an important role on the coagulant demand on the overall performance of c f s process and consequently on the enps mixture removal despite both waters are hydrophilic the presence of ag tio2 and cuo mixture did not hamper the removal of c f s target parameters namely turbidity and nom moreover tio2 enps even seem to contribute to a higher removal of these compounds in the low turbidity and nom content water turbidity removals were above 90 and nom removal between 21 38 for doc and 36 54 for uv254 which are within the acceptable range for the efficiency s removals of these parameters by c f s similarly neither the high turbidity nor the high nom content affected the enps mixture removal results also indicated that the major mechanism involved in enps removal by c f s was charge neutralisation however in nw2 sweep flocculation may also be involved but more studies are needed the water quality parameters after c f s were all within the values obtained in water treatment plant which confirmed that enps removal did not hamper c f s overall performance however despite the high enps removal observed residual concentrations of ti cu and ag between approximately 0 5 and 18 8 μg l were still found in c f s treated water the presence of these concentrations that could be associated with enps dissolution may require a subsequent process to ensure the entire removal of nanoparticles in dwtps declaration of competing interest the authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that

13981,manganese oxide mnox nanorods supported on surfactant modified alumina sma synthesized by the redox co precipitation method are employed as a heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst for degradation of methylene blue mb in presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the uniqueness of the work is that the admicellar support of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant on base material alumina has been utilized to host both the catalyst mnox and the target pollutant mb the catalyst is characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs particle size analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the influence of operational parameters such as initial ph catalyst dose h2o2 concentration the intensity of visible light and initial concentration of mb has been investigated the catalytic performance is evaluated in terms of mb decolorization the reproducibility of the results and reusability of the catalyst is also checked the turnover number ton and turnover frequency tof of the catalyst are found to be 0 068 moles of mb per mole of mn and 2 55 10 6 moles of mb mole of mn s the efficiency of the catalyst to generate hydroxyl radicals under visible light is confirmed using terephthalic acid fluorescence probing technology under optimized conditions 92 decolourization of mb was achieved using the as developed catalyst the main degradation intermediates were identified by esi ms analysis to propose a possible degradation pathway of mb keywords methylene blue degradation surfactant modified alumina mnox nanorods heterogeneous photo fenton reaction 1 introduction methylene blue mb a cationic dye has extensive use in dyeing cotton silk wood 1 as a temporary hair colorant for coating of paper stock 2 for the photodegradation of wood surfaces 3 in sulfide determination by the spectrophotometric method 4 as a promising alternative of isosulphan blue in the treatment of breast cancer 5 detection of dna hybridization 6 etc however despite all its common applications in medical fields its presence in the water body may be threatening in some cases upon exposure people may get increased heart beat rate vomiting heinz body formation cyanosis jaundice quadriplegia etc 2 although it is not a very hazardous substance yet ingestion of it produces a burning sensation in the mouth accidental consumption of high dose of mb may cause headaches and pain in the abdomen and chest 7 it may also cause eye burn in humans and animals 8 in the south indian scenario mb has been reported to be present dominantly in both surface water and groundwater 9 because it is used in most dyeing industries of coimbatore and tiruppur tamil nadu india dyes are recalcitrant resistant to aerobic digestion and have high stability towards light and heat 10 in many cases the traditional wastewater treatment technologies have been proved to be insufficient due to the high stability of the dye molecules 11 the human eye can detect reactive dye even at a low concentration of 0 005 mg l 12 so it is highly objectionable from an aesthetic point of view also conventional activated sludge process asp has been found ineffective even when dyes are mixed with sewage 13 the most common methods available for the dye removal are biological oxidation coagulation flocculation and chemical precipitation however these processes often fail to produce high quality effluents and there is a disposal problem associated with chemical precipitation method 10 adsorption on a suitable substrate is also an alternative method to remove dyes in the recent past a new technology called adsolubilization was reported where surfactant modified alumina sma was used to remove cationic dyes e g malachite green 14 and crystal violet 15 from aqueous media adsolubilization is a process through which organic molecules are solubilized within the admicelle anchored on the solid surface undoubtedly adsolubilization of cationic dyes onto sma and their removal from the aqueous medium is an encouraging process but its limitation is that it only transfers the dyes from one medium to another but does not degrade it to simpler non toxic compounds advanced oxidation processes aops are promising in this regard to degrading dyes up to the mineralization stage fenton s method being one such aop has been widely studied in the past two decades the traditional homogeneous fenton process deals with the activation of h2o2 by fe ii to generate radicals of high oxidation potential however due to several limitations of this process such as maintaining low ph and proper stoichiometric ratio excess sludge generation etc the researchers through decades have tried to modify the process and find alternative reagents to produce heterogeneous fenton catalyst degradation of mb by cobalt copper nanoparticles 16 and co ii loaded surfactant modified alumina surface co sma 17 orange g by copper iron oxide 18 acid orange ii by cobalt iron layered double hydroxide 19 etc are some of the examples of heterogeneous fenton reaction but the use of salts of copper cobalt chromium zinc etc for the heterogeneous fenton reaction is not free from limitations for example availability of copper as cu in the reaction system is problematic and toxicity of cobalt and chromium are high recently supported catalysts have attracted much attention for the activation of hydrogen peroxide peroxymonosulfate and ozone for the degradation of organic pollutants supported catalysts are recovered easily and reused in some cases they are more robust in activity than the colloidal ones 20 nanocatalysts possess distinguishable nanoscale properties due to their reduced dimension their greatly changed electronic configuration and sub surface atomic arrangement significantly improve their catalytic activity compared to that of their bulk structures 21 another attractive issue regarding transition metal oxide in the nano regime is that these materials can be utilized as an excellent redox catalyst because of the high electrical conductivity of the transition metal cation which favors electron transfer and lattice oxygen anion mobility 22 manganese oxides are often used to catalyze oxidation reactions due to having various oxidation states of manganese and diverse crystalline phases 23 yang et al 2009 24 have conducted a study on the catalytic ozonation of pharmaceutical compounds by mesoporous alumina supported manganese oxide wang et al 2016 25 have reported the successful catalytic ozonation and peroxymonosulfate activation by reduced graphene oxide rgo supported nano manganese oxides ceramic honeycomb supported manganese has also been reported to catalytically degrade nitrobenzene in the presence of ozone 26 moreover catalysts possessing anisotropic shape at the nanometer size range drastically change the catalytic activity if the specific crystal facets can be selectively exposed 22 besides this the shape of the nanocatalyst has a strong influence on the catalytic activity the effect of the shape of the nanocrystals has been emphasized on the photodegradation of methyl orange 27 among various shapes of nano mnox the rod shaped structures are much more catalytically active 22 this is also confirmed from the reports of catalytic oxidation of toluene 28 furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanol 29 in the present work we report a novel method for the fabrication of rod shaped nano mnox onto the surface of surfactant modified alumina sma to act as a heterogeneous fenton type catalyst to degrade mb the mnox supported on sma was prepared applying a two step procedure in the first step mn ii was loaded on the sma which possesses an anionic surface the material produced in this step was designated as sma mn in the second step mn ii supported on sma was converted to mnox by a redox co precipitation method by adding kmno4 drop by drop onto it under suspended condition the final solid material was mnox supported on sma this was our catalyst to be designated as sma mnox the step wise preparation of the sma mnox catalyst and the adsolubilization of mb onto its surface is shown in scheme 1 a the catalyst was effective for the degradation of mb in the presence of h2o2 under visible light the added h2o2 was activated by the photo generated electrons and the heterogeneous fenton process led to the production of oh which was responsible for the efficient degradation of mb the most interesting part of the method was that the mb was fully 100 adsorbed on the sma surface and hence the whole reaction occurred on a solid surface it is possibly the first innovative approach where sma supported a non ferrous nanosized transition metal oxide for its further use as a fenton type catalyst to degrade mb under fully adsorbed condition the degradation of mb by h2o2 visible light on sma mnox support is shown in scheme 1 b the present study includes the elucidation of the structure of the catalyst optimization of the process parameters finding out the oxidation mechanism and characterization of the reaction products 2

using avantes uv vis spectrometer having a resolution of 0 5 nm 2 3 catalyst preparation 2 3 1 preparation of surfactant modified alumina sma surfactant modified alumina sma was used as the support for mn ii loading the procedure as reported in our earlier work 15 is as follows first 20 g of sds was dissolved in 900 ml distilled water and 2 5 g nacl was dissolved in 100 ml water separately these two solutions were mixed the ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 5 using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the whole solution was transferred into a bottle and to it 100 g of neutral alumina was added next the whole setup was placed in an incubator shaker and shaken at a speed of 150 rpm for 24 h then the sds concentrations in the first supernatant and two consecutive washings were determined the solid material was filtered and washed two times with double distilled water finally it was dried in a hot air oven for 24 h at 60 c the sds concentration present in the supernatant and the washing was determined following the method reported earlier 30 the solid material obtained is called surfactant modified alumina sma the loading of sds on the as prepared sma was calculated by the mass balance method and it was found to be 113 7 mg g 2 3 2 manganese ii loading on sma to prepare sma mn in a typical procedure 20 g sample of as prepared sma was taken in a conical flask then 100 ml of mncl2 solution conc 1600 mg l was added to it the sample was then placed in the shaker at 150 rpm for 2 h after that the mn concentration in the supernatant was determined using aas the loading of mn ii on sma was determined using the mass balance method and it was found to be 2 5 mg g the solid material was then washed twice and finally dried at 60 c this material was designated as sma mn 2 3 3 preparation of sma mnox from sma mn by redox co precipitation method in the final step mn ii loaded on sma was oxidized using kmno4 in this step sma mn 20 g was suspended and well mixed with 100 ml double distilled water and then 0 6 ml 0 1 m kmno4 was added drop wise the solution was then stirred in a magnetic stirrer for about 4 h and finally allowed to remain at rest for 24 h after that the supernatant was taken out and the solid material was washed several times with distilled water till the washing became neutral the material formed was named as sma mnox the as prepared mnox supported on sma was our fenton type catalyst for mb degradation the schematic for the preparation of sma mnox is shown in scheme 1 a 2 4 calibration graph of mb in 1 butanol the extraction efficiency of the solvent was determined by comparing the two separate calibration curves of mb in the range of 0 8 mg l where the first one was the calibration of mb dissolved in pure 1 butanol i e without extraction as represented by fig s1 a absorbance measured at 657 nm and the second one was the calibration curve of mb after its extraction from mb loaded sma mnox by 1 butanol as represented by fig s1 b thus for the second calibration curve 10 ml mb solutions in the concentration range 0 8 mg l were taken in a series of beakers to each of them sma mnox was added at a dose of 30 g l and kept standing for 30 min it was observed that the whole amount of mb was adsolubilized on the sma mnox surface making it deep blue after mb got fully adsolubilized the whole mixture solid along with the water part was extracted with 1 butanol 10 ml after extraction the absorbance at 657 nm of the 1 butanol layer was measured and plotted vs concentration of mb finally the calibration curve generated was compared with the first one i e without extraction both the calibration curves were straight lines and the correlation coefficients r2 were excellent 0 99 as shown in fig s1 a b the equations were represented as 1 absorbance 0 254 conc mg l 0 048 without extraction and 2 absorbance 0 256 conc mg l 0 036 after extraction for the two described cases 2 5 phzpc determination to determine the phzpc of sma mnox the following procedure was followed 0 1 m nacl solution was prepared and in each of 8 vials 15 ml solution was poured then sma mnox at a dose of 30 g l was added to each of them the ph of the solution was adjusted in the range of 3 10 then the vials were kept in a shaker at 120 rpm for 24 h after 24 h the samples were taken out and the final ph was measured two plots were made to know the phzpc of the material in the first one the final ph was plotted against the initial ph as shown in fig s2 a and in the second one the difference of initial and final ph was plotted against the initial ph as shown in fig s2 b the phzpc of sma mnox was found to be 7 2 from both the plots 2 6 photocatalytic degradation of mb the dye mb degradation experiment was performed in a 50 ml glass beaker which was placed inside another 500 ml glass beaker an aliquot of dye solution 10 ml was taken and sma mnox was added to it in an appropriate quantity the beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer and with the help of a small magnetic fly the dye solution along with sma mnox was agitated at a speed of 500 rpm after 30 min when the dye was completely adsolubilized onto the sma mnox surface h2o2 was added to the solution for degradation of dye the whole set up was placed under visible light a simple table lamp with a 100 w tungsten bulb without incorporation of bandpass filter whose distance from the top of the lamp to the bottom surface of the beaker was 61 cm the intensity of the visible light reaching the surface of the reacting solution was 3000 lx the lamp was turned on immediately after the addition of h2o2 the same experiment was conducted with varying doses of sma mnox different concentrations of h2o2 different initial concentrations of mb and at different initial ph conditions to keep the system cool from the irradiation of the table lamp 100 125 ml of tap water at ambient temperature 25 30 c was placed in the large beaker and from time to time it was replaced it is important to mention that in all kinetic plots shown the zero time is the time of h2o2 addition the percentage of degradation of mb was calculated after its extraction from the sma mnox surface using 1 butanol as the extracting solvent as the mb was fully adsorbed on the sma mnox surface as shown in scheme 1 a from the beginning and throughout the entire reaction it was important to measure the efficiency of mb extraction from the sma mnox surface using a suitable organic solvent after preliminary experiments 1 butanol was selected as an extracting solvent for such purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalyst the powder x ray diffraction xrd analyses of sma sma mn and sma mnox were performed to identify the crystalline phases and orientation of the material the peaks in the three materials have been found almost in the same region from the jcpds file the peaks have been found at 28 707 38 472 41 096 44 814 and 46 393 the values have been confirmed from pdf nos 851327 030932 021109 011179 011176 this study indicates that the peaks are due to alumina no additional peak for manganese oxide was observed in the sma mnox which may be either due to the presence of a low percentage of manganese or due to the amorphous nature of the manganese oxide it is also evident from the literature that the fast reaction of mn vii and mn ii leads to the formation of several nuclei within a short period of time which causes the amorphous nature of the catalyst 31 the x ray powder diffraction patterns of sma sma mn and sma mnox catalyst are displayed in fig 1 the ftir analyses were carried out for sma sma mn and sma mnox and the spectra are shown in fig 2 the band appearing at 550 cm 1 designates the stretching vibration of al o the peak at 1640 cm 1 is assigned to the vibration band of oh due to surface water on alumina the broad absorption peak in the range of 3410 3465 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the oh group indicating the existence of the hydroxyl groups on the surface 32 the band at 1240 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the so bond present in sulfate group of sds 33 the band at 1070 cm 1 is due to cc stretching vibration the peaks at 2850 and 2920 cm 1 are due to the symmetric andasymmetric stretching vibration of ch 34 from the data obtained it is clear that alumina and sds are present in all three materials when the spectra are compared it is revealed that there are peaks near 1640 cm 1 in both sma and sma mn but after the addition of kmno4 the peak becomes sharper in sma mnox it may be due to the formation of ɤ mno2 which shows a peak at 1620 cm 1 35 the diffuse reflectance spectra drs analyses were conducted to study the optical properties of sma sma mn sma mnox and sma mnox mb sma mnox after mb adsorption as shown in fig 3 the drs of sma shows no significant peak whereas the spectra of sma mn and sma mnox show the absorption peaks in the visible range 350 500 nm which is due to the presence of mn ii and mnox compared to sma and sma mn sma mnox has stronger absorption in the visible region these results predict that the as prepared sma mnox may suitably be excited by visible light the incorporation of mb in sma mnox is supported by the appearance of the absorption peak in the drs of sma mnox mb at 660 nm which is a characteristic peak for mb fig 3 the xps analysis of sma mnox was performed to analyze the surface chemical composition and electronic states of mn and o and the spectra are shown in fig 4 a f strong photoelectron peaks of al 2p c 1s o 1s and mn 3s and 2p are found from the wide scan spectrum fig 4 a of the sample during the ejection of photoelectron due to the parallel spin coupling of 3s and 3d electron mn 3s core level spectrum shows a peak splitting doublet 31 the oxidation state of manganese in as prepared manganese oxide can be determined from the peak separation of doublets of the mn 3s spectrum the peak separation at 4 7 4 8 ev indicates the 4 state of mn 36 in the present study the peak separation has been observed at 5 1 ev fig 4 b which indicates the possibility of the existence of both 3 and 4 state of mn 31 the characteristic peak for mn 2p 3 2 is obtained at 643 2 ev before reaction and 642 6 ev after reaction after deconvoluting the peak separation occurred at 640 9 ev 642 3 ev and 643 5 ev in the case of sma mnox before reaction fig 4 c on the other hand in the case of sma mnox after the reaction upon deconvoluting the peak separated at 640 4 ev 641 9 ev and 643 2 ev fig 4 d the characteristic mn 2p 1 2 appeared for sma mnox at 654 6 ev before reaction fig 4 c and at 654 0 ev after reaction fig 4 d this indicates that the oxidation state of mn has remained unchanged after mb degradation in the case of sma mnox before reaction fig 4 e the band at 529 ev is attributed to the o 1s binding energy after deconvoluting the o 1s spectrum multiple peaks have been found at 527 0 ev 528 8 ev and 530 1 ev which implies that more than one oxygen sources such as lattice oxygen surface adsorbed oxygen etc are present in the sample similarly in the case of sma mnox after reaction the band at 529 5 ev is attributed to the o 1s binding energy after deconvoluting the o 1s spectrum multiple peaks have been found at 528 5 ev and 529 9 ev fig 4 f the sem analyses of sma sma mn and sma mnox were performed to have an idea about the surface topography of the materials sem images of sma sma mn and sma mnox at different resolutions are shown in fig 5 as observed from the sem images the surfaces were rough in all the cases table 1 a c shows the results of energy dispersive x ray edax spectra of sma sma mn and sma mnox which confirmed the incorporation of mn on sma the incorporated mn in sma mnox was 42 and after mb degradation table 1 d it was drastically reduced to 0 51 although the sem images have been presented in the scale of 200 nm fig 5 a c and 20 μm fig 5 d f in the case of sma and sma mn and sma mnox no distinguishable difference in structure has been noticed in fig 5 d f but at higher resolution in case of sma mnox rod like structures have been found which is observed in fig 5 a b the width of the nanorods was in the range of 30 70 nm fig 5 b while the length is in the micrometer range to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the synthesis of nano mnox rods using only redox co precipitation reaction in the past all nano mnox rods were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis or calcination the rod shaped morphology of the mnox may be due to the presence of micelle similar rod shaped structures have also been noticed in sma mnox after degradation of mb fig 5 c elemental compositions obtained from the edax analyses of the catalyst before and after degradation are shown in table1 c d respectively as the reaction was carried out in aqueous media so it was necessary to find out the size distribution of sma mnox particles in aqueous suspension the hydrodynamic particle size distribution for sma mnox catalysts in aqueous suspension was obtained by laser diffraction ld analysis this could be defined as the mean particle size in aqueous media figure s3 shows the distribution curve of sma mnox particle sizes in deionized water suspension at ph 5 8 6 0 corresponding to the ph of mb photodegradation runs the graph reveals a monomodal distribution where the maximum concentration is centered at 96 μm in the described method the adsorption of mb onto fenton type catalyst sma mnox was the first step the efficiency of adsorption is related to the surface area of the adsorbent material so it was pertinent to know the surface area of the catalyst it was observed that sma mnox had the surface area 90 m2 g which is considerably high the surface area is higher than the nano mno2 catalyst formed by the reaction of kmno4 and oleic acid 31 the pore diameter of sma mnox was 5 nm the adsorption desorption isotherms fig s4 matches with the type v of iupac isotherm which indicates that sma mnox was a mesoporous material 3 2 fenton type degradation of mb 3 2 1 mb adsorption on sma mnox and alumina as sma mnox has been used as the catalyst here so it is a prerequisite of mb to get adsorbed onto it and further to be degraded so it is essential to find out its adsorptive capacity and compare the same with that of the base material i e alumina to find out the role of surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst it is also important to know the optimum contact time for mb adsorption onto sma mnox and alumina to study this phenomenon two sets of 50 ml beakers were taken and in each of them 10 ml of dye solution of the initial concentration of 20 mg l were added to one set sma mnox was added and to the other alumina was added at the same dose of 20 g l the remaining concentration of mb in the solution phase was monitored at 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min contact time in the case of alumina the mb removal was found to be less than 6 the adsorption studies were conducted with sma mnox dose 20 g l using various concentrations in the range of 20 50 mg l and the plots of adsorption capacity vs contact time are shown in fig 6 it is also interesting to observe that an initial 80 adsorption can be achieved within 5 min it is also interesting to note that the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in mb concentration the reason for such a quick rate must be due to the surfactant bilayer giving negative charge to the alumina surface which can attract the cationic mb dye through ionic interaction similar behavior was also observed in our earlier experiments 14 15 17 the hydrophobic interaction between the dye molecule and the surfactant layer can also play a significant role 3 2 2 adsorption of mn ii on sma surface it is already established that when sds is added to alumina under acidic conditions ph 4 5 the sds molecules get adsorbed on the alumina surface leading to the formation of either hemimicelle or admicelle depending on whether the sds concentration is below or above cmc 15 by utilizing the solubilizing property of this micellar layer in the present study mn ii was placed on the sma surface which was further converted to manganese oxide to present a system where the metal oxide and dye co exist in the surfactant bilayer in fully adsorbed state and finally react with hydrogen peroxide in fenton process the concept of performing catalytic reactions utilizing the principle of the fenton process in the heterogeneous solid surface where the micellar environment has been created is new and interesting to find out the time required for optimum concentrations of mn ii adsorption on the sma surface a kinetic study was performed the experimental details are already discussed in section 2 3 2 it was observed that during the initial period the rate was much faster and 99 removal of mn ii occurred in the initial 20 min however 120 min time was selected as the optimum time to prepare sma mn the adsorption kinetics has been shown in fig 7 3 3 kinetics of degradation of mb under various conditions the degradation of mb was carried out under various experimental conditions considering various combinations the visible light vl source used in our study was normal w lamp and the different conditions employed for mb degradation were mb vl mb h2o2 vl mb h2o2 alumina mb h2o2 sma mb h2o2 vl sma mb vl sma mn mb vl sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mn mb h2o2 sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mnox vl as shown in fig 8 out of all these combinations mb h2o2 sma mnox mb vl sma mnox h2o2 and mb h2o2 sma mn system performed well to degrade mb for sma sma mn and sma mnox the adsorption of mb was very high 100 at 20 mg l of mb concentration it is notable that in the present case both mnox and mb are embedded in admicelle and this provides them a better contact after the adsorption of mb i e after 30 min the modified fenton reaction was allowed to start by adding the reagent h2o2 in the reaction medium the combination for this was designated as mb h2o2 sma mnox the degradation of mb was 56 in 4 0 h using an adsorbent dose of 30 g l however the same system if illuminated with visible light 100 w i e the combination mb h2o2 vl sma mnox the mb degradation eﬃciency achieved was much higher 73 in 4 0 h as shown in fig 8 so mb h2o2 vl sma mnox operational condition was considered to proceed further at this point it may be mentioned that although the dose of sma mnox looks rather high 30 g l but the actual catalyst i e mnox present is quite low this is because the loading of mn ii on sma is low 2 5 mg g 3 4 optimization of experimental set up and contact time under the most suitable condition i e mb h2o2 vl sma mnox the reaction was carried out for longer duration till higher removal efficiency more than 90 was achieved it was found that under the same condition with 30 g l dose h2o2 concentration 776 mm the removal efficiency was 96 after 7 5 h 450 min of reaction hence 450 min was determined as the contact time but as the reaction was conducted in the presence of a 100 w tungsten bulb hence enough heat was evolved to prevent the loss of solvent i e water through evaporation from the reaction mixture due to the heat effect from vl proper care for the experimental set up was made the reaction beaker having capacity 50 ml was placed inside a large beaker having capacity 600 ml with some water inside to provide a cooling effect from time to time this water was replaced by fresh cool water to prevent the rise of temperature of the water and the reaction mixture 3 5 effect of operating parameters 3 5 1 effect of h2o2 concentration initially 1 ml hydrogen peroxide 22 8 strength per 10 ml of the reaction mixture with mb concentration 20 mg l was used while the final conc of h2o2 was calculated as 776 mm 26 384 mg l now a study was done to see the change in the mb removal efficiency with the variation of h2o2 concentration it is important to mention here that the mb removal efficiency of 96 was achieved after 450 min 7 5 h while catalyst dose of 30 g l and 776 mm concentration of h2o2 was applied the reaction was observed to follow zero order initially up to 120 min and during this time period 63 mb removal occurred the mb degradation was also performed with the h2o2 concentration 388 mm 13 192 mg l and 194 mm 6596 mg l and the results are shown in fig 9 a d the removal efficiency was found to be 91 in 450 min with 388 mm h2o2 concentration and it was 70 in 450 min with 194 mm h2o2 concentration keeping the time and other experimental conditions same since the removal efficiency achieved with h2o2 having a concentration of 388 mm was comparable with that obtained with 776 mm so all further studies were conducted with 388 mm concentration of h2o2 the reason behind this is that with the increase of concentration of h2o2 there is an increase in the production of hydroxyl radicals which causes more degradation of mb 17 comparative kinetic analyses and percentage of removal shown in the inset of fig 9 d obtained for the photo fenton degradation of mb with three different concentrations of h2o2 have been graphically presented in fig 9 it may seem that the dose of hydrogen peroxide may be higher but such high doses of h2o2 have also been used by zhang et al for degradation of mb 37 it is interesting to note that the reaction followed zero order throughout the entire process indicating a true surface reaction but the reaction rate varied considerably in the different stages of the reaction a similar observation was reported during the electro fenton degradation of acid orange 7 19 and photo fenton degradation of bisphenol a 38 3 5 2 effect of sma mnox dose the kinetic studies on mb degradation were performed with various catalyst doses 10 30 g l at a fixed h2o2 concentration of 388 mm and visible light irradiation of 3000 lx the results are shown in fig 10 a b it is noted that with a catalyst dose of 30 g l and 20 g l the removal efficiency was 92 and that with 10 g l it was 84 in 7 5 h so the optimum sma mnox dose was selected as 20 g l for further studies increased catalyst dose helps in the production of more oh radicals which however may react among themselves leading to the quenching effect 39 another possible reason is the creation of more turbidity due to a higher dose of the catalyst which makes a hindrance to the passage of light 40 it is also interesting to note that in all cases the reaction followed zero order kinetics throughout the entire period of reaction 450 min although in different stages the time dependent absorption spectra of mb degradation with catalyst dose of 20 g l initial mb concentration 20 mg l h2o2 concentration 388 mm have been shown in fig 11 the gradual blue shift of the absorption maximum of mb indicated its step wise degradation through demethylation the zero order rate constant values up to 90 min are shown in table 2 for comparison 3 5 3 effect of initial ph since ph has a significant effect on the rate of classical fenton reaction so it was felt pertinent to study the effect of ph on the reaction rate of mb degradation in many cases it has been observed that during the course of the reaction the ph of the reaction mixture undergoes a significant change however in the present study the initial ph of the medium was almost neutral and no significant change of ph was observed at the end of the reaction so for our study four different initial ph conditions in the range of 3 5 10 0 were selected in each study the reaction was conducted with an initial mb concentration of 20 mg l sma mnox dose 20 g l and h2o2 concentration 388 mm the percent removal of mb in 450 min 7 5 h was found out and the results are shown in fig 12 it was observed that at ph 3 5 the removal efficiency was much less 70 compared to that 93 at higher ph 8 5 9 5 it is important to note that this is contradictory to the homogeneous classical fenton reaction where lower ph is more favored in the present case 95 of degradation was obtained at ph 8 6 in 7 5 h in the case of textile dye wastewater the ph might be at a higher range 10 41 thus the present method might be suitable for degrading these types of wastewater 3 5 4 effect of light intensity since the dye removal efficiency was found to be enhanced under the influence of visible light so it was necessary to examine the mb removal using a tungsten bulb with different powers initially the study was done with a 100 w tungsten bulb 3000 lx now further studies were performed with a 60 w tungsten bulb 2300 lx and a 20 w 10000 lx led bulb the led bulb consumes less power and it has a longer life moreover it produces less heat thus the application of led might be more useful in the present context although during the initial stage of reaction e g up to 90 min the mb removal by the led bulb was slightly better than that of the 100 w bulb but the removal upon long time irradiation 7 5 h with the 100 w bulb showed the best efficiency the rate constant values of mb degradation with various light intensities have been compiled in table 2 and fig 13 the results clearly show that the performance of the100 w bulb was the best for mb degradation and thus it was selected for our studies all the lights used for our experimental purpose have λmax in the visible range the commercially available led bulb has two peaks throughout its absorption spectra one at a short wavelength at 450 nm and the other at long wavelength 580 nm the other light source used is the bulb made of tungsten filament which is used to emit light in the visible range from 350 nm to 800 nm the spectra of both types of lights used for the entire study have been presented in fig 14 it is clear from the two spectra that the led light has a sharp peak where the normal bulb has a broad spectrum 3 5 5 effect of initial mb concentration in the present study most of the work was carried out with mb concentration 20 mg l and under optimized conditions 92 mb degradation efficiency was achieved the efficiency of the catalyst under similar conditions dose of catalyst fixed at 20 g l and h2o2 concentration at 388 mm with 450 min irradiation but with an initial mb concentration of 40 mg l was also conducted and the degradation efficiency was found to be 77 the results have been shown graphically in fig 15 it is seen in fig 15 a b that the removal efficiency has been lowered with the increase of initial concentration of mb the zero order rate constant values under specified conditions have been summarized in table 2 3 6 reusability of the catalyst the economic feasibility of a method depends on the reusability of the catalyst material to check the reusability of sma mnox it was collected at the end of the reaction and was further subjected to mb degradation material reusability can be directly related to the practical applicability of the material if the catalyst is reusable for many times with high efficiency it involves less cost in the long run and hence greater will be its acceptability the results for the reusability test have been shown in fig 16 in its first use the sma mnox could remove up to 92 of mb in the second cycle the removal efficiency was found to be nearly 80 and in the third cycle it was nearly 70 of the initial concentration which is quite encouraging 3 7 reproducibility of the method it was extremely important to find out the reproducibility of the mb degradation by applying the developed catalyst for this purpose the kinetic experiment was carried out in triplicate under the specified condition using mb having concentration 20 mg l catalyst dose 20 g l h2o2 concentration 388 mm and visible light 100 w the reaction time applied was 0 7 5 h the mean and standard deviation has been computed the plot of percent mb removal vs time drawn through the mean values is shown in fig 17 the results are within the relative standard deviation 10 which indicates that the method is quite reproducible 3 8 confirmation of the formation of hydroxyl radicals during mb degradation it was important to examine the formation of reactive oxygen species ros involved during the mb degradation to examine the mechanism fenton degradation is mostly facilitated by oh radical so the formation of oh and its utilization by mb was monitored for this purpose terephthalic acid fluorescence probing technology was utilized under neutral ph condition terephthalic acid ta reacts with hydroxyl radical to form 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid which shows a bright stable fluorescence at 425 nm 42 this reaction remains unaffected in the presence of other ros such as h2o2 ho2 and o2 this phenomenon was used to confirm the formation of the oh radicals during the reaction the formation of oh radical was examined in the presence and absence of mb for this experiment a series of 1 5 ml of reaction mixtures taken at various reaction times were mixed with 1 5 ml of ta solution prepared by dissolving in aqueous naoh solution followed by the addition of hcl to adjust the ph at 7 and finally the fluorescence spectrum was recorded for each mixture slit width 5 5 the fluorescence spectra of the reaction mixtures in the presence and absence of mb are depicted in fig 18 a b respectively the figures indicate that as the reaction time increases the concentration of oh increases which leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity this occurs both in the presence and absence of mb in the initial phase the fluorescence intensity in the absence of mb was found to be much higher compared to that in the presence of mb but ultimately at 450 min of reaction both the fluorescence intensities are found to be comparable the time dependent i i0 plot is also shown in fig 18 c d which indicates that up to 150 min it follows linearity in both the cases this study indicates that oh was utilized by the mb during the reaction the decomposition of h2o2 by supported manganese oxide catalyst and further the generation of hydroxyl radicals may be followed in various ways as found from literature the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ultimately ends up with the formation of water and oxygen as proposed by various researchers this reaction usually involves two pathways firstly a redox pathway can be assumed in which an electron is exchanged with the surface resulting in the formation of ho2 free radicals secondly a chain reaction mechanism can be assumed where several radicals are formed and they react among themselves leading to the formation of water and oxygen hasan et al 43 suggested that the mixed manganese oxide system is catalytically much more active than the pure manganese oxide in respect of hydrogen peroxide decomposition in the previous section it has already been mentioned that a mixed oxidation state of manganese oxide is present which may be the reason for the formation of oh han et al 44 suggested that oh is the main responsible radical for the oxidation of ethanol by mn3o4 supported on sba they suggested the following equations for the decomposition of h2o2 by metal ions 3 s h2o2 s oh oh 4 s h2o2 s ho2 h 5 ho2 h o2 where s is the metal ion likewise kanungo et al 45 suggested various mechanisms for the decomposition of h2o2 by mixed manganese oxides 6 mn3 h2o2 oh oh mn4 7 mn4 h2o2 h ho2 mn3 8 ho2 h o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 3 9 turnover number ton and turnover frequency tof for the mb degradation catalyzed by sma mnox ton is the number of moles of the reactant that can be converted per mole of the catalyst and tof is the turnover number divided by the time required for the conversion the ton has been computed for mb degradation using mb concentration 20 mg l and catalyst dose 20 g l since 10 ml of the reaction mixture contains 0 5 mg mn ii so for the prepared material the ton has been calculated as 0 068 mol of mb per mole of mn and tof is 2 55 10 6 moles of mb mole of mn s 3 10 identification of the intermediate products of mb degradation by esi ms the intermediate products formed during the course of the reaction and at the end were identified using esi ms for this study the reaction mixture at the end of 120 min and 450 min was considered the mass spectral analyses of both the reaction mixtures did not show the molecular ion peak for the parent mb molecule at m z mass to charge ratio 284 17 fig s5 a b hence it can be concluded that no mb was present in the aqueous medium and the dye was fully adsorbed and degraded onto the sma mnox surface besides it can also be concluded that the mb was not leached during the degradation process however during the course of the reaction the signals at higher m z values of 338 and 317 have been observed these peaks have also been noticed to appear during mb degradation using co ii loaded sma 17 these peaks have been presumed to be due to the hydroxylation of mb at multiple positions in addition to these peaks the peaks at lower m z values have also been observed peaks appearing at m z 270 and 256 may be due to the loss of one and two methyl groups and oxidative degradation of mb demethylation of the methylene blue also has been confirmed from the gradual blue shift of the mb absorption spectra as shown in fig 11 in an earlier report a similar blue shift was presumed to be due to the demethylation of mb 46 a sharp peak at m z value of 183 has been noticed which also matches with earlier observations 47 48 in the lower region of the mass spectrum several peaks have been identified at m z of 148 130 112 which is a clear indication of degradation of mb due to the attack of oh radical the intermediate product structure with their m z values is shown in table 3 the overall degradation mechanism of mb can be visualized in several steps firstly mb gets wholly adsolubilized onto the surface of sma mnox as it has been already mentioned in the previous section due to the negative charge of the surface after the addition of h2o2 manganese oxide reacts with it to form the hydroxyl radical which is evidenced from the fluorescence spectra and esi ms spectra and also from the leaching of mn2 during oxidation of mb the whole scheme can be summarized using the following equations 10 sma mnox mb sma mnox mb 11 sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mnox1 mb oh mn2 12 sma mnox1 mb oh sma mnox oxidation product 3 11 leaching of sds and manganese from sma mnox surface during mb degradation it was important to investigate the leaching of metal and surfactant for the above mentioned adsolubilization based catalytic oxidation in the present study the leaching of mn ii and sds from the sma mnox surface was determined after 450 min of reaction and it showed about 35 and 0 63 leaching of manganese and sds respectively 3 12 toxicity test of the treated dye wastewater towards micro organism to test the toxicity of the treated dye wastewater and the by products formed during the degradation process it was applied to a culture of heterogeneous bacteria developed from the effluent of the sewage treatment plant parallel experiments were conducted to study the growth of the bacterial consortia in the nutrient medium in the presence of dye and effluent a control was set up where the same bacterial culture was grown in nutrient media the results have been graphically presented in fig s6 it is interesting to note that after reaching the stationary growth phase the growth was almost equal in three cases except with a slight difference however during the initial lag phase the growth in the presence of effluent was hindered which may be due to the presence of leached sds mn2 and remaining h2o2 but ultimately it was recovered so the effluents and the by products thus formed may not be so toxic to hinder the growth of the bacterial consortia 4 conclusions

13981,manganese oxide mnox nanorods supported on surfactant modified alumina sma synthesized by the redox co precipitation method are employed as a heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst for degradation of methylene blue mb in presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the uniqueness of the work is that the admicellar support of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant on base material alumina has been utilized to host both the catalyst mnox and the target pollutant mb the catalyst is characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs particle size analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the influence of operational parameters such as initial ph catalyst dose h2o2 concentration the intensity of visible light and initial concentration of mb has been investigated the catalytic performance is evaluated in terms of mb decolorization the reproducibility of the results and reusability of the catalyst is also checked the turnover number ton and turnover frequency tof of the catalyst are found to be 0 068 moles of mb per mole of mn and 2 55 10 6 moles of mb mole of mn s the efficiency of the catalyst to generate hydroxyl radicals under visible light is confirmed using terephthalic acid fluorescence probing technology under optimized conditions 92 decolourization of mb was achieved using the as developed catalyst the main degradation intermediates were identified by esi ms analysis to propose a possible degradation pathway of mb keywords methylene blue degradation surfactant modified alumina mnox nanorods heterogeneous photo fenton reaction 1 introduction methylene blue mb a cationic dye has extensive use in dyeing cotton silk wood 1 as a temporary hair colorant for coating of paper stock 2 for the photodegradation of wood surfaces 3 in sulfide determination by the spectrophotometric method 4 as a promising alternative of isosulphan blue in the treatment of breast cancer 5 detection of dna hybridization 6 etc however despite all its common applications in medical fields its presence in the water body may be threatening in some cases upon exposure people may get increased heart beat rate vomiting heinz body formation cyanosis jaundice quadriplegia etc 2 although it is not a very hazardous substance yet ingestion of it produces a burning sensation in the mouth accidental consumption of high dose of mb may cause headaches and pain in the abdomen and chest 7 it may also cause eye burn in humans and animals 8 in the south indian scenario mb has been reported to be present dominantly in both surface water and groundwater 9 because it is used in most dyeing industries of coimbatore and tiruppur tamil nadu india dyes are recalcitrant resistant to aerobic digestion and have high stability towards light and heat 10 in many cases the traditional wastewater treatment technologies have been proved to be insufficient due to the high stability of the dye molecules 11 the human eye can detect reactive dye even at a low concentration of 0 005 mg l 12 so it is highly objectionable from an aesthetic point of view also conventional activated sludge process asp has been found ineffective even when dyes are mixed with sewage 13 the most common methods available for the dye removal are biological oxidation coagulation flocculation and chemical precipitation however these processes often fail to produce high quality effluents and there is a disposal problem associated with chemical precipitation method 10 adsorption on a suitable substrate is also an alternative method to remove dyes in the recent past a new technology called adsolubilization was reported where surfactant modified alumina sma was used to remove cationic dyes e g malachite green 14 and crystal violet 15 from aqueous media adsolubilization is a process through which organic molecules are solubilized within the admicelle anchored on the solid surface undoubtedly adsolubilization of cationic dyes onto sma and their removal from the aqueous medium is an encouraging process but its limitation is that it only transfers the dyes from one medium to another but does not degrade it to simpler non toxic compounds advanced oxidation processes aops are promising in this regard to degrading dyes up to the mineralization stage fenton s method being one such aop has been widely studied in the past two decades the traditional homogeneous fenton process deals with the activation of h2o2 by fe ii to generate radicals of high oxidation potential however due to several limitations of this process such as maintaining low ph and proper stoichiometric ratio excess sludge generation etc the researchers through decades have tried to modify the process and find alternative reagents to produce heterogeneous fenton catalyst degradation of mb by cobalt copper nanoparticles 16 and co ii loaded surfactant modified alumina surface co sma 17 orange g by copper iron oxide 18 acid orange ii by cobalt iron layered double hydroxide 19 etc are some of the examples of heterogeneous fenton reaction but the use of salts of copper cobalt chromium zinc etc for the heterogeneous fenton reaction is not free from limitations for example availability of copper as cu in the reaction system is problematic and toxicity of cobalt and chromium are high recently supported catalysts have attracted much attention for the activation of hydrogen peroxide peroxymonosulfate and ozone for the degradation of organic pollutants supported catalysts are recovered easily and reused in some cases they are more robust in activity than the colloidal ones 20 nanocatalysts possess distinguishable nanoscale properties due to their reduced dimension their greatly changed electronic configuration and sub surface atomic arrangement significantly improve their catalytic activity compared to that of their bulk structures 21 another attractive issue regarding transition metal oxide in the nano regime is that these materials can be utilized as an excellent redox catalyst because of the high electrical conductivity of the transition metal cation which favors electron transfer and lattice oxygen anion mobility 22 manganese oxides are often used to catalyze oxidation reactions due to having various oxidation states of manganese and diverse crystalline phases 23 yang et al 2009 24 have conducted a study on the catalytic ozonation of pharmaceutical compounds by mesoporous alumina supported manganese oxide wang et al 2016 25 have reported the successful catalytic ozonation and peroxymonosulfate activation by reduced graphene oxide rgo supported nano manganese oxides ceramic honeycomb supported manganese has also been reported to catalytically degrade nitrobenzene in the presence of ozone 26 moreover catalysts possessing anisotropic shape at the nanometer size range drastically change the catalytic activity if the specific crystal facets can be selectively exposed 22 besides this the shape of the nanocatalyst has a strong influence on the catalytic activity the effect of the shape of the nanocrystals has been emphasized on the photodegradation of methyl orange 27 among various shapes of nano mnox the rod shaped structures are much more catalytically active 22 this is also confirmed from the reports of catalytic oxidation of toluene 28 furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanol 29 in the present work we report a novel method for the fabrication of rod shaped nano mnox onto the surface of surfactant modified alumina sma to act as a heterogeneous fenton type catalyst to degrade mb the mnox supported on sma was prepared applying a two step procedure in the first step mn ii was loaded on the sma which possesses an anionic surface the material produced in this step was designated as sma mn in the second step mn ii supported on sma was converted to mnox by a redox co precipitation method by adding kmno4 drop by drop onto it under suspended condition the final solid material was mnox supported on sma this was our catalyst to be designated as sma mnox the step wise preparation of the sma mnox catalyst and the adsolubilization of mb onto its surface is shown in scheme 1 a the catalyst was effective for the degradation of mb in the presence of h2o2 under visible light the added h2o2 was activated by the photo generated electrons and the heterogeneous fenton process led to the production of oh which was responsible for the efficient degradation of mb the most interesting part of the method was that the mb was fully 100 adsorbed on the sma surface and hence the whole reaction occurred on a solid surface it is possibly the first innovative approach where sma supported a non ferrous nanosized transition metal oxide for its further use as a fenton type catalyst to degrade mb under fully adsorbed condition the degradation of mb by h2o2 visible light on sma mnox support is shown in scheme 1 b the present study includes the elucidation of the structure of the catalyst optimization of the process parameters finding out the oxidation mechanism and characterization of the reaction products 2

using avantes uv vis spectrometer having a resolution of 0 5 nm 2 3 catalyst preparation 2 3 1 preparation of surfactant modified alumina sma surfactant modified alumina sma was used as the support for mn ii loading the procedure as reported in our earlier work 15 is as follows first 20 g of sds was dissolved in 900 ml distilled water and 2 5 g nacl was dissolved in 100 ml water separately these two solutions were mixed the ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 5 using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the whole solution was transferred into a bottle and to it 100 g of neutral alumina was added next the whole setup was placed in an incubator shaker and shaken at a speed of 150 rpm for 24 h then the sds concentrations in the first supernatant and two consecutive washings were determined the solid material was filtered and washed two times with double distilled water finally it was dried in a hot air oven for 24 h at 60 c the sds concentration present in the supernatant and the washing was determined following the method reported earlier 30 the solid material obtained is called surfactant modified alumina sma the loading of sds on the as prepared sma was calculated by the mass balance method and it was found to be 113 7 mg g 2 3 2 manganese ii loading on sma to prepare sma mn in a typical procedure 20 g sample of as prepared sma was taken in a conical flask then 100 ml of mncl2 solution conc 1600 mg l was added to it the sample was then placed in the shaker at 150 rpm for 2 h after that the mn concentration in the supernatant was determined using aas the loading of mn ii on sma was determined using the mass balance method and it was found to be 2 5 mg g the solid material was then washed twice and finally dried at 60 c this material was designated as sma mn 2 3 3 preparation of sma mnox from sma mn by redox co precipitation method in the final step mn ii loaded on sma was oxidized using kmno4 in this step sma mn 20 g was suspended and well mixed with 100 ml double distilled water and then 0 6 ml 0 1 m kmno4 was added drop wise the solution was then stirred in a magnetic stirrer for about 4 h and finally allowed to remain at rest for 24 h after that the supernatant was taken out and the solid material was washed several times with distilled water till the washing became neutral the material formed was named as sma mnox the as prepared mnox supported on sma was our fenton type catalyst for mb degradation the schematic for the preparation of sma mnox is shown in scheme 1 a 2 4 calibration graph of mb in 1 butanol the extraction efficiency of the solvent was determined by comparing the two separate calibration curves of mb in the range of 0 8 mg l where the first one was the calibration of mb dissolved in pure 1 butanol i e without extraction as represented by fig s1 a absorbance measured at 657 nm and the second one was the calibration curve of mb after its extraction from mb loaded sma mnox by 1 butanol as represented by fig s1 b thus for the second calibration curve 10 ml mb solutions in the concentration range 0 8 mg l were taken in a series of beakers to each of them sma mnox was added at a dose of 30 g l and kept standing for 30 min it was observed that the whole amount of mb was adsolubilized on the sma mnox surface making it deep blue after mb got fully adsolubilized the whole mixture solid along with the water part was extracted with 1 butanol 10 ml after extraction the absorbance at 657 nm of the 1 butanol layer was measured and plotted vs concentration of mb finally the calibration curve generated was compared with the first one i e without extraction both the calibration curves were straight lines and the correlation coefficients r2 were excellent 0 99 as shown in fig s1 a b the equations were represented as 1 absorbance 0 254 conc mg l 0 048 without extraction and 2 absorbance 0 256 conc mg l 0 036 after extraction for the two described cases 2 5 phzpc determination to determine the phzpc of sma mnox the following procedure was followed 0 1 m nacl solution was prepared and in each of 8 vials 15 ml solution was poured then sma mnox at a dose of 30 g l was added to each of them the ph of the solution was adjusted in the range of 3 10 then the vials were kept in a shaker at 120 rpm for 24 h after 24 h the samples were taken out and the final ph was measured two plots were made to know the phzpc of the material in the first one the final ph was plotted against the initial ph as shown in fig s2 a and in the second one the difference of initial and final ph was plotted against the initial ph as shown in fig s2 b the phzpc of sma mnox was found to be 7 2 from both the plots 2 6 photocatalytic degradation of mb the dye mb degradation experiment was performed in a 50 ml glass beaker which was placed inside another 500 ml glass beaker an aliquot of dye solution 10 ml was taken and sma mnox was added to it in an appropriate quantity the beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer and with the help of a small magnetic fly the dye solution along with sma mnox was agitated at a speed of 500 rpm after 30 min when the dye was completely adsolubilized onto the sma mnox surface h2o2 was added to the solution for degradation of dye the whole set up was placed under visible light a simple table lamp with a 100 w tungsten bulb without incorporation of bandpass filter whose distance from the top of the lamp to the bottom surface of the beaker was 61 cm the intensity of the visible light reaching the surface of the reacting solution was 3000 lx the lamp was turned on immediately after the addition of h2o2 the same experiment was conducted with varying doses of sma mnox different concentrations of h2o2 different initial concentrations of mb and at different initial ph conditions to keep the system cool from the irradiation of the table lamp 100 125 ml of tap water at ambient temperature 25 30 c was placed in the large beaker and from time to time it was replaced it is important to mention that in all kinetic plots shown the zero time is the time of h2o2 addition the percentage of degradation of mb was calculated after its extraction from the sma mnox surface using 1 butanol as the extracting solvent as the mb was fully adsorbed on the sma mnox surface as shown in scheme 1 a from the beginning and throughout the entire reaction it was important to measure the efficiency of mb extraction from the sma mnox surface using a suitable organic solvent after preliminary experiments 1 butanol was selected as an extracting solvent for such purpose 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalyst the powder x ray diffraction xrd analyses of sma sma mn and sma mnox were performed to identify the crystalline phases and orientation of the material the peaks in the three materials have been found almost in the same region from the jcpds file the peaks have been found at 28 707 38 472 41 096 44 814 and 46 393 the values have been confirmed from pdf nos 851327 030932 021109 011179 011176 this study indicates that the peaks are due to alumina no additional peak for manganese oxide was observed in the sma mnox which may be either due to the presence of a low percentage of manganese or due to the amorphous nature of the manganese oxide it is also evident from the literature that the fast reaction of mn vii and mn ii leads to the formation of several nuclei within a short period of time which causes the amorphous nature of the catalyst 31 the x ray powder diffraction patterns of sma sma mn and sma mnox catalyst are displayed in fig 1 the ftir analyses were carried out for sma sma mn and sma mnox and the spectra are shown in fig 2 the band appearing at 550 cm 1 designates the stretching vibration of al o the peak at 1640 cm 1 is assigned to the vibration band of oh due to surface water on alumina the broad absorption peak in the range of 3410 3465 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the oh group indicating the existence of the hydroxyl groups on the surface 32 the band at 1240 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the so bond present in sulfate group of sds 33 the band at 1070 cm 1 is due to cc stretching vibration the peaks at 2850 and 2920 cm 1 are due to the symmetric andasymmetric stretching vibration of ch 34 from the data obtained it is clear that alumina and sds are present in all three materials when the spectra are compared it is revealed that there are peaks near 1640 cm 1 in both sma and sma mn but after the addition of kmno4 the peak becomes sharper in sma mnox it may be due to the formation of ɤ mno2 which shows a peak at 1620 cm 1 35 the diffuse reflectance spectra drs analyses were conducted to study the optical properties of sma sma mn sma mnox and sma mnox mb sma mnox after mb adsorption as shown in fig 3 the drs of sma shows no significant peak whereas the spectra of sma mn and sma mnox show the absorption peaks in the visible range 350 500 nm which is due to the presence of mn ii and mnox compared to sma and sma mn sma mnox has stronger absorption in the visible region these results predict that the as prepared sma mnox may suitably be excited by visible light the incorporation of mb in sma mnox is supported by the appearance of the absorption peak in the drs of sma mnox mb at 660 nm which is a characteristic peak for mb fig 3 the xps analysis of sma mnox was performed to analyze the surface chemical composition and electronic states of mn and o and the spectra are shown in fig 4 a f strong photoelectron peaks of al 2p c 1s o 1s and mn 3s and 2p are found from the wide scan spectrum fig 4 a of the sample during the ejection of photoelectron due to the parallel spin coupling of 3s and 3d electron mn 3s core level spectrum shows a peak splitting doublet 31 the oxidation state of manganese in as prepared manganese oxide can be determined from the peak separation of doublets of the mn 3s spectrum the peak separation at 4 7 4 8 ev indicates the 4 state of mn 36 in the present study the peak separation has been observed at 5 1 ev fig 4 b which indicates the possibility of the existence of both 3 and 4 state of mn 31 the characteristic peak for mn 2p 3 2 is obtained at 643 2 ev before reaction and 642 6 ev after reaction after deconvoluting the peak separation occurred at 640 9 ev 642 3 ev and 643 5 ev in the case of sma mnox before reaction fig 4 c on the other hand in the case of sma mnox after the reaction upon deconvoluting the peak separated at 640 4 ev 641 9 ev and 643 2 ev fig 4 d the characteristic mn 2p 1 2 appeared for sma mnox at 654 6 ev before reaction fig 4 c and at 654 0 ev after reaction fig 4 d this indicates that the oxidation state of mn has remained unchanged after mb degradation in the case of sma mnox before reaction fig 4 e the band at 529 ev is attributed to the o 1s binding energy after deconvoluting the o 1s spectrum multiple peaks have been found at 527 0 ev 528 8 ev and 530 1 ev which implies that more than one oxygen sources such as lattice oxygen surface adsorbed oxygen etc are present in the sample similarly in the case of sma mnox after reaction the band at 529 5 ev is attributed to the o 1s binding energy after deconvoluting the o 1s spectrum multiple peaks have been found at 528 5 ev and 529 9 ev fig 4 f the sem analyses of sma sma mn and sma mnox were performed to have an idea about the surface topography of the materials sem images of sma sma mn and sma mnox at different resolutions are shown in fig 5 as observed from the sem images the surfaces were rough in all the cases table 1 a c shows the results of energy dispersive x ray edax spectra of sma sma mn and sma mnox which confirmed the incorporation of mn on sma the incorporated mn in sma mnox was 42 and after mb degradation table 1 d it was drastically reduced to 0 51 although the sem images have been presented in the scale of 200 nm fig 5 a c and 20 μm fig 5 d f in the case of sma and sma mn and sma mnox no distinguishable difference in structure has been noticed in fig 5 d f but at higher resolution in case of sma mnox rod like structures have been found which is observed in fig 5 a b the width of the nanorods was in the range of 30 70 nm fig 5 b while the length is in the micrometer range to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the synthesis of nano mnox rods using only redox co precipitation reaction in the past all nano mnox rods were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis or calcination the rod shaped morphology of the mnox may be due to the presence of micelle similar rod shaped structures have also been noticed in sma mnox after degradation of mb fig 5 c elemental compositions obtained from the edax analyses of the catalyst before and after degradation are shown in table1 c d respectively as the reaction was carried out in aqueous media so it was necessary to find out the size distribution of sma mnox particles in aqueous suspension the hydrodynamic particle size distribution for sma mnox catalysts in aqueous suspension was obtained by laser diffraction ld analysis this could be defined as the mean particle size in aqueous media figure s3 shows the distribution curve of sma mnox particle sizes in deionized water suspension at ph 5 8 6 0 corresponding to the ph of mb photodegradation runs the graph reveals a monomodal distribution where the maximum concentration is centered at 96 μm in the described method the adsorption of mb onto fenton type catalyst sma mnox was the first step the efficiency of adsorption is related to the surface area of the adsorbent material so it was pertinent to know the surface area of the catalyst it was observed that sma mnox had the surface area 90 m2 g which is considerably high the surface area is higher than the nano mno2 catalyst formed by the reaction of kmno4 and oleic acid 31 the pore diameter of sma mnox was 5 nm the adsorption desorption isotherms fig s4 matches with the type v of iupac isotherm which indicates that sma mnox was a mesoporous material 3 2 fenton type degradation of mb 3 2 1 mb adsorption on sma mnox and alumina as sma mnox has been used as the catalyst here so it is a prerequisite of mb to get adsorbed onto it and further to be degraded so it is essential to find out its adsorptive capacity and compare the same with that of the base material i e alumina to find out the role of surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst it is also important to know the optimum contact time for mb adsorption onto sma mnox and alumina to study this phenomenon two sets of 50 ml beakers were taken and in each of them 10 ml of dye solution of the initial concentration of 20 mg l were added to one set sma mnox was added and to the other alumina was added at the same dose of 20 g l the remaining concentration of mb in the solution phase was monitored at 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min contact time in the case of alumina the mb removal was found to be less than 6 the adsorption studies were conducted with sma mnox dose 20 g l using various concentrations in the range of 20 50 mg l and the plots of adsorption capacity vs contact time are shown in fig 6 it is also interesting to observe that an initial 80 adsorption can be achieved within 5 min it is also interesting to note that the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in mb concentration the reason for such a quick rate must be due to the surfactant bilayer giving negative charge to the alumina surface which can attract the cationic mb dye through ionic interaction similar behavior was also observed in our earlier experiments 14 15 17 the hydrophobic interaction between the dye molecule and the surfactant layer can also play a significant role 3 2 2 adsorption of mn ii on sma surface it is already established that when sds is added to alumina under acidic conditions ph 4 5 the sds molecules get adsorbed on the alumina surface leading to the formation of either hemimicelle or admicelle depending on whether the sds concentration is below or above cmc 15 by utilizing the solubilizing property of this micellar layer in the present study mn ii was placed on the sma surface which was further converted to manganese oxide to present a system where the metal oxide and dye co exist in the surfactant bilayer in fully adsorbed state and finally react with hydrogen peroxide in fenton process the concept of performing catalytic reactions utilizing the principle of the fenton process in the heterogeneous solid surface where the micellar environment has been created is new and interesting to find out the time required for optimum concentrations of mn ii adsorption on the sma surface a kinetic study was performed the experimental details are already discussed in section 2 3 2 it was observed that during the initial period the rate was much faster and 99 removal of mn ii occurred in the initial 20 min however 120 min time was selected as the optimum time to prepare sma mn the adsorption kinetics has been shown in fig 7 3 3 kinetics of degradation of mb under various conditions the degradation of mb was carried out under various experimental conditions considering various combinations the visible light vl source used in our study was normal w lamp and the different conditions employed for mb degradation were mb vl mb h2o2 vl mb h2o2 alumina mb h2o2 sma mb h2o2 vl sma mb vl sma mn mb vl sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mn mb h2o2 sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mnox vl as shown in fig 8 out of all these combinations mb h2o2 sma mnox mb vl sma mnox h2o2 and mb h2o2 sma mn system performed well to degrade mb for sma sma mn and sma mnox the adsorption of mb was very high 100 at 20 mg l of mb concentration it is notable that in the present case both mnox and mb are embedded in admicelle and this provides them a better contact after the adsorption of mb i e after 30 min the modified fenton reaction was allowed to start by adding the reagent h2o2 in the reaction medium the combination for this was designated as mb h2o2 sma mnox the degradation of mb was 56 in 4 0 h using an adsorbent dose of 30 g l however the same system if illuminated with visible light 100 w i e the combination mb h2o2 vl sma mnox the mb degradation eﬃciency achieved was much higher 73 in 4 0 h as shown in fig 8 so mb h2o2 vl sma mnox operational condition was considered to proceed further at this point it may be mentioned that although the dose of sma mnox looks rather high 30 g l but the actual catalyst i e mnox present is quite low this is because the loading of mn ii on sma is low 2 5 mg g 3 4 optimization of experimental set up and contact time under the most suitable condition i e mb h2o2 vl sma mnox the reaction was carried out for longer duration till higher removal efficiency more than 90 was achieved it was found that under the same condition with 30 g l dose h2o2 concentration 776 mm the removal efficiency was 96 after 7 5 h 450 min of reaction hence 450 min was determined as the contact time but as the reaction was conducted in the presence of a 100 w tungsten bulb hence enough heat was evolved to prevent the loss of solvent i e water through evaporation from the reaction mixture due to the heat effect from vl proper care for the experimental set up was made the reaction beaker having capacity 50 ml was placed inside a large beaker having capacity 600 ml with some water inside to provide a cooling effect from time to time this water was replaced by fresh cool water to prevent the rise of temperature of the water and the reaction mixture 3 5 effect of operating parameters 3 5 1 effect of h2o2 concentration initially 1 ml hydrogen peroxide 22 8 strength per 10 ml of the reaction mixture with mb concentration 20 mg l was used while the final conc of h2o2 was calculated as 776 mm 26 384 mg l now a study was done to see the change in the mb removal efficiency with the variation of h2o2 concentration it is important to mention here that the mb removal efficiency of 96 was achieved after 450 min 7 5 h while catalyst dose of 30 g l and 776 mm concentration of h2o2 was applied the reaction was observed to follow zero order initially up to 120 min and during this time period 63 mb removal occurred the mb degradation was also performed with the h2o2 concentration 388 mm 13 192 mg l and 194 mm 6596 mg l and the results are shown in fig 9 a d the removal efficiency was found to be 91 in 450 min with 388 mm h2o2 concentration and it was 70 in 450 min with 194 mm h2o2 concentration keeping the time and other experimental conditions same since the removal efficiency achieved with h2o2 having a concentration of 388 mm was comparable with that obtained with 776 mm so all further studies were conducted with 388 mm concentration of h2o2 the reason behind this is that with the increase of concentration of h2o2 there is an increase in the production of hydroxyl radicals which causes more degradation of mb 17 comparative kinetic analyses and percentage of removal shown in the inset of fig 9 d obtained for the photo fenton degradation of mb with three different concentrations of h2o2 have been graphically presented in fig 9 it may seem that the dose of hydrogen peroxide may be higher but such high doses of h2o2 have also been used by zhang et al for degradation of mb 37 it is interesting to note that the reaction followed zero order throughout the entire process indicating a true surface reaction but the reaction rate varied considerably in the different stages of the reaction a similar observation was reported during the electro fenton degradation of acid orange 7 19 and photo fenton degradation of bisphenol a 38 3 5 2 effect of sma mnox dose the kinetic studies on mb degradation were performed with various catalyst doses 10 30 g l at a fixed h2o2 concentration of 388 mm and visible light irradiation of 3000 lx the results are shown in fig 10 a b it is noted that with a catalyst dose of 30 g l and 20 g l the removal efficiency was 92 and that with 10 g l it was 84 in 7 5 h so the optimum sma mnox dose was selected as 20 g l for further studies increased catalyst dose helps in the production of more oh radicals which however may react among themselves leading to the quenching effect 39 another possible reason is the creation of more turbidity due to a higher dose of the catalyst which makes a hindrance to the passage of light 40 it is also interesting to note that in all cases the reaction followed zero order kinetics throughout the entire period of reaction 450 min although in different stages the time dependent absorption spectra of mb degradation with catalyst dose of 20 g l initial mb concentration 20 mg l h2o2 concentration 388 mm have been shown in fig 11 the gradual blue shift of the absorption maximum of mb indicated its step wise degradation through demethylation the zero order rate constant values up to 90 min are shown in table 2 for comparison 3 5 3 effect of initial ph since ph has a significant effect on the rate of classical fenton reaction so it was felt pertinent to study the effect of ph on the reaction rate of mb degradation in many cases it has been observed that during the course of the reaction the ph of the reaction mixture undergoes a significant change however in the present study the initial ph of the medium was almost neutral and no significant change of ph was observed at the end of the reaction so for our study four different initial ph conditions in the range of 3 5 10 0 were selected in each study the reaction was conducted with an initial mb concentration of 20 mg l sma mnox dose 20 g l and h2o2 concentration 388 mm the percent removal of mb in 450 min 7 5 h was found out and the results are shown in fig 12 it was observed that at ph 3 5 the removal efficiency was much less 70 compared to that 93 at higher ph 8 5 9 5 it is important to note that this is contradictory to the homogeneous classical fenton reaction where lower ph is more favored in the present case 95 of degradation was obtained at ph 8 6 in 7 5 h in the case of textile dye wastewater the ph might be at a higher range 10 41 thus the present method might be suitable for degrading these types of wastewater 3 5 4 effect of light intensity since the dye removal efficiency was found to be enhanced under the influence of visible light so it was necessary to examine the mb removal using a tungsten bulb with different powers initially the study was done with a 100 w tungsten bulb 3000 lx now further studies were performed with a 60 w tungsten bulb 2300 lx and a 20 w 10000 lx led bulb the led bulb consumes less power and it has a longer life moreover it produces less heat thus the application of led might be more useful in the present context although during the initial stage of reaction e g up to 90 min the mb removal by the led bulb was slightly better than that of the 100 w bulb but the removal upon long time irradiation 7 5 h with the 100 w bulb showed the best efficiency the rate constant values of mb degradation with various light intensities have been compiled in table 2 and fig 13 the results clearly show that the performance of the100 w bulb was the best for mb degradation and thus it was selected for our studies all the lights used for our experimental purpose have λmax in the visible range the commercially available led bulb has two peaks throughout its absorption spectra one at a short wavelength at 450 nm and the other at long wavelength 580 nm the other light source used is the bulb made of tungsten filament which is used to emit light in the visible range from 350 nm to 800 nm the spectra of both types of lights used for the entire study have been presented in fig 14 it is clear from the two spectra that the led light has a sharp peak where the normal bulb has a broad spectrum 3 5 5 effect of initial mb concentration in the present study most of the work was carried out with mb concentration 20 mg l and under optimized conditions 92 mb degradation efficiency was achieved the efficiency of the catalyst under similar conditions dose of catalyst fixed at 20 g l and h2o2 concentration at 388 mm with 450 min irradiation but with an initial mb concentration of 40 mg l was also conducted and the degradation efficiency was found to be 77 the results have been shown graphically in fig 15 it is seen in fig 15 a b that the removal efficiency has been lowered with the increase of initial concentration of mb the zero order rate constant values under specified conditions have been summarized in table 2 3 6 reusability of the catalyst the economic feasibility of a method depends on the reusability of the catalyst material to check the reusability of sma mnox it was collected at the end of the reaction and was further subjected to mb degradation material reusability can be directly related to the practical applicability of the material if the catalyst is reusable for many times with high efficiency it involves less cost in the long run and hence greater will be its acceptability the results for the reusability test have been shown in fig 16 in its first use the sma mnox could remove up to 92 of mb in the second cycle the removal efficiency was found to be nearly 80 and in the third cycle it was nearly 70 of the initial concentration which is quite encouraging 3 7 reproducibility of the method it was extremely important to find out the reproducibility of the mb degradation by applying the developed catalyst for this purpose the kinetic experiment was carried out in triplicate under the specified condition using mb having concentration 20 mg l catalyst dose 20 g l h2o2 concentration 388 mm and visible light 100 w the reaction time applied was 0 7 5 h the mean and standard deviation has been computed the plot of percent mb removal vs time drawn through the mean values is shown in fig 17 the results are within the relative standard deviation 10 which indicates that the method is quite reproducible 3 8 confirmation of the formation of hydroxyl radicals during mb degradation it was important to examine the formation of reactive oxygen species ros involved during the mb degradation to examine the mechanism fenton degradation is mostly facilitated by oh radical so the formation of oh and its utilization by mb was monitored for this purpose terephthalic acid fluorescence probing technology was utilized under neutral ph condition terephthalic acid ta reacts with hydroxyl radical to form 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid which shows a bright stable fluorescence at 425 nm 42 this reaction remains unaffected in the presence of other ros such as h2o2 ho2 and o2 this phenomenon was used to confirm the formation of the oh radicals during the reaction the formation of oh radical was examined in the presence and absence of mb for this experiment a series of 1 5 ml of reaction mixtures taken at various reaction times were mixed with 1 5 ml of ta solution prepared by dissolving in aqueous naoh solution followed by the addition of hcl to adjust the ph at 7 and finally the fluorescence spectrum was recorded for each mixture slit width 5 5 the fluorescence spectra of the reaction mixtures in the presence and absence of mb are depicted in fig 18 a b respectively the figures indicate that as the reaction time increases the concentration of oh increases which leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity this occurs both in the presence and absence of mb in the initial phase the fluorescence intensity in the absence of mb was found to be much higher compared to that in the presence of mb but ultimately at 450 min of reaction both the fluorescence intensities are found to be comparable the time dependent i i0 plot is also shown in fig 18 c d which indicates that up to 150 min it follows linearity in both the cases this study indicates that oh was utilized by the mb during the reaction the decomposition of h2o2 by supported manganese oxide catalyst and further the generation of hydroxyl radicals may be followed in various ways as found from literature the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ultimately ends up with the formation of water and oxygen as proposed by various researchers this reaction usually involves two pathways firstly a redox pathway can be assumed in which an electron is exchanged with the surface resulting in the formation of ho2 free radicals secondly a chain reaction mechanism can be assumed where several radicals are formed and they react among themselves leading to the formation of water and oxygen hasan et al 43 suggested that the mixed manganese oxide system is catalytically much more active than the pure manganese oxide in respect of hydrogen peroxide decomposition in the previous section it has already been mentioned that a mixed oxidation state of manganese oxide is present which may be the reason for the formation of oh han et al 44 suggested that oh is the main responsible radical for the oxidation of ethanol by mn3o4 supported on sba they suggested the following equations for the decomposition of h2o2 by metal ions 3 s h2o2 s oh oh 4 s h2o2 s ho2 h 5 ho2 h o2 where s is the metal ion likewise kanungo et al 45 suggested various mechanisms for the decomposition of h2o2 by mixed manganese oxides 6 mn3 h2o2 oh oh mn4 7 mn4 h2o2 h ho2 mn3 8 ho2 h o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 3 9 turnover number ton and turnover frequency tof for the mb degradation catalyzed by sma mnox ton is the number of moles of the reactant that can be converted per mole of the catalyst and tof is the turnover number divided by the time required for the conversion the ton has been computed for mb degradation using mb concentration 20 mg l and catalyst dose 20 g l since 10 ml of the reaction mixture contains 0 5 mg mn ii so for the prepared material the ton has been calculated as 0 068 mol of mb per mole of mn and tof is 2 55 10 6 moles of mb mole of mn s 3 10 identification of the intermediate products of mb degradation by esi ms the intermediate products formed during the course of the reaction and at the end were identified using esi ms for this study the reaction mixture at the end of 120 min and 450 min was considered the mass spectral analyses of both the reaction mixtures did not show the molecular ion peak for the parent mb molecule at m z mass to charge ratio 284 17 fig s5 a b hence it can be concluded that no mb was present in the aqueous medium and the dye was fully adsorbed and degraded onto the sma mnox surface besides it can also be concluded that the mb was not leached during the degradation process however during the course of the reaction the signals at higher m z values of 338 and 317 have been observed these peaks have also been noticed to appear during mb degradation using co ii loaded sma 17 these peaks have been presumed to be due to the hydroxylation of mb at multiple positions in addition to these peaks the peaks at lower m z values have also been observed peaks appearing at m z 270 and 256 may be due to the loss of one and two methyl groups and oxidative degradation of mb demethylation of the methylene blue also has been confirmed from the gradual blue shift of the mb absorption spectra as shown in fig 11 in an earlier report a similar blue shift was presumed to be due to the demethylation of mb 46 a sharp peak at m z value of 183 has been noticed which also matches with earlier observations 47 48 in the lower region of the mass spectrum several peaks have been identified at m z of 148 130 112 which is a clear indication of degradation of mb due to the attack of oh radical the intermediate product structure with their m z values is shown in table 3 the overall degradation mechanism of mb can be visualized in several steps firstly mb gets wholly adsolubilized onto the surface of sma mnox as it has been already mentioned in the previous section due to the negative charge of the surface after the addition of h2o2 manganese oxide reacts with it to form the hydroxyl radical which is evidenced from the fluorescence spectra and esi ms spectra and also from the leaching of mn2 during oxidation of mb the whole scheme can be summarized using the following equations 10 sma mnox mb sma mnox mb 11 sma mnox mb h2o2 sma mnox1 mb oh mn2 12 sma mnox1 mb oh sma mnox oxidation product 3 11 leaching of sds and manganese from sma mnox surface during mb degradation it was important to investigate the leaching of metal and surfactant for the above mentioned adsolubilization based catalytic oxidation in the present study the leaching of mn ii and sds from the sma mnox surface was determined after 450 min of reaction and it showed about 35 and 0 63 leaching of manganese and sds respectively 3 12 toxicity test of the treated dye wastewater towards micro organism to test the toxicity of the treated dye wastewater and the by products formed during the degradation process it was applied to a culture of heterogeneous bacteria developed from the effluent of the sewage treatment plant parallel experiments were conducted to study the growth of the bacterial consortia in the nutrient medium in the presence of dye and effluent a control was set up where the same bacterial culture was grown in nutrient media the results have been graphically presented in fig s6 it is interesting to note that after reaching the stationary growth phase the growth was almost equal in three cases except with a slight difference however during the initial lag phase the growth in the presence of effluent was hindered which may be due to the presence of leached sds mn2 and remaining h2o2 but ultimately it was recovered so the effluents and the by products thus formed may not be so toxic to hinder the growth of the bacterial consortia 4 conclusions methylene blue mb degradation was carried out using a modified photo fenton process in the presence of manganese oxide supported on surfactant modified alumina the catalyst was designated as sma mnox the catalyst was newly developed on sds micellar support and it was characterized by sem edax ftir xrd bet xps and particle size analysis from the drs spectra the loading of mn ii on sma and the further formation of manganese oxide was revealed the phzpc of the material was found as 7 2 the unique feature of the process described here was that the mb degradation occurred entirely in the adsorbed adsolubilized condition under the conditions studied 92 of degradation was achieved after 7 5 h from the kinetic study it was observed that the reaction followed zero order the reproducibility of the process was good the zero order rate constants of mb degradation were compared under different operational conditions the products were identified by esi ms analysis the

13982,para xylene px as an important industrial chemical has largely been transported by sea which is followed by frequent px leakage accidents at sea seawater contaminated by px can be treated by bioremediation using microalgae but there are a limited number of microalgal species that can be used to biodegrade px in this study a novel rhodomonas sp jzb 2 cryptophyta was isolated from jiaozhou bay china which could efficiently remove high concentrations of px from seawater the experimental result indicated that rhodomonas sp jzb 2 could completely biodegrade 30 mg l of px in 6 d the growth inhibitory kinetics of this strain matched those of the yano model and it was calculated that 9 682 mg l was the best concentration for degradation of px by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 besides the biodegradation was the main px removal mechanism therefore rhodomonas sp jzb 2 is expected to be used in the bioremediation of marine environments polluted by px keywords p xylene 18s rrna rhodomonas growth inhibitory kinetics biodegradation 1 introduction para xylene px is an isomer of xylene and it is mainly used in the production of terephthalic acid tpa and as the main precursor for polyethylene terephthalate pet which is widely used in common applications to produce plastics films and synthetic fibres 2 according to statistics the global pet market is expected to grow by approximately 8 per annum 3 as many countries rely on large quantities of px imports in the case of china as the world s second largest producer of px china still imported 15 9 million tons of px in 2018 and its importation increased by 10 15 compared to that in 2017 4 large import volumes lead to the continuous increase in the volume of px transported by sea which is followed by frequent px leakage accidents at sea and px has become one of the most common chemicals involved in accidental marine spills 5 for example in 2002 a japanese chemical tanker eiwa maru sank after collision with a container ship leading to 500 t of xylene entering the sea 6 in 2007 about 400 l of px spilled into the sea when a chemical ship docked at zhuhai china to unload its cargo 7 a european funded project investigated the amount of chemicals transported between major european ports and to other parts of the world and the results indicated that xylene has a high leakage risk 8 french mccay et al 9 employed a predictive model to find that xylene is the chemical posing the highest hazard to aquatic organisms second only to phenol and formaldehyde as one of common hazardous noxious substances hns px is highly toxic to aquatic organisms and the px that was spilled into sea will seriously harm the safety of the local marine environment 10 12 thereinto px was the most toxic to marine shrimp gammarus locusta with a lethal concentration 50 lc50 value of 1 1 mg l 11 as a result px is listed as one of 20 chemicals posing a high risk by the international maritime organization imo 13 le floch et al 14 analysed the environmental behaviour of xylene when it leaked into seawater and the result suggested that partial xylene would dissolve in the water and move downwards so it would be difficult to remediate after such a spill traditional physical and chemical methods can only recover the xylene floating on the sea surface and may cause secondary pollution of the marine environment as for dissolved px in seawater there is no alternative but to take measures to accelerate its natural purification there are few reports on the ecological restoration strategies after spillages of hns 15 bioremediation is usually considered to be an eco friendly effective safe method of treating contaminants microalgae as primary producers are an important part of the marine ecosystem many microalgae can not only undergo autotrophic growth through photosynthesis but also undergo heterotrophic growth by utilising organic carbon sources bioremediation of polluted waters by mixotrophic microalgae is a solar power driven ecologically comprehensive sustainable reclamation strategy 16 besides microalgae do not need additional energy and oxygen they can utilise co2 through photosynthesis and increase dissolved oxygen content in seawater removing excessive nutrients therefrom microalgae can improve the water quality of polluted waters and provide food for marine organisms which contribute to the restoration of the marine ecosystem furthermore microalgae are widely distributed in the sea and have strong environmental adaptability 17 hence microalgae are more advantageous in the restoration of marine ecology compared with other microorganisms therefore in recent years microalgae have been widely reported to be able to degrade organic contaminants in seawater such as phenol 18 19 phthalate acid esters 20 21 bisphenol a 22 and so on however there are few reports of px degrading microalgae hence finding microalgae that can degrade px efficiently is of help to those interested in bioremediation after px leakage at sea in this study an axenic marine microalga which can degrade px efficiently was isolated from seawater this strain was identified and named rhodomonas sp jzb 2 in addition the performance kinetics and mechanism of the removal of px by microalga were investigated through consideration of experimental results this study may provide theoretical and species supports for the bioremediation and ecological restoration of polluted seawater after px leakage 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals px purity 99 and 1 chloronaphthalene purity 99 were purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd shanghai china dichloromethane chromatographic grade was purchased from merck co ltd yantai china all other chemicals were of analytical grade the natural seawater used in this study was obtained from coastal waters off qingdao china the seawater was filtered using a 0 45 μm microporous membrane and then sterilised at 120 for 20 min 2 2 screening and isolation of px degrading microalgae the seawater samples for microalgal screening were taken from jiaozhou bay qingdao china e 120 18 57 89 n 36 6 47 26 the site was adjacent to the estuary of an inland river microalgae were cultured in sterilised f 2 seawater medium 23 containing antibiotics a mixture of ciprofloxacin 4 mg l gentamicin 1 mg l kanamycin 0 5 mg l and tetracycline 0 5 mg l to restrain bacterial growth 24 the composition of f 2 medium was as follows l nano3 75 mg na2hpo4 h2o 5 mg edta na2 4 36 mg a solution of trace elements znso4 4h2o 0 023 g

l 1 ml px tolerant strains were screened by gradually increasing the px concentration therein then the cultures were transferred to the f 2 solid medium containing 0 09 m v agar to isolate the pure bred px tolerant microalgae and the removal ability of px by isolates was assessed by adding 10 mg l px to the medium the experimental processes related to microalgae were conducted on a super clean bench to avoid contamination the incubation conditions of microalgae entailed maintenance of a temperature of 20 under 60 μmol m2 s illumination over a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle while subject to rotation at 150 rpm in an incubator 2 3 identification of px degrading microalgae a scanning electron microscope sem vega3 tescan china was adopted to observe the surface morphology of isolated microalgae 18s rrna was sequenced by a commercial service bgi wuhan corporation china to conduct molecular identification the 18s rrna region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with forward primer its1 5 tccgtaggtgaacctgcgg 3 and reverse primer its4 5 tcctccgcttattgatatgc 3 the software suites clustalw and mega 5 0 were employed for alignment and phylogenetic analysis respectively 2 4 the biodegradation of px by isolated microalgae under aseptic conditions the microalgae in the logarithmic phase were inoculated to sterilisation f 2 medium at an initial cell density of 105 cell ml then 10 ml medium was added to the 50 ml glass sample bottles fitted with teflon lined screw caps and the px dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide dmso was added to the bottles by a micro syringe the px concentrations in the sample bottles were adjusted to 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 mg l respectively the bottles were sealed to prevent volatilisation of px a control experiment without px was carried out to represent the inhibitory effect of px against microalgae each treatment level was tested over 36 replicates and was incubated for 6 d the incubation conditions were as described before the cell density of microalgae and the residual concentration of px in bottle were measured at 24 h intervals three replicates for cell density and three replicates for px concentration before the experiment in order to avoid contamination by other microorganisms the inoculum microalga was cultured in the medium containing antibiotics and the purity of microalgae was examined under a high power microscope 2 5 growth inhibitory kinetics the effects of organic pollutants on the growth of microalgae are promotional at low concentration and inhibitory at high concentration which could be characterised by an appropriate substrate inhibition model of microbial growth 25 26 there were five common models applied in this study which are expressed by specific growth rate and are described below the haldane andrews model 27 is one of the most commonly used models due to its mathematical simplicity and wide acceptance for describing the growth inhibition kinetics of microorganisms the expression is as follows 1 μ μ max s k s s s 2 k i where μ is the specific growth rate day μ max is the maximum specific growth rate day ki represents the inhibition constant mg l and ks represents a substrate affinity constant mg l respectively ks is defined as the limiting substrate concentration where μ 0 5 μ max webb 28 developed a kinetics model considering the enzyme kinetics and allosteric effect the equation is given by the following 2 μ μ max s 1 s k k s s s 2 k i where k mg l is a positive constant yano et al 29 established a growth model based on the inhibitory behaviour of microorganisms at high substrate concentrations 3 μ μ max s k s s s k i s 3 k k i aiba et al 30 proposed an improved version of the monod model a non inhibitory model which relies on an empirical correlation 4 μ μ max s s k s exp s k i edwards 31 proposed another model with which to predict the inhibitory effect at higher substrate concentrations the equation is as follows 5 μ μ m a x exp s k i exp s k s in this study matlab 2014a was employed to fit the experimental data using a non linear regression method 2 6 the removal mechanism of px by microalgae the total removal efficiency of px r can be expressed as follows 6 r b d b a b s r a where bd is the removal efficiency of biodegradation ba represents the removal efficiency of bioaccumulation bs is the removal efficiency of biosorption and ra represents the removal efficiency of biodegradation abiotic factors to determine the values of bd ba and bs 10 ml algal cultures from 5 to 20 mg l of px px can be completely removed and not strongly inhibit the growth of microalga at these concentrations treatments at the fifth day were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were taken to determine the residual amount of px from which we could obtain the r value the harvested microalgae were added to 10 ml seawater and mixed for 5 min then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the gathered supernatants were used for the determination of extracellular adsorbed px on the cell surface b s the remaining cell pellets were suspended by adding 5 ml of dichloromethane containing 5 mg l of 1 chloronaphthalene and mixed for 5 min the suspensions were sonicated for 1 h placed in a refrigerator at 20 c for one night then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the recovered supernatants were used to determine the content of intracellularly accumulated px ba a control treatment without organisms but containing px was set to determine the removal efficiency of abiotic factors ra afterwards the biodegradation efficiency bd could be deduced 2 7 analytical methods 2 7 1 determination of microalgae cell density 1 ml of homogeneous algal culture was taken and stained with 16 μl lugol s iodine solution for 15 min the cell density of microalgae was determined under a microscope nikon japan using a haemocytometer 2 7 2 calculation of specific growth rate the specific growth rate μ was calculated for microalgae according to the following expression 7 μ ln n 2 ln n 1 t 2 t 1 where n 1 and n 2 represent the cell densities of microalgae cells ml at times t2 and t1 respectively 2 7 3 determination of residual px concentrations in medium px concentrations were determined according to the method of jin et al 32 the algal culture 10 ml in the sample bottle was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was added to 5 ml of dichloromethane containing 5 mg l of 1 chloronaphthalene and mixed for 5 min the organic phase in lower layer was taken for the px analysis by gc ms agilent 6890 5975 usa equipped with an hp 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa the gc oven was programmed to increase the temperature therein from 40 c held for 4 min to 120 c at 10 c min and further increased at 25 c min to 180 c after which it was held for 3 min the inlet and transfer line temperatures were set to 290 c and 280 c respectively the selected ion monitoring sim mode was adopted for data acquisition and analysis 2 8 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviations of the results were calculated by setting three replicates of parallel experiments for each measurement statistical analyses were carried out by one way analysis of variance anova using spss 19 0 software spss co usa and differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of the microalgae an axenic microalga was isolated from the seawater sample which could efficiently remove px in seawater according to sem the strain was elliptical with a length of 8 9 μm and a width of 4 5 μm and two isometric flagella protruded from the oral groove each with a length of 8 10 μm the surface of this microalga was irregular the analytical results of the 18s rrna sequence and the phylogenetic tree based on the sequence showed that the microalga was closely related to rhodomonas fig 1 after alignment with other 18s rrna sequences in genbank the similarity between the strain and rhodomonas sp ccmp744 genbank id hf952583 was greater than 99 therefore the isolated microalga strain was identified as a strain of rhodomonas species and named rhodomonas sp jzb 2 the 18 s rrna sequence has been submitted to the genebank database under accession number mn549465 rhodomonas belongs to the phylum of cryptophyta is a genus of pyrenomonadaceae besides chlorophylls rhodomonas contains a red pigment called phycoerythrin which performs as a photosynthetic light harvesting pigment providing energy to photosystem ⅱ 33 34 rhodomonas is widely distributed and widely used as feed in aquaculture 35 37 some studies have reported that oceanic microalgae isolated from coastal waters are more likely to show heterotrophic ability due to the abundance of organic matter including natural dissolved carbon and organics from human activity in offshore areas 38 however the concentration of organic matter mainly natural dissolved carbon in most marine environments is lower and the lack of enzymes involved in heterotrophic processes is the main reason why most marine microalgae cannot utilise organic carbon 39 hence in contrast to the ocean those microalgae able to undertake heterotrophic assimilation of organic pollutants can be easily screened in samples from coastal areas 3 2 the removal performance of px by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 the growth curves of rhodomonas sp jzb 2 and removal curves of px in diverse concentrations of px are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively this strain grew normally at 5 mg l and 10 mg l of px and the cell densities after the third day were greater than those in the control which indicated that px within 10 mg l could promote the growth of this microalga a px concentration of between 10 and 20 mg l would inhibit the growth of microalga at the earlier stage of culture but the px was removed by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 in the first 4 d fig 3 reducing the toxicity of seawater so the growth of microalga resumed rapidly after 4 d however a concentration of px greater than 30 mg l could strongly inhibit the growth of rhodomonas sp jzb 2 and this strain did not grow in 50 mg l of px fig 2 as shown in fig 3 the microalga could completely remove px within 30 mg l in 6 d however little or no px was degraded in px at concentrations above 40 mg l because the excess px leads to the increase of reactive oxygen species ros in cells which is harmful to the antioxidant defence system of microalga resulting in the growth of rhodomonas being completely inhibited and little px being degraded 12 40 bioremediation has become the best choice for marine ecological restoration after pollution by organic chemicals owing to its low cost and environmental friendliness 41 42 in the previous studies the microorganisms found that can biodegrade xylene are mainly freshwater bacteria and fungi such as pseudomonas sp 43 bacillus subtilis 44 pandoraea sp 45 and penicillium sp 46 however there are fewer reports on microorganisms suitable for the removal of xylene in marine environments for example jin et al 32 isolated a janibacter sp from an area contaminated by an oil spill and this strain could degrade 62 8 mixed xylene with an initial concentration of 60 mg l in 60 h besides there are few reports on microalgae that can degrade xylene in seawater rhodomonas sp jzb 2 shows potential for application in the bioremediation of px contaminated seawater 3 3 the growth inhibitory kinetics of rhodomonas sp jzb 2 haldane andrews webb yano aiba and edwards models were employed to analyse the experimental data fig 4 and the parameters are detailed in table 1 the determination coefficient r 2 and the residual sum of squares rss in the model fitting parameters were considered to evaluate the suitability of the model among these models the yano model was best fitted to the kinetics of rhodomonas sp jzb 2 because of the maximum value of r 2 and the minimum value of rss in this study a px concentration of over 30 mg l would strongly inhibit the growth of microalga fig 2 which is consistent with the data obtained by use of the yano model the inhibition constant ki is 31 535 mg l the first derivative of the expression of the yano model eq 3 is as follows 8 μ μ max k s 2 μ max k k i s 3 k s s s k i s 3 k k i 2 the critical substrate concentration sm value at which the specific growth reached its maximum value could be obtained at μ 0 as follows 9 s m k i k s 2 k 3 it was found that sm was 9 682 mg l that is 9 682 mg l was the optimum concentration of px in seawater for the biodegradation by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 predicted by the yano model this value agreed with the experimental value of 10 mg l which was the maximum concentration of px that did not inhibit the growth of microalga fig 2 when das et al 25 and wang et al 18 investigated the degradation of phenol by chlorella pyrenoidosa and isochrysis galbana respectively they also found that yano model could be used to elucidate the growth process of microalgae through the biodegradation of phenol in a manner similar to the present study 3 4 removal mechanism of px by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 as shown in fig s1 supplementary material the amount of px in seawater did not attenuate under the effect of abiotic factors in a closed system without microalga inoculum so the abiotic factors were neglected in this study according to the experimental result biodegradation was the only px removal pathway within 20 mg l by the microalga there was no biosorption or bioaccumulation when px was completely removed microalgae can secrete polysaccharides proteins enzymes lipids and other substances forming extracellular polymers eps and a hydrated biofilm matrix which can degrade organic contaminants as an external digestive system 47 48 in addition the organic pollutants also can be degraded under the action of microalgae intracellular enzymes 18 generally there are three migration pathways in the removal of organics by microalgae including biodegradation biosorption and bioaccumulation song et al 2019 52 found that chlorella sp l38 could efficiently remove florfenicol ff in water and the three removal pathways existed simultaneously when the ff concentration exceeded 86 mg l while biodegradation was the dominant mode for ff removal xiong et al 16 used chlorella vulgaris to remove levofloxacin lev from water biodegradation biosorption and bioaccumulation occurred simultaneously in 0 nacl conditions removal efficiencies were 7 53 1 07 and 0 9 respectively however under 1 nacl conditions lev was removed more efficiently by chlorella vulgaris but no contribution was made by biosorption and biodegradation remained the main removal route of lev the removal efficiencies of biodegradation and bioaccumulation were 90 and 1 5 respectively in this study the rhodomonas sp jzb 2 could completely remove px 20 mg l in seawater through biodegradation and there was no px on or in the microalga cell therefore the px will not be transmitted and magnified in the food chain in addition the major intermediates of px biodegradation are p toluic acid p methylbenzyl alcohol and p cresol 45 49 50 53 which are much less toxic than its parent compound px 51 then the metabolites will be readily mineralised into co2 h2o and biomass in the tca cycle 45 so there will be no hidden danger to marine ecological security 4 conclusion an axenic microalga strain was isolated from seawater in jiaozhou bay and was named rhodomonas sp jzb 2 after identification this microalga can completely remove 30 mg l of px in 6 d the growth of this microalga conformed to the yano model according to the prediction made with the model the optimum concentration of px in seawater for the biodegradation was 9 682 mg l and the growth of microalga was strongly inhibited at 31 535 mg l of px this strain can remove px from seawater through biodegradation rather than introducing it into the food chain of the marine ecosystem therefore rhodomonas sp jzb 2 shows promise for future application to the bioremediation of px polluted seawater declaration of interest statement we declare that we

13982,para xylene px as an important industrial chemical has largely been transported by sea which is followed by frequent px leakage accidents at sea seawater contaminated by px can be treated by bioremediation using microalgae but there are a limited number of microalgal species that can be used to biodegrade px in this study a novel rhodomonas sp jzb 2 cryptophyta was isolated from jiaozhou bay china which could efficiently remove high concentrations of px from seawater the experimental result indicated that rhodomonas sp jzb 2 could completely biodegrade 30 mg l of px in 6 d the growth inhibitory kinetics of this strain matched those of the yano model and it was calculated that 9 682 mg l was the best concentration for degradation of px by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 besides the biodegradation was the main px removal mechanism therefore rhodomonas sp jzb 2 is expected to be used in the bioremediation of marine environments polluted by px keywords p xylene 18s rrna rhodomonas growth inhibitory kinetics biodegradation 1 introduction para xylene px is an isomer of xylene and it is mainly used in the production of terephthalic acid tpa and as the main precursor for polyethylene terephthalate pet which is widely used in common applications to produce plastics films and synthetic fibres 2 according to statistics the global pet market is expected to grow by approximately 8 per annum 3 as many countries rely on large quantities of px imports in the case of china as the world s second largest producer of px china still imported 15 9 million tons of px in 2018 and its importation increased by 10 15 compared to that in 2017 4 large import volumes lead to the continuous increase in the volume of px transported by sea which is followed by frequent px leakage accidents at sea and px has become one of the most common chemicals involved in accidental marine spills 5 for example in 2002 a japanese chemical tanker eiwa maru sank after collision with a container ship leading to 500 t of xylene entering the sea 6 in 2007 about 400 l of px spilled into the sea when a chemical ship docked at zhuhai china to unload its cargo 7 a european funded project investigated the amount of chemicals transported between major european ports and to other parts of the world and the results indicated that xylene has a high leakage risk 8 french mccay et al 9 employed a predictive model to find that xylene is the chemical posing the highest hazard to aquatic organisms second only to phenol and formaldehyde as one of common hazardous noxious substances hns px is highly toxic to aquatic organisms and the px that was spilled into sea will seriously harm the safety of the local marine environment 10 12 thereinto px was the most toxic to marine shrimp gammarus locusta with a lethal concentration 50 lc50 value of 1 1 mg l 11 as a result px is listed as one of 20 chemicals posing a high risk by the international maritime organization imo 13 le floch et al 14 analysed the environmental behaviour of xylene when it leaked into seawater and the result suggested that partial xylene would dissolve in the water and move downwards so it would be difficult to remediate after such a spill traditional physical and chemical methods can only recover the xylene floating on the sea surface and may cause secondary pollution of the marine environment as for dissolved px in seawater there is no alternative but to take measures to accelerate its natural purification there are few reports on the ecological restoration strategies after spillages of hns 15 bioremediation is usually considered to be an eco friendly effective safe method of treating contaminants microalgae as primary producers are an important part of the marine ecosystem many microalgae can not only undergo autotrophic growth through photosynthesis but also undergo heterotrophic growth by utilising organic carbon sources bioremediation of polluted waters by mixotrophic microalgae is a solar power driven ecologically comprehensive sustainable reclamation strategy 16 besides microalgae do not need additional energy and oxygen they can utilise co2 through photosynthesis and increase dissolved oxygen content in seawater removing excessive nutrients therefrom microalgae can improve the water quality of polluted waters and provide food for marine organisms which contribute to the restoration of the marine ecosystem furthermore microalgae are widely distributed in the sea and have strong environmental adaptability 17 hence microalgae are more advantageous in the restoration of marine ecology compared with other microorganisms therefore in recent years microalgae have been widely reported to be able to degrade organic contaminants in seawater such as phenol 18 19 phthalate acid esters 20 21 bisphenol a 22 and so on however there are few reports of px degrading microalgae hence finding microalgae that can degrade px efficiently is of help to those interested in bioremediation after px leakage at sea in this study an axenic marine microalga which can degrade px efficiently was isolated from seawater this strain was identified and named rhodomonas sp jzb 2 in addition the performance kinetics and mechanism of the removal of px by microalga were investigated through consideration of experimental results this study may provide theoretical and species supports for the bioremediation and ecological restoration of polluted seawater after px leakage 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals px purity 99 and 1 chloronaphthalene purity 99 were purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd shanghai china dichloromethane chromatographic grade was purchased from merck co ltd yantai china all other chemicals were of analytical grade the natural seawater used in this study was obtained from coastal waters off qingdao china the seawater was filtered using a 0 45 μm microporous membrane and then sterilised at 120 for 20 min 2 2 screening and isolation of px degrading microalgae the seawater samples for microalgal screening were taken from jiaozhou bay qingdao china e 120 18 57 89 n 36 6 47 26 the site was adjacent to the estuary of an inland river microalgae were cultured in sterilised f 2 seawater medium 23 containing antibiotics a mixture of ciprofloxacin 4 mg l gentamicin 1 mg l kanamycin 0 5 mg l and tetracycline 0 5 mg l to restrain bacterial growth 24 the composition of f 2 medium was as follows l nano3 75 mg na2hpo4 h2o 5 mg edta na2 4 36 mg a solution of trace elements znso4 4h2o 0 023 g

l 1 ml px tolerant strains were screened by gradually increasing the px concentration therein then the cultures were transferred to the f 2 solid medium containing 0 09 m v agar to isolate the pure bred px tolerant microalgae and the removal ability of px by isolates was assessed by adding 10 mg l px to the medium the experimental processes related to microalgae were conducted on a super clean bench to avoid contamination the incubation conditions of microalgae entailed maintenance of a temperature of 20 under 60 μmol m2 s illumination over a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle while subject to rotation at 150 rpm in an incubator 2 3 identification of px degrading microalgae a scanning electron microscope sem vega3 tescan china was adopted to observe the surface morphology of isolated microalgae 18s rrna was sequenced by a commercial service bgi wuhan corporation china to conduct molecular identification the 18s rrna region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with forward primer its1 5 tccgtaggtgaacctgcgg 3 and reverse primer its4 5 tcctccgcttattgatatgc 3 the software suites clustalw and mega 5 0 were employed for alignment and phylogenetic analysis respectively 2 4 the biodegradation of px by isolated microalgae under aseptic conditions the microalgae in the logarithmic phase were inoculated to sterilisation f 2 medium at an initial cell density of 105 cell ml then 10 ml medium was added to the 50 ml glass sample bottles fitted with teflon lined screw caps and the px dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide dmso was added to the bottles by a micro syringe the px concentrations in the sample bottles were adjusted to 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 mg l respectively the bottles were sealed to prevent volatilisation of px a control experiment without px was carried out to represent the inhibitory effect of px against microalgae each treatment level was tested over 36 replicates and was incubated for 6 d the incubation conditions were as described before the cell density of microalgae and the residual concentration of px in bottle were measured at 24 h intervals three replicates for cell density and three replicates for px concentration before the experiment in order to avoid contamination by other microorganisms the inoculum microalga was cultured in the medium containing antibiotics and the purity of microalgae was examined under a high power microscope 2 5 growth inhibitory kinetics the effects of organic pollutants on the growth of microalgae are promotional at low concentration and inhibitory at high concentration which could be characterised by an appropriate substrate inhibition model of microbial growth 25 26 there were five common models applied in this study which are expressed by specific growth rate and are described below the haldane andrews model 27 is one of the most commonly used models due to its mathematical simplicity and wide acceptance for describing the growth inhibition kinetics of microorganisms the expression is as follows 1 μ μ max s k s s s 2 k i where μ is the specific growth rate day μ max is the maximum specific growth rate day ki represents the inhibition constant mg l and ks represents a substrate affinity constant mg l respectively ks is defined as the limiting substrate concentration where μ 0 5 μ max webb 28 developed a kinetics model considering the enzyme kinetics and allosteric effect the equation is given by the following 2 μ μ max s 1 s k k s s s 2 k i where k mg l is a positive constant yano et al 29 established a growth model based on the inhibitory behaviour of microorganisms at high substrate concentrations 3 μ μ max s k s s s k i s 3 k k i aiba et al 30 proposed an improved version of the monod model a non inhibitory model which relies on an empirical correlation 4 μ μ max s s k s exp s k i edwards 31 proposed another model with which to predict the inhibitory effect at higher substrate concentrations the equation is as follows 5 μ μ m a x exp s k i exp s k s in this study matlab 2014a was employed to fit the experimental data using a non linear regression method 2 6 the removal mechanism of px by microalgae the total removal efficiency of px r can be expressed as follows 6 r b d b a b s r a where bd is the removal efficiency of biodegradation ba represents the removal efficiency of bioaccumulation bs is the removal efficiency of biosorption and ra represents the removal efficiency of biodegradation abiotic factors to determine the values of bd ba and bs 10 ml algal cultures from 5 to 20 mg l of px px can be completely removed and not strongly inhibit the growth of microalga at these concentrations treatments at the fifth day were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were taken to determine the residual amount of px from which we could obtain the r value the harvested microalgae were added to 10 ml seawater and mixed for 5 min then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the gathered supernatants were used for the determination of extracellular adsorbed px on the cell surface b s the remaining cell pellets were suspended by adding 5 ml of dichloromethane containing 5 mg l of 1 chloronaphthalene and mixed for 5 min the suspensions were sonicated for 1 h placed in a refrigerator at 20 c for one night then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the recovered supernatants were used to determine the content of intracellularly accumulated px ba a control treatment without organisms but containing px was set to determine the removal efficiency of abiotic factors ra afterwards the biodegradation efficiency bd could be deduced 2 7 analytical methods 2 7 1 determination of microalgae cell density 1 ml of homogeneous algal culture was taken and stained with 16 μl lugol s iodine solution for 15 min the cell density of microalgae was determined under a microscope nikon japan using a haemocytometer 2 7 2 calculation of specific growth rate the specific growth rate μ was calculated for microalgae according to the following expression 7 μ ln n 2 ln n 1 t 2 t 1 where n 1 and n 2 represent the cell densities of microalgae cells ml at times t2 and t1 respectively 2 7 3 determination of residual px concentrations in medium px concentrations were determined according to the method of jin et al 32 the algal culture 10 ml in the sample bottle was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was added to 5 ml of dichloromethane containing 5 mg l of 1 chloronaphthalene and mixed for 5 min the organic phase in lower layer was taken for the px analysis by gc ms agilent 6890 5975 usa equipped with an hp 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa the gc oven was programmed to increase the temperature therein from 40 c held for 4 min to 120 c at 10 c min and further increased at 25 c min to 180 c after which it was held for 3 min the inlet and transfer line temperatures were set to 290 c and 280 c respectively the selected ion monitoring sim mode was adopted for data acquisition and analysis 2 8 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviations of the results were calculated by setting three replicates of parallel experiments for each measurement statistical analyses were carried out by one way analysis of variance anova using spss 19 0 software spss co usa and differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of the microalgae an axenic microalga was isolated from the seawater sample which could efficiently remove px in seawater according to sem the strain was elliptical with a length of 8 9 μm and a width of 4 5 μm and two isometric flagella protruded from the oral groove each with a length of 8 10 μm the surface of this microalga was irregular the analytical results of the 18s rrna sequence and the phylogenetic tree based on the sequence showed that the microalga was closely related to rhodomonas fig 1 after alignment with other 18s rrna sequences in genbank the similarity between the strain and rhodomonas sp ccmp744 genbank id hf952583 was greater than 99 therefore the isolated microalga strain was identified as a strain of rhodomonas species and named rhodomonas sp jzb 2 the 18 s rrna sequence has been submitted to the genebank database under accession number mn549465 rhodomonas belongs to the phylum of cryptophyta is a genus of pyrenomonadaceae besides chlorophylls rhodomonas contains a red pigment called phycoerythrin which performs as a photosynthetic light harvesting pigment providing energy to photosystem ⅱ 33 34 rhodomonas is widely distributed and widely used as feed in aquaculture 35 37 some studies have reported that oceanic microalgae isolated from coastal waters are more likely to show heterotrophic ability due to the abundance of organic matter including natural dissolved carbon and organics from human activity in offshore areas 38 however the concentration of organic matter mainly natural dissolved carbon in most marine environments is lower and the lack of enzymes involved in heterotrophic processes is the main reason why most marine microalgae cannot utilise organic carbon 39 hence in contrast to the ocean those microalgae able to undertake heterotrophic assimilation of organic pollutants can be easily screened in samples from coastal areas 3 2 the removal performance of px by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 the growth curves of rhodomonas sp jzb 2 and removal curves of px in diverse concentrations of px are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively this strain grew normally at 5 mg l and 10 mg l of px and the cell densities after the third day were greater than those in the control which indicated that px within 10 mg l could promote the growth of this microalga a px concentration of between 10 and 20 mg l would inhibit the growth of microalga at the earlier stage of culture but the px was removed by rhodomonas sp jzb 2 in the first 4 d fig 3 reducing the toxicity of seawater so the growth of microalga

13983,graphene oxide go particulates offer an inexpensive route for the formation of graphene flakes their fine size and high degree of dispensability in aqueous media have raised environmental safety concerns in processing plants this manuscript describes a novel electrocoagulation based method that enables the removal of go particles from acidic aqueous suspensions in the form of copper ion containing go films specifically copper ions were generated near a copper anode and adsorbed onto negatively surface charged go particles driving the anodic deposition of go films the experimental variables included the type of electric field dc and ac and the use of a copper ion induced bulk pre coagulation step a direct current dc potential gradient of 3 v cm applied to a baseline suspension with a go concentration of 0 8 mass percent solids removed approximately 3 of the go particles in a minute in the form of compact films of thickness ranging from approximately 10 to 50 microns containing copper ions use of ac fields led to lower deposition rates and copper content on the other hand pre coagulation of go dispersions with copper ions led to films with enhanced copper concentrations characterization of go films using xps and raman techniques has shown that copper is present in the bivalent form in go keywords graphene oxide electrocoagulation coagulation copper ion waste treatment 1 introduction graphene oxide go is the oxidized counterpart of graphene a monolayer sheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms with delocalized π bonding states in a honeycomb crystal lattice from a chemical perspective go has an abundant amount of oxygen atoms on its graphitic backbone in the form of epoxy hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 1 these oxygen containing functional groups are characterized by an isolated electron pair by sharing an electron pair the functional groups can efficiently bind a metal ion to form a metal complex 2 metal ion binding capacity of go exists at a wide range of ph values and depending on the type of divalent cations it is reported to be in the range of 300 1000 mg g 2 graphene oxide has recently garnered significant attention from the scientific community since its reduction has become a reliable route for obtaining chemically modified graphene platelets also referred to as reduced graphene oxide rgo in large scale and low cost 3 furthermore go has found uses where pristine graphene has limited applications such as water treatment 4 and anticorrosion coatings 5 its large scale production has grown significantly in the last decade for example sixth element materials a chinese based company set up a mass production line with a 100 tons per year capacity in 2013 6 due to its increase in production and applications go will unavoidably be released into the environment and ecological system 7 8 in recent years it has been shown that go potentially has deleterious and toxic effects to humans and the ecosystem for example several studies have demonstrated that go could lead to severe and persistent lung diseases 9 10 go could cause cytotoxicity in human erythrocytes and skin fibroblast cells 11 in addition go was reported to reduce microbial metabolic activity in wastewater 12 and to be very toxic to fresh water paramecium caudatum 13 due to the aforementioned risks it is imperative to develop techniques for the removal of go from aqueous suspensions studies on the removal of go based nanomaterials in water treatment systems are scarce chemical coagulation with materials such as al2o3 14 tio2 15 alum 7 and adsorption on materials such as mg al layered double hydroxide ldh and ca al ldh 8 have been reported the main disadvantage of adsorption is low efficiency 16 while chemical coagulation has the inconvenience of high sludge generation handling and disposal 17 in a recent study the authors of this paper reported on the utilization of electrocoagulation ec as the driver for rapidly removing the go particles 18 electrocoagulation has been traditionally used as a method to separate ions and colloidal particles from wastewater 19 in the classic ec process metal cations are produced by electrochemical oxidation of a soluble anode the multivalent metal ions can induce coagulation of particles in the suspension either by neutralizing the surface charge of the colloidal particles if they are negatively charged or by simply reducing the double layer thickness around the particles 20 22 in ec the coagulants are generated in situ which results in much less sludge generation than chemical coagulation additionally the electrophoretic migration of charged particles towards the soluble anode is vital for the electrocoagulation mechanism to occur the main advantage of the novel ec based technique reported in the previously mentioned paper over previous methods to clarify waste streams is that it also allowed the scalable formation of metal ion containing go films much of the ec literature deals with coagulation of particles in the bulk of the dispersion for the formation of films via the ec process it is critical to selectively induce the coagulation very near the electrode surface specifically bivalent copper ions were generated near a copper anode and adsorbed onto negatively surface charged go particles driving the anodic deposition of go films from acidic go dispersions the ec driven technique not only destabilized the suspension but also created a useful go film which can then be reduced to rgo opening avenues for the fabrication of electrochemical devices furthermore the method naturally allows for incorporation of metal ions which has been shown to ensure the mechanical and chemical stability of go films 23 typically direct current dc is used in ec processes which inherently leads to increased consumption of the anode due to oxidation in this work using an alternating current ac field has been shown to minimize the electrode consumption furthermore suspensions of go typically have a very broad particle size distribution due to the large particle size distribution of their graphite precursors and their harsh exfoliation conditions 24 25 using an ac field allows the migration and deposition of particles of specific size onto a substrate by tuning frequency and waveform 26 29 the present work explored the impact of applying a square ac field with varying duty cycle and frequency to the ec based technique some of the experiments also employed a pre coagulation step where cu2 ions were introduced into the system without the presence of an electric field to induce bulk aggregation of the go particles through adsorption followed by a deposition process in an ac or dc field both methods were found to have a strong influence on the removal of go from aqueous suspensions as well as the deposition rate and concentration of copper incorporated into fabricated go films 2 experimental 2 1 material synthesis graphene oxide suspensions were created through a modified hummers method 18 30 which mainly revolves around mixing graphite flakes with sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate the primary suspension had a go concentration of approximately 8 mg ml a ph of 2 and a conductivity of 5 1 ms cm to create pre coagulated dispersions copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o acros organics 99 was added progressively to the primary suspension and changes in the ph value conductivity and stability were noted films were then deposited on copper substrates by several variations listed below of ec assisted deposition 2 1 1 constant potential dc electrocoagulation with primary suspension go films were deposited from the primary suspension onto copper foils 0 0127 cm thick 1 5 cm2 annealed 99 9 substrates were cleaned in 0 1 m hcl by immersion for 60 s in addition the substrates were coated on the backside and the sides with epoxy 3 m scotch weld dp 270 clear to eliminate deposition of go on the back of the substrate as well as limit gas evolution on the substrate edges the copper foil served as the anode and a platinum cathode completed the formation of the electrochemical cell the distance between both electrodes was fixed at 1 5 cm electrocoagulation was performed by applying a 5 v potential field strength of approximately 3 v cm across the electrodes using a hewlett packard 6334a power supply deposition times ranged from 10 to 90 s acidic conditions were used in order to ensure the presence and stability of solubilized copper ions in the go dispersion 31 the films formed on the anodes were removed from the deposition bath rinsed immediately with di water and dried on a hot plate at 65 c under a nitrogen purge 2 psi 2 1 2 constant potential dc electrocoagulation with pre coagulated suspension copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o acros organics 99 was added to di water at a concentration of approximately 0 122 g ml solution ph of 3 7 and stirred for 30 min one milliliter of the copper sulfate solution was then added to the primary go suspension 30 ml and stirred for 30 min this produced a solution with 1000 ppm of cu2 ions the addition of cu2 to the suspension led to the agglomeration of go particles films were formed from the pre coagulated suspension using the same experimental conditions described earlier for the primary suspension 0 ppm of added cu2 a schematic describing the dc field induced ec process is shown in fig 1 2 1 3 ac field electrocoagulation with primary and pre coagulated suspensions films were deposited onto copper foils 0 0127 cm thick annealed 99 9 purity pre cleaned using the procedure described earlier electrocoagulation was performed by applying an ac field across the electrodes using a 60 mhz dual function arbitrary waveform generator bk precision 4055b for both the primary and pre coagulated suspensions the field had an amplitude value of 5 v frequencies ranged from 5 hz to 100 khz and deposition times were varied from 10 to 60 s duty cycles of 50 and 75 were employed fig 2 depicts the waveforms for the two different duty cycles 2 2 material characterization graphene oxide films together with their supporting cu anode substrates were removed from the deposition bath rinsed immediately with di water and dried on a hot plate at 65 c under flowing nitrogen 2 psi the thickness of the films was measured with a profilometer dektak 6 m veeco after creating a step profile by removing a portion of the go film from the cu substrate scan distance for the profilometer trace was 2000 microns and the stylus contact force was 3 mg thickness was measured at 5 10 different locations on a given sample then averaged the thickness measurements were also repeated on at least three samples formed under identical conditions to verify the consistency of the results an agilent 7700x icp ms instrument was used to determine the effect of frequency time and pre coagulation on the concentration of copper incorporated in the film for the analysis an rf power of 1550 w a plasma gas flow of 15 l min a carrier gas flow of 0 85 l min and a makeup gas flow of 0 15 l min was used prior to icp ms analysis films were carefully delaminated from the substrate using a nitrogen gas stream and thoroughly washed in di water and isopropyl alcohol ipa in order to minimize copper contamination the delaminated films were then bleached in nitric acid for metal dissolution and stabilization a zetasizer malvern zetasizer ns equipped with a disposable capillary cell and 633 nm hene laser source was used to determine the zeta potential and size distribution of the suspended go particles the composition and morphology of the go coatings were characterized using a micro raman spectrometer jobin yvon horiba lab ram hr800 and an x ray photoelectron spectrometer kratos 165 raman spectra were collected using an argon ion laser wavelength 514 5 nm 100 mw the beam was focused with a 100x microscope objective with a corresponding 10 μm spot size stokes scattered spectra were collected over the 1000 3000 cm 1 raman shift range resolution 5 cm 1 collection integration time was 20 s and 10 scans were collected and averaged to provide improved signal to noise ratio in the final spectra the xps analysis was used to determine the prevalent oxidation state of copper ions present in the go film the measurements were taken with a monochromatic al kα source the xps instrument used employed a hybrid active lens mode and a charge neutralizer in order to characterize the morphological features of deposited films cross sections of go samples deposited from the primary suspension were prepared using a 30 kv fei helios dual beam sem fib focused ion beam instrument a schematic of the steps involved in the sample preparation method is shown in fig 3 a rectangular carbon platinum carbon layer was deposited over the area of interest to prevent damage and spurious sputtering of the top portion of the sample the layer was also used as a mask to delineate the area of interest a focused beam of gallium ions with a voltage of 30 kv was used to cut a section 7 μm 8 μm x600 nm away from the bulk sample lifted out and transferred to a molybdenum stem grid sem analysis was performed under se mode from the surface of the film initially in contact with the copper electrode to a distance of about 6 7 μm into the film 3 results 3 1 suspension characterization baseline suspensions as well as pre coagulated suspensions were characterized for their size distribution and electrokinetic characteristics to confirm that the addition of copper ions to go suspensions ph of 2 in the absence of an electric field would cause bulk coagulation of go particles copper ions were added to baseline suspensions in the form of copper sulfate at increasing concentrations in the absence of any added copper ions the mean zeta potential of the go particles was approximately 55 mv the negative value of zeta potential is attributable to the ionization of highly acidic carboxylic acid groups in the synthesized go particles in contrast konkena and vasudevan measured zeta potential of much lower negative values 15 mv and justified it as being due to the presence of acidic groups with higher pka values of 4 3 9 8 determined by titration 32 when 25 ppm of copper was added to the dispersion the zeta potential decreased to approximately 30 mv as seen in fig 4 the significant lowering of zeta potential indicates adsorption of positively charged copper ions when the solution concentration of copper was progressively increased to approximately 1000 ppm the go suspensions became visibly more viscous a further increase of copper concentration to approximately 3000 ppm the dispersions thickened and created a gel like structure additionally particle size distribution measurements were done on suspensions that had 0 ppm and 25 ppm of added copper in the absence of any added copper ions the average particle size was 1 25 μm however the standard deviation was higher than 1 28 μm indicating very large distribution of sizes in dispersions with 25 ppm of added copper the zetasizer was unable to obtain a measurement due to the polydispersity index being too large for the tolerances of the tool signifying that variation in the size shape and mass of the go particles was significantly increased this can most likely be attributed to the coagulation and increase in size of a portion of the go particles 3 2 feasibility of go removal from suspension the feasibility of ec driven go removal from primary and pre coagulated suspensions was investigated under dc and ac fields 3 2 1 dc field a potential of 5 v dc was applied to the electrochemical cell for both the primary suspension and the pre coagulated suspension 1000 ppm cu fig 5 a presents the go removal in percent of the original mass of go in the dispersion as a function of time the percent removed was estimated based on the final go film volume after drying and a previously measured film densities for the times used the percent removed ranged from approximately 0 75 to 3 in the primary suspension and from approximately 0 75 to 1 5 in the pre coagulated suspension fig 5 b compares the thickness of deposited films as a function of time for the ec driven deposition from the primary suspension and the pre coagulated 1000 ppm copper suspension in the presence of a dc field of 5 v in the case of deposition from the primary suspension the thickness increases rapidly over the first 30 s and then plateaus out the decrease in film formation rate at longer times can be attributed to the decrease in the current over time as shown in fig 6 at constant voltage the potential difference between the electrodes is constant but the electric field influencing electrophoresis decreases with deposition time because of the formation of an insulating layer in this case go on the electrode surface for the deposition of films from the pre coagulated suspension the film thickness is on par with that from the primary suspension over the first 20 s of the deposition however after 20 s the thickness and deposition rate are significantly reduced this reduction is most likely caused by the larger particle agglomerate sizes due to coagulation since larger particles tend to settle due to gravitational effects their movement in electric field would be hindered 33 in addition an increase in the particle size would also lead to in an increase in the drag proportional to surface area of particle within the fluid which would decrease the velocity of the particles migrating towards the electrode 34 the go particle size therefore has a strong influence on the ec driven removal rate of go particles smaller in size are more efficiently removed 3 2 2 ac field with an ac field the removal of go from the suspension was unsuccessful at a 50 duty cycle however at a 75 duty cycle removal of go from the suspension and deposition of good quality films onto the copper anode was possible as discussed earlier the go particles exhibited a negative zeta potential at a ph of 2 therefore in the negative 5 v regime the go particles are expected to be repelled by the copper electrode and attracted to the platinum electrode poor removal at 50 duty cycle may be attributed to the fact that the net electrophoretic movement of particles toward the anode is very small at this duty cycle in contrast the 75 waveform provides more time under favorable field orientation for electrophoretic migration to the anode within each cycle all subsequent ac experiments were performed with a duty cycle of 75 fig 7 compares the film thickness over time for the 75 duty cycle field frequencies were varied from 5 hz to 100 khz and a constant deposition time of 60 s was used in the primary suspension the thickest go film was formed at a frequency of 5 khz under this condition the film thickness was approximately 20 microns which corresponds to approximately 0 96 mass of go removed from the suspension in the pre coagulated suspension the thickest film was at a frequency of 500 hz the thickness was approximately 28 microns which corresponds to approximately 1 32 mass of go removed for both suspensions an increase in frequency initially led to an increase in the film thickness however for both suspensions after a certain frequency threshold after 5000 hz for 0 ppm and after 500 hz for 1000 ppm cu added further increases in frequency led to a decrease in the resulting film thickness during the application of an ac field particles migrate in opposite directions during each half cycle at the end of each half cycle time is needed for the particles to change direction and accelerate from zero raissi et al 29 rationalized that larger particles require more time to change the direction of electrophoretic migration than smaller particles due to higher inertia at very high frequencies larger particles are no longer able to keep pace with the field and only smaller particles would exhibit electrophoretic migration and contribute to film formation 29 this would also explain why the pre coagulated suspension which has larger go particles has a significantly lower threshold frequency than the primary suspension for the pre coagulated suspension it is very interesting to note that the thickness increases again with increasing frequency after 25 khz agglomerates of primary particles present in the pre coagulated suspension would ideally contain bound as well as physically entrained copper ions since unbound copper ions and go surfaces are oppositely charged they would tend to move in opposite directions in an electrical field this would lead to a rupture of the agglomerates into smaller ones that are more responsive to higher field frequencies and then are available to be removed from the suspension and deposited onto the copper electrode 3 3 film characterization a representative micrograph of the cross section of a film deposited at 5 v with a dc potential for ten seconds is exemplified in fig 8 the film shows a layered microstructure containing cracks and voids between compact deposits this layer type structure indicates that the film formation occurs by face to face coagulation of go sheets aided by copper ions all films deposited onto the copper anode in dc as well ac fields exhibited similar raman spectra as an example the raman spectrum of the film deposited using an dc field of 10 v for 30 s is shown in fig 9 and it is in good agreement with published spectra for go 5 35 the peak of the d band positioned at approximately 1350 cm 1 is attributed with the breathing modes of six membered carbon rings that are activated by defects the peak in the range of 1590 to 1600 cm 1 is the g band which is attributed to e2g phonons at the brillouin zone center 35 the 2d and d g bands are also present and centered at approximately 2700 and 2900 cm 1 respectively 3 4 copper incorporation 3 4 1 icp ms the extent of incorporation of copper ions into the films was characterized using icp ms in the case of dc deposition from the primary suspension two films were prepared under different conditions namely 5 v for 10 s and 5 v for 60 s the copper concentration was found to be approximately 92 mg g for the 5 v 10 s film and 41 mg g for the 5 v 60 s film the relative total concentration of copper ions incorporated in the go films therefore decreases as the thickness of the film and deposition time increase this would imply that as the go film is deposited on the copper substrate the efficiency of the copper incorporation in the film is decreased due to the copper ions released from the anode having difficulty going through the deposited go film the concentration of copper in the film deposited from the pre coagulated suspension 1000 ppm copper at 5 v 60 s was found to be approximately 55 mg g a value that is about 30 larger than for the film deposited from primary suspension under same conditions this increased concentration of copper can be expected since copper is incorporated through two pathways electrochemical oxidation of the copper electrode and cu2 ions already present in the bulk suspension and adsorbed to the depositing go particles icp ms analysis was also carried out on several sets of films deposited from the primary suspension with a 5 v ac field at 5 khz to determine the copper concentration in the films for different times the data presented in fig 10 shows that the concentration of copper incorporated in the films from the primary suspension decreases with time and thickness similar to the dc deposition however the concentration of copper incorporated in the deposited material was significantly lower in the case of the ac field 14 mg g than in the 5 v dc field 41 mg g over 60 s it can be anticipated that over 60 s the copper substrate undergoes less net electrochemical oxidation in the ac field than in the dc field based on duty cycle thereby introducing less copper to the system to cause ec in addition the ac field provided less total time with field orientation appropriate for deposition to the anode for depositions from the pre coagulated system both types of fields yielded films of similar copper concentrations 57 mg g for 5 hz ac and 55 mg g for dc for a deposition time of 60 s this is due to the amount of copper ions formed via dissolution of the copper anode being negligible relative to the amount of copper ions added to bulk suspension 1000 ppm in the pre coagulated suspension indeed prior work 18 with a primary suspension showed that the concentration of copper dissolved into to suspension would be less than 30 ppm for a 30 s deposition with an applied voltage between 2 and 10 v 3 4 2 xps in order to study the charge state of the incorporated copper ions the deposited material was examined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps all specimens examined exhibited similar xps spectra irrespective of deposition conditions fig 11 a is the representative xps survey spectrum of the go coating the three most prevalent peaks are attributable to c1 s cu2p and o1 s regions fig 11 b focuses on the cu2p region of the xps spectrum of the go film and shows evidence of copper binding it reveals that the copper ions had a predominant oxidation state of 2 specifically the two binding energy peaks centered at 934 5 and 954 5 ev and the shakeup satellite peaks at approximately 944 and 963 ev identify the presence of cu2 for comparison the xps spectrum of the cleaned bare copper used as the anode is shown in fig 11 c this spectrum displays binding energy peaks at 952 ev and 932 ev which can be attributed to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 peaks of bare cu and cu2o fig 11 d focuses on the c1 s region of the xps spectrum of the go film and is in good agreement with published spectra for go 30 36 37 the peak centered at approximately 287 ev is associated to co and the peak centered at approximately 285 ev is associated with sp3 carbon there is a shoulder present at approximately 288 ev on the co peak which has been identified as evidence of copper binding 2 the xps data provides fundamental insight on how the copper is incorporated in the go matrix the doubly charged copper ions serve as an effective reagent to coagulate electrophoretically migrating go particles close to the anode via adsorption double layer compression and surface charge reduction neutralization as explained by classical dlvo theory 2 as previously mentioned oxygen containing go functional groups include carboxyl and hydroxyl groups dissociation of neighboring groups would result in the binding complexation of copper ions 2 this is schematically shown in fig 12 copper ion binding capacity of go at ph 2 has been documented by sitko et al 2 3 5 energy and electrode consumption for the same operating conditions energy consumption enc and electrode consumption elc under dc conditions are presented in fig 13 calculation of enc and elc was done by the following equations 38 1 e n c u i t v 2 e l c m i t n f v where u is the voltage v i is the current a t is the time sec v is the volume of the dispersion m is the molar mass g mol f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol and n is the number of electrons transferred n 2 38 both the primary and pre coagulated suspension had similar enc and elc values under a 5 v dc potential the electrode consumption and energy consumption reached approximately 0 02 kg m3 and 0 1 kw h m3 respectively after one minute of processing time at this stage it would be useful to compare the electrode and energy consumptions relative to a more traditional electrocoagulation experiment it is difficult to draw an exact comparison since the classical ec process typically has a test time in hours and often uses higher voltages from 10 to 50 v 39 40 due to the low current and times needed to provide a scalable go film that can be used in electronic applications the electrode and energy consumption was found to be very minimal compared to a classical electrocoagulation batched experiment where one might typically expect increased values by a factor of approximately 10 38 41 44 4 conclusions electrocoagulation was utilized to remove go particles from aqueous suspensions without the inconvenience of high sludge generation handling and disposal the technique actually allowed the scalable and stable formation of copper ion containing go films onto metallic substrates that can be used in anti corrosion applications as well as opening avenues for the fabrication of electronic devices the experimental variables included the type of electric field dc and ac and the use or lack of a copper ion induced chemical pre coagulation step the highest removal rate of approximately 2 5 by mass of go per minute was obtained from the primary suspension under a 5 v dc potential 3 v cm however after 30 s the amount of go removed from suspension plateaus out at around 3 due to the poorly conducting nature of go to increase the extent of go removal a continuous flow and multi electrode system would have to be employed additionally since the consumption of the electrode is very small the electrodes would not have to be replaced often after delamination of the go film a future manuscript will focus on improving the efficiency and scaling up the process the type of field used on the primary suspension had a strong influence on the deposition rate and film properties at a 5 v potential using ac fields resulted in the formation of go films at a slower rate but with a lower level of copper incorporation however increasing go agglomerate size through chemical pre coagulation led to films with enhanced copper concentration as well as well as a more stable deposition rate over various field conditions dc or ac and frequencies declaration of

13983,graphene oxide go particulates offer an inexpensive route for the formation of graphene flakes their fine size and high degree of dispensability in aqueous media have raised environmental safety concerns in processing plants this manuscript describes a novel electrocoagulation based method that enables the removal of go particles from acidic aqueous suspensions in the form of copper ion containing go films specifically copper ions were generated near a copper anode and adsorbed onto negatively surface charged go particles driving the anodic deposition of go films the experimental variables included the type of electric field dc and ac and the use of a copper ion induced bulk pre coagulation step a direct current dc potential gradient of 3 v cm applied to a baseline suspension with a go concentration of 0 8 mass percent solids removed approximately 3 of the go particles in a minute in the form of compact films of thickness ranging from approximately 10 to 50 microns containing copper ions use of ac fields led to lower deposition rates and copper content on the other hand pre coagulation of go dispersions with copper ions led to films with enhanced copper concentrations characterization of go films using xps and raman techniques has shown that copper is present in the bivalent form in go keywords graphene oxide electrocoagulation coagulation copper ion waste treatment 1 introduction graphene oxide go is the oxidized counterpart of graphene a monolayer sheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms with delocalized π bonding states in a honeycomb crystal lattice from a chemical perspective go has an abundant amount of oxygen atoms on its graphitic backbone in the form of epoxy hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 1 these oxygen containing functional groups are characterized by an isolated electron pair by sharing an electron pair the functional groups can efficiently bind a metal ion to form a metal complex 2 metal ion binding capacity of go exists at a wide range of ph values and depending on the type of divalent cations it is reported to be in the range of 300 1000 mg g 2 graphene oxide has recently garnered significant attention from the scientific community since its reduction has become a reliable route for obtaining chemically modified graphene platelets also referred to as reduced graphene oxide rgo in large scale and low cost 3 furthermore go has found uses where pristine graphene has limited applications such as water treatment 4 and anticorrosion coatings 5 its large scale production has grown significantly in the last decade for example sixth element materials a chinese based company set up a mass production line with a 100 tons per year capacity in 2013 6 due to its increase in production and applications go will unavoidably be released into the environment and ecological system 7 8 in recent years it has been shown that go potentially has deleterious and toxic effects to humans and the ecosystem for example several studies have demonstrated that go could lead to severe and persistent lung diseases 9 10 go could cause cytotoxicity in human erythrocytes and skin fibroblast cells 11 in addition go was reported to reduce microbial metabolic activity in wastewater 12 and to be very toxic to fresh water paramecium caudatum 13 due to the aforementioned risks it is imperative to develop techniques for the removal of go from aqueous suspensions studies on the removal of go based nanomaterials in water treatment systems are scarce chemical coagulation with materials such as al2o3 14 tio2 15 alum 7 and adsorption on materials such as mg al layered double hydroxide ldh and ca al ldh 8 have been reported the main disadvantage of adsorption is low efficiency 16 while chemical coagulation has the inconvenience of high sludge generation handling and disposal 17 in a recent study the authors of this paper reported on the utilization of electrocoagulation ec as the driver for rapidly removing the go particles 18 electrocoagulation has been traditionally used as a method to separate ions and colloidal particles from wastewater 19 in the classic ec process metal cations are produced by electrochemical oxidation of a soluble anode the multivalent metal ions can induce coagulation of particles in the suspension either by neutralizing the surface charge of the colloidal particles if they are negatively charged or by simply reducing the double layer thickness around the particles 20 22 in ec the coagulants are generated in situ which results in much less sludge generation than chemical coagulation additionally the electrophoretic migration of charged particles towards the soluble anode is vital for the electrocoagulation mechanism to occur the main advantage of the novel ec based technique reported in the previously mentioned paper over previous methods to clarify waste streams is that it also allowed the scalable formation of metal ion containing go films much of the ec literature deals with coagulation of particles in the bulk of the dispersion for the formation of films via the ec process it is critical to selectively induce the coagulation very near the electrode surface specifically bivalent copper ions were generated near a copper anode and adsorbed onto negatively surface charged go particles driving the anodic deposition of go films from acidic go dispersions the ec driven technique not only destabilized the suspension but also created a useful go film which can then be reduced to rgo opening avenues for the fabrication of electrochemical devices furthermore the method naturally allows for incorporation of metal ions which has been shown to ensure the mechanical and chemical stability of go films 23 typically direct current dc is used in ec processes which inherently leads to increased consumption of the anode due to oxidation in this work using an alternating current ac field has been shown to minimize the electrode consumption furthermore suspensions of go typically have a very broad particle size distribution due to the large particle size distribution of their graphite precursors and their harsh exfoliation conditions 24 25 using an ac field allows the migration and deposition of particles of specific size onto a substrate by tuning frequency and waveform 26 29 the present work explored the impact of applying a square ac field with varying duty cycle and frequency to the ec based technique some of the experiments also employed a pre coagulation step where cu2 ions were introduced into the system without the presence of an electric field to induce bulk aggregation of the go particles through adsorption followed by a deposition process in an ac or dc field both methods were found to have a strong influence on the removal of go from aqueous suspensions as well as the deposition rate and concentration of copper incorporated into fabricated go films 2 experimental 2 1 material synthesis graphene oxide

lower negative values 15 mv and justified it as being due to the presence of acidic groups with higher pka values of 4 3 9 8 determined by titration 32 when 25 ppm of copper was added to the dispersion the zeta potential decreased to approximately 30 mv as seen in fig 4 the significant lowering of zeta potential indicates adsorption of positively charged copper ions when the solution concentration of copper was progressively increased to approximately 1000 ppm the go suspensions became visibly more viscous a further increase of copper concentration to approximately 3000 ppm the dispersions thickened and created a gel like structure additionally particle size distribution measurements were done on suspensions that had 0 ppm and 25 ppm of added copper in the absence of any added copper ions the average particle size was 1 25 μm however the standard deviation was higher than 1 28 μm indicating very large distribution of sizes in dispersions with 25 ppm of added copper the zetasizer was unable to obtain a measurement due to the polydispersity index being too large for the tolerances of the tool signifying that variation in the size shape and mass of the go particles was significantly increased this can most likely be attributed to the coagulation and increase in size of a portion of the go particles 3 2 feasibility of go removal from suspension the feasibility of ec driven go removal from primary and pre coagulated suspensions was investigated under dc and ac fields 3 2 1 dc field a potential of 5 v dc was applied to the electrochemical cell for both the primary suspension and the pre coagulated suspension 1000 ppm cu fig 5 a presents the go removal in percent of the original mass of go in the dispersion as a function of time the percent removed was estimated based on the final go film volume after drying and a previously measured film densities for the times used the percent removed ranged from approximately 0 75 to 3 in the primary suspension and from approximately 0 75 to 1 5 in the pre coagulated suspension fig 5 b compares the thickness of deposited films as a function of time for the ec driven deposition from the primary suspension and the pre coagulated 1000 ppm copper suspension in the presence of a dc field of 5 v in the case of deposition from the primary suspension the thickness increases rapidly over the first 30 s and then plateaus out the decrease in film formation rate at longer times can be attributed to the decrease in the current over time as shown in fig 6 at constant voltage the potential difference between the electrodes is constant but the electric field influencing electrophoresis decreases with deposition time because of the formation of an insulating layer in this case go on the electrode surface for the deposition of films from the pre coagulated suspension the film thickness is on par with that from the primary suspension over the first 20 s of the deposition however after 20 s the thickness and deposition rate are significantly reduced this reduction is most likely caused by the larger particle agglomerate sizes due to coagulation since larger particles tend to settle due to gravitational effects their movement in electric field would be hindered 33 in addition an increase in the particle size would also lead to in an increase in the drag proportional to surface area of particle within the fluid which would decrease the velocity of the particles migrating towards the electrode 34 the go particle size therefore has a strong influence on the ec driven removal rate of go particles smaller in size are more efficiently removed 3 2 2 ac field with an ac field the removal of go from the suspension was unsuccessful at a 50 duty cycle however at a 75 duty cycle removal of go from the suspension and deposition of good quality films onto the copper anode was possible as discussed earlier the go particles exhibited a negative zeta potential at a ph of 2 therefore in the negative 5 v regime the go particles are expected to be repelled by the copper electrode and attracted to the platinum electrode poor removal at 50 duty cycle may be attributed to the fact that the net electrophoretic movement of particles toward the anode is very small at this duty cycle in contrast the 75 waveform provides more time under favorable field orientation for electrophoretic migration to the anode within each cycle all subsequent ac experiments were performed with a duty cycle of 75 fig 7 compares the film thickness over time for the 75 duty cycle field frequencies were varied from 5 hz to 100 khz and a constant deposition time of 60 s was used in the primary suspension the thickest go film was formed at a frequency of 5 khz under this condition the film thickness was approximately 20 microns which corresponds to approximately 0 96 mass of go removed from the suspension in the pre coagulated suspension the thickest film was at a frequency of 500 hz the thickness was approximately 28 microns which corresponds to approximately 1 32 mass of go removed for both suspensions an increase in frequency initially led to an increase in the film thickness however for both suspensions after a certain frequency threshold after 5000 hz for 0 ppm and after 500 hz for 1000 ppm cu added further increases in frequency led to a decrease in the resulting film thickness during the application of an ac field particles migrate in opposite directions during each half cycle at the end of each half cycle time is needed for the particles to change direction and accelerate from zero raissi et al 29 rationalized that larger particles require more time to change the direction of electrophoretic migration than smaller particles due to higher inertia at very high frequencies larger particles are no longer able to keep pace with the field and only smaller particles would exhibit electrophoretic migration and contribute to film formation 29 this would also explain why the pre coagulated suspension which has larger go particles has a significantly lower threshold frequency than the primary suspension for the pre coagulated suspension it is very interesting to note that the thickness increases again with increasing frequency after 25 khz agglomerates of primary particles present in the pre coagulated suspension would ideally contain bound as well as physically entrained copper ions since unbound copper ions and go surfaces are oppositely charged they would tend to move in opposite directions in an electrical field this would lead to a rupture of the agglomerates into smaller ones that are more responsive to higher field frequencies and then are available to be removed from the suspension and deposited onto the copper electrode 3 3 film characterization a representative micrograph of the cross section of a film deposited at 5 v with a dc potential for ten seconds is exemplified in fig 8 the film shows a layered microstructure containing cracks and voids between compact deposits this layer type structure indicates that the film formation occurs by face to face coagulation of go sheets aided by copper ions all films deposited onto the copper anode in dc as well ac fields exhibited similar raman spectra as an example the raman spectrum of the film deposited using an dc field of 10 v for 30 s is shown in fig 9 and it is in good agreement with published spectra for go 5 35 the peak of the d band positioned at approximately 1350 cm 1 is attributed with the breathing modes of six membered carbon rings that are activated by defects the peak in the range of 1590 to 1600 cm 1 is the g band which is attributed to e2g phonons at the brillouin zone center 35 the 2d and d g bands are also present and centered at approximately 2700 and 2900 cm 1 respectively 3 4 copper incorporation 3 4 1 icp ms the extent of incorporation of copper ions into the films was characterized using icp ms in the case of dc deposition from the primary suspension two films were prepared under different conditions namely 5 v for 10 s and 5 v for 60 s the copper concentration was found to be approximately 92 mg g for the 5 v 10 s film and 41 mg g for the 5 v 60 s film the relative total concentration of copper ions incorporated in the go films therefore decreases as the thickness of the film and deposition time increase this would imply that as the go film is deposited on the copper substrate the efficiency of the copper incorporation in the film is decreased due to the copper ions released from the anode having difficulty going through the deposited go film the concentration of copper in the film deposited from the pre coagulated suspension 1000 ppm copper at 5 v 60 s was found to be approximately 55 mg g a value that is about 30 larger than for the film deposited from primary suspension under same conditions this increased concentration of copper can be expected since copper is incorporated through two pathways electrochemical oxidation of the copper electrode and cu2 ions already present in the bulk suspension and adsorbed to the depositing go particles icp ms analysis was also carried out on several sets of films deposited from the primary suspension with a 5 v ac field at 5 khz to determine the copper concentration in the films for different times the data presented in fig 10 shows that the concentration of copper incorporated in the films from the primary suspension decreases with time and thickness similar to the dc deposition however the concentration of copper incorporated in the deposited material was significantly lower in the case of the ac field 14 mg g than in the 5 v dc field 41 mg g over 60 s it can be anticipated that over 60 s the copper substrate undergoes less net electrochemical oxidation in the ac field than in the dc field based on duty cycle thereby introducing less copper to the system to cause ec in addition the ac field provided less total time with field orientation appropriate for deposition to the anode for depositions from the pre coagulated system both types of fields yielded films of similar copper concentrations 57 mg g for 5 hz ac and 55 mg g for dc for a deposition time of 60 s this is due to the amount of copper ions formed via dissolution of the copper anode being negligible relative to the amount of copper ions added to bulk suspension 1000 ppm in the pre coagulated suspension indeed prior work 18 with a primary suspension showed that the concentration of copper dissolved into to suspension would be less than 30 ppm for a 30 s deposition with an applied voltage between 2 and 10 v 3 4 2 xps in order to study the charge state of the incorporated copper ions the deposited material was examined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps all specimens examined exhibited similar xps spectra irrespective of deposition conditions fig 11 a is the representative xps survey spectrum of the go coating the three most prevalent peaks are attributable to c1 s cu2p and o1 s regions fig 11 b focuses on the cu2p region of the xps spectrum of the go film and shows evidence of copper binding it reveals that the copper ions had a predominant oxidation state of 2 specifically the two binding energy peaks centered at 934 5 and 954 5 ev and the shakeup satellite peaks at approximately 944 and 963 ev identify the presence of cu2 for comparison the xps spectrum of the cleaned bare copper used as the anode is shown in fig 11 c this spectrum displays binding energy peaks at 952 ev and 932 ev which can be attributed to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 peaks of bare cu and cu2o fig 11 d focuses on the c1 s region of the xps spectrum of the go film and is in good agreement with published spectra for go 30 36 37 the peak centered at approximately 287 ev is associated to co and the peak centered at approximately 285 ev is associated with sp3 carbon there is a shoulder present at approximately 288 ev on the co peak which has been identified as evidence of copper binding 2 the xps data provides fundamental insight on how the copper is incorporated in the go matrix the doubly charged copper ions serve as an effective reagent to coagulate electrophoretically migrating go particles close to the anode via adsorption double layer compression and surface charge reduction neutralization as explained by classical dlvo theory 2 as previously mentioned oxygen containing go functional groups include carboxyl and hydroxyl groups dissociation of neighboring groups would result in the binding complexation of copper ions 2 this is schematically shown in fig 12 copper ion binding capacity of go at ph 2 has been documented by sitko et al 2 3 5 energy and electrode consumption for the same operating conditions energy consumption enc and electrode consumption elc under dc conditions are presented in fig 13 calculation of enc and elc was done by the following equations 38 1 e n c u i t v 2 e l c m i t n f v where u is the voltage v i is the current a t is the time sec v is the volume of the dispersion m is the molar mass g mol f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol and n is the number of electrons transferred n 2 38 both the primary and pre coagulated suspension had similar enc and elc values under a 5 v dc potential the electrode consumption and energy consumption reached approximately 0 02 kg m3 and 0 1 kw h m3 respectively after one minute of processing time at this stage it would be useful to compare the electrode and energy consumptions relative to a more traditional electrocoagulation experiment it is difficult to draw an exact comparison since the classical ec process typically has a test time in hours and often uses higher voltages from 10 to 50 v 39 40 due to the low current and times needed to provide a scalable go film that can be used in electronic applications the electrode and energy consumption was found to be very minimal compared to a classical electrocoagulation batched experiment where one might typically expect increased values by a factor of approximately 10 38 41 44 4 conclusions electrocoagulation was utilized to remove go particles from aqueous suspensions without the inconvenience of high sludge generation handling and disposal the technique actually allowed the scalable and stable formation of copper ion containing go films onto metallic substrates that can be used in anti corrosion applications as well as opening avenues for the fabrication of electronic devices the experimental variables included the type of electric field dc and ac and the use or lack of a copper ion induced chemical pre coagulation step the highest removal rate of approximately 2 5 by mass of go per minute was obtained from the primary suspension under a 5 v dc potential 3 v cm however after 30 s the amount of go removed from suspension plateaus out at around 3 due to the poorly conducting nature of go to increase the extent of go removal a continuous flow and multi electrode system would have to be employed additionally since the consumption of the electrode is very small the electrodes would not have to be replaced often after delamination of the go film a future manuscript will focus on improving the efficiency and scaling up the process the type of field used on the primary suspension had a strong influence on the deposition rate and film properties at a 5 v potential using ac fields resulted in the formation of go films at a slower rate but with a lower level of copper incorporation however increasing go agglomerate size through chemical pre coagulation led to films with enhanced copper concentration as well as well as a more stable deposition rate over various field conditions dc or ac and frequencies declaration of

13984,this study aims to determine optimal electrocoagulation ec operational conditions for removal of nutrients and organic matter and improving the mixed liquor filterability during municipal wastewater treatment in a submerged membrane electro bioreactor smebr first the optimal electric current exposure time for the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod was determined then different ec conditions were tested by varying the current density mode of exposure and ph using a factorial design finally the impact of the optimal conditions on biomass activity was evaluated the observed optimal operational conditions were a current density of 10 am 2 with an exposure mode of 6 on 30 off at ph 8 using these optimal conditions electrocoagulation achieved high removal efficiencies of 99 51 98 56 and 99 04 for po4 3 p nh4 n and cod respectively after 48 hours of treatment an increase in the size of the flocs under these optimal conditions improved filterability to 98 76 which reduces membrane fouling in an smebr in addition the optimized conditions increased the autotrophic and heterotrophic oxygen uptake rate demonstrating that ec can be applied in an smebr

large volumes and contains high concentrations of pollutants such as solids oils dissolved gases microorganisms and organic matter the removal of these pollutants from wastewater is difficult due to their varied characteristics which makes wastewater a potential source of environmental pollution therefore the effective treatment of wastewater before discharge is important to protect water bodies 1 biological reactors combined with membranes i e membrane bioreactors mbrs are widely used in municipal wastewater treatment 2 however mbrs have some limitations such as low phosphorus removal and membrane fouling which may cause deterioration in the effluent quality 3 4 electrocoagulation ec is an alternative treatment method that has achieved high phosphorus removal efficiencies and improvements in the filterability of the mixed liquor of wastewater in addition ec can be used in combination with other technologies such as submerged membrane electro bioreactor smebr however it is important that the ec process is optimized to compliment membrane processes 5 smebr simultaneously integrates biological process membrane filtration and electrocoagulation in a single system 6 the technology is based on the application of direct current dc in perforated electrodes anode and cathode immersed around a membrane module thus electrocoagulation and biodegradation occur along with the filtration process through a membrane providing the wastewater treatment 7 in the ec process the coagulant ions are produced in situ by applying a potential to the anodes which are typically made of aluminum or iron this process causes the oxidation and dissolution of aluminum or iron in the liquid medium which are hydrolyzed to polymeric hydroxides 8 these hydroxides have a high surface area which contributes to the adsorption of organic compounds which leads to the trapping of colloidal particles and formation of complexes which are easily removed via sedimentation flotation 9 or even membrane filtration because of the improvement in the mixed liquor filterability the electrochemical reactions that occur with a metal m at the anode and cathode are described in eqs 1 to 4 8 at the anode 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the cathode 3 m a q n n e m s 4 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h the coagulant ions generated by electrocoagulation al3 fe3 facilitate phosphorus removal due to the precipitation of phosphorus as fe3 or al3 phosphate and the adsorption of soluble phosphorus on the insoluble aluminum or iron hydroxides formed in the mixed liquor 10 11 ec has shown a high chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency due to the electrochemical oxidation of the anode which helps to transform complex molecules into more biodegradable substances that are easily assimilated by microorganisms 12 in addition the application of an electric field stimulates the metabolism and activity of microorganisms through the electrostimulation process improving the ammoniacal nitrogen removal efficiency 13 however the ec parameters must be optimized to ensure the efficiency of the process the current density and exposure time are important because high current densities can cause the inhibition of the microorganisms due to strong electrical impulses high concentrations of metal ions or changes in ph while short exposure times can decrease the pollutant removal efficiency long exposure times do not provide additional removal and can lead to increased sludge generation 14 the ph also must be controlled to allow the formation of coagulant species because at ph values greater than 9 some insoluble aluminum compounds become al oh 4 which is soluble in water reducing coagulation capacity 15 this study therefore aims to evaluate the influence of ec parameters on the removal of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod and the mixed liquor filterability to establish the optimal ec operational conditions for use in an smebr for municipal wastewater treatment current density exposure mode and ph were evaluated using a 23 factorial design the optimal conditions were evaluated for its impact on the biomass activity of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental unit five bench scale reactors with a capacity of 1 l were used an air diffuser was installed in the base of each reactor to maintain aerobic conditions and ensure adequate mixing four reactors were equipped with two rectangular electrodes 5 65 cm x 13 9 cm separated by 5 0 cm fig 1 the anode was made of flat plates of pure aluminum metal with a useful surface area of 46 335 cm2 the cathode consisted of a thin stainless steel screen the electrodes were connected to an adjustable source of dc digital power with a variable voltage and current of 0 30 v and 0 5 a respectively to control the applied current density and a control panel with timers was installed to regulate the exposure mode the system consisted of two circuits allowing the simultaneous operation of two distinct conditions in duplicate one reactor was operated in parallel without an electric current as a control fig 1 2 2 mixed liquor the mixed liquor was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in florianópolis brazil the suspended solids contents of the samples were amended to about 5000 mg l 1 by sedimentation and removal of the supernatant a similar value to that in an mbr 16 in addition the initial ammoniacal nitrogen and phosphate concentrations in all samples were standardized to approximately 15 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 by adding ammonium chloride nh4cl and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 respectively the characteristics of the standardized mixed liquor are listed in table 1 2 3 determination of the electric current exposure time to optimize the exposure time for the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and soluble cod two reactors were each inoculated with 800 ml of mixed liquor and the ec process was started at room temperature under constant aeration and mixing one reactor was operated with a current density of 10 am 2 and exposure mode of 6 on 18 off 17 which means that the current application was on for 6 minutes followed by 18 minutes off during operating time and the other control without electric current application at specified time intervals a 10 ml aliquot was taken from each reactor and vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane sartorius company br for po4 3 p nh4 n and cod analysis ec was conducted for 48 hours until almost complete removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod was achieved in the reactor with the electric current the test was performed in duplicate 2 4 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation conditions five reactors using the experimental set up shown in fig 1 were each inoculated with 800 ml of mixed liquor the ec process was run for the exposure time determined above the influence of three different values of three main parameters on the treatment was investigated these were the current density 10 15 and 20 am 2 the initial ph 6 7 and 8 and the mode of exposure that is the time minutes that the electric current was turned on off 6 on 18 off 6 on 24 off and 6 on 30 off the ph was adjusted using 1 mol l 1 solutions of sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh during operation ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity and current density were monitored three times a day at the end al 3 po4 3 p nh4 n soluble cod smps epss mfi and size of the flocs were determined a 23 factorial design with center points in triplicate was used factorial design is a technique widely used to determine the best treatment conditions when the process has two or more factors independent variables because this allows the examination of a combination of all variables at all levels with the smallest number of runs possible the technique measures the effect of the factors on selected responses dependent variables 18 the triplicate central point experiments improve the quadratic estimation and give information about the experimental central region 19 eleven experiments were performed according to the proposed factorial design with the central point in triplicate the combinations of the variables of each experiment were determined using statistical software 8 the selected responses were the concentration of soluble aluminum the percentage removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and soluble cod the concentration of soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss the percentage improvement in modified fouling index mfi and the increase in the size of the flocs the results were analyzed using statistical software 8 statsoft inc to conduct an analysis of variance anova pareto diagrams and response surface 3d and 2d graphs for each response the mathematical models were evaluated using multiple linear regression analyses the fit of the regression model was checked by the coefficient of determination r2 2 5 impact of electrocoagulation on the biomass autotrophic and heterotrophic activity the autotrophic and heterotrophic activity of the biomass was monitored using respirometric tests these were performed on mixed liquor from ec conducted using the optimal conditions determined by factorial design the respirometric tests were performed as described by iversen et al 20 two erlenmeyer flasks each containing 1 l of mixed liquor were kept under constant agitation 130 rpm and aeration 8 64 mgo2 l 1 the endogenous oxygen uptake rate our was evaluated in both respirometers after an aeration interruption ammonium chloride was added to one respirometer to obtain the autotrophic our for ammonium oxidation followed by the addition of allylthiourea atu and sodium acetate to inhibit nitrification and to obtain the heterotrophic our respectively in the other respirometer sodium nitrite was added to obtain the autotrophic our for nitrite oxidation the ours were calculated from a do slope do was recorded every 5 s using a ysi proodo these our values were normalized by the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss content to determine the values of specific oxygen uptake rate sour 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of po4 3 p nh4 n cod and al 3 were measured by spectrophotometry hach dr5000 the po4 3 p concentration was determined using the molybdovanophosphoric acid method apha 2005 cod nh4 n and al 3 were measured according to the manufacturer s instructions using the hach 8000 10031 and 8012 methods respectively tss was determined by gravimetric method ph was measured with a thermo fisher ph meter and do with an oximeter ysi 55 conductivity as well as temperature were measured with a probe hanna hi 991300 smps were obtained by mixed liquor centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0 45 μm acetate filter epss were extracted by resuspension of the sediment of the mixed liquor in 0 05 sodium chloride nacl solution using the heating method at 60 c for 30 min followed by centrifugation and filtration as performed for smps smps and epss were measured by spectrophotometry as proteins and carbohydrates according as described by lowry et al 21 and dubois et al 22 respectively to determine the mfi 250 ml of mixed liquor was filtered through a 0 45 μm acetate filter for 20 minutes at a constant pressure of 0 2 bar in a bench filtration unit to calculate the filtration flow through the filter the permeate was collected in an erlenmeyer flask positioned on an analytical balance and the mass of the permeate accumulated every 30 seconds was converted to a volume the mfi s ml 1 is the linear angular coefficient obtained by plotting the filtration time permeate volume t v data in relation to the volume accumulated v 23 the mixed liquor particle size was evaluated through laser diffraction granulometry using a mastersizer malvern 2010 analyzer this method measures the angle of diffraction when a laser beam interacts with the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the electric current exposure time fig 2 shows the percentage removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod over time after the application of an electric current a 10 am 2 current density and intermittent exposure mode of 6 min on 18 min off resulted in a removal of 100 94 20 and 100 of the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod respectively after 48 hours fig 3 shows the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod removal after 48 hours following application of an electric current compared to the control ec significantly increased the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod by 77 91 58 22 and 55 42 respectively compared to the control the high efficiency of po4 3 p removal is due to the interaction of the al3 released by the anode with the soluble po4 3 generating insoluble species eq 5 8 that are easily removed by sedimentation or membrane filtration 24 in addition the adsorption of soluble po4 3 by the insoluble aluminum hydroxides formed during the electrocoagulation process eq 6 also contribute to the removal of po4 3 p 10 the high density flocs are then separated by sedimentation or by flotation through the action of gas bubbles generated at the cathode 5 a l 3 p o 4 3 a l p o 4 s 6 a l 6 o h 15 3 p o 4 3 a l 6 o h 15 p o 4 s the high nh4 n removal is due to the electrostimulation process this is where the electric current within a limited range 25 stimulates the metabolism and activity of microorganisms 13 specifically the enzymes responsible for the nitrification process ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nor 26 the high cod removal in relation to the control provided by ec is due to electrochemical oxidation this process transforms complex molecules into substances with lower molecular weights so they are more biodegradable and easily assimilated by organisms 12 in addition the al 3 ions released by the anode react with soluble organic matter providing the floc formation which also contributes to the removal of soluble cod given the excellent ec performance after 48 hours it was not considered necessary to continue the ec process for 70 hours as in a previous study 27 therefore 48 hours was adopted as the optimum time for the factorial design experiment 3 2 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation conditions a 23 factorial design and response surface graphs were used to determine the optimal ec conditions to remove pollutants from and improve the filterability of municipal wastewater 3 2 1 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation operational conditions for the removal of organic matter and nutrients table 2 shows the results of the po4 3 p nh4 n cod and al3 responses for each experiment the initial concentration of these parameters was shown in table 1 electrical conductivity was also analyzed after each test but it was not part of the statistical analysis conductivity increased in all experiments performed with respect to the initial standardized mixed liquor a possible reason for this is an increase in the ionic content of the media due to the degradation of the substrates kh2po4 and nh4cl 25 in addition the bacteria may have started the endogenous process due to not adding new substrates throughout the operation which leads to the release of soluble compounds into the medium and a consequent increase in conductivity the increase in microbial activity as seen in fig 8 also leads to greater release of soluble compounds by bacteria which also contributes to increasing the conductivity of the medium however these compounds can react with the aluminum released by the anode which explains the lower conductivity values when compared to the control between 1438 and 1742 μs cm 1 high conductivities are an advantage to the system since they provide a less energy consumption 28 when the conductivity of the medium is low a supporting electrolyte such as nacl can be added in order to contribute to its increase the presence of chloride ions in the solution also decreases the electrode s passivation and increases the efficiency of the electrocoagulation 29 while the aluminum concentrations were higher than the initial value measured in the mixed liquor they were low in all conditions tested indicating that the parameters investigated did not substantially alter the al3 released into the liquid in the ph range studied ph 6 to 8 aluminum is mostly in the form of al oh 3 which has low solubility and therefore remains in the sludge as the precipitate aluminum phosphate 15 the po4 3 p removal was high for all conditions tested showing the effectiveness of the ec process in the removal of this pollutant po4 3 p removal occurs through the interaction of soluble po4 3 with al3 and the adsorption of soluble po4 3 by metal hydroxides the nh4 n removal was 93 in most conditions tested except for experiment 2 82 the higher current density and longer exposure time applied in experiment 2 may contribute to this lower removal rate because the microorganisms responsible for nitrification are sensitive to inhibition under these conditions 14 in addition the ph of experiment 2 ph 6 was not in the optimal range for nitrification ph 7 5 8 5 30 the cod removal varied between experiments experiment 5 provided 100 removal while in experiment 2 the removal was only 27 these variations are likely due to the process conditions under favorable current densities and ph values ph 8 and cd 10 am 2 the bacteria responsible for the assimilation of organic matter achieved a very high cod removal under unfavorable conditions to the development of these organisms ph 6 and cd 20 am 2 the low cod removal could also be due to the interaction of the al 3 released by the anode and the soluble organic matter to determine the optimal ec conditions statistical analyses were performed fig 4 shows the effect of the factors tested and the interactions between them on the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod removal as well as on the soluble aluminum concentration fig 4 b and d show that the factors tested did not have a significant effect on nh4 n removal and al3 concentration p 0 05 in contrast fig 4 a and c show that the current density and ph factors had a significant effect p 0 05 on po4 3 p and cod removal moreover the interaction between both factors also affected po4 3 p removal increasing the current density positively affected po4 3 p removal and negatively affected the cod removal the higher po4 3 p removal was due to the higher aluminum concentration from the anode and low cod removal due to impairment of the bacterial activity by the high current density increasing the ph negatively impacted po4 3 p removal this is likely to be because of the precipitation of aluminum as hydroxides in contrast increasing the ph increased the cod removal rate due to the acclimation of sewage degrading bacteria to neutral or slightly basic ph values 30 the current density and ph interaction had a positive effect on po4 3 p removal the exposure mode did not significantly affect any parameters thus the choice of 6 on 30 off mode is the most appropriate because the longer off time reduces energy consumption and depreciation of the electrodes in addition a lower aluminum concentration is expected in the sludge an analysis of variance anova was performed using the po4 3 p and cod removal variables table 3 the anova results showed that the model presented for both po4 3 p and cod removal was significant f calculated f tabulated for the factors that significantly affected the po4 3 p and cod removal the 3d contour curve and 2d response surface graphs fig 5 were made by interrelating the current density and ph factors to the 6 on 30 off exposure mode to analyze the factors that significantly affected the po4 3 p and cod removal and determine the optimal ec conditions for wastewater treatment the residual distribution graph interrelates the removal values of the responses established by the model versus the values observed experimentally indicating the quality of fit of the experimental data to the model for predictive purposes 32 fig 5 a shows that the low ph values resulted in a high po4 3 p removal efficiency at any level of current density interestingly a high po4 3 p removal efficiency could be achieved at any ph value if the current density is high the best condition tested for po4 3 p removal under the 6 on 30 off exposure mode corresponds to a current density of 20 am 2 at ph 6 fig 5 c fig 5 b shows that high cod removal efficiencies can be achieved with a low current density at all ph values and at all values of current density when combined with a high ph value fig 5 d demonstrates that the best condition tested for cod removal corresponds to a current density of 10 am 2 at ph 8 and a 6 on 30 off exposure mode the r2 values for po4 3 p and cod removal were 0 89577 and 0 91152 respectively indicating that the model explains around 90 and 91 of the variability in phosphorus and cod removal respectively the residual distribution graphs fig 5 e and f which relates the values predicted by the model represented by the line and the experimentally observed values represented by the points demonstrates that the observed values are close to the line showing a strong correlation with the predicted values which indicates the goodness of fit for po4 3 p and cod removal this study shows that the best ec conditions for the removal of pollutants from municipal wastewater are a current density of 10 am 2 and ph 8 with a 6 on 30 off exposure mode using these conditions it was possible to remove 99 51 99 04 and 98 56 of po4 3 p cod and nh4 n respectively and obtain a soluble aluminum

and flocs size responses for each factorial design experiment the initial value of these parameters was shown in table 1 the floc size increased considerably under all conditions tested which is due to the electro flocculation phenomenon the al3 ions released by the anode reduce the repulsive forces between the negatively charged colloidal organic particles causing the flocculation of the organic compounds and consequently the formation of larger particles 33 thus the mixed liquor filterability increases shown by the improvement in mfi values to over 97 90 under all the conditions tested the minimum mfi improvement was observed when the lowest current density was applied over the shortest exposure time and the maximum improvement was obtained when the highest density was applied with the longest exposure time because higher densities provide greater dewatering of flocs which improves filterability 27 the removal of smps and epss also improves the mixed liquor filterability especially in an mbr because these substances are considered the main precursors of membrane fouling 34 due to their ability to rapidly aggregate on the membrane surface forming a dense layer 35 aluminum hydroxides formed during ec are responsible for the removal of these compounds attracting smps due to their negative liquid charge and producing organic inorganic solid compounds through electrostatic forces and adsorption 36 statistical analyses were performed to determine the optimal ec conditions to improve the mixed liquor filterability fig 6 shows the effect of the factors tested and their interactions on increasing the floc size mfi improvement and removal of smps and epss according to fig 6 the factors tested did not have a significant effect on the floc size and removal of smps and epss p 0 05 however all factors had a significant effect on mfi improvement p 0 05 fig 6 b increasing the off time negatively affected mfi improvement i e led to lower improvements increasing the

significantly affected the mfi improvement table 5 fig 7 a shows that higher current densities resulted in high mfi improvements with any mode exposure high mfi improvements also occurred at all current densities with lower off time fig 7 b shows the density as a function of ph better improvements in mfi occurred when both factors increased increased mfi improvement was observed with at higher ph values and lower off time fig 7 c the 2d surface graphs fig 7 d e and f demonstrate that the best condition tested for mfi improvement corresponds to the current density of 20 am 2 at a ph of 8 and a 6 on 18 off exposure mode the regression explains around 92 of the variability r2 0 91608 indicating the observed values fit the predicted values well for mfi improvement fig 7 g table 6 shows the optimal ec conditions for pollutant removal and improvement in filterability notable is that the optimal ec conditions for pollutant removal are different from those optimal to improve filterability a current density of 10 am 2 at a ph of 8 and 6 on 30 off exposure mode are considered optimal to achieve both a high pollutant removal efficiency and improvements in the mfi these conditions achieved a 99 51 98 56 99 04 removal rate of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod removal respectively and a 98 76 improvement in mfi the optimal conditions for improvements in filterability current

autotrophic and heterotrophic activity autotrophic and heterotrophic sour increased with the application of electric current fig 8 likely due to the electrostimulation process 13 electric currents can stimulate the activity and metabolism of microorganisms specifically the enzymes responsible for the nitrification process 26 this also explains the improvement in the nh4 n and cod removal fig 3 which according to zeyoudi et al 37 improves electron transport in the cells of microorganisms battistelli et al 17 observed similar behavior in the autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass of an smebr after the application of a 10 am 2 current with a 6 on 18 off exposure mode no negative effects on the biomass activity especially autotrophic microorganisms were observed using the optimized ec

time of 48 hours determined through bench scale experiments allowed the removal of 100 of the po4 3 p and cod and 97 98 of nh4 n a current density of 10 am 2 at ph 8 and a 6 on 30 off exposure mode were determined using factorial design to be the optimal ec conditions for both pollutant removal and filterability improvement while maintaining a high system efficiency application of an electric current favored the activity of the microorganisms especially those related to nitrification which led to a substantial increase in nh4 n removal there were no negative impacts on biomass activity and therefore these ec conditions are unlikely to adversely affect the operation of an smebr ec can therefore be considered a promising technology being able to produce a mixed liquor with low fouling potential and high quality of the effluents treated in an smebr some limitations of this technology are the expense of electrical energy the consumption of electrodes throughout the operation and the

13984,this study aims to determine optimal electrocoagulation ec operational conditions for removal of nutrients and organic matter and improving the mixed liquor filterability during municipal wastewater treatment in a submerged membrane electro bioreactor smebr first the optimal electric current exposure time for the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod was determined then different ec conditions were tested by varying the current density mode of exposure and ph using a factorial design finally the impact of the optimal conditions on biomass activity was evaluated the observed optimal operational conditions were a current density of 10 am 2 with an exposure mode of 6 on 30 off at ph 8 using these optimal conditions electrocoagulation achieved high removal efficiencies of 99 51 98 56 and 99 04 for po4 3 p nh4 n and cod respectively after 48 hours of treatment an increase in the size of the flocs under these optimal conditions improved filterability to 98 76 which reduces membrane fouling in an smebr in addition the optimized conditions increased the autotrophic and heterotrophic oxygen uptake rate demonstrating that ec can be applied in an smebr

large volumes and contains high concentrations of pollutants such as solids oils dissolved gases microorganisms and organic matter the removal of these pollutants from wastewater is difficult due to their varied characteristics which makes wastewater a potential source of environmental pollution therefore the effective treatment of wastewater before discharge is important to protect water bodies 1 biological reactors combined with membranes i e membrane bioreactors mbrs are widely used in municipal wastewater treatment 2 however mbrs have some limitations such as low phosphorus removal and membrane fouling which may cause deterioration in the effluent quality 3 4 electrocoagulation ec is an alternative treatment method that has achieved high phosphorus removal efficiencies and improvements in the filterability of the mixed liquor of wastewater in addition ec can be used in combination with other technologies such as submerged membrane electro bioreactor smebr however it is important that the ec process is optimized to compliment membrane processes 5 smebr simultaneously integrates biological process membrane filtration and electrocoagulation in a single system 6 the technology is based on the application of direct current dc in perforated electrodes anode and cathode immersed around a membrane module thus electrocoagulation and biodegradation occur along with the filtration process through a membrane providing the wastewater treatment 7 in the ec process the coagulant ions are produced in situ by applying a potential to the anodes which are typically made of aluminum or iron this process causes the oxidation and dissolution of aluminum or iron in the liquid medium which are hydrolyzed to polymeric hydroxides 8 these hydroxides have a high surface area which contributes to the adsorption of organic compounds which leads to the trapping of colloidal particles and formation of complexes which are easily removed via sedimentation flotation 9 or even membrane filtration because of the improvement in the mixed liquor filterability the electrochemical reactions that occur with a metal m at the anode and cathode are described in eqs 1 to 4 8 at the anode 1 m s m a q n n e 2 2 h 2 o l 4 h a q o 2 g 4 e at the cathode 3 m a q n n e m s 4 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h the coagulant ions generated by electrocoagulation al3 fe3 facilitate phosphorus removal due to the precipitation of phosphorus as fe3 or al3 phosphate and the adsorption of soluble phosphorus on the insoluble aluminum or iron hydroxides formed in the mixed liquor 10 11 ec has shown a high chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency due to the electrochemical oxidation of the anode which helps to transform complex molecules into more biodegradable substances that are easily assimilated by microorganisms 12 in addition the application of an electric field stimulates the metabolism and activity of microorganisms through the electrostimulation process improving the ammoniacal nitrogen removal efficiency 13 however the ec parameters must be optimized to ensure the efficiency of the process the current density and exposure time are important because high current densities can cause the inhibition of the microorganisms due to strong electrical impulses high concentrations of metal ions or changes in ph while short exposure times can decrease the pollutant removal efficiency long exposure times do not provide additional removal and can lead to increased sludge generation 14 the ph also must be controlled to allow the formation of coagulant species because at ph values greater than 9 some insoluble aluminum compounds become al oh 4 which is soluble in water reducing coagulation capacity 15 this study therefore aims to evaluate the influence of ec parameters on the removal of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod and the mixed liquor filterability to establish the optimal ec operational conditions for use in an smebr for municipal wastewater treatment current density exposure mode and ph were evaluated using a 23 factorial design the optimal conditions were evaluated for its impact on the biomass activity of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental unit five bench scale reactors with a capacity of 1 l were used an air diffuser was installed in the base of each reactor to maintain aerobic conditions and ensure adequate mixing four reactors were equipped with two rectangular electrodes 5 65 cm x 13 9 cm separated by 5 0 cm fig 1 the anode was made of flat plates of pure aluminum metal with a useful surface area of 46 335 cm2 the cathode consisted of a thin stainless steel screen the electrodes were connected to an adjustable source of dc digital power with a variable voltage and current of 0 30 v and 0 5 a respectively to control the applied current density and a control panel with timers was installed to regulate the exposure mode the system consisted of two circuits allowing the simultaneous operation of two distinct conditions in duplicate one reactor was operated in parallel without an electric current as a control fig 1 2 2 mixed liquor the mixed liquor was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in florianópolis brazil the suspended solids contents of the samples were amended to about 5000 mg l 1 by sedimentation and removal of the supernatant a similar value to that in an mbr 16 in addition the initial ammoniacal nitrogen and phosphate concentrations in all samples were standardized to approximately 15 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 by adding ammonium chloride nh4cl and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 respectively the characteristics of the standardized mixed liquor are listed in table 1 2 3 determination of the electric current exposure time to optimize the exposure time for the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and soluble cod two reactors were each inoculated with 800 ml of mixed liquor and the ec process was started at room temperature under constant aeration and mixing one reactor was operated with a current density of 10 am 2 and exposure mode of 6 on 18 off 17 which means that the current application was on for 6 minutes followed by 18 minutes off during operating time and the other control without electric current application at specified time intervals a 10 ml aliquot was taken from each reactor and vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane sartorius company br for po4 3 p nh4 n and cod analysis ec was conducted for 48 hours until almost complete removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod was achieved in the reactor with the electric current the test was performed in duplicate 2 4 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation conditions five reactors using the experimental set up shown in fig 1 were each inoculated with 800 ml of mixed liquor the ec process was run for the exposure time determined above the influence of three different values of three main parameters on the treatment was investigated these were the current density 10 15 and 20 am 2 the initial ph 6 7 and 8 and the mode of exposure that is the time minutes that the electric current was turned on off 6 on 18 off 6 on 24 off and 6 on 30 off the ph was adjusted using 1 mol l 1 solutions of sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh during operation ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity and current density were monitored three times a day at the end al 3 po4 3 p nh4 n soluble cod smps epss mfi and size of the flocs were determined a 23 factorial design with center points in triplicate was used factorial design is a technique widely used to determine the best treatment conditions when the process has two or more factors independent variables because this allows the examination of a combination of all variables at all levels with the smallest number of runs possible the technique measures the effect of the factors on selected responses dependent variables 18 the triplicate central point experiments improve the quadratic estimation and give information about the experimental central region 19 eleven experiments were performed according to the proposed factorial design with the central point in triplicate the combinations of the variables of each experiment were determined using statistical software 8 the selected responses were the concentration of soluble aluminum the percentage removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and soluble cod the concentration of soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss the percentage improvement in modified fouling index mfi and the increase in the size of the flocs the results were analyzed using statistical software 8 statsoft inc to conduct an analysis of variance anova pareto diagrams and response surface 3d and 2d graphs for each response the mathematical models were evaluated using multiple linear regression analyses the fit of the regression model was checked by the coefficient of determination r2 2 5 impact of electrocoagulation on the biomass autotrophic and heterotrophic activity the autotrophic and heterotrophic activity of the biomass was monitored using respirometric tests these were performed on mixed liquor from ec conducted using the optimal conditions determined by factorial design the respirometric tests were performed as described by iversen et al 20 two erlenmeyer flasks each containing 1 l of mixed liquor were kept under constant agitation 130 rpm and aeration 8 64 mgo2 l 1 the endogenous oxygen uptake rate our was evaluated in both respirometers after an aeration interruption ammonium chloride was added to one respirometer to obtain the autotrophic our for ammonium oxidation followed by the addition of allylthiourea atu and sodium acetate to inhibit nitrification and to obtain the heterotrophic our respectively in the other respirometer sodium nitrite was added to obtain the autotrophic our for nitrite oxidation the ours were calculated from a do slope do was recorded every 5 s using a ysi proodo these our values were normalized by the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss content to determine the values of specific oxygen uptake rate sour 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of po4 3 p nh4 n cod and al 3 were measured by spectrophotometry hach dr5000 the po4 3 p concentration was determined using the molybdovanophosphoric acid method apha 2005 cod nh4 n and al 3 were measured according to the manufacturer s instructions using the hach 8000 10031 and 8012 methods respectively tss was determined by gravimetric method ph was measured with a thermo fisher ph meter and do with an oximeter ysi 55 conductivity as well as temperature were measured with a probe hanna hi 991300 smps were obtained by mixed liquor centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0 45 μm acetate filter epss were extracted by resuspension of the sediment of the mixed liquor in 0 05 sodium chloride nacl solution using the heating method at 60 c for 30 min followed by centrifugation and filtration as performed for smps smps and epss were measured by spectrophotometry as proteins and carbohydrates according as described by lowry et al 21 and dubois et al 22 respectively to determine the mfi 250 ml of mixed liquor was filtered through a 0 45 μm acetate filter for 20 minutes at a constant pressure of 0 2 bar in a bench filtration unit to calculate the filtration flow through the filter the permeate was collected in an erlenmeyer flask positioned on an analytical balance and the mass of the permeate accumulated every 30 seconds was converted to a volume the mfi s ml 1 is the linear angular coefficient obtained by plotting the filtration time permeate volume t v data in relation to the volume accumulated v 23 the mixed liquor particle size was evaluated through laser diffraction granulometry using a mastersizer malvern 2010 analyzer this method measures the angle of diffraction when a laser beam interacts with the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the electric current exposure time fig 2 shows the percentage removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod over time after the application of an electric current a 10 am 2 current density and intermittent exposure mode of 6 min on 18 min off resulted in a removal of 100 94 20 and 100 of the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod respectively after 48 hours fig 3 shows the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod removal after 48 hours following application of an electric current compared to the control ec significantly increased the removal of po4 3 p nh4 n and cod by 77 91 58 22 and 55 42 respectively compared to the control the high efficiency of po4 3 p removal is due to the interaction of the al3 released by the anode with the soluble po4 3 generating insoluble species eq 5 8 that are easily removed by sedimentation or membrane filtration 24 in addition the adsorption of soluble po4 3 by the insoluble aluminum hydroxides formed during the electrocoagulation process eq 6 also contribute to the removal of po4 3 p 10 the high density flocs are then separated by sedimentation or by flotation through the action of gas bubbles generated at the cathode 5 a l 3 p o 4 3 a l p o 4 s 6 a l 6 o h 15 3 p o 4 3 a l 6 o h 15 p o 4 s the high nh4 n removal is due to the electrostimulation process this is where the electric current within a limited range 25 stimulates the metabolism and activity of microorganisms 13 specifically the enzymes responsible for the nitrification process ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nor 26 the high cod removal in relation to the control provided by ec is due to electrochemical oxidation this process transforms complex molecules into substances with lower molecular weights so they are more biodegradable and easily assimilated by organisms 12 in addition the al 3 ions released by the anode react with soluble organic matter providing the floc formation which also contributes to the removal of soluble cod given the excellent ec performance after 48 hours it was not considered necessary to continue the ec process for 70 hours as in a previous study 27 therefore 48 hours was adopted as the optimum time for the factorial design experiment 3 2 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation conditions a 23 factorial design and response surface graphs were used to determine the optimal ec conditions to remove pollutants from and improve the filterability of municipal wastewater 3 2 1 determination of the optimal electrocoagulation operational conditions for the removal of organic matter and nutrients table 2 shows the results of the po4 3 p nh4 n cod and al3 responses for each experiment the initial concentration of these parameters was shown in table 1 electrical conductivity was also analyzed after each test but it was not part of the statistical analysis conductivity increased in all experiments performed with respect to the initial standardized mixed liquor a possible reason for this is an increase in the ionic content of the media due to the degradation of the substrates kh2po4 and nh4cl 25 in addition the bacteria may have started the endogenous process due to not adding new substrates throughout the operation which leads to the release of soluble compounds into the medium and a consequent increase in conductivity the increase in microbial activity as seen in fig 8 also leads to greater release of soluble compounds by bacteria which also contributes to increasing the conductivity of the medium however these compounds can react with the aluminum released by the anode which explains the lower conductivity values when compared to the control between 1438 and 1742 μs cm 1 high conductivities are an advantage to the system since they provide a less energy consumption 28 when the conductivity of the medium is low a supporting electrolyte such as nacl can be added in order to contribute to its increase the presence of chloride ions in the solution also decreases the electrode s passivation and increases the efficiency of the electrocoagulation 29 while the aluminum concentrations were higher than the initial value measured in the mixed liquor they were low in all conditions tested indicating that the parameters investigated did not substantially alter the al3 released into the liquid in the ph range studied ph 6 to 8 aluminum is mostly in the form of al oh 3 which has low solubility and therefore remains in the sludge as the precipitate aluminum phosphate 15 the po4 3 p removal was high for all conditions tested showing the effectiveness of the ec process in the removal of this pollutant po4 3 p removal occurs through the interaction of soluble po4 3 with al3 and the adsorption of soluble po4 3 by metal hydroxides the nh4 n removal was 93 in most conditions tested except for experiment 2 82 the higher current density and longer exposure time applied in experiment 2 may contribute to this lower removal rate because the microorganisms responsible for nitrification are sensitive to inhibition under these conditions 14 in addition the ph of experiment 2 ph 6 was not in the optimal range for nitrification ph 7 5 8 5 30 the cod removal varied between experiments experiment 5 provided 100 removal while in experiment 2 the removal was only 27 these variations are likely due to the process conditions under favorable current densities and ph values ph 8 and cd 10 am 2 the bacteria responsible for the assimilation of organic matter achieved a very high cod removal under unfavorable conditions to the development of these organisms ph 6 and cd 20 am 2 the low cod removal could also be due to the interaction of the al 3 released by the anode and the soluble organic matter to determine the optimal ec conditions statistical analyses were performed fig 4 shows the effect of the factors tested and the interactions between them on the po4 3 p nh4 n and cod removal as well as on the soluble aluminum concentration fig 4 b and d show that the factors tested did not have a significant effect on nh4 n removal and al3 concentration p 0 05 in contrast fig 4 a and c show that the current density and ph factors had a significant effect p 0 05 on po4 3 p and cod removal moreover the interaction between both factors also affected po4 3 p removal increasing the current density positively affected po4 3 p removal and negatively affected the cod removal the higher po4 3 p removal was due to the higher aluminum concentration from the anode and low cod removal due to impairment of the bacterial activity by the high current density increasing the ph negatively impacted po4 3 p removal this is likely to be because of the precipitation of aluminum as hydroxides in contrast increasing the ph increased the cod removal rate due to the acclimation of sewage degrading bacteria to neutral or slightly basic ph values 30 the current density and ph interaction had a positive effect on po4 3 p removal the exposure mode did not significantly affect any parameters thus the choice of 6 on 30 off mode is the most appropriate because the longer off time reduces energy consumption and depreciation of the electrodes in addition a lower aluminum concentration is expected in the sludge an analysis of variance anova was performed using the po4 3 p and cod removal variables table 3 the anova results showed that the model presented for both po4 3 p and cod removal was significant f calculated f tabulated for the factors that significantly affected the po4 3 p and cod removal the 3d contour curve and 2d response surface graphs fig 5 were made by interrelating the current density and ph factors to the 6 on 30 off exposure mode to analyze the factors that significantly affected the po4 3 p and cod removal and determine the optimal ec conditions for wastewater treatment the residual distribution graph interrelates the removal values of the responses established by the model versus the values observed experimentally indicating the quality of fit of the experimental data to the model for predictive purposes 32 fig 5 a shows that the low ph values resulted in a high po4 3 p removal efficiency at any level of current density interestingly a high po4 3 p removal efficiency could be achieved at any ph value if the current density is high the best condition tested for po4 3 p removal under the 6 on 30 off exposure mode corresponds to a current density of 20 am 2 at ph 6 fig 5 c fig 5 b shows that high cod removal efficiencies can be achieved with a low current density at all ph values and at all values of current density when combined with a high ph value fig 5 d demonstrates that the best condition tested for cod removal corresponds to a current density of 10 am 2 at ph 8 and a 6 on 30 off exposure mode the r2 values for po4 3 p and cod removal were 0 89577 and 0 91152 respectively indicating that the model explains around 90 and 91 of the variability in phosphorus and cod removal respectively the residual distribution graphs fig 5 e and f which relates the values predicted by the model represented by the line and the experimentally observed values represented by the points demonstrates that the observed values are close to the line showing a strong correlation with the predicted values which indicates the goodness of fit for po4 3 p and cod removal this study shows that the best ec conditions for the removal of pollutants from municipal wastewater are a current
