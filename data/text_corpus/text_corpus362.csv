1810,the presence of seasonal surface deformation in areas that are subsiding uplifting due to groundwater pumping recovery can indicate aquifer recharge understanding seasonal surface deformation and the existing relationship between triggering factors and the deformation supports effective groundwater management and subsidence mitigation here we investigated seasonal ground displacement in response to the aquifer compaction and expansion due to groundwater extraction and recharge within the taiyuan basin northern china we obtained sentinel 1 insar displacement time series data from 2017 to 2020 and quantitatively analyzed relationships between triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and the associated displacements using wavelet based methods the results show that the seasonal deformation is concentrated in the irrigated areas within the central basin with a 1 year periodicity the annual peak to peak amplitude was up to 2 cm peaking in march with troughs in august this seasonality present in the displacement time series is found to be in phase with respect to groundwater levels and anti phase in relation to natural precipitation these results are consistent with the irrigation pumping practices in the basin with increased groundwater withdrawals to meet irrigation water demand prior to the monsoon precipitation season resulting in water level decline and land subsidence from mid march to mid august during the non irrigated season groundwater extraction decreases and the aquifer systems are replenished by precipitation causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift from late august to mid march a geological analysis indicates that the seasonal deformation is controlled by the thickness of quaternary strata and fault systems which play a critical role in forming the earth fissures in the basin the elastic and inelastic deformation was separated the estimated elastic inelastic ratio was about 0 6 0 7 indicating that the inelastic component dominates the main aquifer compaction in the central basin our analysis is of hydrologic importance which could be used to guide groundwater management and subsidence mitigation given the inter basin water diversion projects in this arid basin keywords insar land subsidence seasonal deformation wavelet analysis groundwater elastic inelastic deformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ground surface displacement can occur because of groundwater extraction and recharge in regions with active aquifer systems surface displacement is a response to the variation in pore fluid pressure due to the change in groundwater level which alters the effective stress of the granular matrix in the aquifer system leading to contraction and expansion of pore space galloway and burbey 2011 motagh et al 2017 chaussard et al 2017 when groundwater is pumped out of the aquifer the pore fluid pressures decrease and the effective stresses on the soil mass increase causing aquifer compaction and subsequent land subsidence when water is recharged naturally or artificially into the aquifer and the groundwater level rises the pore fluid pressures regain and the effective stresses on the soils are reduced causing land uplift budhu and adiyaman 2010 in general ground surface displacement due to fluid extraction from a subsurface reservoir can be described as a short term elastic or poroelastic rebound and a long term inelastic compaction galloway and burbey 2011 guzy and malinowska 2020 thus this groundwater induced displacement might exhibit signs of periodicity related to the seasonal and inter annual cycles of groundwater withdrawal and recharge space borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar can detect seasonal ground deformation associated with the seasonal changes of groundwater level lanari et al 2004 reeves et al 2011 the high spatial resolution measurements from insar revealed a detailed spatial variability of seasonality in surface deformation which was used to define the trace of fault location and to characterize aquifer properties chaussard et al 2016 the insar seasonal ground deformation maps over irrigated areas could reflect the seasonal groundwater pumping activities for irrigation purpose and support groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices tang et al 2022 the taiyuan basin is a semi arid basin located in the north of china which has been heavily relying on groundwater resources for decades and suffering severe land subsidence both ground based geodetic techniques e g leveling spirit extensometer and gps and space borne insar have been used to document ground deformation in the taiyuan basin ma et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 tang et al 2018 these previous studies have concluded that groundwater overexploitation is the main triggering factor of land subsidence in the basin to mitigate land subsidence groundwater exploitation in the taiyuan basin was strictly controlled and inter basin water diversion projects were carried out to divert surface water from the yellow river to this arid area the groundwater levels in some parts of the taiyuan basin have risen stabilizing land subsidence in the basin and even turning land subsidence to land uplift in some places tang et al 2022 the municipal governments also implemented a seasonal land fallowing program in the water intensive irrigated areas which could largely reduce the irrigation groundwater demand the seasonal land fallowing practices have a seasonal pumping on groundwater and cause a seasonal variation in water levels due to the extraction and recharge in the aquifer system how the ground surface responses to the seasonal water level changes in the taiyuan basin has not yet been investigated in addition although groundwater overdraft is the triggering factor for ground subsidence in the basin the causal relationships between factors have not been quantitatively analyzed identifying these periodicities in deformation time series and quantifying the existing relationships between triggers and measured deformation is a great challenge fourier transformed methods allows the identification of the dominant frequencies in the data sequence these approaches however does not recognize localized temporal information and time varying frequencies grinsted et al 2004 nevertheless continuous wavelet transform cwt expands data sequences into the time frequency domain which enables the identification of localized intermittent periodicities furthermore the cross wavelet transform xwt and the wavelet coherence wtc analysis allow for the identification of common power between two data sequences and quantifying their delayed relationships these wavelet based methods permit the exploration of periodicity in ground deformation and identification of time delays between triggering factors and the associated deformations in this paper we extend the previous studies of the taiyuan basin tang et al 2018 and tang et al 2022 by using higher temporal resolution of sar data from sentinel 1 satellite to resolve and analyze the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of seasonal deformation we applied the coherence based small baseline subset sbas technique berardino et al 2002 tong and schmidt 2016 to sentinel 1 sar dataset acquired between 2017 and 2020 to derive the time dependent displacements in the basin wavelet based methods including cwt xwt and wtc were used to identify seasonal variations in insar derived displacement time series and quantify the causal relationships between triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and the surface displacement the relationship between the seasonal variations of deformation and geological conditions in this basin was analyzed and the distribution of earth fissures related to the seasonal deformation was considered and the elastic inelastic nature of the displacement was investigated 2 geological background of the study area the taiyuan basin is a large scale cenozoic rift basin located in the central part of shanxi province northern china fig 1 tectonically the flat basin is bordered by taihang mountain in the east and lvliang mountain in the west it is a ne sw trending faulted basin with a length of 150 km from northeast to southwest a width of 30 40 km from northwest to southeast and a coverage area of 6000 km2 the altitude of the basin ranges from 750 to 900 m a s l and is surrounded by hills and mountains with altitudes ranging from 1000 to 3000 m a s l the geomorphology of the basin is controlled by active tectonics that the northwestern is bounded by jiaocheng fault and the southeastern basin is bounded by taigu fault the shape historical development and hydro geological conditions of the basin are controlled by these two boundary faults yan et al 2020 geologically the cenozoic strata in the basin are thick with thicknesses of about 1000 2000 m fig 2 a the exposed and deeply buried strata around the basin are mainly paleozoic ordovician carboniferous permian and triassic clastic rocks guo et al 2007 the strata at the bottom of the basin are predominantly permian and triassic sand shale and covered by tertiary and quaternary loose rock groups the quaternary strata are deeply buried the depth from the northwest 500 m to the southeast 100 200 m gradually becomes shallower see black contours in fig 1b the stratum on both sides of the concealed fault is obviously destroyed that the hanging wall descends and the degree of separation in the shallow layer is small while the degree of separation in deep layers is large as shown in the geological section i i across the basin fig 2b this indicates that the concealed faults are synsedimentary faults or growth faults peng et al 2018 sun et al 2016 in terms of hydrogeology groundwater in the basin is recharged laterally by the penetration of karst water from the surrounding mountains and vertically from the seepage of meteoric water an unconfined aquifer is in the shallow part of the basin at a buried depth of generally less than 50 m the thickness of the unconfined aquifer varies from 10 to 30 m and the medium composed of alluvial diluvial sand and gravel from late pleistocene and holocene the confined aquifer is in the middle and deep part of the basin with a buried depth of generally large than 50 m the medium in the confined aquifer is mainly composed of alluvial and lacustrine sandy pebble from middle pleistocene and lacustrine sediments from early pleistocene peng et al 2018 yan et al 2020 there exists an aquitard with a thickness of 5 30 m between the unconfined and confined aquifers making a significant difference in the water level dynamics and water quality between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifers the climate condition in the basin is arid with an annual average rainfall around 400 650 mm the interannual variation of rainfall displays a seasonal cycle mainly occurring between june and september the surface water in the basin is mostly related to the fenhe river flowing through the whole basin from north to south the blue line in fig 1b which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river taiyuan basin and even the whole shanxi province are extremely short of water resources the water resources per capita is less than 400 m3 which is only 17 of the level of national per capita and far below the international standard for acute water scarcity 500 m3 per capita as a result the structure of water consumption is very uneven as 2 3 of the water consumption depends on groundwater which has caused declines in water levels accompanied by land subsidence and ground fissures in the basin zang et al 2021 at present zones of land subsidence in the basin can be divided into four regions the subsidence area of taiyuan city in the north of the basin the subsidence area of taigu qixian pingyao wenshui jiaocheng counties in the central basin the subsidence area of qingxu jiaocheng wenshui counties in the west and the subsidence area of jiexiu xiaoyi cities in the south chen 2019 zhao and lu 2017 land subsidence was first observed in the urban area of taiyuan city in 1956 with rates up to 110 mm yr in 1980 s ma et al 2005 and has been gradually migrating to suburban areas in xiaodian and jinyuan districts in the south of the taiyuan city 3 data and methods 3 1 insar data and processing to obtain the spatial and temporal deformation in taiyuan basin we processed 94 sar images from sentinel 1 mission spanning the period from march 2017 to april 2020 these data are regularly acquired with a temporal interval of 12 days which is sufficient to resolve seasonal annual and semi annual signals present in the deformation time series the footprint of the processing area covering taiyuan basin from sentinel 1 image is shown in fig 1b sar images acquired in c band are strongly decorrelated by agricultural activity or by vegetated surfaces within the basin the short revisit time of sentinel 1 sar acquisitions can mitigate this effect we used the open source gmtsar software sandwell et al 2011 xu et al 2017 to generate 288 interferograms fig 3 with a threshold of perpendicular baseline of 100 m and a threshold of temporal baseline of 50 days topographic phase contribution in each interferogram were subtracted using a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m from srtm farr et al 2007 to reduce speckle noise the interferograms were down sampled 8 pixels in range and 2 pixels in azimuth and filtered by a gaussian filter with a 0 5 gain at a wavelength of 200 m in azimuth and ground range two dimensional phase unwrapping to recover unambiguous phase data were implemented by the statistical cost network flow algorithm for phase unwrapping snaphu chen and zebker 2001 we used a threshold of 0 12 from coherence map to mask out noisy pixels such as over water bodies or densely vegetated regions while unwrapping the interferograms the long wavelength phase ramps due to imprecise orbital information were removed by fitting a two dimensional linear plane for each interferogram the line of sight los displacement time series were extracted from the unwrapped interferograms by a coherence based sbas method tong and schmidt 2016 this method differs from the traditional sbas berardino et al 2002 in that it solves for the displacement time series at every pixel by taking coherence as weights in the least square inversion the pixels with low coherence are kept in the processing chain and will be down weighted in the analysis making the noise in the input data less sensitive to matrix inversion and resulting in a spatially coherent signal with dense pixels the topography related component of tropospheric delays usually exhibits systematic seasonal variations and may obscure the seasonal displacement signals dong et al 2019 tang et al 2018 the conventional insar time series methods handle the mitigation of tropospheric delay with a spatial temporal filtering by treating the delay simply as a random behavior in time we addressed the issue of seasonal tropospheric delay by combing gacos generic atmospheric correction online service yu et al 2018 and a common point stacking method tymofyeyeva and fialko 2015 this method corrects the long wavelength and topography related components of tropospheric delay for each interferogram by using gacos thus transforming the residual delays into a more randomly distributed behavior over time this helps satisfy the assumptions that atmospheric effects are temporally uncorrelated in insar time series analysis tang et al 2022 which were further reduced by the common point stacking method the displacement velocity was finally obtained from the linear regression of the solved displacement time series 3 2 cgps groundwater level and precipitation data the surveying and mapping department in shanxi province has constructed a cgps network across the administrative region in the province since 2009 which is consisted of 67 stations zeng et al 2012 this cgps network is multipurpose such as for maintaining geodetic reference frame monitoring crustal deformation and climate research measurements from eight cgps stations within the taiyuan basin see the locations in fig 1b are used to validate insar derived displacements in our study the details of the processing strategy of the cgps data and 3d displacement time series for each station can be found in tang et al 2018 zeng et al 2012 the daily cgps observations are available from 2016 to 2019 and overlapped with some parts of the sentinel 1 dataset we compare the insar derived displacements with the cgps measurements in section 4 1 groundwater level data recorded in the confined aquifer at four water wells within the basin were acquired from china earthquake networks center cenc see their locations in fig 1b as marked with ty qx xy and jx the depths of water wells vary from 315 m to 765 78 m yan et al 2020 fig 4 shows the geochronology and lithology of the aquifer at these four wells rock types in the aquifer system for each well are primarily sandstone or consolidated sand gravel groundwater level data were recorded at 1 minute sampling intervals from may 2007 to november 2020 we resampled the time series of water level data by moving average into a daily interval and evaluated the seasonal ground displacement in response to the seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater level in section 4 daily precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg were acquired through giovanni https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni the precipitation data were used to assess the groundwater recharge and its relationship with ground surface displacement in section 4 3 3 insar seasonal displacement modeling ground surface displacements can be divided into three components a linear trend a seasonal variation and an irregular residual the long term lowering in groundwater level causes the consolidation of fine grained sediments which leads to the linear component of land subsidence and is mainly inelastic the seasonal component of displacement is caused by the seasonal cycle of groundwater discharge and recharge in the aquifer system thus we modeled the insar displacement time series y t as 1 y t y 0 v t k 1 2 a k sin 2 π k t b k cos 2 π k ε t where t is the time in units of years v is the linear velocity and y 0 is a constant a k and b k are the coefficients of the periodic motion where k 1 indicates the annual terms and k 2 indicates the semi annual terms the last term ε t represents errors which are independent identically distributed and random with e ε 0 the model with the unknown coefficients y y 0 v a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 t is a linear system as 2 y a x ε the best linear unbiased estimates of the unknown parameters can be solved by least square algorithm as 3 x a t a 1 a t y finally the annual k 1 and semi annual k 2 amplitudes a k and phase k can be calculated as 4 s k 2 c k 2 k tan 1 s k c k k 1 2 3 4 wavelet transform analysis insar derived displacement time series can be further examined with wavelet methods to understand the time varying features and to quantify the causal relationships between the measured displacement and the triggering factors the cwt method expands time series data to the time frequency domain and therefore provides information on the temporal persistence of periodicities the xwt and wtc allow the identification of the common power spectra and wavelet coherence between two time series datasets grinsted et al 2004 tomaoós et al 2020 respectively the cwt is a convolution of the time series data with a scaled and translated version of the mother wavelet ψ 0 η as follows 5 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where n is the data series length s is the wavelet scale δ t is the sampling interval n is the localized time index the most used mother wavelet in geophysical applications is the morlet wavelet which is defined as 6 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where η and ω 0 are the non dimensional time and frequency parameter the wavelet power spectrum is defined as w n x s 2 which conveys information on periodicities at different time scales the xwt is extended from the cwt method which reveals the spatio temporal interactions between two sets of data and quantifies their coordination either the phase relationships or the time lag effects the xwt of two data sequences e g x and y is the product of w x s with the complex conjugate of w y s as follow 7 w xy s w x s w y s w xy s e i δ φ j s where w x s and w y s are the cwt of each data sequence and represents complex conjugate w xy s is the cross wavelet power and δ φ j s is the relative phase that represents a time lag effect between the two time series the xwt is hence very useful for investigating the delayed response between the cause and the effect additionally the relative phase δ φ j s in radians can be converted into time lag in unit of days or years 8 δ t δ φ j s t 2 π where t is the periodicity of the data sequence the wtc characterizes the coherence values range from 0 to 1 between cwts of two individual data sequence which can be expressed as 9 r n 2 s s s 1 w xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator in the time frequency domain where the two cwts have similar wavelet coherence the value r n 2 s will be high close to 1 the proposed methodology here is to apply these wavelet tools cwt xwt and wtc to comprehensively investigate the periodicity of the ground deformation time series and its potential triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and quantitatively analyze their cause effect relationships the input data sequence for wavelet methods must be uniformly sampled in time although sar acquisitions from sentinel 1 have a regular repeating time 12 days in our study some acquisitions may be missing or excluded from interferometric processing due to the decorrelated effects therefore the missing values were linearly interpolated into equally spaced in time using the sentinel 1 revisit interval of 12 days the interpolated displacement time series were then separated into linear and non linear components the potential triggering factors such as groundwater level and precipitation were collected with a higher time frequency 1 day in our study than the displacement time series derived from insar consequently we down sampled the groundwater level and precipitation data time series to the revisiting time interval of the sentinel 1 data i e 12 days the wavelet methods were applied to the evenly sampled data to investigate the seasonal ground deformation and the time lags between seasonal variations in displacements and the triggering factors the flowchart of this procedure can be found in fig 5 4 results and analysis 4 1 insar displacement velocity map in taiyuan basin the los velocity obtained from sentinel 1 data by the coherence based sbas method is shown in fig 6 a we referenced the displacement to a 100 m window collocated with the cgps station k001 which is in the urban area of jinzhong city with high coherence and exhibiting stable ground motion the short revisit time of the sentinel 1 acquisitions combined with the coherence based sbas algorithm help mitigate decorrelated effects in the basin we validated the obtained insar results by comparing the los displacements with measurements from seven cgps stations in the basin except the reference station k001 this validation was performed by comparing their displacement time series fig 6b cumulative displacements fig 6c and velocities fig 6d the three component east north and up cgps displacements were projected onto the los direction using the look vector components for each station the trends of each time series matched in that the rmse of cumulative displacements was 8 mm and the rmse of velocities was 5 mm yr although the time periods between insar and cgps were not the same these comparisons demonstrate a good agreement between these two techniques spatial analysis of the insar displacement map indicates that land subsidence is concentrated in the central and southern parts of the basin marked by dashed green ellipses in fig 6a a subsidence bowl can be easily identified in the south of taiyuan city which covers an area of approximately 100 km2 this subsidence center is in xiaodian district a new economic development zone where extensive groundwater is used for the rapid economic growth that results in the significant subsidence with a maximum rate of 80 mm yr in the central basin along the fenhe riverbanks the land is mainly covered by agricultural crops tang et al 2018 farmers draw a large amount of water to meet irrigation demand from underlying aquifers causing widespread subsidence throughout the central basin the peak of the subsidence in this region is as high as 82 mm yr in the southern edge of the basin land subsidence occurred in the suburban area between jiexiu and xiaoyi city which matches perfectly with the groundwater depression cone in that area the dark red contours in fig 6a confirming that groundwater overexploitation is the primary driving factor of land subsidence land uplift can be found in several areas in the basin marked by solid blue ellipses in fig 6a the uplifts are concentrated in the urban center of taiyuan city in the northern part of the basin where significant land subsidence occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 s at a rate of up to 110 mm year ma et al 2005 we observed the rates of uplift about 14 mm yr during the study period this uplift behavior is confirmed from cgps measurements at stations a001 and a008 see fig 6b the observed land uplift is the elastic relaxation of the compacted aquifer system related to the regained fluid pore pressure due to groundwater recovery a phenomenon referred to as elastic or poroelastic rebound galloway and burbey 2011 since 2003 the wanjiazhai water diversion wwd project has been implemented to divert water from yellow river to taiyuan city which has supplied 1 219 billion m3 of water to taiyuan for household and ecological restoration by the end of 2018 at the same time an integrated groundwater management program was implemented to strictly control groundwater pumping in these circumstances the amount of groundwater usage has largely reduced and groundwater levels have recovered which can be observed at ty well station in fig 8 a that the groundwater level increased by about 22 m between 2007 and 2020 two localized uplifting areas were found in the western edge of the basin one in qingxu county northwest of cgps a002 station with an average rate of 10 mm yr and one in jiaocheng county north of cgps j005 station with an average rate of 6 mm yr the surface displacement caused by groundwater overexploitation is mainly in the vertical direction galloway and burbey 2011 tang et al 2018 hence in the subsequent analysis we directly projected the insar los displacement into the vertical direction by d v d los c o s θ where θ is the incidence angle of radar waves 4 2 seasonal amplitude and phase maps of ground deformation in the basin annual or seasonal uplift may occur in response to natural replenishment of aquifers during times of high precipitation and reflect as a variation in the piezometric head these observations are critical in groundwater management because they indicate that the aquifer maintains some capacity to regain storage capability chaussard et al 2017 riel et al 2018 here we investigated possible annual and seasonal signals in the displacement time series from insar by assuming the ground displacement can be expressed as a combination of seasonal and linear trend as indicated in equation 1 we estimated the sinusoidal coefficients for each pixel using equation 3 and generated seasonal amplitude and phase maps using equation 4 the estimated maps of annual and semi annual amplitude and phase are shown in fig 7 the measurements with high spatial resolution from insar allow us to evaluate the spatial variability of the seasonal signals which is an advantage over the sparse cgps network within the basin fig 7 shows that the seasonal displacement is concentrated within the central region of the basin where groundwater has been pumping for agricultural irrigation we observed two zones of peaks in the annual amplitudes on either side of the fenhe river encircled with the white dashed lines in fig 7a with a maximum amplitude of 2 cm on the eastern bank of the river and 1 cm on the western bank the semi annual signal is primarily present on the eastern bank of the river fig 7c with a maximum amplitude of 0 5 cm which is very small compared to the annual signals 4 3 cwt results of groundwater level ground displacement and precipitation fig 8 shows the cwt power spectra of groundwater level changes spanning 2007 2020 at the four groundwater wells in taiyuan basin from the groundwater time series we observed water level rise at ty well in the north of the basin with a large rate of 2 3 m yr and at qx well in the central basin with a slight rate of 0 6 m yr while we observed groundwater decline in the south of the basin with a large declining rate of 3 m yr at xy well and a slight rate of 0 3 m yr at jx well at qx well it is interesting that a seasonal cycle of groundwater level was clearly modulated in the long term rising trend from the analysis of the cwt power spectrum at qx well in fig 8b this seasonal pattern with a period of one year was clearly identified this seasonal pattern is related to the annual cycle of groundwater withdrawal and recharge in the central basin several semi annual processes were also found at this well but they exhibited intermittency throughout the cwt localized around time intervals of 2010 2012 2015 2016 and 2017 2019 both ty and jx wells exhibited an intermittent signal at the annual band but their maximum powers localized in different time intervals which are around 2007 2013 and 2017 2020 at ty and around 2009 2011 and 2017 2020 at jx the water level at xy well did not show any significant seasonal variations arid and semi arid areas of the taiyuan basin is affected by climate change that the annual precipitation has been decreasing in the basin since the 1950 s shao et al 2017 the reduce of rainfall can affect the hydrological cycle reducing surface water and increasing extraction on groundwater which thus leads to further land subsidence the daily precipitation data at these four well locations obtained from gpm were resampled to a monthly scale and the cwt power spectra are presented in fig 9 we found a dominant 1 year period in relation to the monsoons throughout the observation interval several patterns with periodicity at 0 125 0 5 year are also clearly noted at these wells which correspond to semi annual signals in the temporal variability of the rainfall the seasonality observed in the precipitation data can be explained by the typical continental monsoon climate with an annual total precipitation less than 500 mm and about 60 is concentrated in june september in the study area the ground displacement time series at the four water wells and their cwt power spectra are shown in fig 10 as shown the ground in the north of the basin in taiyuan city also see the velocity map in fig 6 is experiencing uplift with a rate of 14 mm yr due to the groundwater level rise in this region see groundwater level at ty in fig 8 the south of the basin exhibits significant land subsidence with similar rates of 28 mm yr at xy and jx wells following the groundwater level decline albeit the declining rate of groundwater at jx well 0 3 m yr is much smaller than that at xy well 3 m yr in the central basin we observed land subsidence at well qx at a modest rate of 20 mm yr even though the groundwater is rising at this location this inconsistency suggests that the continuous subsidence is driven mainly by the sustained groundwater pumping over the past decades interestingly a seasonal cycle of up and down can be clearly observed in the displacement time series at qx which is related to the changes of groundwater associated with the seasonal water pumping recharge as mentioned earlier this seasonal process in displacement time series with a 1 year period can be recognized from the cwt power spectrum in fig 10b similar regions with high wavelet power at the period of 1 year are recognized for the other well stations although their vibration amplitudes are much lower than that at qx well additionally at ty xy and jx wells a power signal with a period of 3 to 4 months can be observed during 2018 2019 the observed cyclic displacements from insar can be related with groundwater level fluctuations or seasonal variations of rainfall this causal relationship will be investigated through cross wavelet analysis in the next section 4 4 xwt results between displacement groundwater level and precipitation to quantify the causal relationships between seasonal variations of groundwater level precipitation and ground deformation xwt and wtc were applied to these data sequences groundwater pumping is a well known triggering factor of land subsidence so we first analyzed the relationship between displacements and groundwater level changes fig 11 shows the xwt and wtc between insar displacements and groundwater levels at the four water wells we observed a high common power between displacement and groundwater level time series approximately at the period of one year for the whole study period 2017 2020 at all these four wells however the time lag effects vary at different locations displacement was in anti phase with groundwater level in the north of the basin at ty well phase shift δ φ 202 corresponding to a time lag of 205 days fig 11a whereas it was in phase with groundwater level in the central basin at qx well δ φ 3 corresponding to a time lag of 3 days fig 11b in the south of the basin the displacement is lagging the groundwater at xy well by about 102 days δ φ 101 fig 11c while the displacement is leading the groundwater at jx well by about 40 days δ φ 39 fig 11d the heterogeneous time lag effects between ground deformation and groundwater levels at these four wells reveal the lateral variability in the thickness of aquifer aquitard and piezometric head across the basin in heterogeneous aquifer systems the delayed responses between surface deformation due to aquifer compaction and underground water levels is attributed to the delayed equilibration of pore fluid pressure between the aquifers mainly composed of unconsolidated permeable coarse grained deposit such as sands and gravels and aquitards mainly composed of low permeability fine grained deposit such as silts and clays galloway et al 2000 galloway and burbey 2011 in aquifer systems with thick aquitards this lagged response can be on a time scale of years to decades or more as can be seen in fig 4 the qx well in the central basin has the thickest clay unit in the aquifer system the short time delay three days observed between water levels and ground deformation at this well implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on the delayed compaction of aquifer systems at other well stations the time delays are longer due to their smaller thickness of fine grained silts and clays with lower permeability this signal is of hydrologic importance and could be used to assess groundwater recharge and usage groundwater in the aquifer system is replenished or recharged by rainfall and snow melt that seep down into the pores or cracks of the soil and rocks beneath the land s surface the interaction between groundwater and precipitation is crucial to better understand the hydrological processes and water resources management the xwt between groundwater level and precipitation was carried out to analyze its resonance period and phase relationships fig 12 a high common power between groundwater level and precipitation was found at approximately a 1 year period throughout the observation period the xwt and wtc also show that water level and precipitation is in anti phase at ty δ φ 205 corresponding to a time lag of 208 days qx δ φ 228 corresponding to a time lag of 232 days and xy δ φ 259 corresponding to a time lag of 263 days these anti phase relationships agree with the pumping practices in the basin that groundwater pumping is increased before the monsoon precipitation season to meet irrigation water demand during the major crop growing period march to august groundwater declines due to the pumping for irrigation and drops to the lowest level during times of high precipitation august september the water from rainfall is stored and supplies to the crops and groundwater pumping is reduced with groundwater replenished from rainfall and snow melt the water level increases during the non monsoon season and reaches to its highest level during january march rainfall affects the intensity of groundwater pumping and recharge where the amount of groundwater extraction is larger than the amount of recharge during dry weather while the opposite during wet seasons the increased groundwater pumping during seasons with less precipitation will cause more land subsidence if groundwater extraction reduces during seasons with high precipitation and groundwater recharges later a small amount of land uplift could occur due to the regained pore fluid pressure in the aquifer system the plots of the xwt and wtc analysis between displacement and precipitation are shown in fig 13 a high significant power can be observed for a 1 year period at these four water wells covering almost for the entire study period note that precipitation and ground deformation is in phase at ty δ φ 51 corresponding to a time lag of 52 days xy δ φ 15 corresponding to a time lag of 15 days and jx wells δ φ 4 corresponding to time lag of 4 days while this relationship is anti phase at qx well δ φ 128 corresponding to time lag of 130 days this fact agrees with the agriculture irrigated activities as groundwater pumping was encouraged during the high precipitation months in the central region of the basin as discussed earlier 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal deformation in relation to geological conditions the insar time series reveal two different time scales of groundwater related surface displacements in the taiyuan basin which reflects two different deformation processes due to groundwater discharge and recharge the long term trend of land subsidence is consistent with aquitard drainage model galloway et al 2000 gambolati and teatini 2021 that the inelastic compaction is not entirely compensated by the elastic rebound during aquifer recharge the second time scale of short term deformation relates to the annual groundwater level variations in the basin as reflected in the maps of seasonal amplitude and phase delay in fig 7 we superimposed the thickness of quaternary strata and the developed earth fissures onto the annual amplitude and phase delay maps of ground deformation as shown in fig 14 the seasonal pattern is present in taigu qixian counties in the central basin and concentrated in the irrigated area this similar pattern is also found in groundwater level data at qx well around this area earth fissures are widely developed in the central basin around the taigu qixian area which is spatially correlated with the seasonal deformation patterns as can be seen in fig 14 it indicates that the seasonal ground deformation plays a critical role in forming earth fissures especially around the transition areas with large gradients in seasonal amplitudes where differential subsidence is more likely to occur the thickness of quaternary strata at northwestern border of the basin is large than 500 m and it gradually becomes thinner from northwest to southeast the area with large seasonal amplitudes in the eastern bank of fenhe river is located on the southeastern side of the taihang mountain where the thickness of the quaternary strata varies between 200 and 400 m and the lithology is mainly fine sand silt and silty clay meng et al 2019 peng et al 2018 the thickness of the quaternary strata changed rapidly in the discontinuous transition zones of the amplitude phase maps see the profiles of i i and ii ii which suggests that the thickness of quaternary strata plays a critical role in the diffusion of piezometric head in the aquifer system we also found sharp discontinuities in the seasonal amplitude and phase delay across fault systems within the basin indicating that the faults act as an effective barrier to lateral groundwater flow this effect can be clearly found at faults f2 and f3 along the profiles of the annual amplitude fig 14c and e for the discontinuity across the faults the difference in the seasonal annual amplitude between each side of the fault could be as high as 15 mm this across fault discontinuous pattern can also be found in phase delay map where the ground west of the longjiaying fault f2 has a peak signal in may and the ground east of the f2 has a peak signal in february 5 2 elastic and inelastic deformation in response to changes in groundwater in the central basin the short term seasonal variations in ground displacement observed in the insar time series follows well with the aquifer extraction recovery cycles fig 15 the high summer demand for irrigation water combined with the normally wet summer causes groundwater levels to fluctuate in response to the seasonal cycle of pumping and recharge the displacement time series of the points p1 and p2 with the most significant seasonal signals on the east and west banks of fenhe river clearly show that the seasonal elastic displacement is embedded in the long term trend of land subsidence fig 15g h we found that the vertical deformation at these two points has an annual cycle with a peak in march and a trough in august the point p1 on the east bank of fenhe river shows greater subsidence and seasonal effects a subsidence rate of 47 mm yr and an annual amplitude of 22 7 mm than the point p2 on the west bank of the river with a subsidence rate of 18 mm yr and an annual amplitude of 11 8 mm the relationship between vertical deformation and the duration of the extraction recovery phases was analyzed we divided the groundwater and displacement time series into three extraction recovery cycles as shown in fig 15i we estimated the cycle temporal ratio tr and the uplift subsidence ratio sr for each cycle as suggested by ezquerro et al 2014 the tr represents the relationship between the duration of the groundwater recovery t recov over the duration of the extraction t extract i e t recov t extract the sr expressed in percentage corresponds to the ratio between land uplift d uplift during groundwater recovery with respect to land subsidence d subs during groundwater extraction i e d uplift d subs the groundwater extraction phase is from mid march to mid august duration of 5 months and the recovery is from the late august to the next mid march duration of 7 months therefore the tr is 1 4 the tr ratio remains constant over time as can be seen from the seasonal variations of water level at qx well in fig 15i which indicates the relatively constant practices of the annual cycle of groundwater withdrawal and recharge during this period the subsidence and uplift during different extraction recovery phases and their sr are listed in table 1 the average sr is 33 for p1 and 46 7 for p2 suggesting that for this aquifer system the land uplift due to aquifer recovery compensated less than 50 of the previous subsidence during extraction phases although the land subsidence uplift behavior corresponds well to the extraction recovery cycles subsidence and uplift related to groundwater decline and rise respectively were not proportional to changes of groundwater level take p1 location for an example groundwater levels declined 25 8 m corresponding with 218 1 mm of land subsidence cumulative subsidence from march 2017 to march 2020 while groundwater level recovered 25 2 m with a corresponding uplift of only 70 2 mm the ratio of the change in deformation to the change in groundwater level for the declining portion is 8 mm m which is much larger than the ratio for the water level rising portion i e 3 mm m indicating the dominant part of land subsidence is inelastic we further estimated the elastic inelastic deformation ratio r ed i d the long term trend of displacement is considered as the inelastic component and the short term fluctuations of deformation as the elastic component values higher than 1 represent a dominant part of elastic deformation values lower than 1 represent a dominant part of inelastic deformation the trend of the displacement time series on the east bank of the river for pixels with annual amplitude higher than 5 mm and subsidence rates higher than 20 mm yr shows an average subsidence rate of 30 mm yr and fluctuates by 10 mm on the west bank of the river the average subsidence rate is 22 mm yr and the fluctuation is 7 mm the elastic inelastic ratio is approximately 0 66 for the east bank and 0 63 for the west bank between 2017 and 2020 this ratio further confirms the presence of predominantly inelastic deformation in the central basin 6 conclusion in this work we investigated the seasonality of ground displacement in taiyuan basin derived from sentinel 1 insar data and quantified the causal relationships between insar derived seasonal displacements groundwater level and precipitation time series using wavelet based methods cwt xwt and wtc the seasonal variations in ground displacement caused by seasonal groundwater level changes are related to irrigation pumping activities in the central basin this seasonal displacement is characterized by a 1 year period with an annual peak to peak amplitudes of 2 cm with peaks in march and troughs in august using the xwt method we found the seasonal variations present in the displacement time series are in phase with respect to groundwater levels and anti phase to natural precipitation these relationships agree with the irrigation pumping practice in the basin groundwater extraction increases for irrigation from mid march to mid august prior to the monsoon precipitation season resulting in water levels decline and land subsidence during this period during the non irrigated season from late august to mid march groundwater extraction decreases and aquifers are replenished by precipitation causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift the relatively short time delay three days observed between deformation and water level in the central basin implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on the delayed compaction of aquifer systems the seasonal deformation is correlated with the thickness of quaternary strata and fault systems which plays a critical role in the development of earth fissures in the basin our analysis of the central basin shows that the irreversible deformation is likely to be dominant in this area that the elastic inelastic deformation ratio is approximately 0 6 0 7 our results have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of land subsidence and the subsequent design and adoption of subsidence mitigation measures especially the measures on groundwater management for sustainable development in this arid region sentinel 1 mission provides regular data acquisition with high temporal resolution of 6 12 days which helps better reveal seasonal variations in displacement time series the wavelet based methods can be further exploited to identify and quantify causal relationships between insar derived ground deformation and groundwater level which helps improve the numerical models on land subsidence however we must bear in mind that wavelet based methods do not unravel the underlying physical mechanism of land subsidence and additional hydrogeological information and analysis are needed to fully explain the mechanism of the relationship between land subsidence and its triggering factors tomaoós et al 2020

1810,the presence of seasonal surface deformation in areas that are subsiding uplifting due to groundwater pumping recovery can indicate aquifer recharge understanding seasonal surface deformation and the existing relationship between triggering factors and the deformation supports effective groundwater management and subsidence mitigation here we investigated seasonal ground displacement in response to the aquifer compaction and expansion due to groundwater extraction and recharge within the taiyuan basin northern china we obtained sentinel 1 insar displacement time series data from 2017 to 2020 and quantitatively analyzed relationships between triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and the associated displacements using wavelet based methods the results show that the seasonal deformation is concentrated in the irrigated areas within the central basin with a 1 year periodicity the annual peak to peak amplitude was up to 2 cm peaking in march with troughs in august this seasonality present in the displacement time series is found to be in phase with respect to groundwater levels and anti phase in relation to natural precipitation these results are consistent with the irrigation pumping practices in the basin with increased groundwater withdrawals to meet irrigation water demand prior to the monsoon precipitation season resulting in water level decline and land subsidence from mid march to mid august during the non irrigated season groundwater extraction decreases and the aquifer systems are replenished by precipitation causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift from late august to mid march a geological analysis indicates that the seasonal deformation is controlled by the thickness of quaternary strata and fault systems which play a critical role in forming the earth fissures in the basin the elastic and inelastic deformation was separated the estimated elastic inelastic ratio was about 0 6 0 7 indicating that the inelastic component dominates the main aquifer compaction in the central basin our analysis is of hydrologic importance which could be used to guide groundwater management and subsidence mitigation given the inter basin water diversion projects in this arid basin keywords insar land subsidence seasonal deformation wavelet analysis groundwater elastic inelastic deformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ground surface displacement can occur because of groundwater extraction and recharge in regions with active aquifer systems surface displacement is a response to the variation in pore fluid pressure due to the change in groundwater level which alters the effective stress of the granular matrix in the aquifer system leading to contraction and expansion of pore space galloway and burbey 2011 motagh et al 2017 chaussard et al 2017 when groundwater is pumped out of the aquifer the pore fluid pressures decrease and the effective stresses on the soil mass increase causing aquifer compaction and subsequent land subsidence when water is recharged naturally or artificially into the aquifer and the groundwater level rises the pore fluid pressures regain and the effective stresses on the soils are reduced causing land uplift budhu and adiyaman 2010 in general ground surface displacement due to fluid extraction from a subsurface reservoir can be described as a short term elastic or poroelastic rebound and a long term inelastic compaction galloway and burbey 2011 guzy and malinowska 2020 thus this groundwater induced displacement might exhibit signs of periodicity related to the seasonal and inter annual cycles of groundwater withdrawal and recharge space borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar can detect seasonal ground deformation associated with the seasonal changes of groundwater level lanari et al 2004 reeves et al 2011 the high spatial resolution measurements from insar revealed a detailed spatial variability of seasonality in surface deformation which was used to define the trace of fault location and to characterize aquifer properties chaussard et al 2016 the insar seasonal ground deformation maps over irrigated areas could reflect the seasonal groundwater pumping activities for irrigation purpose and support groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices tang et al 2022 the taiyuan basin is a semi arid basin located in the north of china which has been heavily relying on groundwater resources for decades and suffering severe land subsidence both ground based geodetic techniques e g leveling spirit extensometer and gps and space borne insar have been used to document ground deformation in the taiyuan basin ma et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 tang et al 2018 these previous studies have concluded that groundwater overexploitation is the main triggering factor of land subsidence in the basin to mitigate land subsidence groundwater exploitation in the taiyuan basin was strictly controlled and inter basin water diversion projects were carried out to divert surface water from the yellow river to this arid area the groundwater levels in some parts of the taiyuan basin have risen stabilizing land subsidence in the basin and even turning land subsidence to land uplift in some places tang et al 2022 the municipal governments also implemented a seasonal land fallowing program in the water intensive irrigated areas which could largely reduce the irrigation groundwater demand the seasonal land fallowing practices have a seasonal pumping on groundwater and cause a seasonal variation in water levels due to the extraction and recharge in the aquifer system how the ground surface responses to the seasonal water level changes in the taiyuan basin has not yet been investigated in addition although groundwater overdraft is the triggering factor for ground subsidence in the basin the causal relationships between factors have not been quantitatively analyzed identifying these periodicities in deformation time series and quantifying the existing relationships between triggers and measured deformation is a great challenge fourier transformed methods allows the identification of the dominant frequencies in the data sequence these approaches however does not recognize localized temporal information and time varying frequencies grinsted et al 2004 nevertheless continuous wavelet transform cwt expands data sequences into the time frequency domain which enables the identification of localized intermittent periodicities furthermore the cross wavelet transform xwt and the wavelet coherence wtc analysis allow for the identification of common power between two data sequences and quantifying their delayed relationships these wavelet based methods permit the exploration of periodicity in ground deformation and identification of time delays between triggering factors and the associated deformations in this paper we extend the previous studies of the taiyuan basin tang et al 2018 and tang et al 2022 by using higher temporal resolution of sar data from sentinel 1 satellite to resolve and analyze the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of seasonal deformation we applied the coherence based small baseline subset sbas technique berardino et al 2002 tong and schmidt 2016 to sentinel 1 sar dataset acquired between 2017 and 2020 to derive the time dependent displacements in the basin wavelet based methods including cwt xwt and wtc were used to identify seasonal variations in insar derived displacement time series and quantify the causal relationships between triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and the surface displacement the relationship between the seasonal variations of deformation and geological conditions in this basin was analyzed and the distribution of earth fissures related to the seasonal deformation was considered and the elastic inelastic nature of the displacement was investigated 2 geological background of the study area the taiyuan basin is a large scale cenozoic rift basin located in the central part of shanxi province northern china fig 1 tectonically the flat basin is bordered by taihang mountain in the east and lvliang mountain in the west it is a ne sw trending faulted basin with a length of 150 km from northeast to southwest a width of 30 40 km from northwest to southeast and a coverage area of 6000 km2 the altitude of the basin ranges from 750 to 900 m a s l and is surrounded by hills and mountains with altitudes ranging from 1000 to 3000 m a s l the geomorphology of the basin is controlled by active tectonics that the northwestern is bounded by jiaocheng fault and the southeastern basin is bounded by taigu fault the shape historical development and hydro geological conditions of the basin are controlled by these two boundary faults yan et al 2020 geologically the cenozoic strata in the basin are thick with thicknesses of about 1000 2000 m fig 2 a the exposed and deeply buried strata around the basin are mainly paleozoic ordovician carboniferous permian and triassic clastic rocks guo et al 2007 the strata at the bottom of the basin are predominantly permian and triassic sand shale and covered by tertiary and quaternary loose rock groups the quaternary strata are deeply buried the depth from the northwest 500 m to the southeast 100 200 m gradually becomes shallower see black contours in fig 1b the stratum on both sides of the concealed fault is obviously destroyed that the hanging wall descends and the degree of separation in the shallow layer is small while the degree of separation in deep layers is large as shown in the geological section i i across the basin fig 2b this indicates that the concealed faults are synsedimentary faults or growth faults peng et al 2018 sun et al 2016 in terms of hydrogeology groundwater in the basin is recharged laterally by the penetration of karst water from the surrounding mountains and vertically from the seepage of meteoric water an unconfined aquifer is in the shallow part of the basin at a buried depth of generally less than 50 m the thickness of the unconfined aquifer varies from 10 to 30 m and the medium composed of alluvial diluvial sand and gravel from late pleistocene and holocene the confined aquifer is in the middle and deep part of the basin with a buried depth of generally large than 50 m the medium in the confined aquifer is mainly composed of alluvial and lacustrine sandy pebble from middle pleistocene and lacustrine sediments from early pleistocene peng et al 2018 yan et al 2020 there exists an aquitard with a thickness of 5 30 m between the unconfined and confined aquifers making a significant difference in the water level dynamics and water quality between the phreatic aquifer and the confined aquifers the climate condition in the basin is arid with an annual average rainfall around 400 650 mm the interannual variation of rainfall displays a seasonal cycle mainly occurring between june and september the surface water in the basin is mostly related to the fenhe river flowing through the whole basin from north to south the blue line in fig 1b which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river taiyuan basin and even the whole shanxi province are extremely short of water resources the water resources per capita is less than 400 m3 which is only 17 of the level of national per capita and far below the international standard for acute water scarcity 500 m3 per capita as a result the structure of water consumption is very uneven as 2 3 of the water consumption depends on groundwater which has caused declines in water levels accompanied by land subsidence and ground fissures in the basin zang et al 2021 at present zones of land subsidence in the basin can be divided into four regions the subsidence area of taiyuan city in the north of the basin the subsidence area of taigu qixian pingyao wenshui jiaocheng counties in the central basin the subsidence area of qingxu jiaocheng wenshui counties in the west and the subsidence area of jiexiu xiaoyi cities in the south chen 2019 zhao and lu 2017 land subsidence was first observed in the urban area of taiyuan city in 1956 with rates up to 110 mm yr in 1980 s ma et al 2005 and has been gradually migrating to suburban areas in xiaodian and jinyuan districts in the south of the taiyuan city 3 data and methods 3 1 insar data and processing to obtain the spatial and temporal deformation in taiyuan basin we processed 94 sar images from sentinel 1 mission spanning the period from march 2017 to april 2020 these data are regularly acquired with a temporal interval of 12 days which is sufficient to resolve seasonal annual and semi annual signals present in the deformation time series the footprint of the processing area covering taiyuan basin from sentinel 1 image is shown in fig 1b sar images acquired in c band are strongly decorrelated by agricultural activity or by vegetated surfaces within the basin the short revisit time of sentinel 1 sar acquisitions can mitigate this effect we used the open source gmtsar software sandwell et al 2011 xu et al 2017 to generate 288 interferograms fig 3 with a threshold of perpendicular baseline of 100 m and a threshold of temporal baseline of 50 days topographic phase contribution in each interferogram were subtracted using a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m from srtm farr et al 2007 to reduce speckle noise the interferograms were down sampled 8 pixels in range and 2 pixels in azimuth and filtered by a gaussian filter with a 0 5 gain at a wavelength of 200 m in azimuth and ground range two dimensional phase unwrapping to recover unambiguous phase data were implemented by the statistical cost network flow algorithm for phase unwrapping snaphu chen and zebker 2001 we used a threshold of 0 12 from coherence map to mask out noisy pixels such as over water bodies or densely vegetated regions while unwrapping the interferograms the long wavelength phase ramps due to imprecise orbital information were removed by fitting a two dimensional linear plane for each interferogram the line of sight los displacement time series were extracted from the unwrapped interferograms by a coherence based sbas method tong and schmidt 2016 this method differs from the traditional sbas berardino et al 2002 in that it solves for the displacement time series at every pixel by taking coherence as weights in the least square inversion the pixels with low coherence are kept in the processing chain and will be down weighted in the analysis making the noise in the input data less sensitive to matrix inversion and resulting in a spatially coherent signal with dense pixels the topography related component of tropospheric delays usually exhibits systematic seasonal variations and may obscure the seasonal displacement signals dong et al 2019 tang et al 2018 the conventional insar time series methods handle the mitigation of tropospheric delay with a spatial temporal filtering by treating the delay simply as a random behavior in time we addressed the issue of seasonal tropospheric delay by combing gacos generic atmospheric correction online service yu et al 2018 and a common point stacking method tymofyeyeva and fialko 2015 this method corrects the long wavelength and topography related components of tropospheric delay for each interferogram by using gacos thus transforming the residual delays into a more randomly distributed behavior over time this helps satisfy the assumptions that atmospheric effects are temporally uncorrelated in insar time series analysis tang et al 2022 which were further reduced by the common point stacking method the displacement velocity was finally obtained from the linear regression of the solved displacement time series 3 2 cgps groundwater level and precipitation data the surveying and mapping department in shanxi province has constructed a cgps network across the administrative region in the province since 2009 which is consisted of 67 stations zeng et al 2012 this cgps network is multipurpose such as for maintaining geodetic reference frame monitoring crustal deformation and climate research measurements from eight cgps stations within the taiyuan basin see the locations in fig 1b are used to validate insar derived displacements in our study the details of the processing strategy of the cgps data and 3d displacement time series for each station can be found in tang et al 2018 zeng et al 2012 the daily cgps observations are available from 2016 to 2019 and overlapped with some parts of the sentinel 1 dataset we compare the insar derived displacements with the cgps measurements in section 4 1 groundwater level data recorded in the confined aquifer at four water wells within the basin were acquired from china earthquake networks center cenc see their locations in fig 1b as marked with ty qx xy and jx the depths of water wells vary from 315 m to 765 78 m yan et al 2020 fig 4 shows the geochronology and lithology of the aquifer at these four wells rock types in the aquifer system for each well are primarily sandstone or consolidated sand gravel groundwater level data were recorded at 1 minute sampling intervals from may 2007 to november 2020 we resampled the time series of water level data by moving average into a daily interval and evaluated the seasonal ground displacement in response to the seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater level in section 4 daily precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg were acquired through giovanni https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni the precipitation data were used to assess the groundwater recharge and its relationship with ground surface displacement in section 4 3 3 insar seasonal displacement modeling ground surface displacements can be divided into three components a linear trend a seasonal variation and an irregular residual the long term lowering in groundwater level causes the consolidation of fine grained sediments which leads to the linear component of land subsidence and is mainly inelastic the seasonal component of displacement is caused by the seasonal cycle of groundwater discharge and recharge in the aquifer system thus we modeled the insar displacement time series y t as 1 y t y 0 v t k 1 2 a k sin 2 π k t b k cos 2 π k ε t where t is the time in units of years v is the linear velocity and y 0 is a constant a k and b k are the coefficients of the periodic motion where k 1 indicates the annual terms and k 2 indicates the semi annual terms the last term ε t represents errors which are independent identically distributed and random with e ε 0 the model with the unknown coefficients y y 0 v a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 t is a linear system as 2 y a x ε the best linear unbiased estimates of the unknown parameters can be solved by least square algorithm as 3 x a t a 1 a t y finally the annual k 1 and semi annual k 2 amplitudes a k and phase k can be calculated as 4 s k 2 c k 2 k tan 1 s k c k k 1 2 3 4 wavelet transform analysis insar derived displacement time series can be further examined with wavelet methods to understand the time varying features and to quantify the causal relationships between the measured displacement and the triggering factors the cwt method expands time series data to the time frequency domain and therefore provides information on the temporal persistence of periodicities the xwt and wtc allow the identification of the common power spectra and wavelet coherence between two time series datasets grinsted et al 2004 tomaoós et al 2020 respectively the cwt is a convolution of the time series data with a scaled and translated version of the mother wavelet ψ 0 η as follows 5 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where n is the data series length s is the wavelet scale δ t is the sampling interval n is the localized time index the most used mother wavelet in geophysical applications is the morlet wavelet which is defined as 6 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where η and ω 0 are the non dimensional time and frequency parameter the wavelet power spectrum is defined as w n x s 2 which conveys information on periodicities at different time scales the xwt is extended from the cwt method which reveals the spatio temporal interactions between two sets of data and quantifies their coordination either the phase relationships or the time lag effects the xwt of two data sequences e g x and y is the product of w x s with the complex conjugate of w y s as follow 7 w xy s w x s w y s w xy s e i δ φ j s where w x s and w y s are the cwt of each data sequence and represents complex conjugate w xy s is the cross wavelet power and δ φ j s is the relative phase that represents a time lag effect between the two time series the xwt is hence very useful for investigating the delayed response between the cause and the effect additionally the relative phase δ φ j s in radians can be converted into time lag in unit of days or years 8 δ t δ φ j s t 2 π where t is the periodicity of the data sequence the wtc characterizes the coherence values range from 0 to 1 between cwts of two individual data sequence which can be expressed as 9 r n 2 s s s 1 w xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator in the time frequency domain where the two cwts have similar wavelet coherence the value r n 2 s will be high close to 1 the proposed methodology here is to apply these wavelet tools cwt xwt and wtc to comprehensively investigate the periodicity of the ground deformation time series and its potential triggering factors e g groundwater level and precipitation and quantitatively analyze their cause effect relationships the input data sequence for wavelet methods must be uniformly sampled in time although sar acquisitions from sentinel 1 have a regular repeating time 12 days in our study some acquisitions may be missing or excluded from interferometric processing due to the decorrelated effects therefore the missing values were linearly interpolated into equally spaced in time using the sentinel 1 revisit interval of 12 days the interpolated displacement time series were then separated into linear and non linear components the potential triggering factors such as groundwater level and precipitation were collected with a higher time frequency 1 day in our study than the displacement time series derived from insar consequently we down sampled the groundwater level and precipitation data time series to the revisiting time interval of the sentinel 1 data i e 12 days the wavelet methods were applied to the evenly sampled data to investigate the seasonal ground deformation and the time lags between seasonal variations in displacements and the triggering factors the flowchart of this procedure can be found in fig 5 4 results and analysis 4 1 insar displacement velocity map in taiyuan basin the los velocity obtained from sentinel 1 data by the coherence based sbas method is shown in fig 6 a we referenced the displacement to a 100 m window collocated with the cgps station k001 which is in the urban area of jinzhong city with high coherence and exhibiting stable ground motion the short revisit time of the sentinel 1 acquisitions combined with the coherence based sbas algorithm help mitigate decorrelated effects in the basin we validated the obtained insar results by comparing the los displacements with measurements from seven cgps stations in the basin except the reference station k001 this validation was performed by comparing their displacement time series fig 6b cumulative displacements fig 6c and velocities fig 6d the three component east north and up cgps displacements were projected onto the los direction using the look vector components for each station the trends of each time series matched in that the rmse of cumulative displacements was 8 mm and the rmse of velocities was 5 mm yr although the time periods between insar and cgps were not the same these comparisons demonstrate a good agreement between these two techniques spatial analysis of the insar displacement map indicates that land subsidence is concentrated in the central and southern parts of the basin marked by dashed green ellipses in fig 6a a subsidence bowl can be easily identified in the south of taiyuan city which covers an area of approximately 100 km2 this subsidence center is in xiaodian district a new economic development zone where extensive groundwater is used for the rapid economic growth that results in the significant subsidence with a maximum rate of 80 mm yr in the central basin along the fenhe riverbanks the land is mainly covered by agricultural crops tang et al 2018 farmers draw a large amount of water to meet irrigation demand from underlying aquifers causing widespread subsidence throughout the central basin the peak of the subsidence in this region is as high as 82 mm yr in the southern edge of the basin land subsidence occurred in the suburban area between jiexiu and xiaoyi city which matches perfectly with the groundwater depression cone in that area the dark red contours in fig 6a confirming that groundwater overexploitation is the primary driving factor of land subsidence land uplift can be found in several areas in the basin marked by solid blue ellipses in fig 6a the uplifts are concentrated in the urban center of taiyuan city in the northern part of the basin where significant land subsidence occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 s at a rate of up to 110 mm year ma et al 2005 we observed the rates of uplift about 14 mm yr during the study period this uplift behavior is confirmed from cgps measurements at stations a001 and a008 see fig 6b the observed land uplift is the elastic relaxation of the compacted aquifer system related to the regained fluid pore pressure due to groundwater recovery a phenomenon referred to as elastic or poroelastic rebound galloway and burbey 2011 since 2003 the wanjiazhai water diversion wwd project has been implemented to divert water from yellow river to taiyuan city which has supplied 1 219 billion m3 of water to taiyuan for household and ecological restoration by the end of 2018 at the same time an integrated groundwater management program was implemented to strictly control groundwater pumping in these circumstances the amount of groundwater usage has largely reduced and groundwater levels have recovered which can be observed at ty well station in fig 8 a that the groundwater level increased by about 22 m between 2007 and 2020 two localized uplifting areas were found in the western edge of the basin one in qingxu county northwest of cgps a002 station with an average rate of 10 mm yr and one in jiaocheng county north of cgps j005 station with an average rate of 6 mm yr the surface displacement caused by groundwater overexploitation is mainly in the vertical direction galloway and burbey 2011 tang et al 2018 hence in the subsequent analysis we directly projected the insar los displacement into the vertical direction by d v d los c o s θ where θ is the incidence angle of radar waves 4 2 seasonal amplitude and phase maps of ground deformation in the basin annual or seasonal uplift may occur in response to natural replenishment of aquifers during times of high precipitation and reflect as a variation in the piezometric head these observations are critical in groundwater management because they indicate that the aquifer maintains some capacity to regain storage capability chaussard et al 2017 riel et al 2018 here we investigated possible annual and seasonal signals in the displacement time series from insar by assuming the ground displacement can be expressed as a combination of seasonal and linear trend as indicated in equation 1 we estimated the sinusoidal coefficients for each pixel using equation 3 and generated seasonal amplitude and phase maps using equation 4 the estimated maps of annual and semi annual amplitude and phase are shown in fig 7 the measurements with high spatial resolution from insar allow us to evaluate the spatial variability of the seasonal signals which is an advantage over the sparse cgps network within the basin fig 7 shows that the seasonal displacement is concentrated within the central region of the basin where groundwater has been pumping for agricultural irrigation we observed two zones of peaks in the annual amplitudes on either side of the fenhe river encircled with the white dashed lines in fig 7a with a maximum amplitude of 2 cm on the eastern bank of the river and 1 cm on the western bank the semi annual signal is primarily present on the eastern bank of the river fig 7c with a maximum amplitude of 0 5 cm which is very small compared to the annual signals 4 3 cwt results of groundwater level ground displacement and precipitation fig 8 shows the cwt power spectra of groundwater level changes spanning 2007 2020 at the four groundwater wells in taiyuan basin from the groundwater time series we observed water level rise at ty well in the north of the basin with a large rate of 2 3 m yr and at qx well in the central basin with a slight rate of 0 6 m yr while we observed groundwater decline in the south of the basin with a large declining rate of 3 m yr at xy well and a slight rate of 0 3 m yr at jx well at qx well it is interesting that a seasonal cycle of groundwater level was clearly modulated in the long term rising trend from the analysis of the cwt power spectrum at qx well in fig 8b this seasonal pattern with a period of one year was clearly identified this seasonal pattern is related to the annual cycle of groundwater withdrawal and recharge in the central basin several semi annual processes were also found at this well but they exhibited intermittency throughout the cwt localized around time intervals of 2010 2012 2015 2016 and 2017 2019 both ty and jx wells exhibited an intermittent signal at the annual band but their maximum powers localized in different time intervals which are around 2007 2013 and 2017 2020 at ty and around 2009 2011 and 2017 2020 at jx the water level at xy well did not show any significant seasonal variations arid and semi arid areas of the taiyuan basin is affected by climate change that the annual precipitation has been decreasing in the basin since the 1950 s shao et al 2017 the reduce of rainfall can affect the hydrological cycle reducing surface water and increasing extraction on groundwater which thus leads to further land subsidence the daily precipitation data at these four well locations obtained from gpm were resampled to a monthly scale and the cwt power spectra are presented in fig 9 we found a dominant 1 year period in relation to the monsoons throughout the observation interval several patterns with periodicity at 0 125 0 5 year are also clearly noted at these wells which correspond to semi annual signals in the temporal variability of the rainfall the seasonality observed in the precipitation data can be explained by the typical continental monsoon climate with an annual total precipitation less than 500 mm and about 60 is concentrated in june september in the study area the ground displacement time series at the four water wells and their cwt power spectra are shown in fig 10 as shown the ground in the north of the basin in taiyuan city also see the velocity map in fig 6 is experiencing uplift with a rate of 14 mm yr due to the groundwater level rise in this region see groundwater level at ty in fig 8 the south of the basin exhibits significant land subsidence with similar rates of 28 mm yr at xy and jx wells following the groundwater level decline albeit the declining rate of groundwater at jx well 0 3 m yr is much smaller than that at xy well 3 m yr in the central basin we observed land subsidence at well qx at a modest rate of 20 mm yr even though the groundwater is rising at this location this inconsistency suggests that the continuous subsidence is driven mainly by the sustained groundwater pumping over the past decades interestingly a seasonal cycle of up and down can be clearly observed in the displacement time series at qx which is related to the changes of groundwater associated with the seasonal water pumping recharge as mentioned earlier this seasonal process in displacement time series with a 1 year period can be recognized from the cwt power spectrum in fig 10b similar regions with high wavelet power at the period of 1 year are recognized for the other well stations although their vibration amplitudes are much lower than that at qx well additionally at ty xy and jx wells a power signal with a period of 3 to 4 months can be observed during 2018 2019 the observed cyclic displacements from insar can be related with groundwater level fluctuations or seasonal variations of rainfall this causal relationship will be investigated through cross wavelet analysis in the next section 4 4 xwt results between displacement groundwater level and precipitation to quantify the causal relationships between seasonal variations of groundwater level precipitation and ground deformation xwt and wtc were applied to these data sequences groundwater pumping is a well known triggering factor of land subsidence so we first analyzed the relationship between displacements and groundwater level changes fig 11 shows the xwt and wtc between insar displacements and groundwater levels at the four water wells we observed a high common power between displacement and groundwater level time series approximately at the period of one year for the whole study period 2017 2020 at all these four wells however the time lag effects vary at different locations displacement was in anti phase with groundwater level in the north of the basin at ty well phase shift δ φ 202 corresponding to a time lag of 205 days fig 11a whereas it was in phase with groundwater level in the central basin at qx well δ φ 3 corresponding to a time lag of 3 days fig 11b in the south of the basin the displacement is lagging the groundwater at xy well by about 102 days δ φ 101 fig 11c while the displacement is leading the groundwater at jx well by about 40 days δ φ 39 fig 11d the heterogeneous time lag effects between ground deformation and groundwater levels at these four wells reveal the lateral variability in the thickness of aquifer aquitard and piezometric head across the basin in heterogeneous aquifer systems the delayed responses between surface deformation due to aquifer compaction and underground water levels is attributed to the delayed equilibration of pore fluid pressure between the aquifers mainly composed of unconsolidated permeable coarse grained deposit such as sands and gravels and aquitards mainly composed of low permeability fine grained deposit such as silts and clays galloway et al 2000 galloway and burbey 2011 in aquifer systems with thick aquitards this lagged response can be on a time scale of years to decades or more as can be seen in fig 4 the qx well in the central basin has the thickest clay unit in the aquifer system the short time delay three days observed between water levels and ground deformation at this well implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on the delayed compaction of aquifer systems at other well stations the time delays are longer due to their smaller thickness of fine grained silts and clays with lower permeability this signal is of hydrologic importance and could be used to assess groundwater recharge and usage groundwater in the aquifer system is replenished or recharged by rainfall and snow melt that seep down into the pores or cracks of the soil and rocks beneath the land s surface the interaction between groundwater and precipitation is crucial to better understand the hydrological processes and water resources management the xwt between groundwater level and precipitation was carried out to analyze its resonance period and phase relationships fig 12 a high common power between groundwater level and precipitation was found at approximately a 1 year period throughout the observation period the xwt and wtc also show that water level and precipitation is in anti phase at ty δ φ 205 corresponding to a time lag of 208 days qx δ φ 228 corresponding to a time lag of 232 days and xy δ φ 259 corresponding to a time lag of 263 days these anti phase relationships agree with the pumping practices in the basin that groundwater pumping is increased before the monsoon precipitation season to meet irrigation water demand during the major crop growing period march to august groundwater declines due to the pumping for irrigation and drops to the lowest level during times of high precipitation august september the water from rainfall is stored and supplies to the crops and groundwater pumping is reduced with groundwater replenished from rainfall and snow melt the water level increases during the non monsoon season and reaches to its highest level during january march rainfall affects the intensity of groundwater pumping and recharge where the amount of groundwater extraction is larger than the amount of recharge during dry weather while the opposite during wet seasons the increased groundwater pumping during seasons with less precipitation will cause more land subsidence if groundwater extraction reduces during seasons with high precipitation and groundwater recharges later a small amount of land uplift could occur due to the regained pore fluid pressure in the aquifer system the plots of the xwt and wtc analysis between displacement and precipitation are shown in fig 13 a high significant power can be observed for a 1 year period at these four water wells covering almost for the entire study period note that precipitation and ground deformation is in phase at ty δ φ 51 corresponding to a time lag of 52 days xy δ φ 15 corresponding to a time lag of 15 days and jx wells δ φ 4 corresponding to time lag of 4 days while this relationship is anti phase at qx well δ φ 128 corresponding to time lag of 130 days this fact agrees with the agriculture irrigated activities as groundwater pumping was encouraged during the high precipitation months in the central region of the basin as discussed earlier 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal deformation in relation to geological conditions the insar time series reveal two different time scales of groundwater related surface displacements in the taiyuan basin which reflects two different deformation processes due to groundwater discharge and recharge the long term trend of land subsidence is consistent with aquitard drainage model galloway et al 2000 gambolati and teatini 2021 that the inelastic compaction is not entirely compensated by the elastic rebound during aquifer recharge the second time scale of short term deformation relates to the annual groundwater level variations in the basin as reflected in the maps of seasonal amplitude and phase delay in fig 7 we superimposed the thickness of quaternary strata and the developed earth fissures onto the annual amplitude and phase delay maps of ground deformation as shown in fig 14 the seasonal pattern is present in taigu qixian counties in the central basin and concentrated in the irrigated area this similar pattern is also found in groundwater level data at qx well around this area earth fissures are widely developed in the central basin around the taigu qixian area which is spatially correlated with the seasonal deformation patterns as can be seen in fig 14 it indicates that the seasonal ground deformation plays a critical role in forming earth fissures especially around the transition areas with large gradients in seasonal amplitudes where differential subsidence is more likely to occur the thickness of quaternary strata at northwestern border of the basin is large than 500 m and it gradually becomes thinner from northwest to southeast the area with large seasonal amplitudes in the eastern bank of fenhe river is located on the southeastern side of the taihang mountain where the thickness of the quaternary strata varies between 200 and 400 m and the lithology is mainly fine sand silt and silty clay meng et al 2019 peng et al 2018 the thickness of the quaternary strata changed rapidly in the discontinuous transition zones of the amplitude phase maps see the profiles of i i and ii ii which suggests that the thickness of quaternary strata plays a critical role in the diffusion of piezometric head in the aquifer system we also found sharp discontinuities in the seasonal amplitude and phase delay across fault systems within the basin indicating that the faults act as an effective barrier to lateral groundwater flow this effect can be clearly found at faults f2 and f3 along the profiles of the annual amplitude fig 14c and e for the discontinuity across the faults the difference in the seasonal annual amplitude between each side of the fault could be as high as 15 mm this across fault discontinuous pattern can also be found in phase delay map where the ground west of the longjiaying fault f2 has a peak signal in may and the ground east of the f2 has a peak signal in february 5 2 elastic and inelastic deformation in response to changes in groundwater in the central basin the short term seasonal variations in ground displacement observed in the insar time series follows well with the aquifer extraction recovery cycles fig 15 the high summer demand for irrigation water combined with the normally wet summer causes groundwater levels to fluctuate in response to the seasonal cycle of pumping and recharge the displacement time series of the points p1 and p2 with the most significant seasonal signals on the east and west banks of fenhe river clearly show that the seasonal elastic displacement is embedded in the long term trend of land subsidence fig 15g h we found that the vertical deformation at these two points has an annual cycle with a peak in march and a trough in august the point p1 on the east bank of fenhe river shows greater subsidence and seasonal effects a subsidence rate of 47 mm yr and an annual amplitude of 22 7 mm than the point p2 on the west bank of the river with a subsidence rate of 18 mm yr and an annual amplitude of 11 8 mm the relationship between vertical deformation and the duration of the extraction recovery phases was analyzed we divided the groundwater and displacement time series into three extraction recovery cycles as shown in fig 15i we estimated the cycle temporal ratio tr and the uplift subsidence ratio sr for each cycle as suggested by ezquerro et al 2014 the tr represents the relationship between the duration of the groundwater recovery t recov over the duration of the extraction t extract i e t recov t extract the sr expressed in percentage corresponds to the ratio between land uplift d uplift during groundwater recovery with respect to land subsidence d subs during groundwater extraction i e d uplift d subs the groundwater extraction phase is from mid march to mid august duration of 5 months and the recovery is from the late august to the next mid march duration of 7 months therefore the tr is 1 4 the tr ratio remains constant over time as can be seen from the seasonal variations of water level at qx well in fig 15i which indicates the relatively constant practices of the annual cycle of groundwater withdrawal and recharge during this period the subsidence and uplift during different extraction recovery phases and their sr are listed in table 1 the average sr is 33 for p1 and 46 7 for p2 suggesting that for this aquifer system the land uplift due to aquifer recovery compensated less than 50 of the previous subsidence during extraction phases although the land subsidence uplift behavior corresponds well to the extraction recovery cycles subsidence and uplift related to groundwater decline and rise respectively were not proportional to changes of groundwater level take p1 location for an example groundwater levels declined 25 8 m corresponding with 218 1 mm of land subsidence cumulative subsidence from march 2017 to march 2020 while groundwater level recovered 25 2 m with a corresponding uplift of only 70 2 mm the ratio of the change in deformation to the change in groundwater level for the declining portion is 8 mm m which is much larger than the ratio for the water level rising portion i e 3 mm m indicating the dominant part of land subsidence is inelastic we further estimated the elastic inelastic deformation ratio r ed i d the long term trend of displacement is considered as the inelastic component and the short term fluctuations of deformation as the elastic component values higher than 1 represent a dominant part of elastic deformation values lower than 1 represent a dominant part of inelastic deformation the trend of the displacement time series on the east bank of the river for pixels with annual amplitude higher than 5 mm and subsidence rates higher than 20 mm yr shows an average subsidence rate of 30 mm yr and fluctuates by 10 mm on the west bank of the river the average subsidence rate is 22 mm yr and the fluctuation is 7 mm the elastic inelastic ratio is approximately 0 66 for the east bank and 0 63 for the west bank between 2017 and 2020 this ratio further confirms the presence of predominantly inelastic deformation in the central basin 6 conclusion in this work we investigated the seasonality of ground displacement in taiyuan basin derived from sentinel 1 insar data and quantified the causal relationships between insar derived seasonal displacements groundwater level and precipitation time series using wavelet based methods cwt xwt and wtc the seasonal variations in ground displacement caused by seasonal groundwater level changes are related to irrigation pumping activities in the central basin this seasonal displacement is characterized by a 1 year period with an annual peak to peak amplitudes of 2 cm with peaks in march and troughs in august using the xwt method we found the seasonal variations present in the displacement time series are in phase with respect to groundwater levels and anti phase to natural precipitation these relationships agree with the irrigation pumping practice in the basin groundwater extraction increases for irrigation from mid march to mid august prior to the monsoon precipitation season resulting in water levels decline and land subsidence during this period during the non irrigated season from late august to mid march groundwater extraction decreases and aquifers are replenished by precipitation causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift the relatively short time delay three days observed between deformation and water level in the central basin implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on the delayed compaction of aquifer systems the seasonal deformation is correlated with the thickness of quaternary strata and fault systems which plays a critical role in the development of earth fissures in the basin our analysis of the central basin shows that the irreversible deformation is likely to be dominant in this area that the elastic inelastic deformation ratio is approximately 0 6 0 7 our results have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of land subsidence and the subsequent design and adoption of subsidence mitigation measures especially the measures on groundwater management for sustainable development in this arid region sentinel 1 mission provides regular data acquisition with high temporal resolution of 6 12 days which helps better reveal seasonal variations in displacement time series the wavelet based methods can be further exploited to identify and quantify causal relationships between insar derived ground deformation and groundwater level which helps improve the numerical models on land subsidence however we must bear in mind that wavelet based methods do not unravel the underlying physical mechanism of land subsidence and additional hydrogeological information and analysis are needed to fully explain the mechanism of the relationship between land subsidence and its triggering factors tomaoós et al 2020

1811,turbidity has a substantial effect on light propagation in water and is an optical indicator for monitoring water quality the ocean and land colour instrument olci installed in the sentinel 3 satellite could help to monitor turbidity variations due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high revisit time this makes us develop suitable turbidity algorithms for mapping the dynamics of lake

lakes are a crucial component of terrestrial hydrospheres together with terrestrial ecosystems lake ecosystems participate in global material cycles and serve a wide range of functions including controlling river runoff irrigation water provision for industry and drinking and breeding aquatic organisms gleick 2003 awange 2022 while it plays an important role in the development of the national economy lake water quality is vulnerable to the dual impact of climate change and human activities that affect the environment and has a sensitive response to both o reilly et al 2003 woolway et al 2020 consequently long term monitoring and regulation of water quality are necessary to ensure the sustainable utilization of lake resources the use of clean and turbid enable direct visual perception of water quality as a first order description turbidity a comprehensive water quality parameter reflects the inherent optical properties of the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water due to optically active matter such as chlorophyll a and total suspended matter dogliotti et al 2015 nechad et al 2010 thus turbidity is an essential parameter for evaluating water quality it is a regular parameter measured in situ in many lakes in particular it has been suggested as a monitoring parameter for assessing ecosystem functions in the eu marine strategy framework directive since 2008 european commission 2008 continuously large scale observations of lake turbidity can increase the understanding of aquatic environmental conditions including the effects of dynamic natural and anthropogenic activities such as land use soil erosion and urban expansion around lakes kumarasiri et al 2022 ma et al 2010 mccarthy et al 2018 understanding of lake water quality monitoring has increased owing to developments in satellite remote sensing kutser et al 2020 it gained more insights to understand geochemical processes and enabled the detection of high frequency and large scale applications for lake turbidity in comparison to conventional in situ measurement methods several satellite sensors including thematic mapper enhanced thematic mapper operational land imager geostationary ocean color imager and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer etc are widely used to quantify turbidity and map its spatiotemporal patterns bustamante et al 2009 doxaran et al 2006 doxaran et al 2009 wang et al 2020 although they were not specifically designed for inland waters considering the growing interest in satellite sensors for spatiotemporal resolution radiometric resolution and large scale applications appropriate satellite sensors related to turbidity algorithms are required ocean and land colour instrument olci equipped in sentinel 3 satellite offer a narrower spectral bandwidth of 7 5 10 nm table s1 which can identify the complex optical properties of lakes in greater detail likewise the revisit time of olci is 0 9 days for latitudes above 30 and 1 1 days in the equatorial region which presents a major advantage for observing rapidly changing turbidity shen et al 2020 global datasets with a 300 m resolution based on olci data for lake turbidity levels developed by the copernicus global land service program have become available however turbidity data for specific regional lake groups or years were used to calibrate these datasets which is insufficient for tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of turbidity at a multi decadal scale or for large scale observations more importantly these datasets showed an underestimation validation for our study s in situ measured turbidity of lakes across china fig s1 to this end it is necessary to develop an appropriate turbidity algorithm using an olci sensor shifting the focus from a regional scale to a large scale overview of geographical areas remote sensing algorithms for lake turbidity remain particularly challenging because of the complex optical properties of inland lakes li et al 2021 numerous algorithms have been developed to quantify turbidity and empirical algorithms based on mathematical functions and statistical theories have been widely applied choi et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 these algorithms have a simple model relationship that can be used to rapidly map turbidity however for lake turbidity affected by many optically active substances the stability and feasibility of turbidity algorithms remain relatively limited as well as they would not show a linear relationship in some cases the use of simple mathematical functions to elucidate the relationship between turbidity and reflectance is similarly limited ma et al 2021 wang et al 2019 machine learning methods no longer rely on fixed combinations of bands and can describe well the nonlinear relationships between the target and feature variables in many dimensions facilitating the investigation of lake environments schulz et al 2018 we could accurately parameterize the variables responding to turbidity and their optical properties as input variables in algorithms li et al 2021 therefore machine learning algorithms for remotely sensed estimations of water qualities have become popular due to advances in algorithm development and computing power pahlevan et al 2020 peterson et al 2020 in view of the lack of turbidity algorithm and olci sensor application for chinese lakes this study develops machine learning algorithms for turbidity estimation with in situ measured turbidity collected from lakes across china further this methodology allows monitoring turbidity in all lakes in china that are larger than 20 km2 in size the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the relationships between olci reflectance and turbidity 2 calibrate and validate the turbidity algorithm by typical machine learning algorithms for estimating turbidity with in situ datasets 3 map the turbidity in unique lakes and 4 examine the spatial distributions of lake turbidity considering different land use types 1 1 study region china is a vast country and its climatic topographical and geological surroundings differ considerably between regions based on natural hydrologic regionalization the lakes are divided into five regions wang and dou 1998 i e the tibetan plateau lake region tpl inner mongolia xinjiang lake region imxl eastern plain lake region epl northeast plain lake region npl and yunnan guizhou plateau lake region ygpl fig 1 the tpl and imxl belong to the endorheic region with a semi arid climate with most lakes distributed in the region being saline or brackish areas the epl ygpl and npl are exorheic regions where lakes are freshwater lakes with an asian monsoonal humid climate tpl has the largest number of lakes 1 055 lakes with an area 1 km2 and total lake surface area 41 831 7 km2 in china ma et al 2011 these lakes are less impacted by anthropogenic activities because of their high elevations and intense solar radiation resulting in fewer nutrient inputs and high lake clarity song et al 2020 epl and imxl have 634 and 514 lakes respectively with total surface areas of 21 053 km2 and 12 589 9 km2 respectively ma et al 2011 of which most lakes in the epl are eutrophic and shallow owing to the unreasonable utilization of water resources such as aquaculture many lakes located in the imxl have shrunk and anthropogenic activities in recent decades accelerated this process ma et al 2010 ygpl has the smallest number of lakes 65 and surface area 1 240 3 km2 followed by npl number of lakes 425 total area 12 589 9 km2 ma et al 2011 most of the lakes in the ygpl are tectonic lakes which rely on surface water and groundwater recharge with long water exchange cycles and fragile ecosystems with the rapidly growing population and associated economy in the watersheds these lakes distributed in ygpl are undergoing accelerated eutrophication zhang et al 2019 in addition the majority of lakes in the npl are surrounded by agricultural cropland and their water quality is vulnerable to agricultural activities 1 2 in situ data collection and laboratory analysis in this study 1081 samples were collected from 73 lakes

received by the satellite sensor originated from the atmosphere and only 3 15 of the radiation originated from lakes martins et al 2017 the atmospheric correction for oli lite acolite processor which has been reported to have excellent performance for sentinel series satellite images vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 was used to remove atmospheric effects and obtain the reflectance at olci bands oa1 oa21 then a 3 3 pixel centered reflectance rrs λ at each station with cv 10 was employed to assure the uniformity of sampled distribution toming et al 2016 with the develop turbidity algorithm in this study the spatial distribution of turbidity in investigated 457 lakes surface area greater than 20 km2 in 2021 was examined as well as the annual variation in turbidity in selected 6 typical lakes during 2016 2021 similarly cloud free olci imagery also corrected by the acolite processor was used and the reflectance of lake pixels for each image was acquired to estimate turbidity concentration then the annual averaged turbidity of every lake was calculated for all available olci images captured within one lake throughout the year all images were acquired during an ice free period april to november by visual inspection finally 4507 scenes of images were used to map national turbidity for 457 lakes across and 1042 scenes of images were used to map the annual turbidity for selected 6 typical lakes table s5 1 4 lake masks and environmental data collection lake boundaries were used to extract turbidity maps processed from the olci satellite data we referred to the lake boundary dataset in 2020 from zhang et al 2019 to find lakes with a surface area larger than 20 km2 then the normalized difference water index gao 1996 was used to extract accurate water pixels for every olci image both in national and signal scales turbidity mapping simultaneously a normalized difference vegetation index was used to extract and remove the area of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation huete et al 2002 which could have an impact on estimating turbidity concentration in addition in order to avoid the effects of mixed pixels and adjacency effects these extracted lake boundaries need to be buffered inwards by 1 water pixel 300 m for lake boundaries abiotic factors acting on water qualities in large scale observation were demonstrated song et al 2020 li et al 2021 2022 in our study we

partial least squares regression plsr support vector regression svr backpropagation neural network bp k nearest neighbor knn random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost to ensure the feasibility of these developed turbidity algorithms all in situ measured turbidity and their match up reflectance were randomly divided into a calibration dataset n 721 and a validation dataset n 360 in python 3 10 software correlation analyses of turbidity with all possible bands and their combinations ratios plus minus differences etc for our pooled datasets were conducted to preliminarily select the most sensitive spectral variables based on the correlation coefficients the most sensitive spectral variables were used to build a simple regression sr algorithm for turbidity estimates further these all sensitive bands and band combinations responding to in situ measured turbidity concentrations were seen as input variables of machine learning algorithms and partial least squares regression plsr to strengthen the robustness the output variables are turbidity concentrations plsr can extract explanatory variables also called principal components and effectively eliminate the effect of multicollinearity in the data to construct regression equations helland 2014 1 5 1 support vector regression svr proposed by vapnik 1999 is a machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory and is less dependent on the amount of sample data support vector regression svr is an extension of svm and can be classified into linear and nonlinear regressions when conventional regression methods are used the loss is not calculated until the predicted and actual values are equal svr introduces an ε insensitive loss function i e the loss is calculated only when f x y ε at that time as follows 1 f x ω φ x b 2 l ε f x y 0 f x y ε f x y ε o t h e r s where f x is the regression function φ x is the kernel function that converts a nonlinear regression problem into a linear regression problem ε is the tolerance bias and l ε f x y is the loss function this is equivalent to constructing an interval band of width 2 ε centered on the square of the regression equation and calculating the loss only when the sample falls outside the interval band it is generally difficult to directly identify the appropriate ε to ensure that most of the training samples can be within the interval band therefore svr introduces a relaxation factor ξ i i 1 2 n allowing some samples to be outside the interval bands according to the structural risk minimization criterion the optimization problem of the best svr regression function can be defined as follows 3 min ω b ξ i ξ i 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to 4 s t f x i y i ε ξ i y i f x i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c represents the algorithm s tolerance for error and is a penalty factor used to weigh the empirical risk against structural risk 1 5 2 backpropagation neural network the backpropagation neural network bp is a multilayer feedforward neural network based on multilayer perceptrons it consists of two processes forward propagation of the signal and back propagation of the error the input signal acts on the output node through the hidden layer and undergoes a nonlinear transformation to produce an output signal if the desired output real value does not match the network output predicted value it can be transferred to the error backpropagation stage glorot and bengio 2010 when the error is back propagated the bp neural network adjusts the connection weights and thresholds of the neurons layer by layer through the output layer toward the input layer according to the gradient descent method huang et al 2006 after repeated training until the difference between two adjacent errors was less than the specified value or a predetermined number of learning times is reached the network training stops additionally bp typically uses the mean square error as the loss function and the error of the kth sample can be defined as follows 5 e k 1 2 j 1 m y j k o j k 2 where m is the number of neurons in the output layer y j k the expected output and o j k the network output for n samples the overall error can be expressed as 6 e k 1 2 k 1 n j 1 m y j k o j k 2 1 5 3 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn algorithm could offer the advantages of a straightforward algorithm and high accuracy it is a regression prediction algorithm based on pattern recognition theory which uses the concept of matching patterns to match k samples from the training set that are most similar to the input variables it then uses the weighted average of the response variables of these samples as the prediction results of the input variables goldberger et al 2004 the commonly used distance metric parameters are the euclidean manhattan and minkowski distances 1 5 4 tree based integration algorithms the rf is a bagging parallel integrated learning method based on the regression decision tree which uses the bagging method to randomly select samples from the original training set with put back to form multiple mutually independent sub training sets for example if a training set with n samples is used and each time a sub training set of size m m n is taken out from this data set with put back a total of k times are selected k models are trained and learned according to these k sub training sets in the regression problem these k models were used to make predictions and the mean of the predicted values was taken as the final result breiman 2001 7 h x 1 k k 1 k h i x compared with rf xgboost is a boosting tandem integration learning method that is based on a regression decision tree it constructs a new regression decision tree based on the negative gradient direction of the loss function of the previous regression decision tree and gradually reduces the loss by iterative methods such that the predicted value is close to the true value chen and guestrin 2016 assuming k trees the final prediction for the ith sample can be defined as follows 8 y i k 1 k f k x i f k f where y i is the predicted value of the xgboost algorithm for the i t h sample k is the number of regression decision trees f is the set of all regression decision trees and f k x i is the predicted value of the k t h number of regression decision trees 1 6 hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms the parameters can be divided into two types the parameter learned during the training process such as the weight parameters and bias parameters of each neuron in bp and the parameter that needs to be predefined during the construction of the algorithm naming hyperparameters such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer of bp neural networks and activation functions by setting appropriate hyperparameters the performance and efficiency of the algorithms can be significantly improved the grid search cross validation method creates a multidimensional grid in the hyperparameter space each dimension of the grid represents a hyperparameter to be optimized and each grid point represents a combination of hyperparameters and the accuracy of the model is compared for different combinations of parameters using an iterative approach ultimately the best combination of hyperparameters is determined bergstra and bengio 2012 in this study the hyperparameters of the svr bp knn and rf algorithms were provided by the scikit learn machine learning package and the hyperparameters of the xgboost algorithm were provided by the xgboost machine learning package for svr optimization the kernel function types regularization coefficients and kernel coefficients determine the functions that are transformed into higher dimensional spaces and resist overfitting smola and schölkopf 2004 the key parameters of bp are the activation function the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate a limited number of hidden layer neurons is insufficient to train the neural network and will decrease the model s accuracy a large number of hidden layer neurons will lengthen the training process and cause the model to overfit jin et al 2000 the knn algorithm is a special machine learning algorithm in which the distance metrics for weights and the number of neighboring points k determine its accuracy the rf and xgboost algorithms are integrated algorithms based on decision trees and they have similar hyperparameters such as the number of decision trees and maximum depth similarly the learning rate also has a significant impact on the accuracy of the xgboost algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 1 7 statistical analyses and model accuracy assessment statistical analyses such as correlation and regression analyses were performed using python 3 10 the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models and are defined as follows 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 11 mape 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where n represents the number of samples y i and y i are the in situ measured and predicted turbidity concentrations by our turbidity algorithms respectively y is the in situ measured averaged turbidity concentration determination coefficient r2 is often used to represent model prediction performance and root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape are also used to examine agreement between the measured and predicted values with a slope of linear regression close to 1 2 results and discussion 2 1 characteristics of in situ measured turbidity descriptions of lake turbidity are summarized in table 1 the turbidity concentrations ranged from 0 15 to 262 57 ntu with a median value of 33 36 ntu and a mean value of 46 02 46 37 ntu over the observation period likewise our lake dataset contains typical turbid lakes with turbidity exceeding 200 ntu at some sampling sites collected in lake chagan 124 28e 45 25 n and lake xingkai 132 53e 45 27 n it can be found that the biogeochemical characteristics of the 73 lakes across china are diverse indicating the differences of geobiochemical circulation and anthropogenic activities overall a lake turbidity dataset was created with 238 match ups at the 0 10 ntu level 467 match ups at the 10 50 ntu level 257 match ups at the 50 100 ntu level and 119 match ups at the 100 ntu level from lake surveys conducted during various seasons across china significant differences in lake turbidity were observed among the five lake regions f 41 11 p 0 01 the lakes in npl had the highest averaged turbidity mean 58 74 49 67 ntu with large ranges of 0 92 262 57 ntu than those in other lake regions the majority of lakes are distributed in the songnen plain surrounding by developed regions with intensive agriculture ma et al 2021 with high turbidity levels while other scattered lakes located in southeastern mountainous areas have a relatively clean status fig 1 for lakes in epl the turbidity concentrations ranged from 0 19 to 245 43 ntu with an average value of 45 49 44 35 ntu where these lakes are shallow and eutrophic affected by the anthropogenic activities in previous studies li et al 2021 2022 the investigated lakes in imxl and ygpl showed relatively moderate turbidity levels as the turbidity concentrations in imxl ranged from 0 18 to 225 66 ntu with an average value of 35 03 34 33 ntu and those in ygpl had a range of 14 00 61 00 ntu with an average value of 24 02 8 88 ntu respectively not surprisingly lakes located at the tpl exhibited low turbidity levels with an average turbidity of 3 69 5 75 ntu as well as the great spatial heterogeneity this may be due to their high altitude average elevation above 4000 m alimentation of glacier and less anthropogenic activities 2 2 selection of olci spectral bands response to turbidity the averaged rrs λ spectra extracted from atmospheric corrected olci bands oa1 oa21 considering different turbidity levels i e 0 10 ntu n 238 10 50 ntu n 467 50 100 ntu n 257 and 100 ntu n 119 is shown in fig 2 in general the averaged rrs λ spectra within different turbidity levels showed followed a similar shape with the high turbidity concentration could be related to the high rrs λ signals for all samples there were significant differences for rrs λ spectra within different turbidity levels f 14 22 p 0 001 concurrently the averaged rrs λ spectra within 50 100ntu and 100 ntu levels presented a similar shape at 443 nm 490 nm 510 nm and 560 nm and this may due to the saturation in reflectance signals doxaran et al 2002 however we also found a slight increase in rrs 1016 at 0 10 ntu level owing to the light absorption in the near infrared is dominated by pure water and water leaving radiance is zero ouillon et al 1997 the radiance from the skylight may dominate in addition there were significant differences f 568 09 983 14 p 0 001 for rrs λ spectra in red bands from 620 nm 665 nm 674 nm 681 nm and 709 nm within different turbidity levels indicating that they were sensitive to turbidity concentration or its optical characteristic jointly modulated by optically active substances this was consistent with previous studies matsushita et al 2015 li et al 2021 that a sufficient signal to noise ratio at red or nir bands were required to quantify water qualities in turbid waters although we also found there were significant differences f ranged 103 36 to 316 19 p 0 001 for rrs λ spectra in near infrared nir bands from 754 nm 768 nm 779 nm 865 nm and 884 nm within different turbidity levels turbidity as a comprehensive parameter to characterize the water quality both driven by suspended particulate matter and phytoplankton scattering of which solids often are provided with strong backscattering at red or nir wavelengths the narrower olci bands provided the increased sensitivity to the turbidity which integrating absorption and scatter properties of optically active substances pearson correlation coefficients were used to select sensitive bands or their band combinations in response to the in situ measured turbidity table 2 the results showed that the single band reflectance exhibited moderate and strong linear correlations at the 99 confidence level for most of the olci bands except for the oa21 band 1016 nm this agreed with the findings of previous studies dogliotti et al 2015 liversedge 2007 that the energy in the red and nir bands of the electromagnetic spectrum favored the detection of sediments in contrast band combinations revealed more significant correlations between the corresponding rrs λ and in situ measured turbidity than those of the single band when all band combinations were examined we found the oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 and oa6 oa12 oa6 oa21 associated with the rrs 560 rrs 665 rrs 709 and rrs 1020 were all strongly corrected to lake turbidity with r 0 80 in terms of the sensitive band combinations of oa8 oa11 the band ratio could remove residual atmospheric effects such as the oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 also exhibited the significant correlation r 0 82 p 0 01 wang et al 2020 2 3 calibration and validation of turbidity algorithms 2 3 1 hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms table 3 showed the hyperparameter optimization results of machine learning algorithms using the cross validation grid search for our pooled datasets then the determine coefficient r2 and rmse were used to evaluate the optimal configuration of developed machine learning algorithms for estimating turbidity several sensitive bands and band combinations with pearson coefficient r 0 6 were used as the input variables table 2 for svr optimization the kernel function of rbf radial basis function kernel coefficient and regularization coefficient of 3000 and 10 were the optimal parameter combinations in the svr regression fit r2 0 81 rmse 20 17 ntu then the results of the cross validation grid search showed that bp algorithm performed optimally r2 0 76 rmse 22 57 ntu when the number of hidden layer neurons was 120 the activation function was relu and learning rate was 0 13 respectively when the manhattan distance metric with six neighboring points were used the performance of the knn algorithm were the most consistent r2 0 77 rmse 22 07 ntu further the rf algorithm performed well with the relatively high accuracy r2 0 81 rmse 19 99 ntu when the number of decision trees the maximum depth and the minimum number of leaf node samples were 150 12 and 1 respectively finally the xgboost algorithm showed the highest accuracy r2 0 82 rmse 19 53 ntu when the learning rate number of decision trees and maximum depth were 0 02 300 and 6 respectively 2 3 2 comparison of algorithms performance the linear fitting of measured and predicted turbidity concentrations by our developed turbidity algorithms were conducted for machine learning and plsr algorithms we selected 15 variables as input variables to build turbidity algorithms e g oa7 oa8 oa9 oa10 oa11 oa12 oa15 oa16 oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 oa11 oa16 oa6 oa12 and oa6 oa12 oa6 oa21 with the significant correlation r 0 6 p 0 01 between turbidity and reflectance it also can be noted that the band combination of oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 was selected to build an sr turbidity algorithm fig 3 a and table 2 overall the machine learning algorithms employed to develop turbidity algorithms performed better than those of regression algorithms including sr and plsr for calibration and validation dataset expect for slightly overfit svr algorithm fig 3 and table 4 it can be suspected that the high dimensionality 15 input variables may result in the significant overfit for svr validation by contrast among these available machine learning algorithms to estimate turbidity rf algorithm r2 0 92 rmse 12 65 ntu mape 54 32 outperformed the bp r2 0 80 rmse 20 30 ntu mape 134 99 knn r2 0 87 rmse 15 81 ntu mape 69 83 and xgboost r2 0 91 rmse 13 22 ntu mape 60 01 with good fitting performance slope close to 1 and relative low errors with the advances in statistical learning theory the rf and xgboost as integrated algorithms based on the regression decision trees implying they could increase the generalization ability and improve model accuracy by combining multiple regression decision tree models to form model groups as a consequence the rf algorithm was used to generate turbidity maps for the investigated lakes in large scale satellite observation 2 4 spatial patterns of turbidity in lakes 20 km2 in 2021 early investigations of lake turbidity were found in regional lake groups including those in northeast china ma et al 2021 the middle and lower yangtze river hou et al 2017 and some typical lakes feng et al 2012 given the relatively high accuracy of rf turbidity algorithm a national scale assessment of turbidity in lakes area 20 km2 was generated using olci imagery fig 4 a f overall the turbidity concentration in investigated lakes ranged from 0 43 to 200 22 ntu mean 20 96 31 41 ntu consistent with those derived from fieldwork undertaken in 73 lakes table 1 large regional variation of turbidity in lakes was observed in five lake regions across china f 17 26 p 0 01 fig 4 a the turbidity levels of lakes located at npl averaged 63 31 31 62 ntu n 26 and epl 58 30 27 96 ntu n 72 showed relatively higher values than those of other lake regions fig 4 c d lakes distributed in imxl n 61 showed moderate turbidity levels with an average of 16 64 24 03 ntu fig 4b similarly the lakes at tpl n 286 had the lowest turbidity levels with an average of 7 05 19 82 ntu fig 4f followed by the lakes of ygpl with average turbidity of 11 63 13 01 ntu fig 4e when all lakes in the five lake regions were considered n 457 54 05 of them had turbidity level 10 ntu 31 73 with turbidity level ranging between 10 and 50 ntu 10 06 with turbidity level between 50 and 100 ntu and 4 16 with a turbidity level range of 100 200 ntu fig 4h therefore it can conclude that most of the clear lakes dominated the spatial distribution pattern of turbidity maps further considering the total cumulated surface area of lakes 56 401 23 km2 within different turbidity levels it can be shown that the area proportion were 63 89 0 10 ntu 17 97 10 50 ntu 15 53 50 100 ntu and 2 61 100 ntu fig 5 this may be explained by the relatively clear lakes with low turbidity concentration tended to be provided with relatively large area indicating the lake self purification capacity wen et al 2022 high turbidity levels can be observed in lake groups located in east china for example in the songnen plain in npl and the lower yangtze river basin e g lake taihu lake hongze lake gaoyou and lake chaohu in epl consistent with previous total suspended mater observations wen et al 2022 not surprisingly distribution of eutrophic and shallow lakes in the first terrain ladder were separated by the hu s line and about 90 of chinese lakes in east of this line contained loadings from anthropogenic induced terrestrial inputs likewise lake characteristics such as lake depth were also found to be important in aquatic environments qin et al 2020 and our in situ measured turbidity concentrations in lake chagan average depth of 3 m and lake xinkai average depth of 4 5 m showed relatively high turbidity levels table 1 similar to the lake groups in the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang river duan et al 2009 shallow lakes are more likely to experience sediment re suspension which enhances the scattering and absorption of light by cdom and particulate matter indirectly increasing the amount of nutrients required by chlorophyll a leading to higher turbidity levels in lakes in npl and epl by contrast the majority of lakes in ygpl with consistently large depths such as the approximately 155 meter deep lake fuxian had low turbidity level the high altitude lakes of the tpl were demonstrated to have low turbidity levels song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in general the spatial pattern of the lake turbidity is determined by numerous geographical and environmental factors particularly for integrated parameter affected by complex optical active substances such as turbidity as we noted above the high elevation less anthropogenic activities and intensive solar radiance in tpl makes lakes there showed optical characteristics similar to oceanic waters then the glacier fed lakes were dominated with low levels of chlorophyll a nutrients and total suspended solids zhang et al 2019 which could rarely contributed to optical absorption and scattering in waters particularly for colored dissolved organic matter cdom they will undergo photochemical degradation and transfer to uncolored because of solar radiances in tpl song et al 2019 2 5 inter annual dynamics of turbidity in typical lakes our developed rf algorithm performed with satisfactory stability and accuracy in optically complex lakes in national turbidity mapping here we selected sixed typical lakes i e lake hulun in imxl lake chagan in npl lake taihu in epl lake dianchi in ygpl lake selinco in tpl and lake qinghai in tpl to examine the feasibility and application of rf to capture the inter annual variations of turbidity using olci imagery fig 6 lake hulun is a typical large lake in imxl and has experienced a remarkable variation of eutrophication when the surrounding has undergone rapid economic development since 2000 recently the water quality of lake hulun has been deteriorating and algal blooms have frequently appeared chen et al 2021 during 2016 2021 lake hulun showed an increase at first and then decreased from 2016 to 2021 with an average turbidity of 40 89 ntu fig 6a wang et al 2021 reported that the annual fluctuation of total suspended matter is mainly affect by the surface area and depth variations located in the semi arid region of china lake chagan a seventh largest brackish and shallow lake showed an average turbidity of 67 46 ntu with a decreasing tendency 5 65 ntu per year fig 6b lake chagan is easily affected by strong wind prevailing and has always received farmland drainage from da an and qianguo irrigation districts previous studies duan et al 2009 have reported that eutrophication and algal blooms are widely observed in lake taihu and lake dianchi over the past six years the average turbidity in taihu lake was 60 93 ntu with an increasing tendency 3 17 ntu per year fig 6c as a shallow lake wind effect can easily cause the re suspension of sediment give rise to the highly turbid waters the turbidity concentrations in lake taihu exhibited large spatial heterogeneity because of the intensive anthropogenic activities and complex environmental factor act on the water turbidity in different sub regions of lake lake dianchi showed an average turbidity of 46 57 ntu fig 6d and highly turbid waters can be found in the north there was a slightly decreasing trend in turbidity 2 31 ntu per year in lake dianchi during the observation period overall the spatiotemporal variations of lake turbidity in lake selinco averaged turbidity of 2 02 ntu and lake qinghai averaged turbidity of 2 13 ntu generally showed stable levels the turbidity levels of lake selinco then increased at a rate of 0 15 ntu per year over the past 6 years while turbidity levels increased at a rate of 0 28 ntu per year in lake qinghai 2 6 turbidity variations versus elevation and land use water quality can be affected by terrestrial inputs particularly the inputs of optically active substances such as suspended particles nutrients and dissolved organic matter from soil erosion chen et al 2021 considering the spatial patterns of turbidity in lakes distributed in the five lake regions and typical lakes lake turbidity levels at different elevations were further investigated and significant differences were found fig 7 and table s3 f 18 93 p 0 001 the results showed that 20 35 of lakes distributed in plain regions with an elevation of 0 200 m had higher turbidity levels average 59 94 ntu fig 7a across china 2 84 of the lakes distributed between 200 and 500 m had relatively low turbidity averaged 5 49 ntu fig 7b this may be due to the combined influence of terrain and a dense urbanized human population distributed in southeast china as divided by hu s line between 500 and 1000 m lake turbidity levels average 30 11 ntu showed a negative relationship with elevation fig 7c examination of the derived data revealed that lake hulun accounted for 89 30 of the total lake area at elevation intervals and was severely eutrophic with high turbidity both due to human activities and climatic factors additionally the turbidity of lakes located at 1000 2000 m 2000 3500 m and 3500 m had averages of 18 03 8 57 and 6 58 ntu respectively fig 7 d f this study also investigated how changes in lake turbidity were affected by land use in the area around lakes 20 km2 using the 2021 turbidity map fig 8 f 17 06 p 0 001 as shown in fig 8a and table s4 24 07 of lakes with the highest turbidity 56 97 ntu were lakes surrounded by cropland indicating the significant influence of soil erosion on turbidity lakes surrounded by barren land accounted for 17 72 of the total lakes with low plant cover favoring soil erosion possibly being the reason for their relatively high turbidity 11 22 ntu a low turbidity level 8 06 ntu was observed in lakes surrounded by grasslands accounting for 56 24 of the total lakes lakes surrounded by forests accounted for 1 97 of the total and had the lowest turbidity level 4 71 ntu fig 8 and table s4 lake watersheds with barren grass and forest land use types were generally less affected by anthropogenic activities and potential terrestrial inputs because they were demonstrated to be effective in preventing soil erosion verstraeten et al 2002 the results of the spatial patterns of turbidity in the five lake regions and their typical lakes were consistent with those of earlier studies ma et al 2021 hou et al 2017 wen et al 2022 although a driving force analysis of other environmental factors was not conducted in this study this suggests that the rf turbidity algorithm developed here was applicable and capable of filling in gaps in the quantitative research data of lake turbidity additionally the dataset and algorithm can serve as a reference for applications using the esa sentinel 3 olci data 2 7 challenge and future application global lakes increasingly being monitored and new algorithms by satellite observations are being derived it remains challenging to develop a universal quantitative algorithm including lake turbidity machine learning deep learning algorithms would bring us new solutions coupling with remote sensed big data in understanding the complex biogeochemical processes as our results point out machine learning algorithms typically performed better than those of sr and plsr algorithms in large scale applications as mentioned above see section 3 2 the red nir band showed good correlation with in situ measured turbidity concentration however in productive inland waters it is difficult to obtain accurate atmospherically corrected rrs λ due to the large errors in the nir band li et al 2013 therefore in large scale applications a robust model is necessary could avoid or minimize errors and improve accuracy machine learning deep learning algorithms can be used as a good alternative to empirical and semi analytical algorithms however the different machine learning algorithms have different predictive ability and it is important to choose the appropriate machine learning algorithms nevertheless the choice of hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms and the representativeness of the training dataset can also limit the performance of the algorithms therefore research on optimization methods for hyperparameters and field measurements collected from different scenarios will be necessary for our future work in addition more environmental factors e g elevation land use climate factors and lake depth could be added in machine learning algorithms as input variables to improve model generalization ability 3 conclusion the spatiotemporal variability of lake turbidity is closely linked to the reflectance extracted from olci data for productive lakes and the use of machine learning techniques has potential for predicting water quality based on 1081 lake samples collected from typical lakes across china from 2016 to 2021 the accuracy and potential applicability of the developed turbidity algorithms were tested and reliable nationwide turbidity products were generated for lakes with surface areas larger than 20 km2 the findings of this study are as follows 1 machine learning algorithms showed optimal performance compared to those of regression algorithms sr and plsr for turbidity prediction 2 the developed rf algorithm outperformed the other machine learning algorithms e g svr bp knn and xgboost with a validated performance of r2 0 92 and relative errors mape 54 32 rmse 12 65 ntu 3 the accuracy of developed turbidity algorithms for a calibrated dataset was considerably enhanced by hyperparameter optimization and grid search cross validation 4 a nationwide lake turbidity product was generated and analyzed in five lake regions and lakes in the epl and npl showed higher turbidity levels than those in other lake regions elevation and land use changes drove the spatial patterns of turbidity in the lakes investigated our results confirmed the potential of the rf algorithm on quantifying turbidity concentration while the olci imagery with its multiple spectral bands can be used to reveal the spatial distribution patterns we recommend that our in situ measured dataset and rf turbidity algorithm development efforts should be applied further for sensor applications and improvements in sentinel satellites further this study s dataset can be extended to aquatic ecosystem management in the context of climate change credit authorship contribution statement yong li

1811,turbidity has a substantial effect on light propagation in water and is an optical indicator for monitoring water quality the ocean and land colour instrument olci installed in the sentinel 3 satellite could help to monitor turbidity variations due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high revisit time this makes us develop suitable turbidity algorithms for mapping the dynamics of lake turbidity using olci imagery in this study a total of 1081 samples were collected from 73 typical lakes across china during 2017 2022 here we developed and proposed applicable turbidity algorithms i e sr simple regression plsr partial least squares regression svr support vector regression bp backpropagation neural network knn k nearest neighbor rf random forest and xgboost extreme gradient boosting which integrate a broad scale dataset of turbidity ranging from 0 15 ntu to 262 57 ntu using olci imagery the performance results of developed turbidity algorithms demonstrated that rf obtained performed best with good agreements of measured and derived fitting validation dataset r2 0 92 mape 54 32 rmse 12 65 ntu this allowed us to estimate turbidity concentration in chinese lakes with a surface area 20 km2 the averaged turbidity level of lake groups in five lake regions was investigated with a decreased tendency as northeast plain lake region npl 63 31 ntu eastern plain lake region epl 58 30 ntu inner mongolia xinjiang lake region imxl 16 64 ntu yunnan guizhou plateau lake region ygpl 11 63 ntu tibetan plateau lake region tpl 7 05 ntu further we analyze the distributions of lake turbidity considering different land use types and the results showed a decreasing tendency as cropland 56 97 ntu barren land 11 22 ntu grassland 8 06 ntu forest 4 71 ntu our results demonstrated and highlighted the quantification of lake turbidity concentrations using olci imagery and the stability of the rf algorithm which can generate turbidity data for large scale monitoring and decision making related to environmental protection keywords turbidity sentinel 3 olci machine learning random forest data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction lakes are a crucial component of terrestrial hydrospheres together with terrestrial ecosystems lake ecosystems participate in global material cycles and serve a wide range of functions including controlling river runoff irrigation water provision for industry and drinking and breeding aquatic organisms gleick 2003 awange 2022 while it plays an important role in the development of the national economy lake water quality is vulnerable to the dual impact of climate change and human activities that affect the environment and has a sensitive response to both o reilly et al 2003 woolway et al 2020 consequently long term monitoring and regulation of water quality are necessary to ensure the sustainable utilization of lake resources the use of clean and turbid enable direct visual perception of water quality as a first order description turbidity a comprehensive water quality parameter reflects the inherent optical properties of the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water due to optically active matter such as chlorophyll a and total suspended matter dogliotti et al 2015 nechad et al 2010 thus turbidity is an essential parameter for evaluating water quality it is a regular parameter measured in situ in many lakes in particular it has been suggested as a monitoring parameter for assessing ecosystem functions in the eu marine strategy framework directive since 2008 european commission 2008 continuously large scale observations of lake turbidity can increase the understanding of aquatic environmental conditions including the effects of dynamic natural and anthropogenic activities such as land use soil erosion and urban expansion around lakes kumarasiri et al 2022 ma et al 2010 mccarthy et al 2018 understanding of lake water quality monitoring has increased owing to developments in satellite remote sensing kutser et al 2020 it gained more insights to understand geochemical processes and enabled the detection of high frequency and large scale applications for lake turbidity in comparison to conventional in situ measurement methods several satellite sensors including thematic mapper enhanced thematic mapper operational land imager geostationary ocean color imager and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer etc are widely used to quantify turbidity and map its spatiotemporal patterns bustamante et al 2009 doxaran et al 2006 doxaran et al 2009 wang et al 2020 although they were not specifically designed for inland waters considering the growing interest in satellite sensors for spatiotemporal resolution radiometric resolution and large scale applications appropriate satellite sensors related to turbidity algorithms are required ocean and land colour instrument olci equipped in sentinel 3 satellite offer a narrower spectral bandwidth of 7 5 10 nm table s1 which can identify the complex optical properties of lakes in greater detail likewise the revisit time of olci is 0 9 days for latitudes above 30 and 1 1 days in the equatorial region which presents a major advantage for observing rapidly changing turbidity shen et al 2020 global datasets with a 300 m resolution based on olci data for lake turbidity levels developed by the copernicus global land service program have become available however turbidity data for specific regional lake groups or years were used to calibrate these datasets which is insufficient for tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of turbidity at a multi decadal scale or for large scale observations more importantly these datasets showed an underestimation validation for our study s in situ measured turbidity of lakes across china fig s1 to this end it is necessary to develop an appropriate turbidity algorithm using an olci sensor shifting the focus from a regional scale to a large scale overview of geographical areas remote sensing algorithms for lake turbidity remain particularly challenging because of the complex optical properties of inland lakes li et al 2021 numerous algorithms have been developed to quantify turbidity and empirical algorithms based on mathematical functions and statistical theories have been widely applied choi et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 these algorithms have a simple model relationship that can be used to rapidly map turbidity however for lake turbidity affected by many optically active substances the stability and feasibility of turbidity algorithms remain relatively limited as well as they would not show a linear relationship in some cases the use of simple mathematical functions to elucidate the relationship between turbidity and reflectance is similarly limited ma et al 2021 wang et al 2019 machine learning methods no longer rely on fixed combinations of bands and can describe well the nonlinear relationships between the target and feature variables in many dimensions facilitating the investigation of lake environments schulz et al 2018 we could accurately parameterize the variables responding to turbidity and their optical properties as input variables in algorithms li et al 2021 therefore machine learning algorithms for remotely sensed estimations of water qualities have become popular due to advances in algorithm development and computing power pahlevan et al 2020 peterson et al 2020 in view of the lack of turbidity algorithm and olci sensor application for chinese lakes this study develops machine learning algorithms for turbidity estimation with in situ measured turbidity collected from lakes across china further this methodology allows monitoring turbidity in all lakes in china that are larger than 20 km2 in size the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the relationships between olci reflectance and turbidity 2 calibrate and validate the turbidity algorithm by typical machine learning algorithms for estimating turbidity with in situ datasets 3 map the turbidity in unique lakes and 4 examine the spatial distributions of lake turbidity considering different land use types 1 1 study region china is a vast country and its climatic topographical and geological surroundings differ considerably between regions based on natural hydrologic regionalization the lakes are divided into five regions wang and dou 1998 i e the tibetan plateau lake region tpl inner mongolia xinjiang lake region imxl eastern plain lake region epl northeast plain lake region npl and yunnan guizhou plateau lake region ygpl fig 1 the tpl and imxl belong to the endorheic region with a semi arid climate with most lakes distributed in the region being saline or brackish areas the epl ygpl and npl are exorheic regions where lakes are freshwater lakes with an asian monsoonal humid climate tpl has the largest number of lakes 1 055 lakes with an area 1 km2 and total lake surface area 41 831 7 km2 in china ma et al 2011 these lakes are less impacted by anthropogenic activities because of their high elevations and intense solar radiation resulting in fewer nutrient inputs and high lake clarity song et al 2020 epl and imxl have 634 and 514 lakes respectively with total surface areas of 21 053 km2 and 12 589 9 km2 respectively ma et al 2011 of which most lakes in the epl are eutrophic and shallow owing to the unreasonable utilization of water resources such as aquaculture many lakes located in the imxl have shrunk and anthropogenic activities in recent decades accelerated this process ma et al 2010 ygpl has the smallest number of lakes 65 and surface area 1 240 3 km2 followed by npl number of lakes 425 total area 12 589 9 km2 ma et al 2011 most of the lakes in the ygpl are tectonic lakes which rely on surface water and groundwater recharge with long water exchange cycles and fragile ecosystems with the rapidly growing population and associated economy in the watersheds these lakes distributed in ygpl are undergoing accelerated eutrophication zhang et al 2019 in addition the majority of lakes in the npl are surrounded by agricultural cropland and their water quality is vulnerable to agricultural activities 1 2 in situ data collection and laboratory analysis in this study 1081 samples were collected from 73 lakes across china between 2017 and 2022 fig 1 from april to november ice free period for some typical lakes repeated sampling was conducted in different seasons and years table s2 the fieldwork was conducted under cloudless weather and low wind speeds the dataset included a wide range of water quality characteristics and bio optical and radiometric variability from oligotrophic lakes e g lake qinghai and eutrophic lakes e g lake chaohu and lake hulun sampling site locations were recorded using a gps receiver g350 unistrong china lake samples were collected approximately 0 5 m below the surface and stored in acid washed polyethylene bottles for laboratory analysis additionally a multiparameter water quality probe ysi 6600 usa was used to determine water quality parameters such as turbidity and ph 1 3 image acquisition and processing olci level 1b fr full resolution imagery was downloaded from the nasa ocean color website https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov first a total of 83 cloud free scenes of images were downloaded to match the field of the investigated lakes from 2017 to 2022 within 5 d time window song et al 2020 tebbs et al 2013 over 80 of the total radiation signals received by the satellite sensor originated from the atmosphere and only 3 15 of the radiation originated from lakes martins et al 2017 the atmospheric correction for oli lite acolite processor which has been reported to have excellent performance for sentinel series satellite images vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 was used to remove atmospheric effects and obtain the reflectance at olci bands oa1 oa21 then a 3 3 pixel centered reflectance rrs λ at each station with cv 10 was employed to assure the uniformity of sampled distribution toming et al 2016 with the develop turbidity algorithm in this study the spatial distribution of turbidity in investigated 457 lakes surface area greater than 20 km2 in 2021 was examined as well as the annual variation in turbidity in selected 6 typical lakes during 2016 2021 similarly cloud free olci imagery also corrected by the acolite processor was used and the reflectance of lake pixels for each image was acquired to estimate turbidity concentration then the annual averaged turbidity of every lake was calculated for all available olci images captured within one lake throughout the year all images were acquired during an ice free period april to november by visual inspection finally 4507 scenes of images were used to map national turbidity for 457 lakes across and 1042 scenes of images were used to map the annual turbidity for selected 6 typical lakes table s5 1 4 lake masks and environmental data collection lake boundaries were used to extract turbidity maps processed from the olci satellite data we referred to the lake boundary dataset in 2020 from zhang et al 2019 to find lakes with a surface area larger than 20 km2 then the normalized difference water index gao 1996 was used to extract accurate water pixels for every olci image both in national and signal scales turbidity mapping simultaneously a normalized difference vegetation index was used to extract and remove the area of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation huete et al 2002 which could have an impact on estimating turbidity concentration in addition in order to avoid the effects of mixed pixels and adjacency effects these extracted lake boundaries need to be buffered inwards by 1 water pixel 300 m for lake boundaries abiotic factors acting on water qualities in large scale observation were demonstrated song et al 2020 li et al 2021 2022 in our study we considered the land use and altitude factors on spatial national distributions of turbidity estimating from our developed algorithm the land use dataset in 2021 with nine categories e g cropland forest shrub grassland water snow ice barren impervious and wetland was obtained from zenodo https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5816591 developed by yang and huang 2021 altitude data used in this study was derived from dem data collected from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn the datasets were reprocessed via stitching cropping and re projection in arcgis 10 6 software esri inc redlands ca usa 1 5 machine learning algorithms in this study we employed seven representative machine learning algorithms most widely used in remote sensing and environment science such as simple regression sr partial least squares regression plsr support vector regression svr backpropagation neural network bp k nearest neighbor knn random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost to ensure the feasibility of these developed turbidity algorithms all in situ measured turbidity and their match up reflectance were randomly divided into a calibration dataset n 721 and a validation dataset n 360 in python 3 10 software correlation analyses of turbidity with all possible bands and their combinations ratios plus minus differences etc for our pooled datasets were conducted to preliminarily select the most sensitive spectral variables based on the correlation coefficients the most sensitive spectral variables were used to build a simple regression sr algorithm for turbidity estimates further these all sensitive bands and band combinations responding to in situ measured turbidity concentrations were seen as input variables of machine learning algorithms and partial least squares regression plsr to strengthen the robustness the output variables are turbidity concentrations plsr can extract explanatory variables also called principal components and effectively eliminate the effect of multicollinearity in the data to construct regression equations helland 2014 1 5 1 support vector regression svr proposed by vapnik 1999 is a machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory and is less dependent on the amount of sample data support vector regression svr is an extension of svm and can be classified into linear and nonlinear regressions when conventional regression methods are used the loss is not calculated until the predicted and actual values are equal svr introduces an ε insensitive loss function i e the loss is calculated only when f x y ε at that time as follows 1 f x ω φ x b 2 l ε f x y 0 f x y ε f x y ε o t h e r s where f x is the regression function φ x is the kernel function that converts a nonlinear regression problem into a linear regression problem ε is the tolerance bias and l ε f x y is the loss function this is equivalent to constructing an interval band of width 2 ε centered on the square of the regression equation and calculating the loss only when the sample falls outside the interval band it is generally difficult to directly identify the appropriate ε to ensure that most of the training samples can be within the interval band therefore svr introduces a relaxation factor ξ i i 1 2 n allowing some samples to be outside the interval bands according to the structural risk minimization criterion the optimization problem of the best svr regression function can be defined as follows 3 min ω b ξ i ξ i 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to 4 s t f x i y i ε ξ i y i f x i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c represents the algorithm s tolerance for error and is a penalty factor used to weigh the empirical risk against structural risk 1 5 2 backpropagation neural network the backpropagation neural network bp is a multilayer feedforward neural network based on multilayer perceptrons it consists of two processes forward propagation of the signal and back propagation of the error the input signal acts on the output node through the hidden layer and undergoes a nonlinear transformation to produce an output signal if the desired output real value does not match the network output predicted value it can be transferred to the error backpropagation stage glorot and bengio 2010 when the error is back propagated the bp neural network adjusts the connection weights and thresholds of the neurons layer by layer through the output layer toward the input layer according to the gradient descent method huang et al 2006 after repeated training until the difference between two adjacent errors was less than the specified value or a predetermined number of learning times is reached the network training stops additionally bp typically uses the mean square error as the loss function and the error of the kth sample can be defined as follows 5 e k 1 2 j 1 m y j k o j k 2 where m is the number of neurons in the output layer y j k the expected output and o j k the network output for n samples the overall error can be expressed as 6 e k 1 2 k 1 n j 1 m y j k o j k 2 1 5 3 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn algorithm could offer the advantages of a straightforward algorithm and high accuracy it is a regression prediction algorithm based on pattern recognition theory which uses the concept of matching patterns to match k samples from the training set that are most similar to the input variables it then uses the weighted average of the response variables of these samples as the prediction results of the input variables goldberger et al 2004 the commonly used distance metric parameters are the euclidean manhattan and minkowski distances 1 5 4 tree based integration algorithms the rf is a bagging parallel integrated learning method based on the regression decision tree which uses the bagging method to randomly select samples from the original training set with put back to form multiple mutually independent sub training sets for example if a training set with n samples is used and each time a sub training set of size m m n is taken out from this data set with put back a total of k times are selected k models are trained and learned according to these k sub training sets in the regression problem these k models were used to make predictions and the mean of the predicted values was taken as the final result breiman 2001 7 h x 1 k k 1 k h i x compared with rf xgboost is a boosting tandem integration learning method that is based on a regression decision tree it constructs a new regression decision tree based on the negative gradient direction of the loss function of the previous regression decision tree and gradually reduces the loss by iterative methods such that the predicted value is close to the true value chen and guestrin 2016 assuming k trees the final prediction for the ith sample can be defined as follows 8 y i k 1 k f k x i f k f where y i is the predicted value of the xgboost algorithm for the i t h sample k is the number of regression decision trees f is the set of all regression decision trees and f k x i is the predicted value of the k t h number of regression decision trees 1 6 hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms the parameters can be divided into two types the parameter learned during the training process such as the weight parameters and bias parameters of each neuron in bp and the parameter that needs to be predefined during the construction of the algorithm naming hyperparameters such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer of bp neural networks and activation functions by setting appropriate hyperparameters the performance and efficiency of the algorithms can be significantly improved the grid search cross validation method creates a multidimensional grid in the hyperparameter space each dimension of the grid represents a hyperparameter to be optimized and each grid point represents a combination of hyperparameters and the accuracy of the model is compared for different combinations of parameters using an iterative approach ultimately the best combination of hyperparameters is determined bergstra and bengio 2012 in this study the hyperparameters of the svr bp knn and rf algorithms were provided by the scikit learn machine learning package and the hyperparameters of the xgboost algorithm were provided by the xgboost machine learning package for svr optimization the kernel function types regularization coefficients and kernel coefficients determine the functions that are transformed into higher dimensional spaces and resist overfitting smola and schölkopf 2004 the key parameters of bp are the activation function the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate a limited number of hidden layer neurons is insufficient to train the neural network and will decrease the model s accuracy a large number of hidden layer neurons will lengthen the training process and cause the model to overfit jin et al 2000 the knn algorithm is a special machine learning algorithm in which the distance metrics for weights and the number of neighboring points k determine its accuracy the rf and xgboost algorithms are integrated algorithms based on decision trees and they have similar hyperparameters such as the number of decision trees and maximum depth similarly the learning rate also has a significant impact on the accuracy of the xgboost algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 1 7 statistical analyses and model accuracy assessment statistical analyses such as correlation and regression analyses were performed using python 3 10 the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models and are defined as follows 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 11 mape 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where n represents the number of samples y i and y i are the in situ measured and predicted turbidity concentrations by our turbidity algorithms respectively y is the in situ measured averaged turbidity concentration determination coefficient r2 is often used to represent model prediction performance and root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape are also used to examine agreement between the measured and predicted values with a slope of linear regression close to 1 2 results and discussion 2 1 characteristics of in situ measured turbidity descriptions of lake turbidity are summarized in table 1 the turbidity concentrations ranged from 0 15 to 262 57 ntu with a median value of 33 36 ntu and a mean value of 46 02 46 37 ntu over the observation period likewise our lake dataset contains typical turbid lakes with turbidity exceeding 200 ntu at some sampling sites collected in lake chagan 124 28e 45 25 n and lake xingkai 132 53e 45 27 n it can be found that the biogeochemical characteristics of the 73 lakes across china are diverse indicating the differences of geobiochemical circulation and anthropogenic activities overall a lake turbidity dataset was created with 238 match ups at the 0 10 ntu level 467 match ups at the 10 50 ntu level 257 match ups at the 50 100 ntu level and 119 match ups at the 100 ntu level from lake surveys conducted during various seasons across china significant differences in lake turbidity were observed among the five lake regions f 41 11 p 0 01 the lakes in npl had the highest averaged turbidity mean 58 74 49 67 ntu with large ranges of 0 92 262 57 ntu than those in other lake regions the majority of lakes are distributed in the songnen plain surrounding by developed regions with intensive agriculture ma et al 2021 with high turbidity levels while other scattered lakes located in southeastern mountainous areas have a relatively clean status fig 1 for lakes in epl the turbidity concentrations ranged from 0 19 to 245 43 ntu with an average value of 45 49 44 35 ntu where these lakes are shallow and eutrophic affected by the anthropogenic activities in previous studies li et al 2021 2022 the investigated lakes in imxl and ygpl showed relatively moderate turbidity levels as the turbidity concentrations in imxl ranged from 0 18 to 225 66 ntu with an average value of 35 03 34 33 ntu and those in ygpl had a range of 14 00 61 00 ntu with an average value of 24 02 8 88 ntu respectively not surprisingly lakes located at the tpl exhibited low turbidity levels with an average turbidity of 3 69 5 75 ntu as well as the great spatial heterogeneity this may be due to their high altitude average elevation above 4000 m alimentation of glacier and less anthropogenic activities 2 2 selection of olci spectral bands response to turbidity the averaged rrs λ spectra extracted from atmospheric corrected olci bands oa1 oa21 considering different turbidity levels i e 0 10 ntu n 238 10 50 ntu n 467 50 100 ntu n 257 and 100 ntu n 119 is shown in fig 2 in general the averaged rrs λ spectra within different turbidity levels showed followed a similar shape with the high turbidity concentration could be related to the high rrs λ signals for all samples there were significant differences for rrs λ spectra within different turbidity levels f 14 22 p 0 001 concurrently the averaged rrs λ spectra within 50 100ntu and 100 ntu levels presented a similar shape at 443 nm 490 nm 510 nm and 560 nm and this may due to the saturation in reflectance signals doxaran et al 2002 however we also found a slight increase in rrs 1016 at 0 10 ntu level owing to the light absorption in the near infrared is dominated by pure water and water leaving radiance is zero ouillon et al 1997 the radiance from the skylight may dominate in addition there were significant differences f 568 09 983 14 p 0 001 for rrs λ spectra in red bands from 620 nm 665 nm 674 nm 681 nm and 709 nm within different turbidity levels indicating that they were sensitive to turbidity concentration or its optical characteristic jointly modulated by optically active substances this was consistent with previous studies matsushita et al 2015 li et al 2021 that a sufficient signal to noise ratio at red or nir bands were required to quantify water qualities in turbid waters although we also found there were significant differences f ranged 103 36 to 316 19 p 0 001 for rrs λ spectra in near infrared nir bands from 754 nm 768 nm 779 nm 865 nm and 884 nm within different turbidity levels turbidity as a comprehensive parameter to characterize the water quality both driven by suspended particulate matter and phytoplankton scattering of which solids often are provided with strong backscattering at red or nir wavelengths the narrower olci bands provided the increased sensitivity to the turbidity which integrating absorption and scatter properties of optically active substances pearson correlation coefficients were used to select sensitive bands or their band combinations in response to the in situ measured turbidity table 2 the results showed that the single band reflectance exhibited moderate and strong linear correlations at the 99 confidence level for most of the olci bands except for the oa21 band 1016 nm this agreed with the findings of previous studies dogliotti et al 2015 liversedge 2007 that the energy in the red and nir bands of the electromagnetic spectrum favored the detection of sediments in contrast band combinations revealed more significant correlations between the corresponding rrs λ and in situ measured turbidity than those of the single band when all band combinations were examined we found the oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 and oa6 oa12 oa6 oa21 associated with the rrs 560 rrs 665 rrs 709 and rrs 1020 were all strongly corrected to lake turbidity with r 0 80 in terms of the sensitive band combinations of oa8 oa11 the band ratio could remove residual atmospheric effects such as the oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 also exhibited the significant correlation r 0 82 p 0 01 wang et al 2020 2 3 calibration and validation of turbidity algorithms 2 3 1 hyperparameter optimization for machine learning algorithms table 3 showed the hyperparameter optimization results of machine learning algorithms using the cross validation grid search for our pooled datasets then the determine coefficient r2 and rmse were used to evaluate the optimal configuration of developed machine learning algorithms for estimating turbidity several sensitive bands and band combinations with pearson coefficient r 0 6 were used as the input variables table 2 for svr optimization the kernel function of rbf radial basis function kernel coefficient and regularization coefficient of 3000 and 10 were the optimal parameter combinations in the svr regression fit r2 0 81 rmse 20 17 ntu then the results of the cross validation grid search showed that bp algorithm performed optimally r2 0 76 rmse 22 57 ntu when the number of hidden layer neurons was 120 the activation function was relu and learning rate was 0 13 respectively when the manhattan distance metric with six neighboring points were used the performance of the knn algorithm were the most consistent r2 0 77 rmse 22 07 ntu further the rf algorithm performed well with the relatively high accuracy r2 0 81 rmse 19 99 ntu when the number of decision trees the maximum depth and the minimum number of leaf node samples were 150 12 and 1 respectively finally the xgboost algorithm showed the highest accuracy r2 0 82 rmse 19 53 ntu when the learning rate number of decision trees and maximum depth were 0 02 300 and 6 respectively 2 3 2 comparison of algorithms performance the linear fitting of measured and predicted turbidity concentrations by our developed turbidity algorithms were conducted for machine learning and plsr algorithms we selected 15 variables as input variables to build turbidity algorithms e g oa7 oa8 oa9 oa10 oa11 oa12 oa15 oa16 oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 oa11 oa16 oa6 oa12 and oa6 oa12 oa6 oa21 with the significant correlation r 0 6 p 0 01 between turbidity and reflectance it also can be noted that the band combination of oa8 oa11 oa6 oa21 was selected to build an sr turbidity algorithm fig 3 a and table 2 overall the machine learning algorithms employed to develop turbidity algorithms performed better than those of regression algorithms including sr and plsr for calibration and validation dataset expect for slightly overfit svr algorithm fig 3 and table 4 it can be suspected that the high dimensionality 15 input variables may result in the significant overfit for svr validation by contrast among these available machine learning algorithms to estimate turbidity rf algorithm r2 0 92 rmse 12 65 ntu mape 54 32 outperformed the bp r2 0 80 rmse 20 30 ntu mape 134 99 knn r2 0 87 rmse 15 81 ntu mape 69 83 and xgboost r2 0 91 rmse 13 22 ntu mape 60 01 with good fitting performance slope close to 1 and relative low errors with the advances in statistical learning theory the rf and xgboost as integrated algorithms based on the regression decision trees implying they could increase the generalization ability and improve model accuracy by combining multiple regression decision tree models to form model groups as a consequence the rf algorithm was used to generate turbidity maps for the investigated lakes in large scale satellite observation 2 4 spatial patterns of turbidity in lakes 20 km2 in 2021 early investigations of lake turbidity were found in regional lake groups including those in northeast china ma et al 2021 the middle and lower yangtze river hou et al 2017 and some typical lakes feng et al 2012 given the relatively high accuracy of rf turbidity algorithm a national scale assessment of turbidity in lakes area 20 km2 was generated using olci imagery fig 4 a f overall the turbidity concentration in investigated lakes ranged from 0 43 to 200 22 ntu mean 20 96 31 41 ntu consistent with those derived from fieldwork undertaken in 73 lakes table 1 large regional variation of turbidity in lakes was observed in five lake regions across china f 17 26 p 0 01 fig 4 a the turbidity levels of lakes located at npl averaged 63 31 31 62 ntu n 26 and epl 58 30 27 96 ntu n 72 showed relatively higher values than those of other lake regions fig 4 c d lakes distributed in imxl n 61 showed moderate turbidity levels with an average of 16 64 24 03 ntu fig 4b similarly the lakes at tpl n 286 had the lowest turbidity levels with an average of 7 05 19 82 ntu fig 4f followed by the lakes of ygpl with average turbidity of 11 63 13 01 ntu fig 4e when all lakes in the five lake regions were considered n 457 54 05 of them had turbidity level 10 ntu 31 73 with turbidity level ranging between 10 and 50 ntu 10 06 with turbidity level between 50 and 100 ntu and 4 16 with a turbidity level range of 100 200 ntu fig 4h therefore it can conclude that most of the clear lakes dominated the spatial distribution pattern of turbidity maps further considering the total cumulated surface area of lakes 56 401 23 km2 within different turbidity levels it can be shown that the area proportion were 63 89 0 10 ntu 17 97 10 50 ntu 15 53 50 100 ntu and 2 61 100 ntu fig 5 this may be explained by the relatively clear lakes with low turbidity concentration tended to be provided with relatively large area indicating the lake self purification capacity wen et al 2022 high turbidity levels can be observed in lake groups located in east china for example in the songnen plain in npl and the lower yangtze river basin e g lake taihu lake hongze lake gaoyou and lake chaohu in epl consistent with previous total suspended mater observations wen et al 2022 not surprisingly distribution of eutrophic and shallow lakes in the first terrain ladder were separated by the hu s line and about 90 of chinese lakes in east of this line contained loadings from anthropogenic induced terrestrial inputs likewise lake characteristics such as lake depth were also found to be important in aquatic environments qin et al 2020 and our in situ measured turbidity concentrations in lake chagan average depth of 3 m and lake xinkai average depth of 4 5 m showed relatively high turbidity levels table 1 similar to the lake groups in the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang river duan et al 2009 shallow lakes are more likely to experience sediment re suspension which enhances the scattering and absorption of light by cdom and particulate matter indirectly increasing the amount of nutrients required by chlorophyll a leading to higher turbidity levels in lakes in npl and epl by contrast the majority of lakes in ygpl with consistently large depths such as the approximately 155 meter deep lake fuxian had low turbidity level the high altitude lakes of the tpl were demonstrated to have low turbidity levels song et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in general the spatial pattern of the lake turbidity is determined by numerous geographical and environmental factors particularly for integrated parameter affected by complex optical active substances such as turbidity as we noted above the high elevation less anthropogenic activities and intensive solar radiance in tpl makes lakes there showed optical characteristics similar to oceanic waters then the glacier fed lakes were dominated with low levels of chlorophyll a nutrients and total suspended solids zhang et al 2019 which could rarely contributed to optical absorption and scattering in waters particularly for colored dissolved organic matter cdom they will undergo photochemical degradation and transfer to uncolored because of solar radiances in tpl song et al 2019 2 5 inter annual dynamics of turbidity in typical lakes our developed rf algorithm performed with satisfactory stability and accuracy in optically complex lakes in national turbidity mapping here we selected sixed typical lakes i e lake hulun in imxl lake chagan in npl lake taihu in epl lake dianchi in ygpl lake selinco in tpl and lake qinghai in tpl to examine the feasibility and application of rf to capture the inter annual variations of turbidity using olci imagery fig 6 lake hulun is a typical large lake in imxl and has experienced a remarkable variation of eutrophication when the surrounding has undergone rapid economic development since 2000 recently the water quality of lake hulun has been deteriorating and algal blooms have frequently appeared chen et al 2021 during 2016 2021 lake hulun showed an increase at first and then decreased from 2016 to 2021 with an average turbidity of 40 89 ntu fig 6a wang et al 2021 reported that the annual fluctuation of total suspended matter is mainly affect by the surface area and depth variations located in the semi arid region of china lake chagan a seventh largest brackish and shallow lake showed an average turbidity of 67 46 ntu with a decreasing tendency 5 65 ntu per year fig 6b lake chagan is easily affected by strong wind prevailing and has always received farmland drainage from da an and qianguo irrigation districts previous studies duan et al 2009 have reported that eutrophication and algal blooms are widely observed in lake taihu and lake dianchi over the past six years the average turbidity in taihu lake was 60 93 ntu with an increasing tendency 3 17 ntu per year fig 6c as a shallow lake wind effect can easily cause the re suspension of sediment give rise to the highly turbid waters the turbidity concentrations in lake taihu exhibited large spatial heterogeneity because of the intensive anthropogenic activities and complex environmental factor act on the water turbidity in different sub regions of lake lake dianchi showed an average turbidity of 46 57 ntu fig 6d and highly turbid waters can be found in the north there was a slightly decreasing trend in turbidity 2 31 ntu per year in lake dianchi during the observation period overall the spatiotemporal variations of lake turbidity in lake selinco averaged turbidity of 2 02 ntu and lake qinghai averaged turbidity of 2 13 ntu generally showed stable levels the turbidity levels of lake selinco then increased at a rate of 0 15 ntu per year over the past 6 years while turbidity levels increased at a rate of 0 28 ntu per year in lake qinghai 2 6 turbidity variations versus elevation and land use water quality can be affected by terrestrial inputs particularly the inputs of optically active substances such as suspended particles nutrients and dissolved organic matter from soil erosion chen et al 2021 considering the spatial patterns of turbidity in lakes distributed in the five lake regions and typical lakes lake turbidity levels at different elevations were further investigated and significant differences were found fig 7 and table s3 f 18 93 p 0 001 the results showed that 20 35 of lakes distributed in plain regions with an elevation of 0 200 m had higher turbidity levels average 59 94 ntu fig 7a across china 2 84 of the lakes distributed between 200 and 500 m had relatively low turbidity averaged 5 49 ntu fig 7b this may be due to the combined influence of terrain and a dense urbanized human population distributed in southeast china as divided by hu s line between 500 and 1000 m lake turbidity levels average 30 11 ntu showed a negative relationship with elevation fig 7c examination of the derived data revealed that lake hulun accounted for 89 30 of the total lake area at elevation intervals and was severely eutrophic with high turbidity both due to human activities and climatic factors additionally the turbidity of lakes located at 1000 2000 m 2000 3500 m and 3500 m had averages of 18 03 8 57 and 6 58 ntu respectively fig 7 d f this study also investigated how changes in lake turbidity were affected by land use in the area around lakes 20 km2 using the 2021 turbidity map fig 8 f 17 06 p 0 001 as shown in fig 8a and table s4 24 07 of lakes with the highest turbidity 56 97 ntu were lakes surrounded by cropland indicating the significant influence of soil erosion on turbidity lakes surrounded by barren land accounted for 17 72 of the total lakes with low plant cover favoring soil erosion possibly being the reason for their relatively high turbidity 11 22 ntu a low turbidity level 8 06 ntu was observed in lakes surrounded by grasslands accounting for 56 24 of the total lakes lakes surrounded by forests accounted for 1 97 of the total and had the lowest turbidity level 4 71 ntu fig 8 and table s4 lake watersheds with barren grass and forest land use types were generally less affected by anthropogenic activities and potential terrestrial inputs because they were demonstrated to be effective in preventing soil erosion verstraeten et al 2002 the results of the spatial patterns of turbidity in the five lake regions and their typical lakes were consistent with those of earlier studies ma et al 2021 hou et al 2017 wen et al 2022 although a driving force analysis of other environmental factors was not conducted in this study this suggests that the rf turbidity algorithm developed here was applicable and capable of filling in gaps in the quantitative research data of lake turbidity additionally the dataset and algorithm can serve as a reference for applications using the esa sentinel 3 olci data 2 7 challenge and future application global lakes increasingly being monitored and new algorithms by satellite observations are being derived it remains challenging to develop a universal quantitative algorithm including lake turbidity machine learning deep learning algorithms would bring us new solutions coupling with remote sensed big data in understanding the complex biogeochemical processes as our results point out machine learning algorithms typically performed better than those of sr and plsr algorithms in large scale applications as mentioned above see section 3 2 the red nir band showed good correlation with in situ measured turbidity concentration however in productive inland waters it is difficult to obtain accurate atmospherically corrected rrs λ due to the large errors in the nir band li et al 2013 therefore in large scale applications a robust model is necessary could avoid or minimize errors and improve accuracy machine learning deep learning algorithms can be used as a good alternative to empirical and semi analytical algorithms however the different machine learning algorithms have different predictive ability and it is important to choose the appropriate machine learning algorithms nevertheless the choice of hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms and the representativeness of the training dataset can also limit the performance of the algorithms therefore research on optimization methods for hyperparameters and field measurements collected from different scenarios will be necessary for our future work in addition more environmental factors e g elevation land use climate factors and lake depth could be added in machine learning algorithms as input variables to improve model generalization ability 3 conclusion the spatiotemporal variability of lake turbidity is closely linked to the reflectance extracted from olci data for productive lakes and the use of machine learning techniques has potential for predicting water quality based on 1081 lake samples collected from typical lakes across china from 2016 to 2021 the accuracy and potential applicability of the developed turbidity algorithms were tested and reliable nationwide turbidity products were generated for lakes with surface areas larger than 20 km2 the findings of this study are as follows 1 machine learning algorithms showed optimal performance compared to those of regression algorithms sr and plsr for turbidity

ntu 3 the accuracy of developed turbidity algorithms for a calibrated dataset was considerably enhanced by hyperparameter optimization and grid search cross validation 4 a nationwide lake turbidity product was generated and analyzed in five lake regions and lakes in the epl and npl showed higher turbidity levels than those in other lake regions elevation and land use changes drove the spatial patterns of turbidity in the lakes investigated our results confirmed the potential of the rf algorithm on quantifying turbidity concentration while the olci imagery with its multiple spectral bands can be used to reveal the spatial distribution patterns we recommend that our in situ measured dataset and rf turbidity algorithm development efforts should be applied further for sensor applications

1812,phase transition of pore water is a fundamental reason for frost heave in cold regions therefore studying the variation in unfrozen water content is of great significance for understanding the freezing process of pore water and revealing the freezing mechanism in soils in this study a prediction model for unfrozen water content was established based on a probabilistic ice forming model to determine the heterogeneous nucleation rate which is the key variation in the probabilistic model the relationship between the water film thickness and temperature variation in the soil was characterized based on the improved premelting theory in this process the equivalent particle size and density of impurities on the surface of the particles were determined by introducing the particle size distribution curve and average accumulation mode of the particles based on the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism of ice crystals and the variation in the water film a relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate and temperature was established subsequently a method for calculating the equivalent contact angle related to pore water in soils was presented the results showed that the heterogeneous nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle are positively and negatively correlated with the equivalent particle size at the same temperature respectively and the angle decreases with increasing solution concentration furthermore the experimental data of 10 different soils showed that the variation in water content obtained by our model was in good agreement with the experimental values particularly during the stage of rapid water phase change the study developed an effective correlation among heterogeneous nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle of pore water and physical properties of soil by combining crystallization theory and premelting theory which provided a new way to explain water freezing and predict unfrozen water content in soils keywords

introduction when the temperature decreases below 0 c not all water freezes due to the capillary action and particle surface energy in soil which quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created lang and kohn 1970 spaans and baker 1996 xu et al 2010 unfrozen water ice and air coexist in the pores of soil and these different phases interact in a complex manner and affect the soil water heat mechanical properties some researchers believe that water movement occurs through a thin film of unfrozen water on the soil matrix beskow and fil 1935 and that this process is accompanied by solute migration the growth of pore ice blocks the water transport path thus reducing the soil permeability coefficient gilpin 1980 watanabe and flury 2008 the compressive and tensile strength of soils was enhanced by ice cementation bragg and andersland 1981 christ and kim 2009 additionally the thermodynamic properties of soil were determined by the respective volume content of water ice gas phase and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity increased as water content increased lu et al 2021 and the determination of these parameters is of vital importance for engineering design in cold regions such as tunnels yan et al 2018 subgrades pei et al 2021 petroleum pipelines leng et al 2010 and piers tian et al 2021 generally the unfrozen water content is a function of temperature and is widely used in numerical simulations of multiple physical fields in geotechnical engineering in cold regions lai et al 2021 many techniques and methods have been used to measure the unfrozen water content of frozen soil such as nuclear magnetic resonance nmr time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflection fdr differential scanning calorimetry dsc water potential and resistivity patterson and smith 1980 wen et al 2012 liu et al 2020 wan et al 2022b chuvilin et al 2022 the above testing methods can quickly respond to changes in the liquid water content of soil but their limitations are also evident for example nmr and dsc are difficult and time consuming in sample preparation due to the size requirement and the nmr device is expensive li et al 2018 heat pulse detection overestimates the amount of ice by melting it with heat pulses zhang et al 2011 the tdr and fdr sensors need to be calibrated considering that the electrochemical properties of soils are easily impacted by soil texture and mineral content water potential and resistivity methods are relatively easily affected by the salt type and content and significant deviation appears in high salty soils tang et al 2018 chuvilin et al 2022 soil resistivity is a power function of ice content in which two parameters must be regressed using test data from various unfrozen water measurement techniques because it is time consuming and expensive to measure the unfrozen water content lu et al 2019 chuvilin et al 2022 many researchers have devoted themselves to developing prediction models for unfrozen water content anderson and tice 1972 proposed a power function model to estimate the content of unfrozen water at negative temperatures by fitting experimental data later an exponential model was developed considering the initial and residual water content michalowski 1993 bai et al 2018 these models are simple highly accurate and widely used in hydrothermal numerical simulation yan et al 2018 lai et al 2021 pei et al 2021 lu et al 2021 tian et al 2021 however these models rarely consider the factors that affect unfrozen water content including soil type soil particle distribution salt type and salt content initial water content and overburden pressure and the physical meanings of the parameters in these models are unclear it is complicated and a challenge to establish a model considering the influence of various factors on unfrozen water content thus some theories have been developed to explain the presence of unfrozen water in frozen soil including surface effect that refers to variations in particle surface area and surface energy due to the changes in particle properties particle size particle surface charge density etc adsorption force double electric layer theory and capillary action based on these theories semi empirical and theoretical models have been developed bai et al 2018 chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 which reveal the water freezing mechanism in soil and most of the parameters in the models have clear physical significance wettlaufer 1998 explained the changes in the water film in porous materials through surface effects and based on this research watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 estimated the unfrozen water content in frozen soil by considering the distribution of cylindrical pores on the surface of particles chai et al 2018 considered the capillary action and surface effect in soil and estimated the unfrozen water content by calculating the reduction in the freezing point of bound and capillary water during the freezing process however the theoretical freezing point of bound water differs from laboratory results jin et al 2020 unfrozen water was assumed to be a cationic solution on the surface of clay particles under the influence of the surface effect and a theoretical model based on the electric bilayer structure was established to calculate the unfrozen water content of frozen soil jin et al 2020 teng et al 2021 proposed a model for the unfrozen water content in saturated frozen soil at the pore scale by considering the adsorption and capillary effects between soil particles and the ice interface and verified it with pure sand the above models provide theoretical guidance for the analysis of unfrozen water content but most of them calculate the capillary pressure based on the young laplace equation in the calculation process the contact angle is usually regarded as a constant zhou 2013 teng et al 2021 which is inconsistent with the experimental results the contact angle quantifies the physicochemical interactions at the liquid solid interface and influences the nucleation rate of ice crystals and therefore is critical for many physical processes involving soil and water interactions zobrist et al 2007 zhou 2013 limited studies have described the change in liquid water content from the nucleation and growth of ice crystals in soil pores the contact angle between the ice and water interface and substrate in soil pores is closely related to ice crystal growth and can be used to reflect the difficulty of water freezing wan and yang 2020 empirical rules for the freezing point unfrozen water content and contact angle have been provided in previous studies wan et al 2020 wan et al 2022c however the theoretical model of the contact angle during the freezing process has not been established based on the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism a prediction model of unfrozen water content was proposed in this study by reflecting the variation in the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle with the variation in water film thickness in the freezing process of pore water the prediction model was verified using relevant unfrozen water content data and the effects of the particle size and salt concentration on the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle during water freezing were analyzed subsequently the application of the model to unsaturated soil was analyzed and discussed finally three existing unfrozen water content models were compared with the proposed model at different temperature intervals 2 crystallization and premelting theory the theory of heterogeneous nucleation describes ice formation in porous media suggesting that the freezing of water is a matter of probability and is applied to predict the unfrozen water content in soil wan et al 2022b however the key variable equivalent contact angle is obtained by regression of experimental data the premelting theory considers the structure charging characteristics impurity concentration and some microscopic characteristics of porous media and the theory can be used to estimate the unfrozen water content in porous medium by water film width variation moreover the physical significance of the parameters in premelting theory is clear wan et al 2022a therefore in this section the relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate and water film thickness can be established by equalizing the unfrozen water contents calculated separately using the above two theories and the calculation model of the contact angle in the freezing process is theoretically given 2 1 heterogeneous nucleation in soil nucleation of ice crystals in soil is a heterogeneous process according to the ice forming process in pores wan et al 2020 the water freezing process in soil can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 in stage ⅰ the temperature ranges from the initial freezing point to 5 c the theory of heterogeneous nucleation showed that a water drop was easy to freeze with a smaller contact angle and experimental results li et al 2014 liu et al 2016 demonstrated the order of water freezing is from large to small pores thus we concluded that smaller contact angles occur preferentially in large pores wan et al 2022c and ice crystals form and grow rapidly this stage is characterized by the rapid growth of ice crystals and the nucleation rate and unfrozen water content changes significantly in stage ⅱ the temperature varies from 5 c to 15 c the small and medium pores are filled with ice crystals the concentration of the solution in soil increases during water freezing thereby the activity of pore water is reduced which leads to an increase in the interfacial free energy of pore water in small pores σiw and pore water are difficult to freeze with a larger contact angle the contact angle slowly increases as freezing temperature decreases in stage ii ice crystals develop and the variation in unfrozen water content is small in stage iii the temperature is below 15 c the liquid water in soil also exists in the strong bonded water film and tiny pores on the surface of the particles chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the nucleation rate and unfrozen water content remained almost unchanged with temperature thus this stage can be considered as the stable section of the ice crystal wan et al 2022b proposed a theoretical model to predict the unfrozen water content by applying the probability of water forming ice in the soil the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism and residual water content were used in this model which is expressed in eq 1 1 n w n s 1 n s n r n s 1 exp 1 q t m t j het d t where ns is the initial water content nr is the residual water content jhet is the heterogeneous nucleation rate and q is the cooling rate if we do not consider the effect of water molecules crossing the water ice interface the heterogeneous nucleation rate per unit volume per unit time on a specific contact surface can be expressed as eq 2 pruppacher and klett 1997 2 j het 2 n c k t ρ w h ρ i σ iw kt 1 2 exp δ g kt where nc refers to number of atoms in contact with the ice embryo and its value is about 5 85 1018 m 2 k is boltzmann constant and its value is 1 38 10 23 j k 1 h is planck constant and its value is 6 26 10 34j s ρw and ρi are density of water and ice and their values change with the temperature and are shown in the attached nomenclature σiw refers to free energy on the ice water interface t refers to kelvin degree and δg is total excess free energy of the ice nucleus in the derivation the simplest form of the ice nucleation interface was considered that is the interface was treated as a plane thus δg can be determined using eq 3 zobrist et al 2007 3 δ g 16 π σ iw 3 v w 2 3 k t ln s i 2 f θ where vw is volume of water molecules in the ice nucleus si is the saturation ratio of ice in the soil and f θ represents the wetting parameter which is a function of contact angle θ all calculation methods can be found in the attached nomenclature 2 2 premelting theory considering that the number of electrolyte ions in an unfrozen water film is balanced by the charge on the interface hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 proposed a relationship between the supercooling and thickness of the water film as shown in eq 4 4 ρ w q m δ t t m r g t m n im d a h 6 π d 3 q s 2 ε ε 0 1 1 κ n im d exp κ n im d where nim is the particle surface impurity density and in this manuscript it refers to the concentration of salt solution on soil particle surface and tm 273 15 k δt refers to the temperature variation i e the reduction of the initial freezing temperature d is the thickness of water film rg refers to gas constant and its value is 8 314 j mol k ah is hamaker constant qs refers to the density of surface charge ε is the relative dielectric constant of liquid water ε0 is vacuum dielectric constant qm is latent heat released per mole of water during phase transition between water and ice and κ is constant that can be estimated by eq 5 5 κ e 2 n a ε ε 0 k t m where na refers to avogadro constant and its value is 6 022 1023 mol 1 and e refers to the quantity of electron charge and its value is 1 602 10 19c when the temperature decreased below the melting point of the solid the thickness of the film depended on the properties of the intermolecular and coulomb forces in the system and the thickness was a function of the impurity concentration and degree of supercooling dash et al 2006 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 for soils when the surface density of particle is 10 μmol m2 the thickness of the pre melted film on the substrate is dominated by the solute effect wan et al 2022a usually the surface density of particles in the soil before water freezing is much greater than this value jin et al 2020 therefore the thickness of the water film in the soil can be determined by ignoring the inter molecular and coulomb forces in eq 4 and can be rewritten as 6 d r g t m 2 n im ρ w q m δ t two types of common particle accumulations have been utilized to explain pore water freezing based on the premelting theory of porous media cahn et al 1992 simple cubic packing sc and face centered cubic packing fcc wan et al 2022a deduced an equation to calculate the unfrozen water content in soils using the above two packing methods which showed that the variation in unfrozen water content in soils is in the range of two types of particle arrangements to further simplify the calculation model presented by wan et al 2022a it is assumed that the number of impurities in liquid water at different solid liquid contact surfaces is evenly distributed and the average arrangement of stacked particles is adopted that is the average of f p sc and f p fcc is taken which represent the particle volume percentage in the total volume under sc and fcc accumulation respectively the unfrozen water content in saturated soils can be calculated using eq 7 7 η w 3 f p fcc f p sc 2 4 2 2 3 1 3 4 π 16 d α r e 2 π 9 π 16 r 2 α r e 2 where the thickness of the water film d can be determined using eq 6 re is the equivalent particle size which is related to the grain size distribution curve of the soil and can be determined using eq a9 in the attached nomenclature α is the shape factor and r represents the radius of the ice water contact surface which affects the freezing temperature and can be estimated by eq 8 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 8 r σ iw ρ s q m t m δ t r g t m c 0 ρ l 1 to facilitate the calculation of the impurity density on the surface of soil particles the correlation between the pore volume concentration and impurity concentration on the particle surface under different accumulations of soil grains was established according to the geometric relationship of the particle arrangement wan et al 2022a the initial concentration of pore water c 0 was considered as the average concentration of the sc and fcc models and the concentration of impurities was calculated using eq 9 9 n im n im sc n im fcc 2 0 39 υ c 0 r e where υ is the number of electrolytic ions per unit of impurity molecular i e for nacl υ 2 both the water film thickness d and radius of the ice water contact surface r are the functions of δt eqs 6 7 and 8 are combined to establish the expression for the liquid water fraction as follows 10 η w t c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 where c 1 and c 2 are related parameters and are determined by eq 11 11a c 1 3 f p fcc f p sc 2 4 2 2 3 1 3 4 π 16 r g t m 2 υ ρ l q m 11b c 2 2 π 9 π 16 σ iw ρ s q m υ 1 t m 2 2 3 variation of unfrozen water content during the water freezing process liquid water should be stratified according to its properties the double electric layer theory explains the adsorption force of a water film on the surface of clay particles according to the type of adsorption force the water film is divided into an adsorption layer solution that is subject to van der waals force valence force and electrostatic force and a diffusion layer solution that is subject to electrostatic force the electrostatic force decreases exponentially with the distance from the particle surface moreover water films can be divided into volume water capillary water and bound water according to the freezing point of these different films chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 the premelting theory assumes that frozen soil is a ternary system including a soil granular layer a premelting quasi liquid layer water film with width d and an ice crystal layer cahn et al 1992 dash et al 2006 however premelting theory does not differentiate the liquid layer more accurately based on the properties of the water film the residual water content is essentially a type of strong bound water film that is different from bulk water and capillary water and the differences are mainly reflected in the values of ph density and chemical potential wang et al 2022b to effectively use the rule of liquid water fraction based on the premelting theory more effectively and explain the variation in the solid liquid contact angle in frozen soil during the freezing process residual saturation is considered in our calculation and eq 10 can be modified as follows 12 η w t 1 η r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 η r where ηr is the residual water saturation of soil which is the ratio of volume of residual water to the volume of total pore in soil residual water is water film adsorbed on the particle surface which is explained by wang et al 2018 2022a in their hydraulic model the premelting theory describes the relationship between the liquid water fraction of the soil and δt to reconcile the unit of liquid water content used in the premelting theory with the unit in the ice formation probability model the relationship between volumetric water content of soil and liquid water fraction is written as eq 13 combined with the pore ratio of the soil 13 n w e ρ w 1 e ρ d η w where ρd is the dry density of the soil and e is its pore ratio combining eqs 12 and eq 13 the prediction model for the unfrozen water content based on the variation in the thickness of the water film was obtained as follows 14 n w t n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 n r where nr can be determined using eq 15 chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 15 n r a s ρ d ρ bw δ where as is the specific surface area of the soil ρbw is the density of the residual water film and its value is obtained by eq a2 if the initial water content ws is known and δ is the thickness of the residual water film usually assumed to be 1 5 nm in the calculation wang et al 2022b 3 method previous studies have shown that when the initial supercooling of water is ignored the unfrozen water content changes slightly during the freezing and melting processes at a certain soil temperature zhou et al 2020 it is reliable to predict the unfrozen water content of frozen soil based on the probabilistic ice forming model which is used to characterize the change in ice crystal content and determine the variation in water film thickness at negative temperatures based on the premelting theoretical model the prediction accuracies of the two models were verified using experimental data hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 wan et al 2022a c in this section relevant data from six types of soil were adopted to verify our proposed model assuming ice embryo nucleation and growth in a plane substrate during the freezing process the relationship between the nucleation rate and degree of supercooling during the freezing process was determined based on the variation in the water film using this information a prediction model for the volumetric water content in soils based on ice forming probability was developed 3 1 relationship between nucleation rate and δt the heterogeneous nucleation rate could be obtained using eqs 2 and 3 and the precondition was that we need to know the value of the solid liquid contact angle θ however θ is impossible to measure at both microscopic and macroscopic scales zobrist et al 2007 and in our calculation it was a hypothetical equivalent angle and could be obtained by heterogeneous nucleation rate the probabilistic ice forming model connects the heterogeneous nucleation rate to the volumetric water content in the soil eq 16 could be obtained by transforming eq 1 16 ln n w n r n s n r q t m t j het d t the essence of residual unfrozen water is an adsorptive layer solution with stable properties when the temperature is below tr the unfrozen water content remains unchanged and can be regarded as constant michalowski 1993 lu et al 2019 the initial volumetric water content of the saturated soil is related to the pore structure of the soil in the unfrozen state and is temperature independent the analytical expression for jhet can be obtained by taking the derivative of t on both sides of eq 16 17 j het q n w n r d n w dt combined with eq 14 and eq 17 relationship between jhet and δt is built as follows 18 j het q n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 1 n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t 2 2 c 2 α r e 2 δ t 3 it can be seen from eq 18 that jhet is independent of the initial water content and residual water content and decreases as the cooling rate increases or the temperature decreases moreover jhet is related to soil properties such as the concentration of the solution in the soil and the distribution of soil particle size the unfrozen water content was determined by combining eq 1 and eq 18 on the condition of obtaining the relationship between jhet and δt which is written as 19 n w n s 1 n s n r n s 1 c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 considering that the initial freezing point of soil is usually not 0 c the calculated unfrozen water content curve needs to move to the initial freezing point to meet the actual freezing condition wan et al 2022a to illustrate the calculation process of the model proposed in this study a flowchart is shown in fig 2 3 2 relationship between equivalent contact angle and δt eq 2 and eq 3 show that the contact angle is a critical factor affecting jhet if the pore size and substrate where ice nucleation is located are different various solid liquid contact shapes will be formed in the pores at the same temperature moreover the geometry of soil particles can also lead to different ice crystal morphology fig 3 a and b by simplifying water freezing in soil the simplest form of the ice nucleus was used in our study as shown in fig 3c if ice nuclei grew on a flat substrate the macroscopic equivalent contact angle was used to reflect the probability of the ice formation in the soil thus f θ is written as pruppacher and klett 1997 20 f θ 1 4 2 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 the solving process of equivalent contact angle is described as follows firstly using eq 18 we obtain the values of jhet then δg is calculated by eq 2 next f θ can be obtained from eq 3 finally the equivalent contact angle was determined by eq 20 using data fitting between f θ and θ the calculation process is illustrated in fig 2 4 results and analysis 4 1 estimation of the proposed model to validate the unfrozen model proposed in this paper ten groups of test data including 108 data points were utilized leng et al 2010 wen et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 watanabe and wake 2009 the physical parameters of the six types of saturated soil are listed in table 1 including soil type dry density initial volumetric water content equivalent particle size and specific surface area in this table the specific surface area was obtained by the fractal dimension method based on the particle size distribution sepaskhah and tafteh 2013 and the equivalent particle size was obtained according to eq a9 in the attached nomenclature and the particle size distribution of clay is not mentioned in the original literature which is usually 4 μm xu et al 2010 wan et al 2022b the decrease of the freezing point of soil is attributed to concentration of salt solution and the initial concentration in soil is approximately 0 05 mol l when the freezing point is taken as 0 2 c based on the calculated equation of saturated soil wan et al 2015 variation of unfrozen water content in δt is drawn in fig 4 based on eq 19 and the initial supercooling was ignored in the calculations the calculated values of unfrozen water content are basically consistent with the experimental values when α 0 24 and nr 0 080 for clay α 0 27 and nr 0 039 for silty clay α 0 27 and nr 0 1 for silty clay α 0 35 and nr 0 085 for silt α 0 52 and nr 0 075 for silty sand and α 0 60 and nr 0 005 for sand the unfrozen water content changed rapidly when δt was within the 5 k range and slowly decreased as δt increased in a range of 5 k to 10 k our proposed model effectively reflects the relationship between the unfrozen water content and the temperature variation the model can simulate the variation of unfrozen water content in the rapid growth stage of ice crystals 0 δt 5 k for silty clay the absolute error between the predicted and experimental values was 0 015 our model overestimated the unfrozen water content for silty sand and sand when the δt was 15 k and for silt when δt ranged from 0 to 5 k under the same δt unfrozen water content of silty sand and sand were lower than that of clay silty clay and silt and showed larger change rate eq 19 indicates that the content of unfrozen water decreases as the equivalent particle size increases the shape factors of silty sand and sand differ significantly from that of other soils because of the rapid variation in the unfrozen water content near the initial freezing point as shown in fig 4 α mainly affected the rapid growth stage of ice crystals 0 δt 5 k in the freezing characteristic curve and the predicted value of unfrozen water content increased as α decreased the prediction of unfrozen water contentwas almost unaffected by parameter α when δt 5 k however the sensitivity of different soil freezing curves and nucleation rates to α was also different α varied 0 03 when the equivalent particle size was 10 μm fig 4a and 4b and unfrozen water contentfluctuated the most at δt 1 k with a change value of 0 032 m3 m 3 the effect of α on unfrozen water content decreased as the equivalent particle size increased fig 4c 4e α varied 0 20 when the equivalent particle size was 105 μm fig 5 f and the unfrozen water content varied 0 011 m3 m 3 when δt 1 k the value of nr has obvious influence on the unfrozen water curve the increase of nr caused the unfrozen water content curve to rotate counterclockwise around the initial freezing point at the corresponding coordinate points which indicated that the larger the surface area of soil the stronger the surface adsorption of soil particles the more difficult it was to freeze at low temperature 4 2 comparison with existing models three typical models on unfrozen water content were chosen to compare with our proposed model eq 19 including an empirical model proposed by anderson and tice 1972 in the form of a power function with temperature and specific surface area as parameters a semi empirical model in exponential function form presented by kozlowski 2007 considering residual water content and a theoretical model advanced by liu and yu 2013 according to soil freezing characteristic curve and clapeyron equation the comparison between predicted values and test values of six types of soil samples is shown in fig 5 the four models basically achieve accurate prediction although kozlowski s 2007 s model has some errors in predicting clay and silty clay fig 5a and b for most soils the difference between predicted values based on the proposed model and tested data decreased as δt increased the unfrozen water content estimated by anderson and tice 1972 s model was greater than the measured values when δt ranged from 0 to 20 k fig 5a c d and f the prediction effect of liu and yu 2013 s model is better than that of anderson and tice 1972 s model but it has more empirical parameters different from anderson and tice 1972 s and liu and yu 2013 models both kozlowski 2007 s model and our model considered the initial and residual values of soil water content the introduction of the residual water content determined the boundary conditions of the prediction results and improved the prediction accuracy at low temperatures δt 5 k the residual water content decreased as the specific surface area decreased and correlated with clay content wang et al 2022b eq 15 has a high accuracy in predicting the quality of soil containing clay particles jin et al 2020 but ignores the influence of the soil sample volume which leads to an increase in the initial contact angle and a decrease in the ice nucleation temperature wan et al 2020 and the water film on the surface of the particles becomes difficult to freeze therefore the determination of the residual water content parameters of small volume samples and soil with little clay content should consider specific experimental results the parameters of four models are listed in table 2 the root mean square error rmse was adopted to evaluate the performance of the models and the prediction effect shows better at a small rmse value lu et al 2019 liu and yu 2013 s model and our model had a lower rmse value in silty clay s prediction of unfrozen water content and anderson and tice 1972 s and kozlowski 2007 s models had lower rmse values in the prediction of unfrozen water content for clay and sand respectively the anderson and tice 1972 s and liu and yu 2013 s models involved two and three empirical parameters respectively and each set of parameters was only applicable to specific soils the empirical parameters u and v of the same type of soils had the same values in kozlowski 2007 s model and he believed that the water content corresponding to 12 c was the residual value whereas in our study it was 15 c there were also many studies on soil freezing characteristic curves that used the residual value of water content corresponding to 15 c lu et al 2019 wang et al 2022b as a result our model is more accurate at low temperatures than the kozlowski 2007 model similarly empirical parameters α can be determined based on soil type 4 3 variation of nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle fig 6 shows the relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate of the six types of soil and the temperature variation during the freezing process these curves were drawn using eq 18 where the cooling rate q is 1 k min wan et al 2022c variation of jhet was similar with rule of unfrozen water content as the temperature decreased the different decreased at least two orders of magnitude when δt increased to 22 k jhet changed dramatically when δt was 5 k and pore water froze more easily at higher nucleation rates and the six curves of heterogeneous nucleation rate also differ at this stage ice nucleation rate in sand was higher than that in other soils especially at the freezing point the nucleation rate of sand was as high as 0 167 m 2 s 1 while the initial nucleation rate of other soils was between 0 025 and 0 054 m 2 s 1 the test results indicated that near the freezing point of sand the speed of ice crystal generation and unfrozen water content reduction were much faster than that in other soils this phenomenon is consistent with the sfcc of sand the smaller the free energy δg required to form ice nucleus during the transition from liquid to ice the more favorable it is for the formation of ice nucleus fornea et al 2009 eqs a4 and a6 show that σiw and si increased and decreased with the decrease of a w respectively and a w decreased as the temperature decreased due to the enrichment of salt in unfrozen water during water freezing wan and yang 2020 moreover experiments had shown that pore water in macropores had greater water activity chai et al 2018 therefore δg required for pore water phase transformation in macropores during the nucleation process was smaller and the nucleation rate was greater once δt was greater than about 5 k the difference in growth and rate in the six soils was negligible fig 7 shows the relationship between the equivalent contact angle of six types of soils and the temperature variation in the freezing process the curves of the equivalent contact angle for these six soils had similar trends and the initial values of the equivalent contact angles in different soils were different the initial equivalent contact angle of silty clay of the same type was similar with a difference of 0 078 although the initial water content equivalent particle size and the freezing point of the two silty clays were different equivalent contact angle increased from 4 to 35 as δt increased rapidly from 0 to 5 k and the water in macropores had been frozen then the angle increased proportionally as δt increased when δt 15 k the equivalent contact angle increased slightly with the increment of δt compared with the second stage which indicated that pore water freezing was becoming increasingly difficult in fig 7 the equivalent contact angle decreased as the equivalent particle size increased the magnitude of the contact angle determined the degree of wetness and the contact angle itself depended on the relative size of the surface tension surface tension was related to the interfacial free energy between ice and liquid water fornea et al 2009 at the same temperature the interfacial free energy decreased as the water activity decreased koop et al 2000 the geometry of the pores caused the confined water to curve and decreased the water activity especially in small pores tian et al 2017 in addition the chemical potential and freezing point of water in small pores were much lower than those in large pores wan and yang 2020 chen et al 2021 thus the equivalent contact angle decreased as the pore size increased the pore size formed among the soil particles was positively correlated with particle size qiu et al 2020 it also indicated that clay had the maximum equivalent contact angle under the same δt which was consistent with the calculated results fig 5 4 4 application of the model in unsaturated soils frozen soil is often unsaturated and damage to infrastructure due to gas migration in unsaturated frozen soil wan and yang 2020 according to the unsaturated soil theory kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the matric suction of soil increases with a decrease in the initial water content as air saturation the ratio of air volume to total pore volume increases the tensile stress on the water film in the soil pores increases and liquid water does not easily turn into ice under these conditions the water retention of unsaturated soil was described by the soil water characteristic curve which represents the relationship between matric suction and water content most existing models for predicting the unsaturated soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc were developed based on the vg and fx models of the soil water characteristic curve swcc liu and yu 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the application of these models requires the acquisition of a soil water characteristic curve swcc and the determination of three parameters without obvious physical significance in this study the melting behavior between the ice crystal and gas interface was ignored the freezing curves of five groups of unsaturated silty clays were predicted and the influence of the ice air interface on the soil freezing curves was indirectly observed the variation in the liquid content when air saturation was ηa 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 40 determined using equation ηw 1 ηa and combining with eqs 13 and 19 is shown in fig 8 a initial freezing point of soil was related to air saturation qiu et al 2020 and the predicted values showed relatively large differences with the tested values in the range of δt from 0 to 2 k but the prediction showed the variation of unfrozen water content well fig 8b shows the difference between the predicted and experimental values when δt was within 5 k range the prediction was less than the test values and the difference exceeded 0 015 m3 m 3 as δt varied from 0 5 k to 2 k the accuracy was highest when δt 5 k when δt 5 k the predicted unfrozen water content of soils with different initial saturations was higher than the experimental value but the error was within 0 010 m3 m 3 and the error changed slowly with temperature so the prediction effect was accurate the results also showed that the difference between the predicted values and the experimental values of different air saturations decreased as δt increased in addition when the air saturation exceeded 0 15 the error became increasingly evident when δt was 5 k the variation of unfrozen water content tended to be consistent for different air saturations 4 5 influence factors of jhet and θ assuming the soil system was composed of soil with one particle size the effects of soil particle size and solution concentration on the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle were analyzed jhet and θ in soils with particle size 1 10 and 100 μm during cooling process was calculated based on eq 20 and eqs 2 3 and 18 heterogeneous nucleation is a process of nonequivalent spatial position formation with the aid of an external interface wan et al 2020 particles of different sizes provide different nucleation interfacial energies on which atoms are attached to the nucleate thus reducing the degree of liquid supercooling and facilitating nucleation as shown in fig 9 the larger particles nucleate more easily when the solution concentration was 0 013 mol l the particle size changed from 1 to 10 μm and the initial nucleation rate changed from 0 1317 to 0 02031 m 3 s 1 however when the particle size increased to 100 μm the initial nucleation rate had little increase compared with that when the particle size was 10 μm moreover the equivalent contact angle did not change significantly with particle size during the cooling processes at different solution concentrations when impurities such as salt exist in soils the salt is dissolved in liquid water and decreases the chemical potential of pore water dash et al 2006 wan et al 2020 and the freezing point as shown in fig 8 for the same particle size the initial value of the contact angle increased as the solution concentration increased indicating that the pore water was more difficult to freeze the pore water continues to transform into ice as δt increases and the salt in the soil accumulates in an increasingly thin liquid water film dash et al 2006 wan and yang 2020 xiao et al 2022 resulting in a further reduction in the chemical potential of the water film meanwhile larger contact angles appear in small microapertures wan et al 2022c and ice becomes increasingly difficult to form 5 discussion existing empirical models of unfrozen water content are simple and convenient for mathematical structures and have been widely used in numerical simulations bai et al 2018 lai et al 2021 however these models usually involve at least two parameters that must be determined experimentally many researchers have connected the model parameters to soil properties through data regression to ensure that the parameters have physical significance parameters such as the plasticity index and specific surface area have been introduced in many models anderson and tice 1972 but this method can only be used for specific soils and cannot determine the commonality between different types of soil or further reveal the freezing mechanism of pore water in soil the proposed model considers the effects of various factors on the equivalent contact angle nucleation rate and unfrozen water content during the water freezing process eq 19 was used to predict the content of unfrozen water during the freezing process of the ten soil types and the accuracy of the model was verified using published experimental data fig 5 residual water content was estimated by combining the experimental results with the specific surface area of the soil residual water which actually moves as a thin film is a critical factor in describing hydrological processes wang et al 2018 2022a the value of the residual water content can be obtained by drying test van genuchten 1980 however there is a difference in residual water content during freezing and drying processes kou et al 2020 the reason is that there exists a water film forming by the premelting effect between crystal surface and grain boundary at negative temperature the width of this film is usually below 1 nm hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 the residual water content determined the boundary conditions of our model and effectively improved the prediction accuracy of unfrozen water content when δt was 5 k by comparing the parameters in our proposed model with those in most empirical models anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 liu and yu 2013 it can be observed that each parameter of the model has a clear physical meaning the proposed model is easy to apply when we know parameter α and the other basic physical parameters of soil however the relationship between the shape factor particle size and soil type was not clear and soil particle roughness may affect its value nucleation rate and contact angle varied considerably in the initial freezing period as shape factor increased which suggested α values for five different soils are given according to the sensitivity analysis of prediction unfrozen water content curve by variation of α the other category included the parameters that are related to soil properties such as the liquid concentration in the soil particle size residual water content initial water content and there are parameters need to be obtained experimentally soil usually contains a certain amount of salt the increase in liquid concentration and decrease in particle size hinder ice nucleation however the sequence of phase transition during cooling is also different owing to different types of salt for example na2so4 can crystallize before ice formation whereas nacl crystallizes after water freezing xiao et al 2020 the unfrozen water content calculated using our model is based on the ice forming probability and salt crystal precipitation in the freezing process is not considered thus the proposed model is not suitable for the soil with a high salt content which requires the introduction of the phase diagram of salt solution in porous medium if included this would improve the current model the variation of contact angle explained the hysteresis of water content in soil during the drying wetting process zhou 2013 the maximum and minimum contact angles were called the advancing and receding contact angles respectively and the angle remained a receding contact angle during drying and an advancing contact angle during wetting these two angles were not constant and changed as the number of wet and dry cycles increased zhou 2013 similarly when the temperature decreased the pore liquid did not necessarily freeze at the thermodynamic freezing point but remained in a liquid metastable state until ice nucleation the hysteresis effect of unfrozen water content also existed in the freeze thaw cycles koopmans and miller 1966 tian et al 2017 and amiri et al 2018 suggested that the difference was caused by capillary action and adsorption which enlarged the temperature interval between freezing and thawing field observation also showed evidence of hysteretic behavior during soil freeze thaw processes quinton and baltzer 2013 however the contact angle during the soil freezing process cannot be directly measured at the macro and micro level and research in this field is limited some researchers have used a high order polynomial regression of the relationship between the angle and temperature based on the acquisition of soil sfcc wan et al 2022c the model proposed in this study theoretically estimates the change in the equivalent contact angle during water freezing by combining premelting and crystallization theories providing a clear calculation method for this angle the concept of the equivalent contact angle can be used to describe the degree of freezing difficulty of different soil materials moreover the organic matter content can significantly affect the contact angle according to a study by czachor et al 2010 as the organic matter content increases in soil the contact angle decreases this is due to organic matter acting as a wetting agent reducing the surface tension of the liquid which results in a lower contact angle hysteretic effect of unfrozen water content during freeze thaw process is not considered in the present work and will be further studied in the future work the premelting theory was initially applied to saturated soils which considered two kinds of particle accumulation modes and determined the maximum and minimum unfrozen water content corresponding to a given temperature wan et al 2022a however the assumption of saturated system and the solution form of implicit function of water film thickness in the model make it difficult to apply in practice thus the solution method of water film thickness and the premelting effect were simplified based on the measured data and the mathematical structure of the simplified model was easier for numerical simulation the nucleation rate is represented by the water film thickness and the unfrozen water content is calculated based on a probabilistic ice formation model in this process the melting behavior between the ice crystal and gas interface was ignored premelting theory is applied to unsaturated soils the influence of the water film thickness at the ice air interface on the liquid content increased as the air saturation increased and an increase in air pressure reduced the initial freezing point of the soil wen et al 2012 the sfcc under different saturation states also differed wan et al 2020 experimental data verified the prediction accuracy of our model for silty clay with liquid saturation 0 4 in the stage where the nucleation rate changed dramatically the calculation method for the unfrozen water content which only considered the melting characteristics between the surface and interface of the soil and ice crystal particles when the pores were completely filled with water underestimated the unfrozen water content fig 8 thus it is necessary to consider the influence of the water air interface on the premelting behavior establish the relationship between the contact angle and temperature under unsaturated conditions correct the influence of air pressure on the freezing curve when pore water experiences a drastic phase transformation and improve the calculation accuracy of the unfrozen water content in unsaturated soils 6 conclusion based on the premelting and crystallization theories a prediction model of unfrozen water content was developed the calculation method of the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle in the freezing process was established theoretically the applicability of our model in unsaturated soils was analyzed and discussed moreover our proposed model was compared with three other typical models and the accuracy of our model was verified the main conclusions are as follows 1 the ice nucleation rate was independent of the initial and residual water contents the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle of different soils exhibited the same variation trend during the water freezing process the ice nucleation rate increases with the increase of the equivalent particle size 2 the value of the equivalent contact angle reflects the degree of difficulty of the pore water ice phase change when the soil freezes the contact angle increases nonlinearly for δt 5 k and 15 k and has a linear relationship with δt between 5 k and 15 k for most soils the initial equivalent contact angle was 15 at the same temperature the equivalent contact angle increases with a decrease of solution concentration and increase of particle size 3 the unfrozen water content predicted by our proposed model was consistent with the test results for most soils particularly for clay and silty clay in the application of unsaturated soil when the air saturation is 0 4 and the δt variation from initial freezing point is within 5 k the predicted value of the proposed model underestimates the unfrozen water content and the error is 0 025 m3 m 3 when the temperature variation from the initial freezing point was 5 k the change in matric suction caused by the increase in air pressure could be ignored in the calculation of the unfrozen water content the shape factor varies from 0 24 to 0 6 for most of soils and increases as the equivalent particle size increases as with most theoretical models there are limitations and further research is needed to improve the new model in future research we will improve the prediction accuracy of the model in soils with high salinity and low saturation which requires consideration of salt crystallization precipitation and premelting behavior at the ice gas interface simultaneously the correlation between the hysteresis effect of the contact angle and hysteresis phenomenon of unfrozen water content in the freeze thaw cycle is also a subject we are studying in addition we are focusing on physical meaning and determination of shape parameters in

1812,phase transition of pore water is a fundamental reason for frost heave in cold regions therefore studying the variation in unfrozen water content is of great significance for understanding the freezing process of pore water and revealing the freezing mechanism in soils in this study a prediction model for unfrozen water content was established based on a probabilistic ice forming model to determine the heterogeneous nucleation rate which is the key variation in the probabilistic model the relationship between the water film thickness and temperature variation in the soil was characterized based on the improved premelting theory in this process the equivalent particle size and density of impurities on the surface of the particles were determined by introducing the particle size distribution curve and average accumulation mode of the particles based on the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism of ice crystals and the variation in the water film a relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate and temperature was established subsequently a method for calculating the equivalent contact angle related to pore water in soils was presented the results showed that the heterogeneous nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle are positively and negatively correlated with the equivalent particle size at the same temperature respectively and the angle decreases with increasing solution concentration furthermore the experimental data of 10 different soils showed that the variation in water content obtained by our model was in good agreement with the experimental values particularly during the stage of rapid water phase change the study developed an effective correlation among heterogeneous nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle of pore water and physical properties of soil by combining crystallization theory and premelting theory which provided a new way to explain water freezing and predict unfrozen water content in soils keywords

introduction when the temperature decreases below 0 c not all water freezes due to the capillary action and particle surface energy in soil which quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created lang and kohn 1970 spaans and baker 1996 xu et al 2010 unfrozen water ice and air coexist in the pores of soil and these different phases interact in a complex manner and affect the soil water heat mechanical properties some researchers believe that water movement occurs through a thin film of unfrozen water on the soil matrix beskow and fil 1935 and that this process is accompanied by solute migration the growth of pore ice blocks the water transport path thus reducing the soil permeability coefficient gilpin 1980 watanabe and flury 2008 the compressive and tensile strength of soils was enhanced by ice cementation bragg and andersland 1981 christ and kim 2009 additionally the thermodynamic properties of soil were determined by the respective volume content of water ice gas phase and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity increased as water content increased lu et al 2021 and the determination of these parameters is of vital importance for engineering design in cold regions such as tunnels yan et al 2018 subgrades pei et al 2021 petroleum pipelines leng et al 2010 and piers tian et al 2021 generally the unfrozen water content is a function of temperature and is widely used in numerical simulations of multiple physical fields in geotechnical engineering in cold regions lai et al 2021 many techniques and methods have been used to measure the unfrozen water content of frozen soil such as nuclear magnetic resonance nmr time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflection fdr differential scanning calorimetry dsc water potential and resistivity patterson and smith 1980 wen et al 2012 liu et al 2020 wan et al 2022b chuvilin et al 2022 the above testing methods can quickly respond to changes in the liquid water content of soil but their limitations are also evident for example nmr and dsc are difficult and time consuming in sample preparation due to the size requirement and the nmr device is expensive li et al 2018 heat pulse detection overestimates the amount of ice by melting it with heat pulses zhang et al 2011 the tdr and fdr sensors need to be calibrated considering that the electrochemical properties of soils are easily impacted by soil texture and mineral content water potential and resistivity methods are relatively easily affected by the salt type and content and significant deviation appears in high salty soils tang et al 2018 chuvilin et al 2022 soil resistivity is a power function of ice content in which two parameters must be regressed using test data from various unfrozen water measurement techniques because it is time consuming and expensive to measure the unfrozen water content lu et al 2019 chuvilin et al 2022 many researchers have devoted themselves to developing prediction models for unfrozen water content anderson and tice 1972 proposed a power function model to estimate the content of unfrozen water at negative temperatures by fitting experimental data later an exponential model was developed considering the initial and residual water content michalowski 1993 bai et al 2018 these models are simple highly accurate and widely used in hydrothermal numerical simulation yan et al 2018 lai et al 2021 pei et al 2021 lu et al 2021 tian et al 2021 however these models rarely consider the factors that affect unfrozen water content including soil type soil particle distribution salt type and salt content initial water content and overburden pressure and the physical meanings of the parameters in these models are unclear it is complicated and a challenge to establish a model considering the influence of various factors on unfrozen water content thus some theories have been developed to explain the presence of unfrozen water in frozen soil including surface effect that refers to variations in particle surface area and surface energy due to the changes in particle properties particle size particle surface charge density etc adsorption force double electric layer theory and capillary action based on these theories semi empirical and theoretical models have been developed bai et al 2018 chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 which reveal the water freezing mechanism in soil and most of the parameters in the models have clear physical significance wettlaufer 1998 explained the changes in the water film in porous materials through surface effects and based on this research watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 estimated the unfrozen water content in frozen soil by considering the distribution of cylindrical pores on the surface of particles chai et al 2018 considered the capillary action and surface effect in soil and estimated the unfrozen water content by calculating the reduction in the freezing point of bound and capillary water during the freezing process however the theoretical freezing point of bound water differs from laboratory results jin et al 2020 unfrozen water was assumed to be a cationic solution on the surface of clay particles under the influence of the surface effect and a theoretical model based on the electric bilayer structure was established to calculate the unfrozen water content of frozen soil jin et al 2020 teng et al 2021 proposed a model for the unfrozen water content in saturated frozen soil at the pore scale by considering the adsorption and capillary effects between soil particles and the ice interface and verified it with pure sand the above models provide theoretical guidance for the analysis of unfrozen water content but most of them calculate the capillary pressure based on the young laplace equation in the calculation process the contact angle is usually regarded as a constant zhou 2013 teng et al 2021 which is inconsistent with the experimental results the contact angle quantifies the physicochemical interactions at the liquid solid interface and influences the nucleation rate of ice crystals and therefore is critical for many physical processes involving soil and water interactions zobrist et al 2007 zhou 2013 limited studies have described the change in liquid water content from the nucleation and growth of ice crystals in soil pores the contact angle between the ice and water interface and substrate in soil pores is closely related to ice crystal growth and can be used to reflect the difficulty of water freezing wan and yang 2020 empirical rules for the freezing point unfrozen water content and contact angle have been provided in previous studies wan et al 2020 wan et al 2022c however the theoretical model of the contact angle during the freezing process has not been established based on the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism a prediction model of unfrozen water content was proposed in this study by reflecting the variation in the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle with the variation in water film thickness in the freezing process of pore water the prediction model was verified using relevant unfrozen water content data and the effects of the particle size and salt concentration on the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle during water freezing were analyzed subsequently the application of the model to unsaturated soil was analyzed and discussed finally three existing unfrozen water content models were compared with the proposed model at different temperature intervals 2 crystallization and premelting theory the theory of heterogeneous nucleation describes ice formation in porous media suggesting that the freezing of water is a matter of probability and is applied to predict the unfrozen water content in soil wan et al 2022b however the key variable equivalent contact angle is obtained by regression of experimental data the premelting theory considers the structure charging characteristics impurity concentration and some microscopic characteristics of porous media and the theory can be used to estimate the unfrozen water content in porous medium by water film width variation moreover the physical significance of the parameters in premelting theory is clear wan et al 2022a therefore in this section the relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate and water film thickness can be established by equalizing the unfrozen water contents calculated separately using the above two theories and the calculation model of the contact angle in the freezing process is theoretically given 2 1 heterogeneous nucleation in soil nucleation of ice crystals in soil is a heterogeneous process according to the ice forming process in pores wan et al 2020 the water freezing process in soil can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 in stage ⅰ the temperature ranges from the initial freezing point to 5 c the theory of heterogeneous nucleation showed that a water drop was easy to freeze with a smaller contact angle and experimental results li et al 2014 liu et al 2016 demonstrated the order of water freezing is from large to small pores thus we concluded that smaller contact angles occur preferentially in large pores wan et al 2022c and ice crystals form and grow rapidly this stage is characterized by the rapid growth of ice crystals and the nucleation rate and unfrozen water content changes significantly in stage ⅱ the temperature varies from 5 c to 15 c the small and medium pores are filled with ice crystals the concentration of the solution in soil increases during water freezing thereby the activity of pore water is reduced which leads to an increase in the interfacial free energy of pore water in small pores σiw and pore water are difficult to freeze with a larger contact angle the contact angle slowly increases as freezing temperature decreases in stage ii ice crystals develop and the variation in unfrozen water content is small in stage iii the temperature is below 15 c the liquid water in soil also exists in the strong bonded water film and tiny pores on the surface of the particles chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the nucleation rate and unfrozen water content remained almost unchanged with temperature thus this stage can be considered as the stable section of the ice crystal wan et al 2022b proposed a theoretical model to predict the unfrozen water content by applying the probability of water forming ice in the soil the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism and residual water content were used in this model which is expressed in eq 1 1 n w n s 1 n s n r n s 1 exp 1 q t m t j het d t where ns is the initial water content nr is the residual water content jhet is the heterogeneous nucleation rate and q is the cooling rate if we do not consider the effect of water molecules crossing the water ice interface the heterogeneous nucleation rate per unit volume per unit time on a specific contact surface can be expressed as eq 2 pruppacher and klett 1997 2 j het 2 n c k t ρ w h ρ i σ iw kt 1 2 exp δ g kt where nc refers to number of atoms in contact with the ice embryo and its value is about 5 85 1018 m 2 k is boltzmann constant and its value is 1 38 10 23 j k 1 h is planck constant and its value is 6 26 10 34j s ρw and ρi are density of water and ice and their values change with the temperature and are shown in the attached nomenclature σiw refers to free energy on the ice water interface t refers to kelvin degree and δg is total excess free energy of the ice nucleus in the derivation the simplest form of the ice nucleation interface was considered that is the interface was treated as a plane thus δg can be determined using eq 3 zobrist et al 2007 3 δ g 16 π σ iw 3 v w 2 3 k t ln s i 2 f θ where vw is volume of water molecules in the ice nucleus si is the saturation ratio of ice in the soil and f θ represents the wetting parameter which is a function of contact angle θ all calculation methods can be found in the attached nomenclature 2 2 premelting theory considering that the number of electrolyte ions in an unfrozen water film is balanced by the charge on the interface hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 proposed a relationship between the supercooling and thickness of the water film as shown in eq 4 4 ρ w q m δ t t m r g t m n im d a h 6 π d 3 q s 2 ε ε 0 1 1 κ n im d exp κ n im d where nim is the particle surface impurity density and in this manuscript it refers to the concentration of salt solution on soil particle surface and tm 273 15 k δt refers to the temperature variation i e the reduction of the initial freezing temperature d is the thickness of water film rg refers to gas constant and its value is 8 314 j mol k ah is hamaker constant qs refers to the density of surface charge ε is the relative dielectric constant of liquid water ε0 is vacuum dielectric constant qm is latent heat released per mole of water during phase transition between water and ice and κ is constant that can be estimated by eq 5 5 κ e 2 n a ε ε 0 k t m where na refers to avogadro constant and its value is 6 022 1023 mol 1 and e refers to the quantity of electron charge and its value is 1 602 10 19c when the temperature decreased below the melting point of the solid the thickness of the film depended on the properties of the intermolecular and coulomb forces in the system and the thickness was a function of the impurity concentration and degree of supercooling dash et al 2006 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 for soils when the surface density of particle is 10 μmol m2 the thickness of the pre melted film on the substrate is dominated by the solute effect wan et al 2022a usually the surface density of particles in the soil before water freezing is much greater than this value jin et al 2020 therefore the thickness of the water film in the soil can be determined by ignoring the inter molecular and coulomb forces in eq 4 and can be rewritten as 6 d r g t m 2 n im ρ w q m δ t two types of common particle accumulations have been utilized to explain pore water freezing based on the premelting theory of porous media cahn et al 1992 simple cubic packing sc and face centered cubic packing fcc wan et al 2022a deduced an equation to calculate the unfrozen water content in soils using the above two packing methods which showed that the variation in unfrozen water content in soils is in the range of two types of particle arrangements to further simplify the calculation model presented by wan et al 2022a it is assumed that the number of impurities in liquid water at different solid liquid contact surfaces is evenly distributed and the average arrangement of stacked particles is adopted that is the average of f p sc and f p fcc is taken which represent the particle volume percentage in the total volume under sc and fcc accumulation respectively the unfrozen water content in saturated soils can be calculated using eq 7 7 η w 3 f p fcc f p sc 2 4 2 2 3 1 3 4 π 16 d α r e 2 π 9 π 16 r 2 α r e 2 where the thickness of the water film d can be determined using eq 6 re is the equivalent particle size which is related to the grain size distribution curve of the soil and can be determined using eq a9 in the attached nomenclature α is the shape factor and r represents the radius of the ice water contact surface which affects the freezing temperature and can be estimated by eq 8 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 8 r σ iw ρ s q m t m δ t r g t m c 0 ρ l 1 to facilitate the calculation of the impurity density on the surface of soil particles the correlation between the pore volume concentration and impurity concentration on the particle surface under different accumulations of soil grains was established according to the geometric relationship of the particle arrangement wan et al 2022a the initial concentration of pore water c 0 was considered as the average concentration of the sc and fcc models and the concentration of impurities was calculated using eq 9 9 n im n im sc n im fcc 2 0 39 υ c 0 r e where υ is the number of electrolytic ions per unit of impurity molecular i e for nacl υ 2 both the water film thickness d and radius of the ice water contact surface r are the functions of δt eqs 6 7 and 8 are combined to establish the expression for the liquid water fraction as follows 10 η w t c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 where c 1 and c 2 are related parameters and are determined by eq 11 11a c 1 3 f p fcc f p sc 2 4 2 2 3 1 3 4 π 16 r g t m 2 υ ρ l q m 11b c 2 2 π 9 π 16 σ iw ρ s q m υ 1 t m 2 2 3 variation of unfrozen water content during the water freezing process liquid water should be stratified according to its properties the double electric layer theory explains the adsorption force of a water film on the surface of clay particles according to the type of adsorption force the water film is divided into an adsorption layer solution that is subject to van der waals force valence force and electrostatic force and a diffusion layer solution that is subject to electrostatic force the electrostatic force decreases exponentially with the distance from the particle surface moreover water films can be divided into volume water capillary water and bound water according to the freezing point of these different films chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 the premelting theory assumes that frozen soil is a ternary system including a soil granular layer a premelting quasi liquid layer water film with width d and an ice crystal layer cahn et al 1992 dash et al 2006 however premelting theory does not differentiate the liquid layer more accurately based on the properties of the water film the residual water content is essentially a type of strong bound water film that is different from bulk water and capillary water and the differences are mainly reflected in the values of ph density and chemical potential wang et al 2022b to effectively use the rule of liquid water fraction based on the premelting theory more effectively and explain the variation in the solid liquid contact angle in frozen soil during the freezing process residual saturation is considered in our calculation and eq 10 can be modified as follows 12 η w t 1 η r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 η r where ηr is the residual water saturation of soil which is the ratio of volume of residual water to the volume of total pore in soil residual water is water film adsorbed on the particle surface which is explained by wang et al 2018 2022a in their hydraulic model the premelting theory describes the relationship between the liquid water fraction of the soil and δt to reconcile the unit of liquid water content used in the premelting theory with the unit in the ice formation probability model the relationship between volumetric water content of soil and liquid water fraction is written as eq 13 combined with the pore ratio of the soil 13 n w e ρ w 1 e ρ d η w where ρd is the dry density of the soil and e is its pore ratio combining eqs 12 and eq 13 the prediction model for the unfrozen water content based on the variation in the thickness of the water film was obtained as follows 14 n w t n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 n r where nr can be determined using eq 15 chai et al 2018 jin et al 2020 15 n r a s ρ d ρ bw δ where as is the specific surface area of the soil ρbw is the density of the residual water film and its value is obtained by eq a2 if the initial water content ws is known and δ is the thickness of the residual water film usually assumed to be 1 5 nm in the calculation wang et al 2022b 3 method previous studies have shown that when the initial supercooling of water is ignored the unfrozen water content changes slightly during the freezing and melting processes at a certain soil temperature zhou et al 2020 it is reliable to predict the unfrozen water content of frozen soil based on the probabilistic ice forming model which is used to characterize the change in ice crystal content and determine the variation in water film thickness at negative temperatures based on the premelting theoretical model the prediction accuracies of the two models were verified using experimental data hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 wan et al 2022a c in this section relevant data from six types of soil were adopted to verify our proposed model assuming ice embryo nucleation and growth in a plane substrate during the freezing process the relationship between the nucleation rate and degree of supercooling during the freezing process was determined based on the variation in the water film using this information a prediction model for the volumetric water content in soils based on ice forming probability was developed 3 1 relationship between nucleation rate and δt the heterogeneous nucleation rate could be obtained using eqs 2 and 3 and the precondition was that we need to know the value of the solid liquid contact angle θ however θ is impossible to measure at both microscopic and macroscopic scales zobrist et al 2007 and in our calculation it was a hypothetical equivalent angle and could be obtained by heterogeneous nucleation rate the probabilistic ice forming model connects the heterogeneous nucleation rate to the volumetric water content in the soil eq 16 could be obtained by transforming eq 1 16 ln n w n r n s n r q t m t j het d t the essence of residual unfrozen water is an adsorptive layer solution with stable properties when the temperature is below tr the unfrozen water content remains unchanged and can be regarded as constant michalowski 1993 lu et al 2019 the initial volumetric water content of the saturated soil is related to the pore structure of the soil in the unfrozen state and is temperature independent the analytical expression for jhet can be obtained by taking the derivative of t on both sides of eq 16 17 j het q n w n r d n w dt combined with eq 14 and eq 17 relationship between jhet and δt is built as follows 18 j het q n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 1 n s n r c 1 n im α r e δ t 2 2 c 2 α r e 2 δ t 3 it can be seen from eq 18 that jhet is independent of the initial water content and residual water content and decreases as the cooling rate increases or the temperature decreases moreover jhet is related to soil properties such as the concentration of the solution in the soil and the distribution of soil particle size the unfrozen water content was determined by combining eq 1 and eq 18 on the condition of obtaining the relationship between jhet and δt which is written as 19 n w n s 1 n s n r n s 1 c 1 n im α r e δ t c 2 α r e 2 δ t 2 considering that the initial freezing point of soil is usually not 0 c the calculated unfrozen water content curve needs to move to the initial freezing point to meet the actual freezing condition wan et al 2022a to illustrate the calculation process of the model proposed in this study a flowchart is shown in fig 2 3 2 relationship between equivalent contact angle and δt eq 2 and eq 3 show that the contact angle is a critical factor affecting jhet if the pore size and substrate where ice nucleation is located are different various solid liquid contact shapes will be formed in the pores at the same temperature moreover the geometry of soil particles can also lead to different ice crystal morphology fig 3 a and b by simplifying water freezing in soil the simplest form of the ice nucleus was used in our study as shown in fig 3c if ice nuclei grew on a flat substrate the macroscopic equivalent contact angle was used to reflect the probability of the ice formation in the soil thus f θ is written as pruppacher and klett 1997 20 f θ 1 4 2 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 the solving process of equivalent contact angle is described as follows firstly using eq 18 we obtain the values of jhet then δg is calculated by eq 2 next f θ can be obtained from eq 3 finally the equivalent contact angle was determined by eq 20 using data fitting between f θ and θ the calculation process is illustrated in fig 2 4 results and analysis 4 1 estimation of the proposed model to validate the unfrozen model proposed in this paper ten groups of test data including 108 data points were utilized leng et al 2010 wen et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 watanabe and wake 2009 the physical parameters of the six types of saturated soil are listed in table 1 including soil type dry density initial volumetric water content equivalent particle size and specific surface area in this table the specific surface area was obtained by the fractal dimension method based on the particle size distribution sepaskhah and tafteh 2013 and the equivalent particle size was obtained according to eq a9 in the attached nomenclature and the particle size distribution of clay is not mentioned in the original literature which is usually 4 μm xu et al 2010 wan et al 2022b the decrease of the freezing point of soil is attributed to concentration of salt solution and the initial concentration in soil is approximately 0 05 mol l when the freezing point is taken as 0 2 c based on the calculated equation of saturated soil wan et al 2015 variation of unfrozen water content in δt is drawn in fig 4 based on eq 19 and the initial supercooling was ignored in the calculations the calculated values of unfrozen water content are basically consistent with the experimental values when α 0 24 and nr 0 080 for clay α 0 27 and nr 0 039 for silty clay α 0 27 and nr 0 1 for silty clay α 0 35 and nr 0 085 for silt α 0 52 and nr 0 075 for silty sand and α 0 60 and nr 0 005 for sand the unfrozen water content changed rapidly when δt was within the 5 k range and slowly decreased as δt increased in a range of 5 k to 10 k our proposed model effectively reflects the relationship between the unfrozen water content and the temperature variation the model can simulate the variation of unfrozen water content in the rapid growth stage of ice crystals 0 δt 5 k for silty clay the absolute error between the predicted and experimental values was 0 015 our model overestimated the unfrozen water content for silty sand and sand when the δt was 15 k and for silt when δt ranged from 0 to 5 k under the same δt unfrozen water content of silty sand and sand were lower than that of clay silty clay and silt and showed larger change rate eq 19 indicates that the content of unfrozen water decreases as the equivalent particle size increases the shape factors of silty sand and sand differ significantly from that of other soils because of the rapid variation in the unfrozen water content near the initial freezing point as shown in fig 4 α mainly affected the rapid growth stage of ice crystals 0 δt 5 k in the freezing characteristic curve and the predicted value of unfrozen water content increased as α decreased the prediction of unfrozen water contentwas almost unaffected by parameter α when δt 5 k however the sensitivity of different soil freezing curves and nucleation rates to α was also different α varied 0 03 when the equivalent particle size was 10 μm fig 4a and 4b and unfrozen water contentfluctuated the most at δt 1 k with a change value of 0 032 m3 m 3 the effect of α on unfrozen water content decreased as the equivalent particle size increased fig 4c 4e α varied 0 20 when the equivalent particle size was 105 μm fig 5 f and the unfrozen water content varied 0 011 m3 m 3 when δt 1 k the value of nr has obvious influence on the unfrozen water curve the increase of nr caused the unfrozen water content curve to rotate counterclockwise around the initial freezing point at the corresponding coordinate points which indicated that the larger the surface area of soil the stronger the surface adsorption of soil particles the more difficult it was to freeze at low temperature 4 2 comparison with existing models three typical models on unfrozen water content were chosen to compare with our proposed model eq 19 including an empirical model proposed by anderson and tice 1972 in the form of a power function with temperature and specific surface area as parameters a semi empirical model in exponential function form presented by kozlowski 2007 considering residual water content and a theoretical model advanced by liu and yu 2013 according to soil freezing characteristic curve and clapeyron equation the comparison between predicted values and test values of six types of soil samples is shown in fig 5 the four models basically achieve accurate prediction although kozlowski s 2007 s model has some errors in predicting clay and silty clay fig 5a and b for most soils the difference between predicted values based on the proposed model and tested data decreased as δt increased the unfrozen water content estimated by anderson and tice 1972 s model was greater than the measured values when δt ranged from 0 to 20 k fig 5a c d and f the prediction effect of liu and yu 2013 s model is better than that of anderson and tice 1972 s model but it has more empirical parameters different from anderson and tice 1972 s and liu and yu 2013 models both kozlowski 2007 s model and our model considered the initial and residual values of soil water content the introduction of the residual water content determined the boundary conditions of the prediction results and improved the prediction accuracy at low temperatures δt 5 k the residual water content decreased as the specific surface area decreased and correlated with clay content wang et al 2022b eq 15 has a high accuracy in predicting the quality of soil containing clay particles jin et al 2020 but ignores the influence of the soil sample volume which leads to an increase in the initial contact angle and a decrease in the ice nucleation temperature wan et al 2020 and the water film on the surface of the particles becomes difficult to freeze therefore the determination of the residual water content parameters of small volume samples and soil with little clay content should consider specific experimental results the parameters of four models are listed in table 2 the root mean square error rmse was adopted to evaluate the performance of the models and the prediction effect shows better at a small rmse value lu et al 2019 liu and yu 2013 s model and our model had a lower rmse value in silty clay s prediction of unfrozen water content and anderson and tice 1972 s and kozlowski 2007 s models had lower rmse values in the prediction of unfrozen water content for clay and sand respectively the anderson and tice 1972 s and liu and yu 2013 s models involved two and three empirical parameters respectively and each set of parameters was only applicable to specific soils the empirical parameters u and v of the same type of soils had the same values in kozlowski 2007 s model and he believed that the water content corresponding to 12 c was the residual value whereas in our study it was 15 c there were also many studies on soil freezing characteristic curves that used the residual value of water content corresponding to 15 c lu et al 2019 wang et al 2022b as a result our model is more accurate at low temperatures than the kozlowski 2007 model similarly empirical parameters α can be determined based on soil type 4 3 variation of nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle fig 6 shows the relationship between the heterogeneous nucleation rate of the six types of soil and the temperature variation during the freezing process these curves were drawn using eq 18 where the cooling rate q is 1 k min wan et al 2022c variation of jhet was similar with rule of unfrozen water content as the temperature decreased the different decreased at least two orders of magnitude when δt increased to 22 k jhet changed dramatically when δt was 5 k and pore water froze more easily at higher nucleation rates and the six curves of heterogeneous nucleation rate also differ at this stage ice nucleation rate in sand was higher than that in other soils especially at the freezing point the nucleation rate of sand was as high as 0 167 m 2 s 1 while the initial nucleation rate of other soils was between 0 025 and 0 054 m 2 s 1 the test results indicated that near the freezing point of sand the speed of ice crystal generation and unfrozen water content reduction were much faster than that in other soils this phenomenon is consistent with the sfcc of sand the smaller the free energy δg required to form ice nucleus during the transition from liquid to ice the more favorable it is for the formation of ice nucleus fornea et al 2009 eqs a4 and a6 show that σiw and si increased and decreased with the decrease of a w respectively and a w decreased as the temperature decreased due to the enrichment of salt in unfrozen water during water freezing wan and yang 2020 moreover experiments had shown that pore water in macropores had greater water activity chai et al 2018 therefore δg required for pore water phase transformation in macropores during the nucleation process was smaller and the nucleation rate was greater once δt was greater than about 5 k the difference in growth and rate in the six soils was negligible fig 7 shows the relationship between the equivalent contact angle of six types of soils and the temperature variation in the freezing process the curves of the equivalent contact angle for these six soils had similar trends and the initial values of the equivalent contact angles in different soils were different the initial equivalent contact angle of silty clay of the same type was similar with a difference of 0 078 although the initial water content equivalent particle size and the freezing point of the two silty clays were different equivalent contact angle increased from 4 to 35 as δt increased rapidly from 0 to 5 k and the water in macropores had been frozen then the angle increased proportionally as δt increased when δt 15 k the equivalent contact angle increased slightly with the increment of δt compared with the second stage which indicated that pore water freezing was becoming increasingly difficult in fig 7 the equivalent contact angle decreased as the equivalent particle size increased the magnitude of the contact angle determined the degree of wetness and the contact angle itself depended on the relative size of the surface tension surface tension was related to the interfacial free energy between ice and liquid water fornea et al 2009 at the same temperature the interfacial free energy decreased as the water activity decreased koop et al 2000 the geometry of the pores caused the confined water to curve and decreased the water activity especially in small pores tian et al 2017 in addition the chemical potential and freezing point of water in small pores were much lower than those in large pores wan and yang 2020 chen et al 2021 thus the equivalent contact angle decreased as the pore size increased the pore size formed among the soil particles was positively correlated with particle size qiu et al 2020 it also indicated that clay had the maximum equivalent contact angle under the same δt which was consistent with the calculated results fig 5 4 4 application of the model in unsaturated soils frozen soil is often unsaturated and damage to infrastructure due to gas migration in unsaturated frozen soil wan and yang 2020 according to the unsaturated soil theory kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the matric suction of soil increases with a decrease in the initial water content as air saturation the ratio of air volume to total pore volume increases the tensile stress on the water film in the soil pores increases and liquid water does not easily turn into ice under these conditions the water retention of unsaturated soil was described by the soil water characteristic curve which represents the relationship between matric suction and water content most existing models for predicting the unsaturated soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc were developed based on the vg and fx models of the soil water characteristic curve swcc liu and yu 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the application of these models requires the acquisition of a soil water characteristic curve swcc and the determination of three parameters without obvious physical significance in this study the melting behavior between the ice crystal and gas interface was ignored the freezing curves of five groups of unsaturated silty clays were predicted and the influence of the ice air interface on the soil freezing curves was indirectly observed the variation in the liquid content when air saturation was ηa 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 40 determined using equation ηw 1 ηa and combining with eqs 13 and 19 is shown in fig 8 a initial freezing point of soil was related to air saturation qiu et al 2020 and the predicted values showed relatively large differences with the tested values in the range of δt from 0 to 2 k but the prediction showed the variation of unfrozen water content well fig 8b shows the difference between the predicted and experimental values when δt was within 5 k range the prediction was less than the test values and the difference exceeded 0 015 m3 m 3 as δt varied from 0 5 k to 2 k the accuracy was highest when δt 5 k when δt 5 k the predicted unfrozen water content of soils with different initial saturations was higher than the experimental value but the error was within 0 010 m3 m 3 and the error changed slowly with temperature so the prediction effect was accurate the results also showed that the difference between the predicted values and the experimental values of different air saturations decreased as δt increased in addition when the air saturation exceeded 0 15 the error became increasingly evident when δt was 5 k the variation of unfrozen water content tended to be consistent for different air saturations 4 5 influence factors of jhet and θ assuming the soil system was composed of soil with one particle size the effects of soil particle size and solution concentration on the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle were analyzed jhet and θ in soils with particle size 1 10 and 100 μm during cooling process was calculated based on eq 20 and eqs 2 3 and 18 heterogeneous nucleation is a process of nonequivalent spatial position formation with the aid of an external interface wan et al 2020 particles of different sizes provide different nucleation interfacial energies on which atoms are attached to the nucleate thus reducing the degree of liquid supercooling and facilitating nucleation as shown in fig 9 the larger particles nucleate more easily when the solution concentration was 0 013 mol l the particle size changed from 1 to 10 μm and the initial nucleation rate changed from 0 1317 to 0 02031 m 3 s 1 however when the particle size increased to 100 μm the initial nucleation rate had little increase compared with that when the particle size was 10 μm moreover the equivalent contact angle did not change significantly with particle size during the cooling processes at different solution concentrations when impurities such as salt exist in soils the salt is dissolved in liquid water and decreases the chemical potential of pore water dash et al 2006 wan et al 2020 and the freezing point as shown in fig 8 for the same particle size the initial value of the contact angle increased as the solution concentration increased indicating that the pore water was more difficult to freeze the pore water continues to transform into ice as δt increases and the salt in the soil accumulates in an increasingly thin liquid water film dash et al 2006 wan and yang 2020 xiao et al 2022 resulting in a further reduction in the chemical potential of the water film meanwhile larger contact angles appear in small microapertures wan et al 2022c and ice becomes increasingly difficult to form 5 discussion existing empirical models of unfrozen water content are simple and convenient for mathematical structures and have been widely used in numerical simulations bai et al 2018 lai et al 2021 however these models usually involve at least two parameters that must be determined experimentally many researchers have connected the model parameters to soil properties through data regression to ensure that the parameters have physical significance parameters such as the plasticity index and specific surface area have been introduced in many models anderson and tice 1972 but this method can only be used for specific soils and cannot determine the commonality between different types of soil or further reveal the freezing mechanism of pore water in soil the proposed model considers the effects of various factors on the equivalent contact angle nucleation rate and unfrozen water content during the water freezing process eq 19 was used to predict the content of unfrozen water during the freezing process of the ten soil types and the accuracy of the model was verified using published experimental data fig 5 residual water content was estimated by combining the experimental results with the specific surface area of the soil residual water which actually moves as a thin film is a critical factor in describing hydrological processes wang et al 2018 2022a the value of the residual water content can be obtained by drying test van genuchten 1980 however there is a difference in residual water content during freezing and drying processes kou et al 2020 the reason is that there exists a water film forming by the premelting effect between crystal surface and grain boundary at negative temperature the width of this film is usually below 1 nm hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 the residual water content determined the boundary conditions of our model and effectively improved the prediction accuracy of unfrozen water content when δt was 5 k by comparing the parameters in our proposed model with those in most empirical models anderson and tice 1972 kozlowski 2007 liu and yu 2013 it can be observed that each parameter of the model has a clear physical meaning the proposed model is easy to apply when we know parameter α and the other basic physical parameters of soil however the relationship between the shape factor particle size and soil type was not clear and soil particle roughness may affect its value nucleation rate and contact angle varied considerably in the initial freezing period as shape factor increased which suggested α values for five different soils are given according to the sensitivity analysis of prediction unfrozen water content curve by variation of α the other category included the parameters that are related to soil properties such as the liquid concentration in the soil particle size residual water content initial water content and there are parameters need to be obtained experimentally soil usually contains a certain amount of salt the increase in liquid concentration and decrease in particle size hinder ice nucleation however the sequence of phase transition during cooling is also different owing to different types of salt for example na2so4 can crystallize before ice formation whereas nacl crystallizes after water freezing xiao et al 2020 the unfrozen water content calculated using our model is based on the ice forming probability and salt crystal precipitation in the freezing process is not considered thus the proposed model is not suitable for the soil with a high salt content which requires the introduction of the phase diagram of salt solution in porous medium if included this would improve the current model the variation of contact angle explained the hysteresis of water content in soil during the drying wetting process zhou 2013 the maximum and minimum contact angles were called the advancing and receding contact angles respectively and the angle remained a receding contact angle during drying and an advancing contact angle during wetting these two angles were not constant and changed as the number of wet and dry cycles increased zhou 2013 similarly when the temperature decreased the pore liquid did not necessarily freeze at the thermodynamic freezing point but remained in a liquid metastable state until ice nucleation the hysteresis effect of unfrozen water content also existed in the freeze thaw cycles koopmans and miller 1966 tian et al 2017 and amiri et al 2018 suggested that the difference was caused by capillary action and adsorption which enlarged the temperature interval between freezing and thawing field observation also showed evidence of hysteretic behavior during soil freeze thaw processes quinton and baltzer 2013 however the contact angle during the soil freezing process cannot be directly measured at the macro and micro level and research in this field is limited some researchers have used a high order polynomial regression of the relationship between the angle and temperature based on the acquisition of soil sfcc wan et al 2022c the model proposed in this study theoretically estimates the change in the equivalent contact angle during water freezing by combining premelting and crystallization theories providing a clear calculation method for this angle the concept of the equivalent contact angle can be used to describe the degree of freezing difficulty of different soil materials moreover the organic matter content can significantly affect the contact angle according to a study by czachor et al 2010 as the organic matter content increases in soil the contact angle decreases this is due to organic matter acting as a wetting agent reducing the surface tension of the liquid which results in a lower contact angle hysteretic effect of unfrozen water content during freeze thaw process is not considered in the present work and will be further studied in the future work the premelting theory was initially applied to saturated soils which considered two kinds of particle accumulation modes and determined the maximum and minimum unfrozen water content corresponding to a given temperature wan et al 2022a however the assumption of saturated system and the solution form of implicit function of water film thickness in the model make it difficult to apply in practice thus the solution method of water film thickness and the premelting effect were simplified based on the measured data and the mathematical structure of the simplified model was easier for numerical simulation the nucleation rate is represented by the water film thickness and the unfrozen water content is calculated based on a probabilistic ice formation model in this process the melting behavior between the ice crystal and gas interface was ignored premelting theory is applied to unsaturated soils the influence of the water film thickness at the ice air interface on the liquid content increased as the air saturation increased and an increase in air pressure reduced the initial freezing point of the soil wen et al 2012 the sfcc under different saturation states also differed wan et al 2020 experimental data verified the prediction accuracy of our model for silty clay with liquid saturation 0 4 in the stage where the nucleation rate changed dramatically the calculation method for the unfrozen water content which only considered the melting characteristics between the surface and interface of the soil and ice crystal particles when the pores were completely filled with water underestimated the unfrozen water content fig 8 thus it is necessary to consider the influence of the water air interface on the premelting behavior establish the relationship between the contact angle and temperature under unsaturated conditions correct the influence of air pressure on the freezing curve when pore water experiences a drastic phase transformation and improve the calculation accuracy of the unfrozen water content in unsaturated soils 6 conclusion based on the premelting and crystallization theories a prediction model of unfrozen water content was developed the calculation method of the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle in the freezing process was established theoretically the applicability of our model in unsaturated soils was analyzed and discussed moreover our proposed model was compared with three other typical models and the accuracy of our model was verified the main conclusions are as follows 1 the ice nucleation rate was independent of the initial and residual water contents the nucleation rate and equivalent contact angle of different soils exhibited the same variation trend during the water freezing process the ice nucleation rate increases with the increase of the equivalent particle size 2 the value of the equivalent contact angle reflects the degree of difficulty of the pore water ice phase change when the soil freezes the contact angle increases nonlinearly for δt 5 k and 15 k and has a linear relationship with δt between 5 k and 15 k for most soils the initial equivalent contact angle was 15 at the same temperature the equivalent contact angle increases with a decrease of solution concentration and increase of particle size 3 the unfrozen water content predicted by our proposed model was consistent with the test results for most soils particularly for clay and silty clay in the application of unsaturated soil when the air saturation is 0 4 and the δt variation from initial freezing point is within 5 k the predicted value of the proposed model underestimates the unfrozen water content and the error is 0 025 m3 m 3 when the temperature variation from the initial freezing point was 5 k the change in matric suction caused by the increase in air pressure could be ignored in the calculation of the unfrozen water content the shape factor varies from 0 24 to 0 6 for most of soils and increases as the equivalent particle size increases as with most theoretical models there are limitations and further research is needed to improve the new model in future research we will improve the prediction accuracy of the model in soils with high salinity and low saturation which requires consideration of salt crystallization precipitation and premelting behavior at the ice gas interface simultaneously the correlation between the hysteresis effect of the contact angle and hysteresis phenomenon of unfrozen water content in the freeze thaw cycle is also a subject we are studying in addition we are focusing on physical meaning and determination of shape parameters in

1813,coastal terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange are two different submarine groundwater discharge sgd pathways the contribution of both pathways in dissolved carbon export to the coastal water remains almost unknown here we investigated terrestrial groundwater discharge porewater exchange and dissolved carbon export in a tropical estuary moyangjiang china using stable water δ2h and δ18o and radioactive 222rn 224ra and 228th isotopes the average terrestrial groundwater discharge was estimated to be 3 2 0 2 106 m3 d 1 by a three end member mixing model of δ18o and salinity the porewater exchange was estimated to be 11 3 0 14 cm d 1 by the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method accordingly dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated to be 1 19 0 10 107 and 3 23 0 25 105 mol d 1 respectively in comparison when upscaling to the whole estuary dic and doc export fluxes from porewater exchange were estimated to be 1 56 0 21 105 and 2 12 0 29 105 mol d 1 respectively terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized overall both pathways contributed a large amount of dissolved carbon export to the coastal water and play an important role in delivering terrestrial carbon across land ocean interface evaluating the contributions of different pathways of sgd to terrestrial solutes will help to improve the accuracy of sgd associated terrestrial solute fluxes keywords submarine groundwater discharge stable water isotopes radioactive isotopes 224ra 228th disequilibria dissolved carbon export data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuaries are important interfaces from land to ocean which are recognized as an important pathway for dissolved carbon to the ocean cai 2011 bauer et al 2013 dai et al 2022 the exchange of river water and seawater driven by tides causes spatiotemporal gradients of many physicochemical parameters in estuaries e g ph dissolved oxygen and salinity spiteri et al 2008 which strongly influences various biogeochemical processes including the carbon cycling canuel et al 2012 wu et al 2019 although estuaries account for only a small percentage 0 3 of global ocean area they play a disproportionately large role in the delivery of dissolved carbon to the ocean cai 2011 bauer et al 2013 liang et al 2020 hence a comprehensive assessment quantification of carbon sources and fluxes into estuaries is of great importance in constructing the global ocean carbon budget the main sources of dissolved carbon to estuaries include riverine inputs groundwater discharge or and porewater exchange and diffusion from bottom sediments groundwater is often rich in organic matter and can deliver high concentrations of dissolved carbon into the surface water of estuaries santos et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2017 submarine groundwater discharge sgd is any and all flow of water on continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force moore 2003 burnett et al 2003 previous studies have shown that sgd contributes significantly nutrients and carbon to the surface water which makes it a critical component in estuarine carbon nutrient biogeochemistry studies liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015a santos et al 2021 for example sadat noori et al 2017 revealed that groundwater discharge was a major source of dissolved carbon in a subtropical estuary sgd includes five different driving mechanisms terrestrial groundwater discharge density driven seawater circulation seasonal exchange of seawater shoreface circulation of seawater and cm scale porewater exchange garcia orellana et al 2021 however the roles of these processes in sgd and their contribution to dissolved carbon into the surface water remain largely unclear radium ra isotopes are useful tracers of sgd because of their wide ranges of half lives 223ra 11 4 d 224ra 3 7 d 226ra 1600 y and 228ra 5 75 y and conservative behaviors moore 1996 povinec et al 2012 garcia orellana et al 2021 wang et al 2021a xu et al 2022 they have been successfully applied to trace sgd over different spatial and temporal scales taniguchi et al 2019 wang et al 2019a recently the radium thorium isotope 224ra 228th disequilibrium method was used to quantify water exchange and solute export across the sediment water interface in many coastal zones cai et al 2012 tamborski et al 2021 wei et al 2022 stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o are also ideal tracers for investigating groundwater and surface water interactions in the coastal area povinec et al 2008 the isotope tracer integrates the signal from various groundwater pathways which makes it useful in the study of multiple processes in spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic systems burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 rodellas et al 2017 thus it can be a potential approach that contributes to study sgd dynamics in this study we utilize the three end member mixing model and the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method to estimate terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange and dissolved carbon export in a tropical estuary moyangjiang china we must highlight that strictly speaking porewater is synonymous with groundwater in order to clearly express these two driving mechanisms porewater refers specifically to centimeter scale groundwater at the sediment water interface e g burnett et al 2003 santos et al 2012 hong et al 2017 tambroski et al 2021 we aim to verify the hypothesis that terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange in the estuary can deliver a significant quantity of dissolved carbon to the coastal ocean to testify our assumption we determined the concentration and distribution of dissolved carbon in the estuary and assessed the roles of terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange as release mechanisms in the dissolved carbon export via the application of multiple tracers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site moyangjiang delta is located in the guangdong province southeast of china fig 1 there are two major tributaries namely moyangjiang river and nalong river fig 1 the climate in this region frequently influenced by the marine monsoon and tropical and subtropical high pressure climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 2200 mm with 80 occurring in the period from april to august the temperature variation is limited between each month and the annual average temperature is 23 c moyangjiang estuary is dominated by semidiurnal tides tidal height varied between 0 5 and 3 0 m during the sampling period 2 2 sample collection the river water rw01 rw13 n 13 and groundwater gw01 gw05 n 7 samples in moyangjiang and nalong tributaries were collected during december 17th 18th in 2020 time series samples of river water rw14 n 13 were collected every two hours for 24 h two full tidal cycles at the mouth of the estuary during december 18th 19th in 2020 the sampling sites of river water groundwater and sediment cores are outlined in fig 1 in order to select a representative radon 222rn activity in river water we collected river water at a depth of 1 0 m in order to select a representative 222rn activity in groundwater groundwater samples need to be collected as close to the river as possible e g santos et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2017 in this study groundwater samples were collected in the riparian edge about 1 3 m meters away from the river by using a push point piezometer and a peristaltic pump the depths of the groundwater samples depended on the field conditions the volumes of river water and groundwater samples for 222rn analysis were 2 l and 250 ml respectively in the field water samples for stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o were prefiltered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate filter and were preserved into 15 ml polyethylene bottles without headspace water samples for dissolved carbon were collected into clean 40 ml brown glass bottles water samples for dissolved organic carbon dic and its isotope δ13c dic were prefiltered through a 0 22 μm polycarbonate filter and were capped without air bubbles inside the bottles samples for dissolved organic carbon doc were prefiltered through a 0 25 μm polycarbonate filter and were preserved after addition of 2 m hcl until ph 2 all water samples were kept in the dark at 4 6 c until analyses in addition salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do for all water samples were measured in situ using a handheld hi9828 model probe hanna sediments core samples for 224ra and 228th analysis were collected using a gravity drill during the cruise the sampling station of sediment cores was located at the mouth of the estuary fig 1 sediment core samples were stored vertically during their transport to the laboratory in the laboratory one sediment core was sectioned into 1 cm thick slices to measure activities of surface exchangeable 224ra and 228th hereafter simply referred to as total 224ra and 228th corresponding to sediment core for 224ra and 228th analyses we also used additional 8 10 sediment cores to extract porewater porewater in sediments was extracted from the methods proposed by seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 briefly porewater 50 ml was extracted from sediment cores by inserting rhizon samplers directly into sediments via pre drilled sampling ports at depths of 1 5 10 20 and 30 cm porewater samples were slowly poured onto 25 g mn fibers to extract dissolved 224ra 2 3 analytical methods activities of 222rn half life 3 83 d in river water and groundwater were measured in the field using an automated radon in air monitor rad 7 durridge co burnett et al 2001 peterson et al 2019 in order to reduce the uncertainty of 222rn activity we increased the counting time for at least 2 h santos et al 2010 the uncertainty of 222rn was generally lower than 20 activities of total 224ra and 228th half life 1 91 y in sediments were determined using a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc cai et al 2015 tamborski et al 2021 activities of total 224ra and 228th were measured according to the detailed procedure in cai et al 2012 the propagated error associated with 224ra and 228th activities in bulk sediment averages 3 4 for the entire data set cai et al 2020 sediments were dried at 80 c for 48 h and water content loss was measured to calculate sediment porosity activities of dissolved 224ra adsorbed on mn fibers were also measured on a radecc system these 224ra activities were determined according to the detailed procedure in moore and arnold 1996 because the volume of collected porewater in muddy sediments was relatively small we increased the counting time more than 24 h to achieve a minimum of 1000 counts in the 220 channel of radecc system so that the counting uncertainty can be constrained within 3 4 cai et al 2020 dic and δ13c dic were determined within 24 h after sampling doc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analyzer germany after removing dic by bubbling oxygen through the acidified samples the instrument was calibrated using a standard potassium phthalate solution diluted to within the range of concentrations estimated for the doc content of the samples samples for dic without acidification were used to determine dissolved total carbon by the toc analyzer dic concentrations were then calculated as the difference between dissolved total carbon and doc the measurement uncertainties of doc and dic concentration were better than 3 the δ2h and δ18o values of water samples were measured separately by the water equilibrium method gillikin and bouillon 2007 wang et al 2015b for δ2h 300 μl sample water was transferred into a 12 ml vial and a pt stick catalyst was added in each vial the vials were then sealed and flushed with he h2 gas mixture 99 he and 1 h2 at a rate of 50 ml min for 8 min after 40 min the vials were measured using a gasbench ii coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer 253 plus thermo fisher scientific usa for δ18o 300 μl sample water was transferred into a 12 ml vial the vials were sealed and flushed with he co2 gas mixture 99 7 he and 0 3 co2 at a rate of 50 ml min for 8 min samples were placed at 23 c for 48 h to reach the equilibrium state and then measured using the same system with δ2h the δ2h and δ18o values were calibrated to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow by running a serious of chinese standards with known δ2hvsmow and δ18ovsmow values the inner outer precision were 0 4 2 0 for δ2h values 0 06 0 1 for δ18o values the δ2h and δ18o values were reported relative to the vsmow the δ13c dic values were determined by the method described by gillikin and bouillon 2007 five drops of 99 h3po4 were added to a 12 ml vial sealed and flushed with 99 999 he for 8 min at a rate of 80 ml min then 700 μl sample water was transferred to the vial using 1 ml syringes and placed at 23 c for 24 h the vials of different samples were measured using the same system with δ2h and δ18o the δ13c values of samples were calibrated to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb standard by running a working standard nahco3 solution with 30 mg l 1 dic the δ13cvpdb value of nahco3 is 5 08 0 1 which is determined using iaea co 8 δ13cvpdb 5 764 0 032 the inner outer precision for δ13c values were 0 06 0 2 the δ13c values were reported relative to the vpdb standard 2 4 three end member mixing model the end member mixing model has frequently been used to estimate the proportions of different water sources moore 2003 liu et al 2012 petermann et al 2019 water sources at the estuary mainly included upstream river water groundwater discharge and open seawater here salinity and δ18o were used to construct the three end member mixing model given the water mixing at the estuary a three end member mixing model was then built as the following equation 1a f r f gw f o 1 1b s r f r s gw f gw s o f o s m 1c 18 o r f r 18 o gw f gw 18 o o f o 18 o m where f is the fraction of each end member s is the salinity and δ18 o is the value of δ18o the subscript r gw and o represent river water end member groundwater end member and open sea water end member respectively the subscript m represents measured value in the estuary based on river discharge qr unit m3 d 1 and the proportion of river and groundwater terrestrial groundwater discharge qgw unit m3 d 1 was then calculated as the following equation 2 q gw q r f r f gw 2 5 the 224ra 228th disequilibrium model in benthic environments 224ra can be desorbed in saline water while parent 228th is strongly bound to solid particles cai et al 2012 accordingly the 224ra 228th disequilibrium is developed recently for the quantification of porewater and solute exchange across the sediment water interface in coastal zones tamborski et al 2021 wei et al 2022 briefly the dissolved 224ra migrates across the sediment water interface into the surface water through various processes like groundwater and or porewater exchanges garcia orellana et al 2021 which results in the deficits in 224ra relative to 228th in sediments the deficit flux of 224ra is calculated by integrating the activity difference of 228th and 224ra across the depth at which 224ra deficit occurs until some depth at which 224ra and 228th reach secular equilibrium cai et al 2012 the expression that describes the 224ra deficit flux from the sediment water interface is given by 3 f ra o z λ ra a th a ra d z where f ra is the 224ra deficit flux dpm m 2 d 1 λ ra is the decay constant of 224ra 0 189 d 1 z is the depth horizon below which 224ra and 228th reach secular equilibrium m ara and ath are 224ra and 228th activities in sediments dpm m 3 respectively based on estimated 224ra export flux porewater exchange qpx unit m d 1 was evaluated as the following equation 4 q px f ra a dra pw a dra ow where a dra pw and a dra ow are dissolved 224ra activities in sediment porewater and overlying water dpm l 1 respectively 3 results 3 1 river water 3 1 1 spatial distribution observations salinity ranged from 0 to 10 8 and gradually increased from upstream to the mouth of the estuary fig 2 water ph ranged from 6 82 to 7 56 with an average of 7 28 higher ph was observed at the downstream of the river activities of 222rn in river water ranged from 99 26 to 362 49 bq m 3 with an average of 217 75 bq m 3 the highest activity was observed at the downstream values of δ18o in river water ranged from 5 8 to 3 7 with an average of 5 0 values of δ2h in river water ranged from 38 1 to 24 8 with an average of 33 2 dic concentrations ranged from 701 to 1182 μm with an average of 874 μm while doc concentrations ranged from 281 to 358 μm with an average of 309 μm the highest dic concentration was observed near the estuary fig 2 in which the highest doc concentration was observed values of δ13c dic ranged from 8 5 to 5 2 with an average of 7 3 3 1 2 time series observations at the mouth of the estuary salinity ranged from 8 12 to 29 58 and followed a tidal trend with higher values at high tide and lower values at low tide fig 3 salinity and tidal height showed about 2 hour time difference because the tidal station is located downstream of the sampling station fig 3 water ph ranged from 7 67 to 7 98 with an average of 7 82 water ph showed similar trends as salinity fig 3 in other words ph reached the maximum value at high tide and dropped to the minimum value at low tide there was no clear tidal trend for do whereas the lowest do concentration was observed at high tide activities of 222rn ranged from 630 49 bq m 3 to 109 35 bq m 3 with an average of 348 178 bq m 3 222rn followed an opposite tidal trend and was clearly seen to have the highest activity at low tide and the lowest activity at high tide fig 3 values of δ18o ranged from 4 1 to 0 8 with an average of 2 9 values of δ2h ranged from 28 6 to 6 5 with an average of 19 3 both δ2h and δ18o showed a tidal cycle that reached the maximum value at high tide and the minimum value at low tide fig 3 dic concentrations ranged from 1099 to 1919 μm with an average of 1387 μm dic followed the tidal trend with the highest concentration observed at high tide fig 3 δ13c dic also showed a tidal cycle that reached a maximum of 2 1 at high tide and dropped to 5 8 at low tide doc concentrations ranged from 278 to 358 μm with an average of 309 μm doc followed the inverse tidal trend with the lowest concentration observed at high tide fig 3 suggesting doc deficiency in seawater 3 2 groundwater analysis results for groundwater are outlined in table 1 seven groundwater samples were collected from upstream to the mouth of the estuary the average ph 6 7 0 4 and do 2 7 0 1 mg l 1 in groundwater were lower than observations in river water activities of 222rn in groundwater ranged from 1820 113 to 9957 236 bq m 3 the average 222rn activity 6581 2402 bq m 3 in groundwater was an order of magnitude higher than that in river water 217 75 bq m 3 concentrations of doc in groundwater ranged from 204 to 941 μm with an average of 410 μm concentrations of dic in groundwater ranged from 611 to 18578 μm with an average of 4900 μm the average concentrations of doc and dic in groundwater were higher than those in rivers values of δ18o in groundwater ranged from 6 8 to 5 3 with an average of 5 9 which was more depleted than river water values of δ13c dic in groundwater ranged from 17 0 to 7 9 with an average of 13 0 3 3 sediments and porewater total 224ra and 228th activities from the depth profile sediment are presented in fig 4 activities of total 224ra and 228th in sediments were in the range of 0 231 0 012 1 219 0 040 dpm g 1 and 0 273 0 010 1 313 0 037 dpm g 1 respectively the total 224ra 228th ratios ranged from 0 844 0 052 to 1 149 0 058 since 224ra is produced by the decay of 228th total 224ra and 228th showed a very similar distribution pattern at all layers fig 4a more importantly activities of total 224ra were lower than those of 228th in sediments fig 4a indicating that total 224ra was in dramatic deficit with respect to 228th activities of 224ra dic and doc concentrations in sediment porewater and the overlying water are presented in table 2 activities of dissolved 224ra in porewater ranged from 9 48 1 42 to 50 74 3 10 dpm l 1 in comparison the activity of dissolved 224ra in overlying river water was 7 91 0 60 dpm l 1 dic concentrations ranged from 1977 to 3829 μm and doc concentrations ranged from 788 to 1491 μm concentrations of dic and doc were higher in porewater than that of overlying water 4 discussion 4 1 terrestrial groundwater discharge the precipitation samples were used to determine the local meteoric water line lmwl the best fit was δ2h 7 95δ18o 6 45 r2 0 98 which differed slightly from the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 from fig 5 a we found that δ2h and δ18o of upstream river water was located on the lmwl indicating low evapotranspiration rates in this study area moreover several samples of river water time series were slightly deviated from the lmwl fig 5a however the δ2h and δ18o fitting line of river water upstream and time series passed through the open seawater end member 0 0 fig 5a this indicated that the deviation of stable isotopes was caused by the conservative mixing between the open seawater and river water deuterium excess d excess was defined as d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 and it was less variable compared with δ2h and δ18o the d excess has been shown to be an important indicator of reflecting differences in humidity between vapor source and evaporation huang and pang 2012 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 kong et al 2019 in this study the values of d excess ranged from 0 to 10 fig 5b more importantly the d excess and δ18o fitting line of river water approximately passed through the open seawater end member 0 0 fig 5b this also indicated that the conservative mixing was the major reason for the modification of isotopic composition additionally there was significant positive relationship between δ18o and salinity of river water time series fig 5c indicating a conservative behavior of δ18o in the estuary therefore we concluded that river water δ18o was conservative and was mainly controlled by conservative mixing and the modification of isotopic composition caused by the evapotranspiration could be ignored the relevant low evapotranspiration rates may be related to the local high humidity and the relatively small scale of our study area stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o have been increasingly used to identify water sources in different coastal regions e g petermann et al 2018 debnath et al 2019 wang et al 2021b in this study a three end member mixing model was established by using salinity and δ18o this study showed significantly differences in δ18o among upstream river water groundwater and seawater fig 5c strictly speaking there were four end members i e terrestrial groundwater discharge porewater exchange river seawater we need to emphasize that porewater exchange is referred to the water exchange across the sediment water interface in a relatively small spatiotemporal scale m and hours santos et al 2012 alorda kleinglass et al 2019 hong et al 2017 chen et al 2021 this process may have little impact on water volume and salinity burnett et al 2003 moreover the values of δ18o were mainly affected by isotope fractionation mechanism e g evapotranspiration given a relatively small spatiotemporal scale of porewater exchange in this study i e 30 cm depth it might be reasonable to assume that δ18o was not fractionated during the pore water exchange process indeed we found that salinity and δ18o of sediment pore water are basically consistent with that of the overlying river water see table 2 which may offer more confidence in this assumption overall in the end member mixing model established by salinity and δ18o the porewater end member was implicitly included in the seawater end member average values of δ18o in upstream river water at stations rw01 rw13 and groundwater at stations gw01 gw05 were used as corresponding end members the value of δ18o at high tide was recognized as seawater end member end member values used in the mixing model are listed in table 3 based on equation 1 the proportions of upstream river water groundwater and seawater at the estuary were averagely 30 20 and 50 respectively seawater was recognized as the dominant component of the water at the mouth of the estuary the average upstream river discharge was 4 6 106 m3 d 1 during december cheng et al 2016 tang and wang 2022 based on equation 2 the average terrestrial groundwater discharge was then estimated to be 3 2 0 2 106 m3 d 1 which was 68 of the average upstream river discharge groundwater is recognized as the dominant source of baseflow koskelo et al 2012 this indicated our estimated terrestrial groundwater discharge was the groundwater contributing to the river downstream from the gauged location likely including baseflow moreover the proportions of upstream river water and groundwater were strongly and negatively correlated with the salinity fig 6 in comparison the proportion of seawater showed strong positive correlations with salinity fig 6 4 2 porewater exchange 224ra deficits were observed in the sediment at depths ranging from 0 to 7 cm from 18 to 25 cm and from 30 to 35 cm fig 4 suggesting the recent mobilization and transport of 224ra notably total 224ra activities in sediments of depths ranging from 7 to 18 cm were higher than that of 228th fig 4 this phenomenon may be explained by radium adsorption on the high level manganese dioxide in the sediment this phenomenon was also observed in other estuaries and salt marshes e g cai et al 2014 shi et al 2019 tamborski et al 2021 integrating 224ra flux across the depths from 0 to 36 cm 224ra export flux was estimated to be 490 120 dpm m 2 d 1 from eq 3 considering the activity difference of 224ra between porewater at a depth of 1 cm and overlying surface water porewater exchange flux was then estimated to be 11 3 0 14 cm d 1 from eq 4 the calculated deficit of 224ra in the sediment is a summed value from various processes that occurred at the sediment water interface which included the molecular diffusion cai et al 2015 cai et al 2020 according to the activity gradients of dissolved 224ra and fick s first law the molecular diffusive 224ra flux was estimated to be 4 0 dpm m 2 d 1 considering that the total flux of 224ra was two orders of magnitude higher than the molecular diffusive flux of 224ra the result indicated a negligible amount of 224ra export driven by molecular diffusion across the sediment water interface the relationship between 222rn and tidal level provides insight into the driving forces of groundwater discharge 222rn is produced by the decay of radium isotope 226ra in sediments here the average activity of 222rn in terrestrial groundwater was an order of magnitude higher than that in surface water this indicated that groundwater was likely an important source of 222rn moreover 222rn followed an opposite tidal trend with higher values at high tide and lower values at low tide which was consistent with time series measurements in global estuaries e g sadat noori et al 2015 petermann et al 2018 peterson et al 2019 here we highlighted that the sources of 222rn included both terrestrial groundwater discharge and cm scale porewater exchange from the sediment water interface this suggested that tidal pumping influenced these two processes of sgd water table rises and drops in the estuary caused by tidal fluctuations would eventually lead to the variation of the hydraulic gradient between groundwater and surface water levels in other words from high tide to low tide the declining seawater level increased the hydraulic gradient moreover estuarine sediments generally exhibit a large variety of macrobenthos kristensen and blackburn 1987 cai et al 2014 cai et al 2015 demonstrated that bioirrigation was the predominant process that controls solute transfer across the sediment water interface liu et al 2022 used experiments and numerical models to reveal that biological processes bioturbation and bioirrigation significantly enhanced solute transport to the overlying water hence we speculate that biological processes conducted by worms and bivalves in estuary are recognized as an important process that influences the transfer of dissolved carbon across the sediment water interface however tidal pumping leads to changes in the chemical properties of the overlying water which can also lead to the migration and transformation of dissolved carbon overall tidal pumping may be recognized as the primary driver of these two processes of sgd in addition moyangjiang delta is prone to earthquake wang et al 2020 the faults could serve as preferential conduits for meteoric water and may increase the potential contribution of terrestrial groundwater discharge santos et al 2011 4 3 carbon fluxes and comparisons with other studies the concentrations of dissolved carbon in river water are related to lithology groundwater discharge and or porewater exchange organic matter degradation and water residence time brunet et al 2005 in the distribution of doc vs salinity from time series measurement in the estuary most samples were above the conservative line especially in the low salinity range of 0 15 fig 7 a such result indicated significant doc production addition occurred in the low salinity range in this study average dic concentrations of all surface water was 3 7 times higher than the average doc concentration this suggested that dic was the dominant component of dissolved carbon in the distribution of dic vs salinity from time series measurement in the estuary samples with low salinity 0 15 were slightly above the conservative line fig 7b this also suggested dic production addition occurred in low salinity range unlike doc concentrations in the time series observation dic concentrations followed the tidal trend fig 3 the highest dic concentration was observed in seawater this phenomenon may be related to the deficiency of carbonates in the watershed similar phenomenon has also been observed in other studies e g sadat noori et al 2016 santos et al 2019 cabral et al 2021 the δ13c dic value at high tide was close to zero indicating that the main source of dic in the seawater is the dissolution of marine carbonates brunet et al 2005 in this study dic and doc were significantly positively correlated in groundwater r2 0 9 p 0 01 and sediment porewater r2 0 6 p 0 01 indicating that both carbon species have a similar source dissolved carbon fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated by multiplying groundwater discharge flux by concentration differences of dissolved carbon between average groundwater and river water groundwater discharge flux was averaged during a tidal cycle accordingly dic and doc fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated to be 1 19 0 10 107 mol d 1 and 3 23 0 25 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 dissolved carbon fluxes from the river were estimated by multiplying the upstream river discharge and average carbon concentration in river dic and doc fluxes from the river were then estimated to be 4 00 1 41 106 mol d 1 and 6 18 1 42 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 the contribution of terrestrial groundwater discharge to dic export exceeded that of the river loading dissolved carbon fluxes from porewater exchange were estimated by multiplying porewater exchange flux by concentration differences of dissolved carbon between porewater at a depth of 1 cm and overlying surface water tamborski et al 2021 dic and doc export rates from porewater exchange were estimated to be 44 6 6 1 and 60 7 8 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively when upscaling our estimated carbon export rates from local porewater exchange to the entire estuary area 3 5 105 m2 we obtained dic and doc fluxes of 1 56 0 21 105 mol d 1 and 2 12 0 29 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 although carbon export rates in the estuary may not be evenly distributed these estimated fluxes could be used as a first order estimate to compare relative magnitudes among the different sources from fig 8 terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export doc fluxes from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange were in the same order of magnitude porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized mangroves have been recognized as carbon rich ecosystem alongi 2014 sippo et al 2016 sippo et al 2016 and dittmar et al 2006 estimated average dic and doc exports of 59 mmol m 2 d 1 and 43 1 mmol m 2 d 1 from the global mangrove region respectively interestingly our estimated dic and doc export rates across the sediment water interface were comparable to those in carbon rich mangrove forests on the other hand tanner and eyre 2020 obtained an average sediment carbon burial rate estimation of 18 mmol m 2 d 1 in a tropical estuary sydney harbour estuary australia brown et al 2021 obtained an average sediment organic carbon burial rate estimation of 4 8 mmol m 2 d 1 in three tropical estuaries our estimated carbon export rates were higher than these carbon sequestration rates in the tropical estuary additionally the global average carbon sequestration rate in the estuary was estimated to be 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 alongi 2014 wang et al 2019b estimated average carbon sequestration rate of 36 9 mmol m 2 d 1 in tidal wetlands in united states our estimated carbon export rates in the tropical estuary were also higher than the average carbon sequestration rates in the global estuary and tidal wetlands these simple comparisons highlighted that terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange play an important role in the delivery of dissolved carbon into the estuary in summary both pathways of sgd contributed to different fluxes of dissolved carbon evaluating the contributions of different pathways of sgd to terrestrial solutes will help to improve the accuracy of sgd associated terrestrial solute fluxes in future studies 5 conclusions this study highlights the contribution of two different groundwater pathways terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange of dissolved carbon export to the estuarine water terrestrial groundwater discharge was quantified by a three end member mixing model porewater exchange was quantified based on the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized dic and doc export rates from porewater exchange were comparable to those from mangrove forests and higher than the average carbon sequestration rates in the estuary this study revealed that both pathways contributed a large amount of dissolved carbon export to the coastal water and play an important role in the delivery of dissolved carbon into the coastal water

1813,coastal terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange are two different submarine groundwater discharge sgd pathways the contribution of both pathways in dissolved carbon export to the coastal water remains almost unknown here we investigated terrestrial groundwater discharge porewater exchange and dissolved carbon export in a tropical estuary moyangjiang china using stable water δ2h and δ18o and radioactive 222rn 224ra and 228th isotopes the average terrestrial groundwater discharge was estimated to be 3 2 0 2 106 m3 d 1 by a three end member mixing model of δ18o and salinity the porewater exchange was estimated to be 11 3 0 14 cm d 1 by the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method accordingly dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated to be 1 19 0 10 107 and 3 23 0 25 105 mol d 1 respectively in comparison when upscaling to the whole estuary dic and doc export fluxes from porewater exchange were estimated to be 1 56 0 21 105 and 2 12 0 29 105 mol d 1 respectively terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized overall both pathways contributed a large amount of dissolved carbon export to the coastal water and play an important role in delivering terrestrial carbon across land ocean interface evaluating the contributions of different pathways of sgd to terrestrial solutes will help to improve the accuracy of sgd associated terrestrial solute fluxes keywords submarine groundwater discharge stable water isotopes radioactive isotopes 224ra 228th disequilibria dissolved carbon export data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuaries are important interfaces from land to ocean which are recognized as an important pathway for dissolved carbon to the ocean cai 2011 bauer et al 2013 dai et al 2022 the exchange of river water and seawater driven by tides causes spatiotemporal gradients of many physicochemical parameters in estuaries e g ph dissolved oxygen and salinity spiteri et al 2008 which strongly influences various biogeochemical processes including the carbon cycling canuel et al 2012 wu et al 2019 although estuaries account for only a small percentage 0 3 of global ocean area they play a disproportionately large role in the delivery of dissolved carbon to the ocean cai 2011 bauer et al 2013 liang et al 2020 hence a comprehensive assessment quantification of carbon sources and fluxes into estuaries is of great importance in constructing the global ocean carbon budget the main sources of dissolved carbon to estuaries include riverine inputs groundwater discharge or and porewater exchange and diffusion from bottom sediments groundwater is often rich in organic matter and can deliver high concentrations of dissolved carbon into the surface water of estuaries santos et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2017 submarine groundwater discharge sgd is any and all flow of water on continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force moore 2003 burnett et al 2003 previous studies have shown that sgd contributes significantly nutrients and carbon to the surface water which makes it a critical component in estuarine carbon nutrient biogeochemistry studies liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015a santos et al 2021 for example sadat noori et al 2017 revealed that groundwater discharge was a major source of dissolved carbon in a subtropical estuary sgd includes five different driving mechanisms terrestrial groundwater discharge density driven seawater circulation seasonal exchange of seawater shoreface circulation of seawater and cm scale porewater exchange garcia orellana et al 2021 however the roles of these processes in sgd and their contribution to dissolved carbon into the surface water remain largely unclear radium ra isotopes are useful tracers of sgd because of their wide ranges of half lives 223ra 11 4 d 224ra 3 7 d 226ra 1600 y and 228ra 5 75 y and conservative behaviors moore 1996 povinec et al 2012 garcia orellana et al 2021 wang et al 2021a xu et al 2022 they have been successfully applied to trace sgd over different spatial and temporal scales taniguchi et al 2019 wang et al 2019a recently the radium thorium isotope 224ra 228th disequilibrium method was used to quantify water exchange and solute export across the sediment water interface in many coastal zones cai et al 2012 tamborski et al 2021 wei et al 2022 stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o are also ideal tracers for investigating groundwater and surface water interactions in the coastal area povinec et al 2008 the isotope tracer integrates the signal from various groundwater pathways which makes it useful in the study of multiple processes in spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic systems burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 rodellas et al 2017 thus it can be a potential approach that contributes to study sgd dynamics in this study we utilize the three end member mixing model and the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method to estimate terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange and dissolved carbon export in a tropical estuary moyangjiang china we must highlight that strictly speaking porewater is synonymous with groundwater in order to clearly express these two driving mechanisms porewater refers specifically to centimeter scale groundwater at the sediment water interface e g burnett et al 2003 santos et al 2012 hong et al 2017 tambroski et al 2021 we aim to verify the hypothesis that terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange in the estuary can deliver a significant quantity of dissolved carbon to the coastal ocean to testify our assumption we determined the concentration and distribution of dissolved carbon in the estuary and assessed the roles of terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange as release mechanisms in the dissolved carbon export via the application of multiple tracers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site moyangjiang delta is located in the guangdong province southeast of china fig 1 there are two major tributaries namely moyangjiang river and nalong river fig 1 the climate in this region frequently influenced by the marine monsoon and tropical and subtropical high pressure climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 2200 mm with 80 occurring in the period from april to august the temperature variation is limited between each month and the annual average temperature is 23 c moyangjiang estuary is dominated by semidiurnal tides tidal height varied between 0 5 and 3 0 m during the sampling period 2 2 sample collection the river water rw01 rw13 n 13 and groundwater gw01 gw05 n 7 samples in moyangjiang and nalong tributaries were collected during december 17th 18th in 2020 time series samples of river water rw14 n 13 were collected every two hours for 24 h two full tidal cycles at the mouth of the estuary during december 18th 19th in 2020 the sampling sites of river water groundwater and sediment cores are outlined in fig 1 in order to select a representative radon 222rn activity in river water we collected river water at a depth of 1 0 m in order to select a representative 222rn activity in groundwater groundwater samples need to be collected as close to the river as possible e g santos et al 2010 sadat noori et al 2017 in this study groundwater samples were collected in the riparian edge about 1 3 m meters away from the river by using a push point piezometer and a peristaltic pump the depths of the groundwater samples depended on the field conditions the volumes of river water and groundwater samples for 222rn analysis were 2 l and 250 ml respectively in the field water samples for stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o were prefiltered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate filter and were preserved into 15 ml polyethylene bottles without headspace water samples for dissolved carbon were collected into clean 40 ml brown glass bottles water samples for dissolved organic carbon dic and its isotope δ13c dic were prefiltered through a 0 22 μm polycarbonate filter and were capped without air bubbles inside the bottles samples for dissolved organic carbon doc were prefiltered through a 0 25 μm polycarbonate filter and were preserved after addition of 2 m hcl until ph 2 all water samples were kept in the dark at 4 6 c until analyses in addition salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do for all water samples were measured in situ using a handheld hi9828 model probe hanna sediments core samples for 224ra and 228th analysis were collected using a gravity drill during the cruise the sampling station of sediment cores was located at the mouth of the estuary fig 1 sediment core samples were stored vertically during their transport to the laboratory in the laboratory one sediment core was sectioned into 1 cm thick slices to measure activities of surface exchangeable 224ra and 228th hereafter simply referred to as total 224ra and 228th corresponding to sediment core for 224ra and 228th analyses we also used additional 8 10 sediment cores to extract porewater porewater in sediments was extracted from the methods proposed by seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 briefly porewater 50 ml was extracted from sediment cores by inserting rhizon samplers directly into sediments via pre drilled sampling ports at depths of 1 5 10 20 and 30 cm porewater samples were slowly poured onto 25 g mn fibers to extract dissolved 224ra 2 3 analytical methods activities of 222rn half life 3 83 d in river water and groundwater were measured in the field using an automated radon in air monitor rad 7 durridge co burnett et al 2001 peterson et al 2019 in order to reduce the uncertainty of 222rn activity we increased the counting time for at least 2 h santos et al 2010 the uncertainty of 222rn was generally lower than 20 activities of total 224ra and 228th half life 1 91 y in sediments were determined using a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc cai et al 2015 tamborski et al 2021 activities of total 224ra and 228th were measured according to the detailed procedure in cai et al 2012 the propagated error associated with 224ra and 228th activities in bulk sediment averages 3 4 for the entire data set cai et al 2020 sediments were dried at 80 c for 48 h and water content loss was measured to calculate sediment porosity activities of dissolved 224ra adsorbed on mn fibers were also measured on a radecc system these 224ra activities were determined according to the detailed procedure in moore and arnold 1996 because the volume of collected porewater in muddy sediments was relatively small we increased the counting time more than 24 h to achieve a minimum of 1000 counts in the 220 channel of radecc system so that the counting uncertainty can be constrained within 3 4 cai et al 2020 dic and δ13c dic were determined within 24 h after sampling doc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analyzer germany after removing dic by bubbling oxygen through the acidified samples the instrument was calibrated using a standard potassium phthalate solution diluted to within the range of concentrations estimated for the doc content of the samples samples for dic without acidification were used to determine dissolved total carbon by the toc analyzer dic concentrations were then calculated as the difference between dissolved total carbon and doc the measurement uncertainties of doc and dic concentration were better than 3 the δ2h and δ18o values of water samples were measured separately by the water equilibrium method gillikin and bouillon 2007 wang et al 2015b for δ2h 300 μl sample water was transferred into a 12 ml vial and a pt stick catalyst was added in each vial the vials were then sealed and flushed with he h2 gas mixture 99 he and 1 h2 at a rate of 50 ml min for 8 min after 40 min the vials were measured using a gasbench ii coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer 253 plus thermo fisher scientific usa for δ18o 300 μl sample water was transferred into a 12 ml vial the vials were sealed and flushed with he co2 gas mixture 99 7 he and 0 3 co2 at a rate of 50 ml min for 8 min samples were placed at 23 c for 48 h to reach the equilibrium state and then measured using the same system with δ2h the δ2h and δ18o values were calibrated to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow by running a serious of chinese standards with known δ2hvsmow and δ18ovsmow values the inner outer precision were 0 4 2 0 for δ2h values 0 06 0 1 for δ18o values the δ2h and δ18o values were reported relative to the vsmow the δ13c dic values were determined by the method described by gillikin and bouillon 2007 five drops of 99 h3po4 were added to a 12 ml vial sealed and flushed with 99 999 he for 8 min at a rate of 80 ml min then 700 μl sample water was transferred to the vial using 1 ml syringes and placed at 23 c for 24 h the vials of different samples were measured using the same system with δ2h and δ18o the δ13c values of samples were calibrated to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb standard by running a working standard nahco3 solution with 30 mg l 1 dic the δ13cvpdb value of nahco3 is 5 08 0 1 which is determined using iaea co 8 δ13cvpdb 5 764 0 032 the inner outer precision for δ13c values were 0 06 0 2 the δ13c values were reported relative to the vpdb standard 2 4 three end member mixing model the end member mixing model has frequently been used to estimate the proportions of different water sources moore 2003 liu et al 2012 petermann et al 2019 water sources at the estuary mainly included upstream river water groundwater discharge and open seawater here salinity and δ18o were used to construct the three end member mixing model given the water mixing at the estuary a three end member mixing model was then built as the following equation 1a f r f gw f o 1 1b s r f r s gw f gw s o f o s m 1c 18 o r f r 18 o gw f gw 18 o o f o 18 o m where f is the fraction of each end member s is the salinity and δ18 o is the value of δ18o the subscript r gw and o represent river water end member groundwater end member and open sea water end member respectively the subscript m represents measured value in the estuary based on river discharge qr unit m3 d 1 and the proportion of river and groundwater terrestrial groundwater discharge qgw unit m3 d 1 was then calculated as the following equation 2 q gw q r f r f gw 2 5 the 224ra 228th disequilibrium model in benthic environments 224ra can be desorbed in saline water while parent 228th is strongly bound to solid particles cai et al 2012 accordingly the 224ra 228th disequilibrium is developed recently for the quantification of porewater and solute exchange across the sediment water interface in coastal zones tamborski et al 2021 wei et al 2022 briefly the dissolved 224ra migrates across the sediment water interface into the surface water through various processes like groundwater and or porewater exchanges garcia orellana et al 2021 which results in the deficits in 224ra relative to 228th in sediments the deficit flux of 224ra is calculated by integrating the activity difference of 228th and 224ra across the depth at which 224ra deficit occurs until some depth at which 224ra and 228th reach secular equilibrium cai et al 2012 the expression that describes the 224ra deficit flux from the sediment water interface is given by 3 f ra o z λ ra a th a ra d z where f ra is the 224ra deficit flux dpm m 2 d 1 λ ra is the decay constant of 224ra 0 189 d 1 z is the depth horizon below which 224ra and 228th reach secular equilibrium m ara and ath are 224ra and 228th activities in sediments dpm m 3 respectively based on estimated 224ra export flux porewater exchange qpx unit m d 1 was evaluated as the following equation 4 q px f ra a dra pw a dra ow where a dra pw and a dra ow are dissolved 224ra activities in sediment porewater and overlying water dpm l 1 respectively 3 results 3 1 river water 3 1 1 spatial distribution observations salinity ranged from 0 to 10 8 and gradually increased from upstream to the mouth of the estuary fig 2 water ph ranged from 6 82 to 7 56 with an average of 7 28 higher ph was observed at the downstream of the river activities of 222rn in river water ranged from 99 26 to 362 49 bq m 3 with an average of 217 75 bq m 3 the highest activity was observed at the downstream values of δ18o in river water ranged from 5 8 to 3 7 with an average of 5 0 values of δ2h in river water ranged from 38 1 to 24 8 with an average of 33 2 dic concentrations ranged from 701 to 1182 μm with an average of 874 μm while doc concentrations ranged from 281 to 358 μm with an average of 309 μm the highest dic concentration was observed near the estuary fig 2 in which the highest doc concentration was observed values of δ13c dic ranged from 8 5 to 5 2 with an average of 7 3 3 1 2 time series observations at the mouth of the estuary salinity ranged from 8 12 to 29 58 and followed a tidal trend with higher values at high tide and lower values at low tide fig 3 salinity and tidal height showed about 2 hour time difference because the tidal station is located downstream of the sampling station fig 3 water ph ranged from 7 67 to 7 98 with an average of 7 82 water ph showed similar trends as salinity fig 3 in other words ph reached the maximum value at high tide and dropped to the minimum value at low tide there was no clear tidal trend for do whereas the lowest do concentration was observed at high tide activities of 222rn ranged from 630 49 bq m 3 to 109 35 bq m 3 with an average of 348 178 bq m 3 222rn followed an opposite tidal trend and was clearly seen to have the highest activity at low tide and the lowest activity at high tide fig 3 values of δ18o ranged from 4 1 to 0 8 with an average of 2 9 values of δ2h ranged from 28 6 to 6 5 with an average of 19 3 both δ2h and δ18o showed a tidal cycle that reached the maximum value at high tide and the minimum value at low tide fig 3 dic concentrations ranged from 1099 to 1919 μm with an average of 1387 μm dic followed the tidal trend with the highest concentration observed at high tide fig 3 δ13c dic also showed a tidal cycle that reached a maximum of 2 1 at high tide and dropped to 5 8 at low tide doc concentrations ranged from 278 to 358 μm with an average of 309 μm doc followed the inverse tidal trend with the lowest concentration observed at high tide fig 3 suggesting doc deficiency in seawater 3 2 groundwater analysis results for groundwater are outlined in table 1 seven groundwater samples were collected from upstream to the mouth of the estuary the average ph 6 7 0 4 and do 2 7 0 1 mg l 1 in groundwater were lower than observations in river water activities of 222rn in groundwater ranged from 1820 113 to 9957 236 bq m 3 the average 222rn activity 6581 2402 bq m 3 in groundwater was an order of magnitude higher than that in river water 217 75 bq m 3 concentrations of doc in groundwater ranged from 204 to 941 μm with an average of 410 μm concentrations of dic in groundwater ranged from 611 to 18578 μm with an average of 4900 μm the average concentrations of doc and dic in groundwater were higher than those in rivers values of δ18o in groundwater ranged from 6 8 to 5 3 with an average of 5 9 which was more depleted than river water values of δ13c dic in groundwater ranged from 17 0 to 7 9 with an average of 13 0 3 3 sediments and porewater total 224ra and 228th activities from the depth profile sediment are presented in fig 4 activities of total 224ra and 228th in sediments were in the range of 0 231 0 012 1 219 0 040 dpm g 1 and 0 273 0 010 1 313 0 037 dpm g 1 respectively the total 224ra 228th ratios ranged from 0 844 0 052 to 1 149 0 058 since 224ra is produced by the decay of 228th total 224ra and 228th showed a very similar distribution pattern at all layers fig 4a more importantly activities of total 224ra were lower than those of 228th in sediments fig 4a indicating that total 224ra was in dramatic deficit with respect to 228th activities of 224ra dic and doc concentrations in sediment porewater and the overlying water are presented in table 2 activities of dissolved 224ra in porewater ranged from 9 48 1 42 to 50 74 3 10 dpm l 1 in comparison the activity of dissolved 224ra in overlying river water was 7 91 0 60 dpm l 1 dic concentrations ranged from 1977 to 3829 μm and doc concentrations ranged from 788 to 1491 μm concentrations of dic and doc were higher in porewater than that of overlying water 4 discussion 4 1 terrestrial groundwater discharge the precipitation samples were used to determine the local meteoric water line lmwl the best fit was δ2h 7 95δ18o 6 45 r2 0 98 which differed slightly from the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 from fig 5 a we found that δ2h and δ18o of upstream river water was located on the lmwl indicating low evapotranspiration rates in this study area moreover several samples of river water time series were slightly deviated from the lmwl fig 5a however the δ2h and δ18o fitting line of river water upstream and time series passed through the open seawater end member 0 0 fig 5a this indicated that the deviation of stable isotopes was caused by the conservative mixing between the open seawater and river water deuterium excess d excess was defined as d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 and it was less variable compared with δ2h and δ18o the d excess has been shown to be an important indicator of reflecting differences in humidity between vapor source and evaporation huang and pang 2012 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 kong et al 2019 in this study the values of d excess ranged from 0 to 10 fig 5b more importantly the d excess and δ18o fitting line of river water approximately passed through the open seawater end member 0 0 fig 5b this also indicated that the conservative mixing was the major reason for the modification of isotopic composition additionally there was significant positive relationship between δ18o and salinity of river water time series fig 5c indicating a conservative behavior of δ18o in the estuary therefore we concluded that river water δ18o was conservative and was mainly controlled by conservative mixing and the modification of isotopic composition caused by the evapotranspiration could be ignored the relevant low evapotranspiration rates may be related to the local high humidity and the relatively small scale of our study area stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o have been increasingly used to identify water sources in different coastal regions e g petermann et al 2018 debnath et al 2019 wang et al 2021b in this study a three end member mixing model was established by using salinity and δ18o this study showed significantly differences in δ18o among upstream river water groundwater and seawater fig 5c strictly speaking there were four end members i e terrestrial groundwater discharge porewater exchange river seawater we need to emphasize that porewater exchange is referred to the water exchange across the sediment water interface in a relatively small spatiotemporal scale m and hours santos et al 2012 alorda kleinglass et al 2019 hong et al 2017 chen et al 2021 this process may have little impact on water volume and salinity burnett et al 2003 moreover the values of δ18o were mainly affected by isotope fractionation mechanism e g evapotranspiration given a relatively small spatiotemporal scale of porewater exchange in this study i e 30 cm depth it might be reasonable to assume that δ18o was not fractionated during the pore water exchange process indeed we found that salinity and δ18o of sediment pore water are basically consistent with that of the overlying river water see table 2 which may offer more confidence in this assumption overall in the end member mixing model established by salinity and δ18o the porewater end member was implicitly included in the seawater end member average values of δ18o in upstream river water at stations rw01 rw13 and groundwater at stations gw01 gw05 were used as corresponding end members the value of δ18o at high tide was recognized as seawater end member end member values used in the mixing model are listed in table 3 based on equation 1 the proportions of upstream river water groundwater and seawater at the estuary were averagely 30 20 and 50 respectively seawater was recognized as the dominant component of the water at the mouth of the estuary the average upstream river discharge was 4 6 106 m3 d 1 during december cheng et al 2016 tang and wang 2022 based on equation 2 the average terrestrial groundwater discharge was then estimated to be 3 2 0 2 106 m3 d 1 which was 68 of the average upstream river discharge groundwater is recognized as the dominant source of baseflow koskelo et al 2012 this indicated our estimated terrestrial groundwater discharge was the groundwater contributing to the river downstream from the gauged location likely including baseflow moreover the proportions of upstream river water and groundwater were strongly and negatively correlated with the salinity fig 6 in comparison the proportion of seawater showed strong positive correlations with salinity fig 6 4 2 porewater exchange 224ra deficits were observed in the sediment at depths ranging from 0 to 7 cm from 18 to 25 cm and from 30 to 35 cm fig 4 suggesting the recent mobilization and transport of 224ra notably total 224ra activities in sediments of depths ranging from 7 to 18 cm were higher than that of 228th fig 4 this phenomenon may be explained by radium adsorption on the high level manganese dioxide in the sediment this phenomenon was also observed in other estuaries and salt marshes e g cai et al 2014 shi et al 2019 tamborski et al 2021 integrating 224ra flux across the depths from 0 to 36 cm 224ra export flux was estimated to be 490 120 dpm m 2 d 1 from eq 3 considering the activity difference of 224ra between porewater at a depth of 1 cm and overlying surface water porewater exchange flux was then estimated to be 11 3 0 14 cm d 1 from eq 4 the calculated deficit of 224ra in the sediment is a summed value from various processes that occurred at the sediment water interface which included the molecular diffusion cai et al 2015 cai et al 2020 according to the activity gradients of dissolved 224ra and fick s first law the molecular diffusive 224ra flux was estimated to be 4 0 dpm m 2 d 1 considering that the total flux of 224ra was two orders of magnitude higher than the molecular diffusive flux of 224ra the result indicated a negligible amount of 224ra export driven by molecular diffusion across the sediment water interface the relationship between 222rn and tidal level provides insight into the driving forces of groundwater discharge 222rn is produced by the decay of radium isotope 226ra in sediments here the average activity of 222rn in terrestrial groundwater was an order of magnitude higher than that in surface water this indicated that groundwater was likely an important source of 222rn moreover 222rn followed an opposite tidal trend with higher values at high tide and lower values at low tide which was consistent with time series measurements in global estuaries e g sadat noori et al 2015 petermann et al 2018 peterson et al 2019 here we highlighted that the sources of 222rn included both terrestrial groundwater discharge and cm scale porewater exchange from the sediment water interface this suggested that tidal pumping influenced these two processes of sgd water table rises and drops in the estuary caused by tidal fluctuations would eventually lead to the variation of the hydraulic gradient between groundwater and surface water levels in other words from high tide to low tide the declining seawater level increased the hydraulic gradient moreover estuarine sediments generally exhibit a large variety of macrobenthos kristensen and blackburn 1987 cai et al 2014 cai et al 2015 demonstrated that bioirrigation was the predominant process that controls solute transfer across the sediment water interface liu et al 2022 used experiments and numerical models to reveal that biological processes bioturbation and bioirrigation significantly enhanced solute transport to the overlying water hence we speculate that biological processes conducted by worms and bivalves in estuary are recognized as an important process that influences the transfer of dissolved carbon across the sediment water interface however tidal pumping leads to changes in the chemical properties of the overlying water which can also lead to the migration and transformation of dissolved carbon overall tidal pumping may be recognized as the primary driver of these two processes of sgd in addition moyangjiang delta is prone to earthquake wang et al 2020 the faults could serve as preferential conduits for meteoric water and may increase the potential contribution of terrestrial groundwater discharge santos et al 2011 4 3 carbon fluxes and comparisons with other studies the concentrations of dissolved carbon in river water are related to lithology groundwater discharge and or porewater exchange organic matter degradation and water residence time brunet et al 2005 in the distribution of doc vs salinity from time series measurement in the estuary most samples were above the conservative line especially in the low salinity range of 0 15 fig 7 a such result indicated significant doc production addition occurred in the low salinity range in this study average dic concentrations of all surface water was 3 7 times higher than the average doc concentration this suggested that dic was the dominant component of dissolved carbon in the distribution of dic vs salinity from time series measurement in the estuary samples with low salinity 0 15 were slightly above the conservative line fig 7b this also suggested dic production addition occurred in low salinity range unlike doc concentrations in the time series observation dic concentrations followed the tidal trend fig 3 the highest dic concentration was observed in seawater this phenomenon may be related to the deficiency of carbonates in the watershed similar phenomenon has also been observed in other studies e g sadat noori et al 2016 santos et al 2019 cabral et al 2021 the δ13c dic value at high tide was close to zero indicating that the main source of dic in the seawater is the dissolution of marine carbonates brunet et al 2005 in this study dic and doc were significantly positively correlated in groundwater r2 0 9 p 0 01 and sediment porewater r2 0 6 p 0 01 indicating that both carbon species have a similar source dissolved carbon fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated by multiplying groundwater discharge flux by concentration differences of dissolved carbon between average groundwater and river water groundwater discharge flux was averaged during a tidal cycle accordingly dic and doc fluxes from terrestrial groundwater discharge were estimated to be 1 19 0 10 107 mol d 1 and 3 23 0 25 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 dissolved carbon fluxes from the river were estimated by multiplying the upstream river discharge and average carbon concentration in river dic and doc fluxes from the river were then estimated to be 4 00 1 41 106 mol d 1 and 6 18 1 42 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 the contribution of terrestrial groundwater discharge to dic export exceeded that of the river loading dissolved carbon fluxes from porewater exchange were estimated by multiplying porewater exchange flux by concentration differences of dissolved carbon between porewater at a depth of 1 cm and overlying surface water tamborski et al 2021 dic and doc export rates from porewater exchange were estimated to be 44 6 6 1 and 60 7 8 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively when upscaling our estimated carbon export rates from local porewater exchange to the entire estuary area 3 5 105 m2 we obtained dic and doc fluxes of 1 56 0 21 105 mol d 1 and 2 12 0 29 105 mol d 1 respectively fig 8 although carbon export rates in the estuary may not be evenly distributed these estimated fluxes could be used as a first order estimate to compare relative magnitudes among the different sources from fig 8 terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export doc fluxes from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange were in the same order of magnitude porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized mangroves have been recognized as carbon rich ecosystem alongi 2014 sippo et al 2016 sippo et al 2016 and dittmar et al 2006 estimated average dic and doc exports of 59 mmol m 2 d 1 and 43 1 mmol m 2 d 1 from the global mangrove region respectively interestingly our estimated dic and doc export rates across the sediment water interface were comparable to those in carbon rich mangrove forests on the other hand tanner and eyre 2020 obtained an average sediment carbon burial rate estimation of 18 mmol m 2 d 1 in a tropical estuary sydney harbour estuary australia brown et al 2021 obtained an average sediment organic carbon burial rate estimation of 4 8 mmol m 2 d 1 in three tropical estuaries our estimated carbon export rates were higher than these carbon sequestration rates in the tropical estuary additionally the global average carbon sequestration rate in the estuary was estimated to be 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 alongi 2014 wang et al 2019b estimated average carbon sequestration rate of 36 9 mmol m 2 d 1 in tidal wetlands in united states our estimated carbon export rates in the tropical estuary were also higher than the average carbon sequestration rates in the global estuary and tidal wetlands these simple comparisons highlighted that terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange play an important role in the delivery of dissolved carbon into the estuary in summary both pathways of sgd contributed to different fluxes of dissolved carbon evaluating the contributions of different pathways of sgd to terrestrial solutes will help to improve the accuracy of sgd associated terrestrial solute fluxes in future studies 5 conclusions this study highlights the contribution of two different groundwater pathways terrestrial groundwater discharge and porewater exchange of dissolved carbon export to the estuarine water terrestrial groundwater discharge was quantified by a three end member mixing model porewater exchange was quantified based on the 224ra 228th disequilibrium method terrestrial groundwater discharge derived dic flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that from porewater exchange and was three times greater than that from river discharge terrestrial groundwater discharge was recognized as a significant contributor to dic export porewater exchange played a disproportionately important role in the delivery of doc to the ocean and its contribution to doc needed to be emphasized dic and doc export rates from porewater exchange were comparable to those from mangrove forests and higher than the average carbon sequestration rates in the estuary this study revealed that both pathways contributed a large amount of dissolved carbon export to the coastal water and play an important role in the delivery of dissolved carbon into the coastal water

1814,recently it has been demonstrated that the use of lagged discharge in long short term memory lstm networks represents an effective method for streamflow prediction so called data integration di however it is uncertain if a transfer learning tl model which did not include recent discharge when trained on the source region can reap the benefits of including recent discharge data this study investigated the ability of tl to provide daily streamflow predictions for a few watersheds in a snow dominated region target while transferring the knowledge acquired from the conterminous united states source based on an lstm architecture the performance of the tl model was compared with that of a physically based model pbm hydrotel additionally testing the source model on the target region demonstrated the performance of the model used in tl the approaches applied to improve the accuracy of tl included use of i di of recent observed flows and simulated flows hydrotel to improve predictions ii different meteorological and physiographic variables from the source and target datasets iii incremental numbers of training watersheds from the target region testing the source model with di at the target region produced test period median kling gupta efficiency kge and nash sutcliffe log model efficiency nash log values of 0 837 and 0 870 respectively the best performance was achieved with the tl model using di with a maximum number of watersheds median values of 0 953 and 0 942 for nash log and kge respectively moreover including pbm simulated flows improved predictions reducing the variability of performance metrics our findings show that tl and additional new procedures could significantly enhance streamflow predictions even when di models are available keywords streamflow prediction transfer learning deep learning lstm data integration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has been affecting water resources availability and management worldwide in regions such as northeastern north america where winter precipitation is dominated by snow climate variability and global warming are expected to affect hydrologic processes the seasonality of river flows may change with earlier spring peak flows in addition to increased winter flows and decreased summer flows barnett et al 2005 dibike coulibaly 2005 providing these regions with reliable streamflow predictions is of high importance currently streamflow is generally modeled using either physically based models pbms or data driven models such as deep learning dl or machine learning ml models the former models depend on governing equations considering complex mechanisms of the hydrologic cycle while the latter models rely on existing relationships among data the fact that key processes and human activities are inadequately represented in pbms limits their use not to mention their high computational costs shen et al 2018 on the other end dl models have shown outstanding achievements in predicting and understanding land atmospheric interactions at low computational cost without knowing the complex mechanisms considered in pbms shen et al 2021 shen lawson 2021 recently there has been significant interest in long short term models lstms in hydrology which are the focus of this study they are specially designed to process sequential data and they have been broadly used for time series prediction of hydrologic variables alizadeh et al 2021 fang shen 2020 kratzert et al 2018 ouyang et al 2021 rahmani et al 2021a rahmani et al 2021b shen et al 2021 furthermore considering three gates in lstm design led to significant improvements in the prediction accuracy of time series compared to traditional recurrent neural networks rnn several lstm applications have been explored to improve hydrological prediction and forecasting cho and kim 2022 used the lstm to predict the residual errors of wrf hydro weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system simulations when compared to observations hunt et al 2022 developed a medium range streamflow forecast systemusing lstm in a hybrid system that was initially trained with historical era5 reanalyses and observations and under operational forecasting conditions the lstm ingested variables from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs girihagama et al 2022 demonstrated that coupling an attention mechanism to an lstm model could improve model performance during prediction using unseen non overlapping data compared to the standard lstm they concluded that this attention based lstm model could be used with a higher level of confidence to develop real time streamflow forecasting systems for canadian watersheds on the other hand granata et al 2022 compared the performance of a novel model based on stacking random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms during forecasting with that of a bi directional lstm model a complicated model both models had equivalent forecasting capabilities however the stacked model performed better at predicting peak flows but much worse at predicting low flows meanwhile feng et al 2020 showed that they could further improve the accuracy of streamflow predictions using lagged flow observations as inputs to an lstm they called the procedure of leveraging recent flow observations to improve predictions data integration di however such exceptional performance of dl models in hydrologic sciences here e g lstms comes from training these models on large datasets such as camels addor et al 2017 catchment attributes for large sample studies to mitigate overfitting and further improve the prediction accuracy shin et al 2016 zhuang et al 2021 as pooling data together becomes beneficial for deep networks fang et al 2022 in most parts of the world there is a lack of accessibility to such datasets in terms of quality and quantity for example in many parts of the world including québec canada streamflow observations are quite sparse with records often available only for a few years alipour kibler 2018 bitew gebremichael 2011 feng et al 2021 therefore can the most relevant dl models reliably achieve significant performance for streamflow prediction if not which methods could be coupled to help them attain more accurate predictions tl is a common technique in artificial intelligence ai that mainly uses the knowledge contained in a task i e the source domain to improve the performance of a model on another similar task i e the target domain where data collection is limited although tl was first introduced by pratt and jennings 1996 where a controversial argument was made based on a survey of transfer between connectionists it did not receive growing interest until 2009 pan yang 2009 due to the increase in dataset size and complexity as well as the desire for faster and more efficient model training tl has been more and more popular in recent years based on differences between the source and target tl can be divided into three categories pan yang 2010 redko et al 2019 it is known as transductive tl also referred to as domain adaptation in some studies when the source and target share the same task but have different domains when the source task and the target task are different within the same domain inductive tl takes place and the learning is done via inductive bias finally if the source and target have different domains and different tasks this type of learning is known as unsupervised tl whereby common representations are learned despite the absence of no direct similarities between the source and target one of the key advantages is that it can drastically minimize the amount of labelled data required to train a model this is particularly helpful in domains where labelled data are difficult to come by or expensive to acquire blitzer et al 2007 tl has been widely used to transfer models from image classification and recognition datasets to similar tasks such as in remote sensing guo et al 2020 liu et al 2022 nowakowski et al 2021 however only some studies have focused on performing tl particularly to predict the hydrological time series bedi 2022 kimura et al 2019 this further underscores the importance of performing tl in hydrological modeling for example ma et al 2021 attempted to transfer a pretrained lstm with camels dataset across continents to three regions with different densities of data namely britain central chile and china they showed tl could substantially improve streamflow prediction in the data scarce areas of chile and china but it could not elevate the results for britain the benefits gradually lessened if the target region had long term records despite wide uses of tl it also has some limitations indeed one challenge remains the source domain and the target domain must be sufficiently similar also the pre trained model and tl technique being used can have a big impact on the performance zhao et al 2021 thus it behooves to carefully experiment to identify the best strategy for a task to avoid negative transfer pan yang 2010 torrey shavlik 2010 it is undeniable that previous studies have enhanced our knowledge of employing tl in hydrological modelling in streamflow prediction particularly there are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding this subject here we applied tl using lstm as the modeling platform pretrained over the camels dataset for streamflow predictions of eight watersheds in southern québec canada this study answers several research questions i how does the tl model compare against an operational physically based streamflow model ii can tl improve the performance of di models iii can pbm simulations provide value as inputs for a tl model iv how does the seasonality performance of tl compare to that of a pbm 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets this study used two types of datasets to transfer knowledge from highly monitored regions in the usa source dataset to a moderately monitored region in southern québec canada target dataset camels was selected as the source dataset addor et al 2017 this dataset is freely accessible and provides data for 671 watersheds with minimum human disturbances across conus conterminous united states shown in fig 1 camels has various sub datasets covering meteorological or forcing data observed flows and physiographic data or static attributes all the data are aggregated and reported at the watershed scale the period for most of the watersheds goes back to 1980 daymet which had the highest spatial resolution 1 km among the three gridded data sources was used to generate the meteorological data all watersheds in camels 671 were selected to train the source model training period from january 1 1989 to january 1 2006 and testing period from january 1 2006 to october 1 2013 southern québec was selected to conduct the tl with just a few watersheds eight see table 1 along with their corresponding static attributes data these watersheds are located over five hydrographic regions of the st lawrence river see fig 2 their corresponding drainage areas vary from medium watersheds 591 km2 to large ones 6768 km2 foulon and rousseau 2018 reported that the region surrounding the st lawrence river depicted in fig 2 has a mean annual temperature of 1 8 c and a mean annual total precipitation of 940 mm based on the meteorological data 1981 2002 1995 and 1996 being unavailable from natural resources canada all watersheds are snow dominated while the annual peak flow generally occurs during the spring freshet table 2 and table 3 foulon rousseau 2018 provide a summary of the hydroclimatic characteristics for the two hydrologic seasons of summer 1 june to 30 november and winter 1 december to 31 may the mean winter rainfall is more varied with a mean of 214 mm and a standard deviation of 64 mm meanwhile the mean summer rainfall is 548 mm and moreuniform among the watersheds standard deviation of 32 mm the mean snowfall is 273 mm while the standard deviation of the mean snowfall is 55 mm in the summer and winter the mean temperature is 11 2 c and 4 2 c respectively in accordance with the seasons the mean temperature during summer and winter has a standard deviation of 1 7 c and 2 6 c respectively the mean daily flows are 1 2 and 1 9 mm during summer and winter with standard deviations of 0 4 and 0 23 respectively summer rainfalls and convective storms which are more variable than snowfalls are responsible for the higher variability of summer flows most of the required variables of the target dataset came from hysets hydrometeorological sandbox école de technologie supérieure arsenault et al 2020 a gathering of various datasets among the available meteorological datasets the daily era5 reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 was chosen as the primary source of forcing data for the target dataset the reliability of this dataset over the target domain has been demonstrated by several studies tarek et al 2020a 2020b the training period ranged from december 1 1982 to december 1 1991 while the testing period was from december 1 1991 to december 1 2002 the required input variables for near optimum daily streamflow prediction using an lstm model have been reported previously by feng et al 2020 table s1 considering that some of the input variables may not be accessible for southern québec the common input variables are introduced in table 4 along with their corresponding dataset from which they were extracted another model used along the hysets database to extract some physiographic data was that produced using physitel a semi automatic gis based framework noël et al 2014 turcotte et al 2001 physitel allows easy watershed segmentation and parametrization of relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus or hillslopes and interconnected river segments rss to extract physiographic data e g elevation the value of the variable of interest at the centroid of each rhhu was multiplied by the area of the rhhu after the summation of all values the resulting product was divided by the area of the whole watershed the hydrometric data were provided by the québec ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change melcc 2022 2 2 long short term memory lstm architecture the modelling framework in this study was long short term memory networks lstm recurrent neural networks rnn in contrast to typical artificial neural networks ann can strongly connect data from previous time series with that from a current time series however rnns are unable to preserve the long term dependencies in the input sequences when the distance between the relevant informationand the point where it is required increases to solve the vanishing or exploding gradient issues in the rnn computational process lstm was developed lstm has four functions to operate with three of them acting as governing gates hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 controlling the information flow through cells additionally another cell state so called ct has been added in the lstm structure to save the learned information then the stored information is transferred to cell ht the structure of the four functions is illustrated in fig 3 the cell state located in the upper left corner of the diagram illustrates the transition of ct 1 to ct and represents the core of lstm meanwhile a vector of zeros of a user defined length is initialized to represent the hidden state h then lstm uses a sigmoid function f acting as a decision gate in the cell that decides which information to be forgotten and to what degree this gate which is called the forget gate was initially introduced by gers et al 2000 the ft function is introduced in eq 1 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f where ft is the resulting vector ranging between 0 and 1 while σ is the sigmoid function σ x 1 1 e x the two adjustable weight matrices and the bias vector are wf uf and bf respectively then two additional functions are used for deciding the information contained in the cell state more specifically function g t hyperbolic tangent function tanh x e x e x e x e x creates a vector of new candidate values for the cell state in the range 1 1 function i another sigmoid function in the range 0 1 assigns what information can be added to the cell state and plays the role of input gate finally these two functions are combined with the forget gate information f function to update the previous step of cell state ct 1 to the current ct as follows 2 g t tanh w g x t u g h t 1 b g 3 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where the operator implies element wise multiplication and ensures the information will be preserved in lstm both ft and it range between 0 and 1 in addition to assigning values of 0 for the forget gate and values of 1 for it for keeping the valuable information the final gate is the output gate or o function responsible for which information should be transferred out of the cell state and updates the hidden state using a hyperbolic tangent function 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t thus the long term dependencies can be learned through these equations in lstm in a way that first no information can get lost because the cell state is defined as a linear function unlike rnns on top of that the introduction of the new three gates in lstm allows this neural network to preserve the information for long time steps this feature of lstm can prevent exploding and vanishing of the back propagation step hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 which can occur in rnns the output of the final lstm layer is connected to a dense layer at the last time step hn as follows 7 y w d h n b d where y is the final predicted value of streamflow and wd and bd are the weight matrix of the dense layer and the bias term respectively it should be mentioned that applying these structures would significantly increase the number of adjustable parameters for the learning process which can result in some degree of overfitting for cases such as for small datasets the lstm model used for pretraining using all observations of 671 watersheds has shown very good performance for snow dominated regions in the usa feng et al 2020 although the camels dataset includes information from various regions 2 3 transfer learning transfer learning was used to predict streamflow for a few watersheds in southern québec during the training process of deep networks such as lstm some weights are assigned to hidden layers in addition to nonlinear activation functions the information during training is saved through weights with some parts of the network self organizing to perform specific functionalities as dictated by the architecture of the lstm tl was performed in two steps step one the source model was pretrained on the source dataset also known as weight initialization step two after the pretraining the stored model along with the initialized weights was entirely or partially trained once more on the target dataset the weights could be modified during training on the target dataset weight initialization or kept constant weight freezing in regions with limited access to data without performing tl the model cannot find the relationships that exist among the inputs e g forcing and static attributes and the target here observed flows final training modified and fine tuned all or parts of the weights to better fit the model over the target dataset while the model converged faster the advantage of weight freezing over pretraining is the reduction of the size of the training dataset required for calibration and the possibility of overfitting ma et al 2021 the tl process is illustrated in fig 4 tl model was constructed based on training on all watersheds in southern québec in contrast to watershed by watershed modeling 2 4 physically based model the pbm chosen for this study is hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model compatible with remote sensing and gis data bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012 fortin et al 2001 fossey et al 2015 turcotte et al 2007 the model was used to provide simulated flows to the lstm to develop a physics informed tl model and a benchmark as well the québec ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change has been applying hydrotel for hydrological forecasting turcotte et al 2004 and hydroclimatic projections defacc 2018 the hydrological processes modeled by hydrotel include spatial distribution of precipitation and temperature snow accumulation and melt soil temperature freezing vertical water balance i e infiltration evapotranspiration soil water movement wetland hydrology overland flow routing and river routing hydrological modeling through hydrotel is based on dividing the watershed into hillslopes a k a relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhu subdivided into three soil layers and interconnected river segments rss draining the units the first soil layer is considered a thin layer interflow and baseflow are controlled through the second and third layers respectively the water contents of the three soil layers are calculated as state variables at each time step either daily or sub daily readers are referred to fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2007 and fossey et al 2015 for more details on hydrotel the model was automatically calibrated using a global optimization algorithm dds see tolson and shoemaker 2007 and foulon and rousseau 2018 for more details and a combination of the kling gupta efficiency criterion kling et al 2012 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash sutcliffe 1970 the latter was calculated using log transformed flows oudin et al 2006 this approach can be beneficial for predicting both high and low flows foulon rousseau 2018 notably lstm and hydrotel used the data time series differently during training while lstm was trained on all the available data observed flows were excluded from november to march under ice cover during the calibration of hydrotel and a one year spin up period was considered 2 5 data pre processing data pre processing and normalization are crucial tasks for ml and dl studies because the approach used can influence how accurate predictions are made as well as how long training takes nawi et al 2013 each problem requires specific methods and algorithms for data pre processing which depends on the types of variables common data pre processing includes data cleaning dealing with missing data data transformation which changes the scale type and probability distributions of variables and applying techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of input variables maharana et al 2022 the goal is to obtain a mean close to zero for data distribution to speed up the learning process and the convergence according to feng et al 2020 if the watersheds are batched together during streamflow modeling the lack of data pre processing would result in considering wetter watersheds more in the calculation of default loss while with data normalization the model errors are identically distributed among watersheds within the same batch normalization of inputs and output was done according to the data pre processing suggested by feng et al 2020 normalization of the streamflow variable was marginally different from other variables dimensionless streamflow was obtained by dividing the streamflow by the watershed area and mean annual precipitation this way the lstm model can better realize the relationships between the dimensionless target streamflow and input variables then another transformation was applied to achieve a gaussian distribution as follows 8 v log 10 v 0 1 where v and v are the streamflow variables after and before transformation respectively then a final transformation was applied to all the variables including the forcing data streamflow and static attributes to normalize them as follows 9 x i n e w x i x σ where x i n e w x i x and σ are the standardized raw mean and standard deviation values for the variable respectively the results shown in section 3 were converted to the original scale before standardization 2 6 numerical experiments 2 6 1 testing the source model on target watersheds to understand the performance of the source model on the target region the model trained using all conus basins was tested on watersheds of southern québec in three ways i the forward model with forcing and static attributes given as inputs during training and testing the term forward is used to ease the comparison with di models ii the di model trained on conus and tested on target watersheds the inputs were forcing data static attributes and observed streamflows from the previous day which for simplicity is called qt 1 afterwards and iii finally the di model trained on conus while during testing the observed streamflows prediction target were replaced with hydrotel simulated flows and then used to replace qt 1 the actual observed streamflows were used to evaluate the performance of this specific case during the calculation of evaluation metrics more details about the process of testing the source model on the target region can be found in figure s2 the training period over camels was from january 1 1989 to january 1 2006 while the testing period of the target dataset was from december 1 1991 to december 1 2002 so the results can be compared with the results introduced in section 2 6 2 2 6 2 improving tl approaches the baseline tl model that was compared with hydrotel simulated flows and observed flows was the forward model incorporating only forcing and static attribute data results are shown in section 3 2 the following approaches were proposed to train and improve the prediction accuracy of the baseline tl model against hydrotel i the tl model was pretrained on all available forcing and static attribute data in camels input variables of source dataset introduced in table s1 in contrast the input data used during training on the target region was more limited than camels input variables introduced in table 4 for simplicity performing tl while different forcing and static attributes variables are used from source and target datasets is called different input data dd as opposed to performing tl while the same forcing and static attributes variables are used from source and target datasets namely same input data sd fig 5 depicts how forcing and static attribute variables differ between the source and target datasets the variables used for model training in tl with sd are displayed as the input layer target in fig 5 apart from qsim which represents hydrotel simulated flows and is not included in the source dataset yet there remains the question of whether to use dd or sd to do tl modeling for the other approaches of this study values of 1 and 0 in the names of tl models see table 6 indicate performing tl with dd and sd respectively ii the tl model was trained with qt 1 as well as forcing and static attribute data called data integration di in the name of the models di appears before tl to distinguish the di models from the forward ones all di tl models were developed and used while di was applied during pretraining and training on the source and target datasets respectively there was a particular model whereby di was applied only in training on the target region and not during pretraining to show if tl can improve the performance of di models thus the name of this model is indicated as tl di 1 8 see table 6 iii the tl model was trained with simulated flows of hydrotel along with forcing and static attribute data it has been shown that hydrotel simulated flows could provide satisfactory predictions for the selected watersheds of southern québec foulon rousseau 2018 two tl models of di and forward were constructed in this part in the names of these models s denotes the use of simulated flows in model training iv the tl model that had the number of training watersheds increased from 8 to 34 in southern québec locations of the 34 watersheds are displayed in figure s1 in the name of this series of tl models the number of watersheds involved in the training distinguishes this approach from the rest to complement the comparison local models referred to the lstm models trained on the target region without performing tl were trained for each approach to understand the benefit of using tl compared to local model training more detailed descriptions of all models tl and local models and the flowchart of the model building process are provided in figures s3 and s4 2 7 model evaluation criteria and hyper parameters 2 7 1 performance metrics in the current study the following metrics were deployed to assess model performance kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 it breaks up nash sutcliffe efficiency nse into its constitutive parts correlation variability bias and mean bias like nse kge ranges from and 1 while kge of 1 shows perfect agreement between simulated and observed flows it has been used for model calibration and validation since it addresses some of the shortcomings of using only nse as the performance metric and is given by 10 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where β s o and γ σ s s σ o o and r pearson correlation coefficient log nash sutcliffe efficiency nash log oudin et al 2006 nash log is the nse nash sutcliffe 1970 calculated on log transformed flows it has greater efficiency in terms of favoring both high and low flows during streamflow simulation nash log ranges from to 1 and a value of 1 shows the optimal value of nash log it is calculated as follows on log transformed flows 11 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 root mean squared error rmse singh et al 2005 it measures the spread of error residuals and it ranges from 0 to while rmse of 0 shows no residual errors it is calculated as follows 12 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n pearson correlation coefficient corr pearson 1920 pearson correlation is a measure of linearity between two variables for this case study between simulated and observed flows a value between 1 and 1 is assigned to corr where 1 shows total negative correlation 1 shows total positive correlation and 0 illustrates no correlation among the variables corr or r is the root square of r2 that according to krause et al 2005 explains the degree of dispersion of observed values by predicted values if a model always results in underestimation or overestimation it could still have a high value for r2 and as a result in corr even if all the predicted values by that model are wrong thus it is suggested to use additional evaluation metrics along with using corr to interpret the modeled values the equation to calculate corr is given by 13 corr i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 it measures how much the average of simulated values are inclined to be higher or lower than those observed it ranges between and while 0 shows the optimal value it is given by 14 pbias i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 where in all the above equations o and s refer to the means of observed o and simulated s flows respectively σ s and σ o stand for standard deviations of simulated and observed flows respectively where n is the number of observed flows all metrics were calculated for the testing period for sake of comparison the period from january 1 1995 to may 31 1997 was excluded due to the absence of simulated flows of hydrotel in this period 2 7 2 hyperparameters the parameters defining the architecture of dl models are termed hyperparameters finding their optimal values represents a critical task as it directly affects the accuracy and reliability of the learning models a proper selection of hyperparameters can distinguish a state of the art performance from an average performance hutter et al 2015 the rmse between predicted and observed streamflows was selected as the objective function to be minimized or loss function and the adadelta algorithm was adopted as the optimization method zeiler 2012 in comparison to pure stochastic gradient descent the adadelta algorithm has a very low computational overhead and dynamically self adjusts over time using only first order information the methodappears to be robust to noisy gradient information various model architectural choices diverse data modalities and selected hyperparameters while not requiring manual optimization of the learning rate the optimized parameters for the models used in this study were batch size hidden layer size epoch parameters of dropout algorithm and length of training instances batch size controls the number of training examples given to the model for calculating the loss function before updating the matrices of weights hidden layer size determines the number of layers between input and output layers which also characterizes the degree of complexity of the network one epoch is defined as one forward run for all training examples the length of training instances determines the length of the time series for each training sample dropout which randomly drops network nodes along with all the other connections is a regularization technique specifically for neural networks the degree of regularization is controlled through a parameter called dropout rate the dropout rate is the proportion of units that are dropped out during training for instance a dropout rate of 0 5 means that half of the network units are randomly dropped out during each training iteration the source lstm model and the tl models have their hyperparameter combinations manually tested and selected table 5 contains information about the tested and optimal values of hyperparameters the length of training instances was the same for both models 365 days the snow and subsurface storage processes can be represented by training instances of 365 days however the length of the selected training instance does not restrict the lstm memory to 365 days 3 results this section is organized as follows first the results of testing the source model on target watersheds are presented second the overall performance of the baseline tl model is discussed third the added value of approaches to boost the performance of the baseline tl model are introduced and fourth the performance of hydrotel and the best tl model for different seasons are presented table 6 shows the performance of all models presented in this study 3 1 performance of source model tested on target watersheds testing the forward model on target watersheds achieved a negative value for nash log median test period thus further assessment was not pursued fig 6 shows the results of testing the di model on target watersheds di model using observed flows could provide satisfactory results during testing kge and nash log values of 0 837 and 0 870 respectively on the target region testing the di model on the target watersheds with limited access to observation records shown as di s in fig 6 could achieve decent median kge and nash log values of 0 745 and 0 569 moriasi et al 2007 indicated that nash log values larger than 0 5 could provide a good fit of the hydrograph and a satisfactory fit with the 1 1 line on the plot of observed versus simulated flows 3 2 performance of baseline tl model hydrotel and tl performed better than the local model during the test period fig 7 hydrotel and tl had similar median kge values 0 845 and 0 839 respectively tl offered solid performance for predicting baseflows as quantified by nash log compared to hydrotel with a higher median and smaller variabilities in predicted values median values of 0 762 and 0 679 for tl and hydrotel respectively even the local model performed slightly better than hydrotel in capturing the baseflows median value of 0 685 the median corr of the test period was slightly larger for tl compared to hydrotel 0 884 and 0 871 respectively while the rmse of tl was relatively smaller than that of hydrotel 37 515 m3 s and 39 360 m3 s respectively however the pbias values of hydrotel were better than those of tl with a closer median value to zero value of 1 007 while the median pbias of tl was 7 842 fig 8 shows the performance of the above models based on their hydrographs for one of the watersheds the batiscan watershed along with the 10th and 90th percentiles of observed data and the observed mean annual hydrographs for the selected watersheds of southern québec the general shapes of the mean annual hydrograph are almost similar hence the hydrograph of only one of them is presented hydrographs of the remaining watersheds can be found in the supporting material tl and hydrotel cornflower blue and green curves in fig 8 respectively showed good agreement with the observed flows and are well within the 10th to 90th percentile band of the observed flows shaded area in fig 8 in some places the local model outreached the 10th to 90th percentile band while hydrotel underestimated the peak flows the tl model was inclined to overestimate the occurrence of peak flows in spring 3 3 added value of applying different approaches to improve the baseline tl model this section introducesthe results of applying different approaches to improve the efficiency of the baseline tl model against hydrotel 3 3 1 performance of the tl models using different forcing and static attribute variables from source and target datasets the results of performing tl forward model using dd and sd are illustrated in fig 9 a using the sd approach resulted in higher evaluation metrics median values of 0 864 0 768 0 899 42 347 m3 s and 8 73 for kge nash log corr rmse and pbias respectively compared to using dd median values of 0 787 0 745 0 867 48 374 m3 s and 17 72 for kge nash log corr rmse and pbias respectively to perform tl in di tl models see fig 9 b the use of dd could achieve a slightly higher median kge value than sd in developing di tl models the median nash log and rmse values of di tl models using sd and dd were almost of the same median nash log values of 0 919 and 0 933 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 1 8 respectively median rmse values were 17 511 m3 s and 17 987 m3 s for the di tl models using sd and dd during training respectively the median corr value of the case when sd was used was slightly higher value of 0 971 compared to 0 964 in contrast the median pbias of using dd in di tl models was lower value of 1 193 compared to 5 748 with smaller variabilities around the median fig 10 shows the mean observed annual hydrograph compared to the mean annual hydrographs of simulated flows by tl and di tl models using dd and sd for the batiscan watershed in the hydrograph of tl models using sd could improve the accuracy of simulated flows compared to dd comparison of blue and medium spring green curves in fig 10 at the same time slight improvements were provided in di tl models using dd when compared to sd brown curve versus the yellow curve in fig 10 in summary sd seemed to be a more effective approach and the rest of the models were built using sd in tl except for cases where hydrotel simulated outputs were added as inputs to the tl model 3 3 2 performance of di tl models the performance metrics reported for di models are shown in fig 11 providing recent observed flows as an input to the tl model generally improved model accuracy the values of the metrics of di models showed that the increments provided by tl weight initialization and freezing were minor compared to applying tl with forward models the sequence of increments can be realized by comparing the tl models with the local model even for this series of models with minor increments tl could elevate the results from 0 894 median kge value of di local 8 to 0 942 for the median kge of di tl 0 34 which showed the best performance among di models furthermore focusing on di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 we see that their performances are very similar for di tl 0 34 median values of 0 942 0 953 15 425 m3 s 0 970 and 0 066 for kge nash log rmse corr and pbias respectively and for di tl 0 8 median values of 0 904 0 923 16 025 m3 s 0 900 and 5 800 for kge nash log rmse corr and pbias respectively the performance of tl di 1 8 confirms the power of tl to improve the di models even though the di model was not used during pretraining the values of the metrics reported in fig 11 are too close to clearly see the difference indeed without loss of continuity if we now look at nse nash sutcliffe efficiency values the reported values for di local 8 0 908 and tl di 1 8 0 914 have a 0 06 nse difference fig 12 shows the mean annual hydrograph of the batiscan watershed for the simulated flows generated by di models and the observed flows the performance of tl di 1 8 in capturing the peak flows during the spring was similar to that of di tl 0 34 dark blue curve versus orange curve while having some problems in the summer and the fall to capture the peak flows although tl di 1 8 could achieve very good results given their performance metrics and hydrographs when compared to those of the di tl models di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 not including di during pretraining caused larger variabilities in the predictions around the median 3 3 3 performance of tl models incorporating simulated flows as inputs fig 13 shows the results of tl models including hydrotel simulated flows as inputs their median kge values tl s 1 8 and di tl s 1 8 were nearly identical 0 84 and 0 838 respectively to that of hydrotel 0 845 alone however lower variabilities in predictions were observed around the median value for tl s 1 8 compared to hydrotel nash log values of all physics informed models values of 0 795 0 806 and 0 822 for local s 8 di tl s 1 8 and tl s 1 8 respectively built in this study were higher than the median value of hydrotel 0 679 once more the variabilities of predictions around the median of nash log values were smaller for physics informed models compared to hydrotel the median values of corr for the physics informed models were greater than the median of hydrotel with superior performance for di tl s 1 8 value of 0 90 the median values of rmse for the physics informed models values of 36 910 35 335 and 35 90 m3 s for local s 8 di tl s 1 8 and tl s 1 8 respectively were slightly samller than that of hydrotel 39 36 m3 s alone finally the pbias of hydrotel was closer to zero than those of the other models overall tl s 1 8 had the best performance among this series of models 3 3 4 performance of tl models when increasing the number of watersheds fig 14 shows the results of increasing the number of watersheds with similar climatological characteristics in both series of models forward and di models an increase in the number of watersheds enhanced the performance but of a different increment while for tl models tl 0 8 and tl 0 34 slight improvements are observed for all performance metrics for di tl models di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 including more watersheds during training using the target region resulted in greater improvements compared to tl models especially in terms of kge values of 0 904 and 0 942 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 nash log values of 0 923 and 0 953 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 and pbias 5 80 and 0 066 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 3 4 seasonal performance fig 15 displays the results of seasonal flow predictions by hydrotel and di tl 0 34 this model represents the best tl model in this study tl had better performance metrics throughout the year than hydrotel having a better median test period during all seasons in the winter spring summer and fall for instance the median kge values of di tl 0 34 were 0 911 0 946 0 892 and 0 904 respectively and for hydrotel the corresponding median kge values were 0 761 0 832 0 659 and 0 711 4 discussion in this section first we discuss the performance of the baseline tl model and the results of testing the source model on target watersheds second the incremental benefits of applying different approaches to improve tl for streamflow prediction are discussed finally the seasonal performances of the best tl model and hydrotel are thoroughly discussed 4 1 testing the source model and baseline tl model results of testing the source model on target watersheds means that if we intend to test the forward model on a region where we only have meteorological data and static attributes that would not be a practical test to take and meteorological data are not impactful enough during testing comparison of the results of testing the di model with the results of testing the forward model on the target region singles out the power of di models to provide streamflow predictions with acceptable accuracy even during testing while having access to some simulated flows when compared to hydrotel the baseline tl model and the local model both outperformed the latter in capturing the baseflows that is due to the remarkable ability of lstm models to capture low flow patterns this suggests the current version of hydrotel cannot not reproduce satisfactorily baseflow processes when calibrated pbms like hydrotel often focus more heavily on the peaks and sacrifice low flows but lstm is less sensitive to such tradeoffs analysis of the performance metrics and the mean annual hydrographs of the baseline tl model and of hydrotel indicates that the former requires some improvements in flow prediction during spring and summer two seasons with a higher frequency of peak flows 4 2 tl improving approaches the analysis of the results of using dd different forcing and static attribute variables for source and target datasets and sd same forcing and static attribute variables for source and target datasets in tl and di tl models indicates that using sd seems preferable in this study although using dd provided slight improvements in di tl models the gains were minor compared to improvements provided by sd in forward tl models row a in fig 9 where the use of sd showed superior performance over dd however this does not mean that using dd in tl modeling will not significantly improve with shorter data records or other regions since these models are data driven and results may differ from region to region based on the data involved in training moreover the use of dd in tl development shows the power of dl to adapt easily to new conditions however it may not be as easy for pbms for pbms running the model without having the exact inputs required is relatively impossible although the performance of di tl models was improved compared to hydrotel it should be noted that in this series of models qt 1 was included in tl modeling while data assimilation was not provided for hydrotel however it is much easier to integrate data here qt 1 in this way than performing standard data assimilation e g ensemble kalman filtering with pbms e g samuel et al 2019 comparing increments provided by di tl models and tl models sequence of increments were higher for tl models it can be realized that tl is mainly more effective for cases dealing with regional data scarcity although the target dataset used in this study had access to fewer variables than those available through camels we could access an almost complete flow record for the selected watersheds of southern québec this is in contradiction with the concept of data scarcity but these di tl models have the potential to be used for providing predictions for nearby watersheds dealing with data sparsity by fine tuning the di tl model comparable performances of di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 fig 11 suggests that although increasing the number of watersheds could decrease the prediction errors we could get almost the same results with fewer watersheds although the performance of tl di 1 8 was comparable to that of other models in the series of di tl models the analysis of the tl di 1 8 model revealed that larger variabilities made in the predictions of the tl di 1 8 demonstrate the value of pretraining with di over the source model and how well knowledge gained from the source dataset can be used to improve predictions in the target region analysis of tl models incorporating simulated flows of hydrotel showed that di tl s 1 8 could not elevate the results significantly although the di model was used during pretraining one of the reasons for this outcome could be associated with the errors embedded in the hydrotel simulated flows that lowered the accuracy of predictions generated by the tl model overall analysis of the results of this approach shows using hydrotel simulated flows as inputs were beneficial since they could improve nash log corr and rmse while achieving similar kge values moreover they could reduce the variabilities of predictions for all watersheds compared to hydrotel especially based on the nash log and pbias values although combining tl technique with di showed significant enhancement in predictions fig 11 the superior performance of tl s 1 8 demonstrates the importance of physics informed tl and dl models in real world applications this is due to the restricted availability of streamflow data in some areas and the often higher cost of even obtaining them compared to using pbm simulated flows as an alternative finally tl models where the number of watersheds had been increased using a more extensive dataset at the target region achieved better performance in both forward and di models small improvements provided by increasing the number of watersheds consistent with the results reported for di tl models indicate the importance of grouping the watersheds before training rather than just increasing the number of watersheds which can be further investigated in the future the prediction results indicate that tl models achieve better prediction performance compared to applying the lstm model on the target region without tl local model training which is consistent with the findings previously reported by bedi 2022 li et al 2021 in summary among all tl models the di tl model with the number of watersheds increased from 8 to 34 in the target region obtained the best performance readers are referred to figure s12 and figure s13 to see the boxplots and hydrographs of all models compared to the work of ma et al 2021 although they used a higher density of basins with a shorter training period and a longer pretraining period the highest median nse value was 0 86 for camels cl and camels gb in this study the median nse value of the baseline without any improvement was 0 803 using eight watersheds tl 0 8 as mentioned before by feng et al 2020 the source model developed over camels reached exceptional performance especially in mountainous and snow dominated watersheds the eight 8 watersheds selected for projecting tl modeling are classified as snow dominated watersheds demonstrating the potential of performing tl modeling for this region achieving significant performance after applying the proposed tl improving approaches median values of nash log of 0 953 kge of 0 942 and nse of 0 932 for di tl 0 34 the final tl models were obtained by a partially frozen model probably due to having a smaller dataset in the target region moreover southern québec watersheds can be qualified as large watersheds the median drainage area for the watersheds at the target region was 3498 km2 while that for camels watersheds was 329 62 km2 highlighting the fact that achieving the optimal performance of the tl model depends on the sufficient change of weights during training this is consistent with the results previously reported by ma et al 2021 4 3 seasonal performance of tl and hydrotel models results of tl and hydrotel models indicated better performance of both models in the spring and then during fall the two seasons with large flow variability although hydrotel considered summer flows during calibration its performance was deemed poor the hydrotel version used for this study does not account for water uptake in the hydrographic network preliminary results with a newer version of the model have illustrated that accounting for water withdrawals can improve the results of simulated flows during the summer albeit not shown here contrastingly the performance of the di tl 0 34 model was relatively lower in summer lower median e g in kge and pearson correlation compared to its performance during other seasons and that may be because of the presence of more extreme flows during summer compared to winter as a reminder during the calibration process of hydrotel winter flows were not accounted for yet the model performed relatively well compared to other seasons according to values of kge corr rmse and pbias in contrast di tl 0 34 model had the smallest median rmse of 7 545 m3 s and a high median kge nash log and correlation 0 911 0 919 and 0 954 respectively during winter this indicates the inherent advantage of lstm models in tracking the hydrologic processes during the winter generally both models had difficulties capturing flows during summer and some actions should be considered to improve their results accordingly although the superior performance of hydrotel was observed during the spring in general there is a probability of large bias involved in simulations during the spring due to higher values of corr and rmse compared to the performance during the winter 5 conclusions lagged discharge in long short term memory lstm networks has been shown to be a successful technique for streamflow prediction or so called data integration di while the use of di has proven useful with deep learning dl no study has previously shown the ability of a transfer learning tl model to reap the significant benefits of adding recent discharge data in this study an lstm model trained on camels addor et al 2017 dataset over the conus conterminous united states was transferred to a snow dominated region utilizing hysets arsenault et al 2020 as the target dataset in quebec canada and multiple improvement strategies were implemented to enhance the performance of the tl model performances of tl models were compared to a physically based model pbm hydrotel how well the source model would function in tl was determined by testing the source model on the target region results of testing the source model on the target region did not yield meaningful results when only meteorological and physiographic data from camels were used during training however once the di model had been used to produce predictions for the target region through testing the accuracy of the predictions varied depending on the availability of recent observations of discharge in the target region in the tl scheme the baseline tl model which was trained with meteorological and physiographic data performed well when compared to hydrotel especially when it came to capturing low flows however it needed to be enhanced additionally it was discovered that performing tl with the same meteorological and physiographic variables from the source and target datasets provided a more acceptable performance than doing so with different meteorological and physiographic variables among the approaches suggested for improving the performance of the baseline tl model employing di with a maximum number of watersheds from the target region achieved the highest prediction accuracy the di tl model that was trained using only eight watersheds nevertheless was likewise highly effective the performance of the di tl models when di was not used during pretraining showed that tl could even increase the performance of di models the models requiring less improvement as they employed recent discharge observations in the model training when streamflow observations did not exist including hydrotel simulated flows could improve the streamflow predictions by reducing the prediction errors the results of this study highlight the significance of the tl scheme to transfer knowledge from data rich regions to snow dominated regions and improve streamflow prediction for those regions due to the ability of the lstm model to extract information from large datasets and tracking of long term hydrological processes the tl models used in this study can also be applied to nearby watersheds not having sufficient streamflow records and provide predictions with good accuracy furthermore this study shows that large hydrological datasets like camels contain more information that can possibly be modeled by a pbm improving the prediction accuracy of extreme flows to elevate the performance of the tl model during seasons like summer certainly represents a valuable avenue of research slight improvements provided by increasing the number of training watersheds in tl demonstrate the necessity of exploring some criteria to group the watersheds before training to achieve exceptional predictive skills in future works rather than just increasing the number of watersheds furthermore it is suggested to investigate the performance of physics informed tl models shen et al 2023 during the spatial test training in one site and testing in another site

1814,recently it has been demonstrated that the use of lagged discharge in long short term memory lstm networks represents an effective method for streamflow prediction so called data integration di however it is uncertain if a transfer learning tl model which did not include recent discharge when trained on the source region can reap the benefits of including recent discharge data this study investigated the ability of tl to provide daily streamflow predictions for a few watersheds in a snow dominated region target while transferring the knowledge acquired from the conterminous united states source based on an lstm architecture the performance of the tl model was compared with that of a physically based model pbm hydrotel additionally testing the source model on the target region demonstrated the performance of the model used in tl the approaches applied to improve the accuracy of tl included use of i di of recent observed flows and simulated flows hydrotel to improve predictions ii different meteorological and physiographic variables from the source and target datasets iii incremental numbers of training watersheds from the target region testing the source model with di at the target region produced test period median kling gupta efficiency kge and nash sutcliffe log model efficiency nash log values of 0 837 and 0 870 respectively the best performance was achieved with the tl model using di with a maximum number of watersheds median values of 0 953 and 0 942 for nash log and kge respectively moreover including pbm simulated flows improved predictions reducing the variability of performance metrics our findings show that tl and additional new procedures could significantly enhance streamflow predictions even when di models are available keywords streamflow prediction transfer learning deep learning lstm data integration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has been affecting water resources availability and management worldwide in regions such as northeastern north america where winter precipitation is dominated by snow climate variability and global warming are expected to affect hydrologic processes the seasonality of river flows may change with earlier spring peak flows in addition to increased winter flows and decreased summer flows barnett et al 2005 dibike coulibaly 2005 providing these regions with reliable streamflow predictions is of high importance currently streamflow is generally modeled using either physically based models pbms or data driven models such as deep learning dl or machine learning ml models the former models depend on governing equations considering complex mechanisms of the hydrologic cycle while the latter models rely on existing relationships among data the fact that key processes and human activities are inadequately represented in pbms limits their use not to mention their high computational costs shen et al 2018 on the other end dl models have shown outstanding achievements in predicting and understanding land atmospheric interactions at low computational cost without knowing the complex mechanisms considered in pbms shen et al 2021 shen lawson 2021 recently there has been significant interest in long short term models lstms in hydrology which are the focus of this study they are specially designed to process sequential data and they have been broadly used for time series prediction of hydrologic variables alizadeh et al 2021 fang shen 2020 kratzert et al 2018 ouyang et al 2021 rahmani et al 2021a rahmani et al 2021b shen et al 2021 furthermore considering three gates in lstm design led to significant improvements in the prediction accuracy of time series compared to traditional recurrent neural networks rnn several lstm applications have been explored to improve hydrological prediction and forecasting cho and kim 2022 used the lstm to predict the residual errors of wrf hydro weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system simulations when compared to observations hunt et al 2022 developed a medium range streamflow forecast systemusing lstm in a hybrid system that was initially trained with historical era5 reanalyses and observations and under operational forecasting conditions the lstm ingested variables from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs girihagama et al 2022 demonstrated that coupling an attention mechanism to an lstm model could improve model performance during prediction using unseen non overlapping data compared to the standard lstm they concluded that this attention based lstm model could be used with a higher level of confidence to develop real time streamflow forecasting systems for canadian watersheds on the other hand granata et al 2022 compared the performance of a novel model based on stacking random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms during forecasting with that of a bi directional lstm model a complicated model both models had equivalent forecasting capabilities however the stacked model performed better at predicting peak flows but much worse at predicting low flows meanwhile feng et al 2020 showed that they could further improve the accuracy of streamflow predictions using lagged flow observations as inputs to an lstm they called the procedure of leveraging recent flow observations to improve predictions data integration di however such exceptional performance of dl models in hydrologic sciences here e g lstms comes from training these models on large datasets such as camels addor et al 2017 catchment attributes for large sample studies to mitigate overfitting and further improve the prediction accuracy shin et al 2016 zhuang et al 2021 as pooling data together becomes beneficial for deep networks fang et al 2022 in most parts of the world there is a lack of accessibility to such datasets in terms of quality and quantity for example in many parts of the world including québec canada streamflow observations are quite sparse with records often available only for a few years alipour kibler 2018 bitew gebremichael 2011 feng et al 2021 therefore can the most relevant dl models reliably achieve significant performance for streamflow prediction if not which methods could be coupled to help them attain more accurate predictions tl is a common technique in artificial intelligence ai that mainly uses the knowledge contained in a task i e the source domain to improve the performance of a model on another similar task i e the target domain where data collection is limited although tl was first introduced by pratt and jennings 1996 where a controversial argument was made based on a survey of transfer between connectionists it did not receive growing interest until 2009 pan yang 2009 due to the increase in dataset size and complexity as well as the desire for faster and more efficient model training tl has been more and more popular in recent years based on differences between the source and target tl can be divided into three categories pan yang 2010 redko et al 2019 it is known as transductive tl also referred to as domain adaptation in some studies when the source and target share the same task but have different domains when the source task and the target task are different within the same domain inductive tl takes place and the learning is done via inductive bias finally if the source and target have different domains and different tasks this type of learning is known as unsupervised tl whereby common representations are learned despite the absence of no direct similarities between the source and target one of the key advantages is that it can drastically minimize the amount of labelled data required to train a model this is particularly helpful in domains where labelled data are difficult to come by or expensive to acquire blitzer et al 2007 tl has been widely used to transfer models from image classification and recognition datasets to similar tasks such as in remote sensing guo et al 2020 liu et al 2022 nowakowski et al 2021 however only some studies have focused on performing tl particularly to predict the hydrological time series bedi 2022 kimura et al 2019 this further underscores the importance of performing tl in hydrological modeling for example ma et al 2021 attempted to transfer a pretrained lstm with camels dataset across continents to three regions with different densities of data namely britain central chile and china they showed tl could substantially improve streamflow prediction in the data scarce areas of chile and china but it could not elevate the results for britain the benefits gradually lessened if the target region had long term records despite wide uses of tl it also has some limitations indeed one challenge remains the source domain and the target domain must be sufficiently similar also the pre trained model and tl technique being used can have a big impact on the performance zhao et al 2021 thus it behooves to carefully experiment to identify the best strategy for a task to avoid negative transfer pan yang 2010 torrey shavlik 2010 it is undeniable that previous studies have enhanced our knowledge of employing tl in hydrological modelling in streamflow prediction particularly there are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding this subject here we applied tl using lstm as the modeling platform pretrained over the camels dataset for streamflow predictions of eight watersheds in southern québec canada this study answers several research questions i how does the tl model compare against an operational physically based streamflow model ii can tl improve the performance of di models iii can pbm simulations provide value as inputs for a tl model iv how does the seasonality performance of tl compare to that of a pbm 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets this study used two types of datasets to transfer knowledge from highly monitored regions in the usa source dataset to a moderately monitored region in southern québec canada target dataset camels was selected as the source dataset addor et al 2017 this dataset is freely accessible and provides data for 671 watersheds with minimum human disturbances across conus conterminous united states shown in fig 1 camels has various sub datasets covering meteorological or forcing data observed flows and physiographic data or static attributes all the data are aggregated and reported at the watershed scale the period for most of the watersheds goes back to 1980 daymet which had the highest spatial resolution 1 km among the three gridded data sources was used to generate the meteorological data all watersheds in camels 671 were selected to train the source model training period from january 1 1989 to january 1 2006 and testing period from january 1 2006 to october 1 2013 southern québec was selected to conduct the tl with just a few watersheds eight see table 1 along with their corresponding static attributes data these watersheds are located over five hydrographic regions of the st lawrence river see fig 2 their corresponding drainage areas vary from medium watersheds 591 km2 to large ones 6768 km2 foulon and rousseau 2018 reported that the region surrounding the st lawrence river depicted in fig 2 has a mean annual temperature of 1 8 c and a mean annual total precipitation of 940 mm based on the meteorological data 1981 2002 1995 and 1996 being unavailable from natural resources canada all watersheds are snow dominated while the annual peak flow generally occurs during the spring freshet table 2 and table 3 foulon rousseau 2018 provide a summary of the hydroclimatic characteristics for the two hydrologic seasons of summer 1 june to 30 november and winter 1 december to 31 may the mean winter rainfall is more varied with a mean of 214 mm and a standard deviation of 64 mm meanwhile the mean summer rainfall is 548 mm and moreuniform among the watersheds standard deviation of 32 mm the mean snowfall is 273 mm while the standard deviation of the mean snowfall is 55 mm in the summer and winter the mean temperature is 11 2 c and 4 2 c respectively in accordance with the seasons the mean temperature during summer and winter has a standard deviation of 1 7 c and 2 6 c respectively the mean daily flows are 1 2 and 1 9 mm during summer and winter with standard deviations of 0 4 and 0 23 respectively summer rainfalls and convective storms which are more variable than snowfalls are responsible for the higher variability of summer flows most of the required variables of the target dataset came from hysets hydrometeorological sandbox école de technologie supérieure arsenault et al 2020 a gathering of various datasets among the available meteorological datasets the daily era5 reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 was chosen as the primary source of forcing data for the target dataset the reliability of this dataset over the target domain has been demonstrated by several studies tarek et al 2020a 2020b the training period ranged from december 1 1982 to december 1 1991 while the testing period was from december 1 1991 to december 1 2002 the required input variables for near optimum daily streamflow prediction using an lstm model have been reported previously by feng et al 2020 table s1 considering that some of the input variables may not be accessible for southern québec the common input variables are introduced in table 4 along with their corresponding dataset from which they were extracted another model used along the hysets database to extract some physiographic data was that produced using physitel a semi automatic gis based framework noël et al 2014 turcotte et al 2001 physitel allows easy watershed segmentation and parametrization of relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus or hillslopes and interconnected river segments rss to extract physiographic data e g elevation the value of the variable of interest at the centroid of each rhhu was multiplied by the area of the rhhu after the summation of all values the resulting product was divided by the area of the whole watershed the hydrometric data were provided by the québec ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change melcc 2022 2 2 long short term memory lstm architecture the modelling framework in this study was long short term memory networks lstm recurrent neural networks rnn in contrast to typical artificial neural networks ann can strongly connect data from previous time series with that from a current time series however rnns are unable to preserve the long term dependencies in the input sequences when the distance between the relevant informationand the point where it is required increases to solve the vanishing or exploding gradient issues in the rnn computational process lstm was developed lstm has four functions to operate with three of them acting as governing gates hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 controlling the information flow through cells additionally another cell state so called ct has been added in the lstm structure to save the learned information then the stored information is transferred to cell ht the structure of the four functions is illustrated in fig 3 the cell state located in the upper left corner of the diagram illustrates the transition of ct 1 to ct and represents the core of lstm meanwhile a vector of zeros of a user defined length is initialized to represent the hidden state h then lstm uses a sigmoid function f acting as a decision gate in the cell that decides which information to be forgotten and to what degree this gate which is called the forget gate was initially introduced by gers et al 2000 the ft function is introduced in eq 1 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f where ft is the resulting vector ranging between 0 and 1 while σ is the sigmoid function σ x 1 1 e x the two adjustable weight matrices and the bias vector are wf uf and bf respectively then two additional functions are used for deciding the information contained in the cell state more specifically function g t hyperbolic tangent function tanh x e x e x e x e x creates a vector of new candidate values for the cell state in the range 1 1 function i another sigmoid function in the range 0 1 assigns what information can be added to the cell state and plays the role of input gate finally these two functions are combined with the forget gate information f function to update the previous step of cell state ct 1 to the current ct as follows 2 g t tanh w g x t u g h t 1 b g 3 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where the operator implies element wise multiplication and ensures the information will be preserved in lstm both ft and it range between 0 and 1 in addition to assigning values of 0 for the forget gate and values of 1 for it for keeping the valuable information the final gate is the output gate or o function responsible for which information should be transferred out of the cell state and updates the hidden state using a hyperbolic tangent function 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t thus the long term dependencies can be learned through these equations in lstm in a way that first no information can get lost because the cell state is defined as a linear function unlike rnns on top of that the introduction of the new three gates in lstm allows this neural network to preserve the information for long time steps this feature of lstm can prevent exploding and vanishing of the back propagation step hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 which can occur in rnns the output of the final lstm layer is connected to a dense layer at the last time step hn as follows 7 y w d h n b d where y is the final predicted value of streamflow and wd and bd are the weight matrix of the dense layer and the bias term respectively it should be mentioned that applying these structures would significantly increase the number of adjustable parameters for the learning process which can result in some degree of overfitting for cases such as for small datasets the lstm model used for pretraining using all observations of 671 watersheds has shown very good performance for snow dominated regions in the usa feng et al 2020 although the camels dataset includes information from various regions 2 3 transfer learning transfer learning was used to predict streamflow for a few watersheds in southern québec during the training process of deep networks such as lstm some weights are assigned to hidden layers in addition to nonlinear activation functions the information during training is saved through weights with some parts of the network self organizing to perform specific functionalities as dictated by the architecture of the lstm tl was performed in two steps step one the source model was pretrained on the source dataset also known as weight initialization step two after the pretraining the stored model along with the initialized weights was entirely or partially trained once more on the target dataset the weights could be modified during training on the target dataset weight initialization or kept constant weight freezing in regions with limited access to data without performing tl the model cannot find the relationships that exist among the inputs e g forcing and static attributes and the target here observed flows final training modified and fine tuned all or parts of the weights to better fit the model over the target dataset while the model converged faster the advantage of weight freezing over pretraining is the reduction of the size of the training dataset required for calibration and the possibility of overfitting ma et al 2021 the tl process is illustrated in fig 4 tl model was constructed based on training on all watersheds in southern québec in contrast to watershed by watershed modeling 2 4 physically based model the pbm chosen for this study is hydrotel a semi distributed hydrological model compatible with remote sensing and gis data bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012 fortin et al 2001 fossey et al 2015 turcotte et al 2007 the model was used to provide simulated flows to the lstm to develop a physics informed tl model and a benchmark as well the québec ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change has been applying hydrotel for hydrological forecasting turcotte et al 2004 and hydroclimatic projections defacc 2018 the hydrological processes modeled by hydrotel include spatial distribution of precipitation and temperature snow accumulation and melt soil temperature freezing vertical water balance i e infiltration evapotranspiration soil water movement wetland hydrology overland flow routing and river routing hydrological modeling through hydrotel is based on dividing the watershed into hillslopes a k a relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhu subdivided into three soil layers and interconnected river segments rss draining the units the first soil layer is considered a thin layer interflow and baseflow are controlled through the second and third layers respectively the water contents of the three soil layers are calculated as state variables at each time step either daily or sub daily readers are referred to fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2007 and fossey et al 2015 for more details on hydrotel the model was automatically calibrated using a global optimization algorithm dds see tolson and shoemaker 2007 and foulon and rousseau 2018 for more details and a combination of the kling gupta efficiency criterion kling et al 2012 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash sutcliffe 1970 the latter was calculated using log transformed flows oudin et al 2006 this approach can be beneficial for predicting both high and low flows foulon rousseau 2018 notably lstm and hydrotel used the data time series differently during training while lstm was trained on all the available data observed flows were excluded from november to march under ice cover during the calibration of hydrotel and a one year spin up period was considered 2 5 data pre processing data pre processing and normalization are crucial tasks for ml and dl studies because the approach used can influence how accurate predictions are made as well as how long training takes nawi et al 2013 each problem requires specific methods and algorithms for data pre processing which depends on the types of variables common data pre processing includes data cleaning dealing with missing data data transformation which changes the scale type and probability distributions of variables and applying techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of input variables maharana et al 2022 the goal is to obtain a mean close to zero for data distribution to speed up the learning process and the convergence according to feng et al 2020 if the watersheds are batched together during streamflow modeling the lack of data pre processing would result in considering wetter watersheds more in the calculation of default loss while with data normalization the model errors are identically distributed among watersheds within the same batch normalization of inputs and output was done according to the data pre processing suggested by feng et al 2020 normalization of the streamflow variable was marginally different from other variables dimensionless streamflow was obtained by dividing the streamflow by the watershed area and mean annual precipitation this way the lstm model can better realize the relationships between the dimensionless target streamflow and input variables then another transformation was applied to achieve a gaussian distribution as follows 8 v log 10 v 0 1 where v and v are the streamflow variables after and before transformation respectively then a final transformation was applied to all the variables including the forcing data streamflow and static attributes to normalize them as follows 9 x i n e w x i x σ where x i n e w x i x and σ are the standardized raw mean and standard deviation values for the variable respectively the results shown in section 3 were converted to the original scale before standardization 2 6 numerical experiments 2 6 1 testing the source model on target watersheds to understand the performance of the source model on the target region the model trained using all conus basins was tested on watersheds of southern québec in three ways i the forward model with forcing and static attributes given as inputs during training and testing the term forward is used to ease the comparison with di models ii the di model trained on conus and tested on target watersheds the inputs were forcing data static attributes and observed streamflows from the previous day which for simplicity is called qt 1 afterwards and iii finally the di model trained on conus while during testing the observed streamflows prediction target were replaced with hydrotel simulated flows and then used to replace qt 1 the actual observed streamflows were used to evaluate the performance of this specific case during the calculation of evaluation metrics more details about the process of testing the source model on the target region can be found in figure s2 the training period over camels was from january 1 1989 to january 1 2006 while the testing period of the target dataset was from december 1 1991 to december 1 2002 so the results can be compared with the results introduced in section 2 6 2 2 6 2 improving tl approaches the baseline tl model that was compared with hydrotel simulated flows and observed flows was the forward model incorporating only forcing and static attribute data results are shown in section 3 2 the following approaches were proposed to train and improve the prediction accuracy of the baseline tl model against hydrotel i the tl model was pretrained on all available forcing and static attribute data in camels input variables of source dataset introduced in table s1 in contrast the input data used during training on the target region was more limited than camels input variables introduced in table 4 for simplicity performing tl while different forcing and static attributes variables are used from source and target datasets is called different input data dd as opposed to performing tl while the same forcing and static attributes variables are used from source and target datasets namely same input data sd fig 5 depicts how forcing and static attribute variables differ between the source and target datasets the variables used for model training in tl with sd are displayed as the input layer target in fig 5 apart from qsim which represents hydrotel simulated flows and is not included in the source dataset yet there remains the question of whether to use dd or sd to do tl modeling for the other approaches of this study values of 1 and 0 in the names of tl models see table 6 indicate performing tl with dd and sd respectively ii the tl model was trained with qt 1 as well as forcing and static attribute data called data integration di in the name of the models di appears before tl to distinguish the di models from the forward ones all di tl models were developed and used while di was applied during pretraining and training on the source and target datasets respectively there was a particular model whereby di was applied only in training on the target region and not during pretraining to show if tl can improve the performance of di models thus the name of this model is indicated as tl di 1 8 see table 6 iii the tl model was trained with simulated flows of hydrotel along with forcing and static attribute data it has been shown that hydrotel simulated flows could provide satisfactory predictions for the selected watersheds of southern québec foulon rousseau 2018 two tl models of di and forward were constructed in this part in the names of these models s denotes the use of simulated flows in model training iv the tl model that had the number of training watersheds increased from 8 to 34 in southern québec locations of the 34 watersheds are displayed in figure s1 in the name of this series of tl models the number of watersheds involved in the training distinguishes this approach from the rest to complement the comparison local models referred to the lstm models trained on the target region without performing tl were trained for each approach to understand the benefit of using tl compared to local model training more detailed descriptions of all models tl and local models and the flowchart of the model building process are provided in figures s3 and s4 2 7 model evaluation criteria and hyper parameters 2 7 1 performance metrics in the current study the following metrics were deployed to assess model performance kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 it breaks up nash sutcliffe efficiency nse into its constitutive parts correlation variability bias and mean bias like nse kge ranges from and 1 while kge of 1 shows perfect agreement between simulated and observed flows it has been used for model calibration and validation since it addresses some of the shortcomings of using only nse as the performance metric and is given by 10 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where β s o and γ σ s s σ o o and r pearson correlation coefficient log nash sutcliffe efficiency nash log oudin et al 2006 nash log is the nse nash sutcliffe 1970 calculated on log transformed flows it has greater efficiency in terms of favoring both high and low flows during streamflow simulation nash log ranges from to 1 and a value of 1 shows the optimal value of nash log it is calculated as follows on log transformed flows 11 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 root mean squared error rmse singh et al 2005 it measures the spread of error residuals and it ranges from 0 to while rmse of 0 shows no residual errors it is calculated as follows 12 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n pearson correlation coefficient corr pearson 1920 pearson correlation is a measure of linearity between two variables for this case study between simulated and observed flows a value between 1 and 1 is assigned to corr where 1 shows total negative correlation 1 shows total positive correlation and 0 illustrates no correlation among the variables corr or r is the root square of r2 that according to krause et al 2005 explains the degree of dispersion of observed values by predicted values if a model always results in underestimation or overestimation it could still have a high value for r2 and as a result in corr even if all the predicted values by that model are wrong thus it is suggested to use additional evaluation metrics along with using corr to interpret the modeled values the equation to calculate corr is given by 13 corr i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 it measures how much the average of simulated values are inclined to be higher or lower than those observed it ranges between and while 0 shows the optimal value it is given by 14 pbias i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 where in all the above equations o and s refer to the means of observed o and simulated s flows respectively σ s and σ o stand for standard deviations of simulated and observed flows respectively where n is the number of observed flows all metrics were calculated for the testing period for sake of comparison the period from january 1 1995 to may 31 1997 was excluded due to the absence of simulated flows of hydrotel in this period 2 7 2 hyperparameters the parameters defining the architecture of dl models are termed hyperparameters finding their optimal values represents a critical task as it directly affects the accuracy and reliability of the learning models a proper selection of hyperparameters can distinguish a state of the art performance from an average performance hutter et al 2015 the rmse between predicted and observed streamflows was selected as the objective function to be minimized or loss function and the adadelta algorithm was adopted as the optimization method zeiler 2012 in comparison to pure stochastic gradient descent the adadelta algorithm has a very low computational overhead and dynamically self adjusts over time using only first order information the methodappears to be robust to noisy gradient information various model architectural choices diverse data modalities and selected hyperparameters while not requiring manual optimization of the learning rate the optimized parameters for the models used in this study were batch size hidden layer size epoch parameters of dropout algorithm and length of training instances batch size controls the number of training examples given to the model for calculating the loss function before updating the matrices of weights hidden layer size determines the number of layers between input and output layers which also characterizes the degree of complexity of the network one epoch is defined as one forward run for all training examples the length of training instances determines the length of the time series for each training sample dropout which randomly drops network nodes along with all the other connections is a regularization technique specifically for neural networks the degree of regularization is controlled through a parameter called dropout rate the dropout rate is the proportion of units that are dropped out during training for instance a dropout rate of 0 5 means that half of the network units are randomly dropped out during each training iteration the source lstm model and the tl models have their hyperparameter combinations manually tested and selected table 5 contains information about the tested and optimal values of hyperparameters the length of training instances was the same for both models 365 days the snow and subsurface storage processes can be represented by training instances of 365 days however the length of the selected training instance does not restrict the lstm memory to 365 days 3 results this section is organized as follows first the results of testing the source model on target watersheds are presented second the overall performance of the baseline tl model is discussed third the added value of approaches to boost the performance of the baseline tl model are introduced and fourth the performance of hydrotel and the best tl model for different seasons are presented table 6 shows the performance of all models presented in this study 3 1 performance of source model tested on target watersheds testing the forward model on target watersheds achieved a negative value for nash log median test period thus further assessment was not pursued fig 6 shows the results of testing the di model on target watersheds di model using observed flows could provide satisfactory results during testing kge and nash log values of 0 837 and 0 870 respectively on the target region testing the di model on the target watersheds with limited access to observation records shown as di s in fig 6 could achieve decent median kge and nash log values of 0 745 and 0 569 moriasi et al 2007 indicated that nash log values larger than 0 5 could provide a good fit of the hydrograph and a satisfactory fit with the 1 1 line on the plot of observed versus simulated flows 3 2 performance of baseline tl model hydrotel and tl performed better than the local model during the test period fig 7 hydrotel and tl had similar median kge values 0 845 and 0 839 respectively tl offered solid performance for predicting baseflows as quantified by nash log compared to hydrotel with a higher median and smaller variabilities in predicted values median values of 0 762 and 0 679 for tl and hydrotel respectively even the local model performed slightly better than hydrotel in capturing the baseflows median value of 0 685 the median corr of the test period was slightly larger for tl compared to hydrotel 0 884 and 0 871 respectively while the rmse of tl was relatively smaller than that of hydrotel 37 515 m3 s and 39 360 m3 s respectively however the pbias values of hydrotel were better than those of tl with a closer median value to zero value of 1 007 while the median pbias of tl was 7 842 fig 8 shows the performance of the above models based on their hydrographs for one of the watersheds the batiscan watershed along with the 10th and 90th percentiles of observed data and the observed mean annual hydrographs for the selected watersheds of southern québec the general shapes of the mean annual hydrograph are almost similar hence the hydrograph of only one of them is presented hydrographs of the remaining watersheds can be found in the supporting material tl and hydrotel cornflower blue and green curves in fig 8 respectively showed good agreement with the observed flows and are well within the 10th to 90th percentile band of the observed flows shaded area in fig 8 in some places the local model outreached the 10th to 90th percentile band while hydrotel underestimated the peak flows the tl model was inclined to overestimate the occurrence of peak flows in spring 3 3 added value of applying different approaches to improve the baseline tl model this section introducesthe results of applying different approaches to improve the efficiency of the baseline tl model against hydrotel 3 3 1 performance of the tl models using different forcing and static attribute variables from source and target datasets the results of performing tl forward model using dd and sd are illustrated in fig 9 a using the sd approach resulted in higher evaluation metrics median values of 0 864 0 768 0 899 42 347 m3 s and 8 73 for kge nash log corr rmse and pbias respectively compared to using dd median values of 0 787 0 745 0 867 48 374 m3 s and 17 72 for kge nash log corr rmse and pbias respectively to perform tl in di tl models see fig 9 b the use of dd could achieve a slightly higher median kge value than sd in developing di tl models the median nash log and rmse values of di tl models using sd and dd were almost of the same median nash log values of 0 919 and 0 933 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 1 8 respectively median rmse values were 17 511 m3 s and 17 987 m3 s for the di tl models using sd and dd during training respectively the median corr value of the case when sd was used was slightly higher value of 0 971 compared to 0 964 in contrast the median pbias of using dd in di tl models was lower value of 1 193 compared to 5 748 with smaller variabilities around the median fig 10 shows the mean observed annual hydrograph compared to the mean annual hydrographs of simulated flows by tl and di tl models using dd and sd for the batiscan watershed in the hydrograph of tl models using sd could improve the accuracy of simulated flows compared to dd comparison of blue and medium spring green curves in fig 10 at the same time slight improvements were provided in di tl models using dd when compared to sd brown curve versus the yellow curve in fig 10 in summary sd seemed to be a more effective approach and the rest of the models were built using sd in tl except for cases where hydrotel simulated outputs were added as inputs to the tl model 3 3 2 performance of di tl models the performance metrics reported for di models are shown in fig 11 providing recent observed flows as an input to the tl model generally improved model accuracy the values of the metrics of di models showed that the increments provided by tl weight initialization and freezing were minor compared to applying tl with forward models the sequence of increments can be realized by comparing the tl models with the local model even for this series of models with minor increments tl could elevate the results from 0 894 median kge value of di local 8 to 0 942 for the median kge of di tl 0 34 which showed the best performance among di models furthermore focusing on di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 we see that their performances are very similar for di tl 0 34 median values of 0 942 0 953 15 425 m3 s 0 970 and 0 066 for kge nash log rmse corr and pbias respectively and for di tl 0 8 median values of 0 904 0 923 16 025 m3 s 0 900 and 5 800 for kge nash log rmse corr and pbias respectively the performance of tl di 1 8 confirms the power of tl to improve the di models even though the di model was not used during pretraining the values of the metrics reported in fig 11 are too close to clearly see the difference indeed without loss of continuity if we now look at nse nash sutcliffe efficiency values the reported values for di local 8 0 908 and tl di 1 8 0 914 have a 0 06 nse difference fig 12 shows the mean annual hydrograph of the batiscan watershed for the simulated flows generated by di models and the observed flows the performance of tl di 1 8 in capturing the peak flows during the spring was similar to that of di tl 0 34 dark blue curve versus orange curve while having some problems in the summer and the fall to capture the peak flows although tl di 1 8 could achieve very good results given their performance metrics and hydrographs when compared to those of the di tl models di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 not including di during pretraining caused larger variabilities in the predictions around the median 3 3 3 performance of tl models incorporating simulated flows as inputs fig 13 shows the results of tl models including hydrotel simulated flows as inputs their median kge values tl s 1 8 and di tl s 1 8 were nearly identical 0 84 and 0 838 respectively to that of hydrotel 0 845 alone however lower variabilities in predictions were observed around the median value for tl s 1 8 compared to hydrotel nash log values of all physics informed models values of 0 795 0 806 and 0 822 for local s 8 di tl s 1 8 and tl s 1 8 respectively built in this study were higher than the median value of hydrotel 0 679 once more the variabilities of predictions around the median of nash log values were smaller for physics informed models compared to hydrotel the median values of corr for the physics informed models were greater than the median of hydrotel with superior performance for di tl s 1 8 value of 0 90 the median values of rmse for the physics informed models values of 36 910 35 335 and 35 90 m3 s for local s 8 di tl s 1 8 and tl s 1 8 respectively were slightly samller than that of hydrotel 39 36 m3 s alone finally the pbias of hydrotel was closer to zero than those of the other models overall tl s 1 8 had the best performance among this series of models 3 3 4 performance of tl models when increasing the number of watersheds fig 14 shows the results of increasing the number of watersheds with similar climatological characteristics in both series of models forward and di models an increase in the number of watersheds enhanced the performance but of a different increment while for tl models tl 0 8 and tl 0 34 slight improvements are observed for all performance metrics for di tl models di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 including more watersheds during training using the target region resulted in greater improvements compared to tl models especially in terms of kge values of 0 904 and 0 942 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 nash log values of 0 923 and 0 953 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 and pbias 5 80 and 0 066 for di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 3 4 seasonal performance fig 15 displays the results of seasonal flow predictions by hydrotel and di tl 0 34 this model represents the best tl model in this study tl had better performance metrics throughout the year than hydrotel having a better median test period during all seasons in the winter spring summer and fall for instance the median kge values of di tl 0 34 were 0 911 0 946 0 892 and 0 904 respectively and for hydrotel the corresponding median kge values were 0 761 0 832 0 659 and 0 711 4 discussion in this section first we discuss the performance of the baseline tl model and the results of testing the source model on target watersheds second the incremental benefits of applying different approaches to improve tl for streamflow prediction are discussed finally the seasonal performances of the best tl model and hydrotel are thoroughly discussed 4 1 testing the source model and baseline tl model results of testing the source model on target watersheds means that if we intend to test the forward model on a region where we only have meteorological data and static attributes that would not be a practical test to take and meteorological data are not impactful enough during testing comparison of the results of testing the di model with the results of testing the forward model on the target region singles out the power of di models to provide streamflow predictions with acceptable accuracy even during testing while having access to some simulated flows when compared to hydrotel the baseline tl model and the local model both outperformed the latter in capturing the baseflows that is due to the remarkable ability of lstm models to capture low flow patterns this suggests the current version of hydrotel cannot not reproduce satisfactorily baseflow processes when calibrated pbms like hydrotel often focus more heavily on the peaks and sacrifice low flows but lstm is less sensitive to such tradeoffs analysis of the performance metrics and the mean annual hydrographs of the baseline tl model and of hydrotel indicates that the former requires some improvements in flow prediction during spring and summer two seasons with a higher frequency of peak flows 4 2 tl improving approaches the analysis of the results of using dd different forcing and static attribute variables for source and target datasets and sd same forcing and static attribute variables for source and target datasets in tl and di tl models indicates that using sd seems preferable in this study although using dd provided slight improvements in di tl models the gains were minor compared to improvements provided by sd in forward tl models row a in fig 9 where the use of sd showed superior performance over dd however this does not mean that using dd in tl modeling will not significantly improve with shorter data records or other regions since these models are data driven and results may differ from region to region based on the data involved in training moreover the use of dd in tl development shows the power of dl to adapt easily to new conditions however it may not be as easy for pbms for pbms running the model without having the exact inputs required is relatively impossible although the performance of di tl models was improved compared to hydrotel it should be noted that in this series of models qt 1 was included in tl modeling while data assimilation was not provided for hydrotel however it is much easier to integrate data here qt 1 in this way than performing standard data assimilation e g ensemble kalman filtering with pbms e g samuel et al 2019 comparing increments provided by di tl models and tl models sequence of increments were higher for tl models it can be realized that tl is mainly more effective for cases dealing with regional data scarcity although the target dataset used in this study had access to fewer variables than those available through camels we could access an almost complete flow record for the selected watersheds of southern québec this is in contradiction with the concept of data scarcity but these di tl models have the potential to be used for providing predictions for nearby watersheds dealing with data sparsity by fine tuning the di tl model comparable performances of di tl 0 8 and di tl 0 34 fig 11 suggests that although increasing the number of watersheds could decrease the prediction errors we could get almost the same results with fewer watersheds although the performance of tl di 1 8 was comparable to that of other models in the series of di tl models the analysis of the tl di 1 8 model revealed that larger variabilities made in the predictions of the tl di 1 8 demonstrate the value of pretraining with di over the source model and how well knowledge gained from the source dataset can be used to improve predictions in the target region analysis of tl models incorporating simulated flows of hydrotel showed that di tl s 1 8 could not elevate the results significantly although the di model was used during pretraining one of the reasons for this outcome could be associated with the errors embedded in the hydrotel simulated flows that lowered the accuracy of predictions generated by the tl model overall analysis of the results of this approach shows using hydrotel simulated flows as inputs were beneficial since they could improve nash log corr and rmse while achieving similar kge values moreover they could reduce the variabilities of predictions for all watersheds compared to hydrotel especially based on the nash log and pbias values although combining tl technique with di showed significant enhancement in predictions fig 11 the superior performance of tl s 1 8 demonstrates the importance of physics informed tl and dl models in real world applications this is due to the restricted availability of streamflow data in some areas and the often higher cost of even obtaining them compared to using pbm simulated flows as an alternative finally tl models where the number of watersheds had been increased using a more extensive dataset at the target region achieved better performance in both forward and di models small improvements provided by increasing the number of watersheds consistent with the results reported for di tl models indicate the importance of grouping the watersheds before training rather than just increasing the number of watersheds which can be further investigated in the future the prediction results indicate that tl models achieve better prediction performance compared to applying the lstm model on the target region without tl local model training which is consistent with the findings previously reported by bedi 2022 li et al 2021 in summary among all tl models the di tl model with the number of watersheds increased from 8 to 34 in the target region obtained the best performance readers are referred to figure s12 and figure s13 to see the boxplots and hydrographs of all models compared to the work of ma et al 2021 although they used a higher density of basins with a shorter training period and a longer pretraining period the highest median nse value was 0 86 for camels cl and camels gb in this study the median nse value of the baseline without any improvement was 0 803 using eight watersheds tl 0 8 as mentioned before by feng et al 2020 the source model developed over camels reached exceptional performance especially in mountainous and snow dominated watersheds the eight 8 watersheds selected for projecting tl modeling are classified as snow dominated watersheds demonstrating the potential of performing tl modeling for this region achieving significant performance after applying the proposed tl improving approaches median values of nash log of 0 953 kge of 0 942 and nse of 0 932 for di tl 0 34 the final tl models were obtained by a partially frozen model probably due to having a smaller dataset in the target region moreover southern québec watersheds can be qualified as large watersheds the median drainage area for the watersheds at the target region was 3498 km2 while that for camels watersheds was 329 62 km2 highlighting the fact that achieving the optimal performance of the tl model depends on the sufficient change of weights during training this is consistent with the results previously reported by ma et al 2021 4 3 seasonal performance of tl and hydrotel models results of tl and hydrotel models indicated better performance of both models in the spring and then during fall the two seasons with large flow variability although hydrotel considered summer flows during calibration its performance was deemed poor the hydrotel version used for this study does not account for water uptake in the hydrographic network preliminary results with a newer version of the model have illustrated that accounting for water withdrawals can improve the results of simulated flows during the summer albeit not shown here contrastingly the performance of the di tl 0 34 model was relatively lower in summer lower median e g in kge and pearson correlation compared to its performance during other seasons and that may be because of the presence of more extreme flows during summer compared to winter as a reminder during the calibration process of hydrotel winter flows were not accounted for yet the model performed relatively well compared to other seasons according to values of kge corr rmse and pbias in contrast di tl 0 34 model had the smallest median rmse of 7 545 m3 s and a high median kge nash log and correlation 0 911 0 919 and 0 954 respectively during winter this indicates the inherent advantage of lstm models in tracking the hydrologic processes during the winter generally both models had difficulties capturing flows during summer and some actions should be considered to improve their results accordingly although the superior performance of hydrotel was observed during the spring in general there is a probability of large bias involved in simulations during the spring due to higher values of corr and rmse compared to the performance during the winter 5 conclusions lagged discharge in long short term memory lstm networks has been shown to be a successful technique for streamflow prediction or so called data integration di while the use of di has proven useful with deep learning dl no study has previously shown the ability of a transfer learning tl model to reap the significant benefits of adding recent discharge data in this study an lstm model trained on camels addor et al 2017 dataset over the conus conterminous united states was transferred to a snow dominated region utilizing hysets arsenault et al 2020 as the target dataset in quebec canada and multiple improvement strategies were implemented to enhance the performance of the tl model performances of tl models were compared to a physically based model pbm hydrotel how well the source model would function in tl was determined by testing the source model on the target region results of testing the source model on the target region did not yield meaningful results when only meteorological and physiographic data from camels were used during training however once the di model had been used to produce predictions for the target region through testing the accuracy of the predictions varied depending on the availability of recent observations of discharge in the target region in the tl scheme the baseline tl model which was trained with meteorological and physiographic data performed well when compared to hydrotel especially when it came to capturing low flows however it needed to be enhanced additionally it was discovered that performing tl with the same meteorological and physiographic variables from the source and target datasets provided a more acceptable performance than doing so with different meteorological and physiographic variables among the approaches suggested for improving the performance of the baseline tl model employing di with a maximum number of watersheds from the target region achieved the highest prediction accuracy the di tl model that was trained using only eight watersheds nevertheless was likewise highly effective the performance of the di tl models when di was not used during pretraining showed that tl could even increase the performance of di models the models requiring less improvement as they employed recent discharge observations in the model training when streamflow observations did not exist including hydrotel simulated flows could improve the streamflow predictions by reducing the prediction errors the results of this study highlight the significance of the tl scheme to transfer knowledge from data rich regions to snow dominated regions and improve streamflow prediction for those regions due to the ability of the lstm model to extract information from large datasets and tracking of long term hydrological processes the tl models used in this study can also be applied to nearby watersheds not having sufficient streamflow records and provide predictions with good accuracy furthermore this study shows that large hydrological datasets like camels contain more information that can possibly be modeled by a pbm improving the prediction accuracy of extreme flows to elevate the performance of the tl model during seasons like summer certainly represents a valuable avenue of research slight improvements provided by increasing the number of training watersheds in tl demonstrate the necessity of exploring some criteria to group the watersheds before training to achieve exceptional predictive skills in future works rather than just increasing the number of watersheds furthermore it is suggested to investigate the performance of physics informed tl models shen et al 2023 during the spatial test training in one site and testing in another site
