11775,in arid regions water resources are scarce therefore sea and brackish groundwater desalination using reverse osmosis ro techniques is commonly used to provide freshwater for potable purposes el moghra oasis a case study of an inland depression represents an arid region in the western desert of egypt the oasis relies mainly on the brackish groundwater in el moghra aquifer for salt tolerant crop irrigation and feeding desalination plants the ro brackish groundwater desalination conserves about 75 of the total cost compared to seawater as feed water accordingly the main target of the present work is to allocate cost effective sites for constructing desalination plants to solve freshwater shortages the hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques have been applied to understand the aquifer recharge mechanism and the main factors that deteriorate the groundwater quality additionally an analytical hierarchy process ahp relying on the geographic information systems gis utilized to delineate the promising desalination sites four main criteria linked with the cost of ro groundwater desalination were investigated including aquifer hydraulic parameters hydrogeochemical characteristics recharge indicators based on isotopic tracers and other miscellaneous parameters related to the site accessibility and environmental issues these four main criteria include fourteen

groundwater geochemistry stable isotopes el moghra oasis multi criteria decision analysis analytical hierarchy process reverse osmosis desalination data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the freshwater shortage has recently become a serious problem in egypt el bedawy 2014 eissa et al 2016a b egypt is located in north africa s arid climatic zones where the main water resources are the annual budget from the nile and fossil groundwater the rapid population growth threatens a severe shortage of drinking water supplies in the near future abd ellah 2020 in recent decades the egyptian government has started to increase the reclaimed land depending on non conventional water as a sustainable source of drinking water and agricultural projects abdel shafy and kamel 2016 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 the western desert of egypt represents appropriate and strategic regions for further land reclamation developmental projects moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 an arid climate characterizes el moghra oasis as a part of the western desert abdel mogith et al 2012 mohamaden et al 2017 yousf et al 2018 where the annual rainfall is scarce and mainly occurs in winter mohamaden et al 2017 sayed et al 2019 the study area has attracted the interest of governmental organizations and the private sector due to the availability of brackish groundwater in the el moghra aquifer of the lower miocene age for potable and irrigation uses the miocene groundwater is mostly brackish where the salinity ranges from 2100 to 7200 mg l el sabri et al 2016 according to the standard recommended limits world health organization 2004 the groundwater is not permissible for drinking however it is suitable for salt tolerant crops under specific soils and irrigation management el sayed and morsy 2018 eu delegation to egypt 2015 additionally groundwater desalination is crucial for human consumption and plant irrigation in remote areas during the last five decades drinking water produced from different desalination techniques in egypt using the sea as feedwater salinity 44 000 mg l has increased from 500 m3 d to 746 000 m3 d it is expected to be about 2 6 106 m3 d by the end of 2037 due to the further installation of mega desalination plants in the coastal cities of egypt hcww 2020 the cost of reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination ranges from 0 5 to 1 2 us m3 while the cost of brackish water desalination varies from 0 2 to 0 4 us m3 reddy and ghaffour 2007 ghaffour et al 2013 in groundwater desalination the aquifer parameters such as the depth to groundwater dtw saturated aquifer thickness and aquifer transmissivity are important characteristics to consider while conserving the water desalination cost and ensuring the sustainability of feed groundwater akhter and hasan 2016 schroeder et al 2021 shallow groundwater depth location sites are more favorable than deep groundwater due to the additional drilling and pumping costs of the latter furthermore thick aquifer saturation with high transmissivity enhances productivity and ensures a sustainable groundwater resource one of the other factors controlling the desalination cost is the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater including the salinity and quality of feed water paktinat et al 2014 therefore selecting the best sites throughout el moghra oasis for desalination plants will greatly reduce the daily operational and annual maintenance costs and consequently conserve the total resource ahmadi et al 2020 the dissolved salt assemblages in groundwater including caso4 caco3 baso4 and srso4 are alkaline earth salts that may participate to form scale buildup on the membrane top surface and deteriorate its productivity lin et al 2005 shirazi et al 2010 pe rez gonza lez et al 2012 to mitigate the scaling problem strategies such as ph adjustment antiscalant and chemical dosing need to be used which increase the cost of reverse osmosis desalination chesters 2009 additionally the concentration of dissolved trace and minor elements such as iron fe2 and silica sio2 in the groundwater of the el moghra aquifer have been detected in high concentrations el sabri et al 2016 iron precipitates upon changes in ph causing membrane fouling and drastically reducing the produced desalinated water aly et al 2012 in addition silica scaling mitigation in desalination processes has been a challenge until now ion exchange resins or accelerated seeded precipitation processes have to be used to remove silica from the inlet water rahardianto et al 2010 environmental isotopes δ18o and δ2h were employed to define the origins of sustainable groundwater recharge in semi arid aquifer regions eissa et al 2016a b ouhamdouch et al 2022 that can impact operation facilities and consequently affect the groundwater desalination cost owosina et al 1996 mongelli et al 2013 abidi et al 2017 other miscellaneous factors have also been considered in this research to prevent the environmental impacts of using fossil fuels for the desalination process and factors related to favorable site locations and accessibility solar energy instead of fossil fuels should operate reverse osmosis desalination plants for environmental reasons consequently the spatial variation of solar radiation in the study area has been well delineated to determine the most suitable site for constructing the ro plant eu delegation to egypt 2015 shouman et al 2016 aydin and sarptas 2020 moreover the land slope is an influential factor affecting photo voltaic pv panel installation land with a slope greater than 4 causes solar panels to shadow and adversely affects the system efficiency noorollahi et al 2016 distance from major roads is also critical for selecting a suitable desalination site as the construction of new access roads is very expensive and should be minimized sayed et al 2019 noorollahi et al 2016 many published types of research have been achieved to select promising sites for a desalination plant the analytical hierarchy process ahp a multi criteria decision making analysis mcda that was improved by saaty 1980 1994 was used to check the consistency of the decision to identify the suitable sites for desalination plants and to lower the bias in the decision making progression paktinat et al 2014 used multi criteria decision making and fuzzy logic to determine the promising solar desalination system sites the hybrid fuzzy analytical hierarchy process has been used to help stakeholders with a subjective selection of the feasible seawater desalination technology between seven alternatives ion exchange ie vapor compression vc multi stage flash distillation msf multi effect distillation med electrodialysis ed and ro jarada et al 2020 rustum et al 2020 to adequately investigated the groundwater in el moghra aquifer the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters geochemical groundwater characteristics and other miscellaneous associated with the optimum operational conditions required for the ro desalination plants have been weighted and reclassified according to their importance relative to each other the aquifer hydraulic parameters include depth to groundwater dtw saturated aquifer thickness st and transmissivity t the geochemical characteristics of groundwater include the total dissolved solids tds total hardness th caso4 sio2 fe sr b and stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h additionally other miscellaneous includes global solar radiation gsr land slope ls and distance to roads d have been determined while the regional hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotopic content of el moghra aquifer have been studied intensively i e ali and salman 1988 awad et al 1994 araffa et al 2021 awad et al 1994 mapping the potential groundwater zone s for delineating the best sites for ro groundwater desalination is still unclear the gis technique efficiently delineates the potential groundwater zone in arid regions and provides more accurate results jose et al 2012 lakshmi and reddy 2018 therefore the main objectives of this research are 1 utilize the gis techniques for aquifer mapping to identify the optimal locations for constructing desalination plants affiliated with feed groundwater quality 2 to determine the promising aquifer recharge zone s and hydraulic parameters in el moghra area to ensure the sustainability of feed groundwater 3 create a suitability map for the best locations for constructing desalination plants in the el moghra oasis using a multi criterion including geochemistry of groundwater isotopes and mcda analysis supported by a gis tool the scientific approach of this research could be applied globally to areas that have the similar climatic and hydrogeological conditions 2 study area description the area of the feasibility study is between latitudes 30 00 to 30 10 n and longitudes 28 30 to 29 00 e fig 1 in summer the average recorded temperature is 39 c while 23 c in winter mohamaden et al 2017 and humidity ranges from 39 5 in december to 19 in june the annual precipitation in el moghra area ranges from 25 to 50

5 4 mm day in december el sabri et al 2016 the study area comprises three main geomorphic units el diffa plateau dune belt and el moghra depression esm 1 el diffa plateau extends along the north part of the el moghra region where a well defined escarpment is developed and extends northward the dune belt is located in the main southern portion of el moghra and is divided into sand sheets and gravelly plains which constitute the main portion of the study area the el moghra depression is divided into lowlands sabkhas and el moghra lake el sayed and morsy 2018 the el moghra region is covered by rock units ranging in age from the lower miocene to the quaternary fig 2 the lower miocene unit includes the el moghra formation of fluviomarine sediments said 1962 it grades northwards to the mamura formation of marine facies pickford et al 2010 the middle miocene unit includes the marine fossiliferous carbonates of the marmarica formation the pliocene rock unit includes the el hagif formation which consists mainly of unfossiliferous limestone of smoky white color interbedded with marl layers the el moghra formation is the only aquifer in the study area and is divided into three water bearing formations arranged from top to bottom monqar el dawi upper qaret el rikab middle and el raml lower respectively yousf et al 2018 el sabri et al 2016 3 materials and methods the selection of ideal locations for constructing desalination plants was carried out in five steps 1 groundwater data from the field site in el moghra area was collected 2 the effective factors containing criteria were identified and screened 3 thematic layers were prepared using a geographical information system gis 4 every factor was weighted through multi criteria decision making mcda ahp and 5 the layers were then integrated to identify the proper locations using the galdit method based on geographical information systems gis the esm 2 presents the different steps of selecting of the best sites for cost wise desalination plants 3 1 groundwater data collection the el moghra aquifer is characterized by 55 groundwater samples in august 2019 furthermore rainwater and seawater samples were collected the depth to groundwater dtw and total depth td were measured during the fieldwork using the solinst sounder model 101 p7 probe water level meter instrument aquifer transmissivity t data were used to estimate aquifer potential t kb fetter 1988 where k is hydraulic conductivity m day and b is the aquifer thickness m during the field trip ph water electrical conductivity ec in μs cm and groundwater salinity tds mg l were measured the ph and ec were measured using a 3510 jenway uk meter and orion 150 a thermo electron corporation waltham ma usa respectively groundwater samples were collected to analyze the major cations and anions rainwater and thatcher 1960 fishman and friedman 1985 hem 1989 astm 2002 at the desert research centre in cairo egypt br ion was analyzed by the orion ea 940 thermo electron corporation fe ba sr sio2 were analyzed by icap 6500 duo thermo scientific england thermo scientific 2007 usepa method 6010 b 1996 the precision measurement accuracies for fe ba sr and si were 0 09 0 003 0 008 and 0 172 ppm respectively the saturation indices for halite calcite dolomite and gypsum minerals as well as the calcium sulfate concentration caso4 in mmol l were calculated by phreeqc 3 3 7 computer program esm 3 4 oxygen 18 and deuterium were measured at the isotope tracers and technologies lab in waterloo canada using picarro crds model l2130 i by the method described by coplen et al 1991 coplen 1995 deuterium and oxygen 18 as per mil and the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as isotopic standard reference material where δ 18o 16o sample 18o 16o standard 1 χ1000 craig 1961 the precision measurement accuracy for oxygen 18 was 0 1 and 1 for deuterium tritium 3h was determined by liquid scintillation counting ri carb model 2700 tr series at the atomic energy authority lab cairo egypt the analytical precision was approximately 0 65 tu i a e a 2012 3 2 identifying the effective factors criteria the membrane type power supply and system configuration for the ro desalination plant can vary based on the aquifer hydraulic characteristics feedwater chemistry aquifer recharge rate and solar radiation intensity ruiz garcía and nuez 2020 according to saeed et al 2019 the parameters which affect feed water chemistry are total dissolved solids total hardness calcium sulfate silica iron strontium and barium therefore these factors are focused on in this study 3 3 thematic layer preparation all the factor criteria were entered into arc gis 10 2 2 as input layers for site selection the digital elevation model dem is derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the data was collected in c band by the space shuttle endeavour in 2001 using a sar interferometry device these data were used to create land slope and area solar radiation maps using arcgis 10 2 2 spatial analyzer modules the empirical bayesian kriging ebk approach that automates the most challenging portions of creating a valid kriging model was used to interpolate the layers ebk unlike other kriging methods in geostatistical analyst uses subsetting and simulation to automatically produce these parameters ensuring that the findings are accurate krivoruchko and gribov 2019 gribova and krivoruchko 2020 after thematic layers preparation and interpolation of the selected criteria these layers were divided into three categories and reclassified using the reclassify tool in arc gis 10 2 2 for each criterion suitability ratings of 1 3 were adopted where rate 1 low 2 medium 3 high suitability table 1 3 4 analytical hierarchy process in this study three level hierarchy structure is developed the first level defines the objective of this study which is mapping suitable sites for constructing desalination plants the next level consists of organizing the effective criteria and sub criteria on the suitable sites for constructing desalination plants saaty 1980 proposed assigning weights for the relevant criteria and their associated features on a scale of 1 9 where 1 is prevalent to equal importance 2 weak importance 3 moderate importance and 4 moderate plus strong importance is given 5 while strong plus very strong super strong and extreme importance are given 6 7 8 9 respectively a pairwise comparison matrix a is constructed once the weights have been allocated the relative relevance of the two criteria is then evaluated on a range of 1 9 on a numerical scale the weights are then normalized by dividing each entry by the column total the requisite relative criteria weights are calculated by taking the average of the new matrix s rows then performing a consistency test using the consistency ratio as follows 1 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the average value of the consistency vector and n is the number of factors the consistency ratio cr is a metric for how consistent this pair wise comparison matrix is 2 c r c i r i where ri is the random index which depends on n values table 2 the cr must be equal to or less than 0 10 cr 0 10 to acquire accurate results with the ahp alternatively cr 0 10 means there is an inconsistency 3 5 galdit method the best locations for desalination plant construction are evaluated using the galdit method moghaddam et al 2015 chang et al 2019 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 galdit is an index mapping approach the suitability map is generated using thematic layers in raster format with the same cell size in the raster calculator tool in arcgis 10 2 2 by the integration of all the maps classified maps of tds dtw st t fe th caso4 sio2 ba sr δ18o gsr ls and d as the following equation 3 g a l d i t i n d e x n 1 10 w n χ r n where n w and r are the factors the criteria weight from ahp and the rating assigned to the ten factors respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer hydraulic characteristics 4 1 1 depth to groundwater dtw the depth to water of el moghra aquifer in the area ranges from 4 to 93 m the depth to water increases towards the southwest in the direction of the qattara depression as seen in fig 3 a samples which have a depth to groundwater ranging from 4 0 to 20 0 m are given a rating of 3 at the same time samples with depth to groundwater ranging from 50 to 93 m are given the lowest rating of 1 the depth to groundwater is an important element impacting the cost of drilling water wells and groundwater pumping resulting in the entire cost of desalination plant construction wada et al 2010 chen et al 2019 4 1 2 saturated aquifer thickness the el moghra aquifer is comprised of three thick layers of sand and sandstone separated by thin clay and shale laminae the aquifer saturated thickness decreases from east to west it ranges from 350 to 474 m as seen in fig 3b the saturated thickness considerably impacts the future increase in groundwater pumping costs foster et al 2017 merrill and guilfoos 2017 therefore areas with a saturated thickness ranging from 350 to 400 m are given the lowest rating of 1 while areas with a saturated thickness ranging from 450 to 474 are given the highest rating of 3 4 1 3 aquifer transmissivity the term transmissivity refers to the rate at which groundwater with a certain kinematic viscosity is transmitted across a unit width of the aquifer at a given hydraulic gradient todd 1980 it ranges from 800 to 6500 m2 day the highest transmissivity values are presented in the northeastern part of the area as seen in fig 3c it ranges from 3000 to 6500 m2 day indicating a large amount of groundwater in this part giving it a high rating of 3 in contrast the southwestern area has the lowest transmissivity values as it ranges from 800 to 1500 m2 day this indicates that the probability of groundwater in this part of the area is low 4 2 geochemical groundwater characteristics 4 2 1 groundwater salinity the total dissolved solids in groundwater of the el moghra aquifer range from 2565 to 11 075 mg l the groundwater salinity increases from southwest and northeast to the west with the same direction of groundwater net flow towards the qattara depression as shown in fig 4 a abdel mogith et al 2012 groundwater wells which have salinity ranging from 2565 to 5000 mg l are given a rating of 3 as it requires lower pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure of the salinized feed water consequently the energy consumption and costs are reduced than wells with salinity ranging from 7000 to 11 075 mg l which are rated 1 lattemann and höpner 2008 atab et al 2016 sodium na and chloride cl represent the main dissolved ions in groundwater where na na na in epm sum total cations in epm 100 ranges from 56 well 22 to 83 7 well 52 while cl cl cl in epm sum total anions in epm 100 ranges between 67 well 29 to 89 6 well 3 the calculated saturation indices si for halite in all the groundwater samples are less than zero indicating the nacl is completely dissolved in the groundwater and undersaturation limit plummer et al 1994 nacl is the main salt leading the groundwater salinization in el moghra aquifer esm 4 4 2 2 total hardness the total hardness th is associated with the amount of dissolved calcium ca and magnesium in groundwater the concentration of dissolved calcium in groundwater ranges from 109 mg l well 52 to 674 mg l well 50 while magnesium ranges between 66 mg l well 52 and 475 mg l well 3 hardwater possesses high dissolved calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as calcite and dolomite embedded in the aquifer matrix pickford et al 2010 the calculated saturation indices for the calcite caco3 and dolomite mgco3 are mostly positive ve calcite values 81 and ve dolomite 85 indicating supersaturation the th of groundwater in the el moghra aquifer ranges from 543 to 3315 mg l as caco3 as shown in fig 4b it increases westward with the same direction of groundwater flow this finding is related to the leaching and dissolution of carbonates which constitute the overlying middle miocene marmarica aquifer in addition the study area s total hardness results indicate that the groundwater in the study area is very hard and needs pretreatment before desalination to protect the membrane surface from scaling which decreases the water flux zaidi et al 2021 accordingly wells with th ranging from 543 to 1000 mg l as caco3 are given a rating of 3 while wells with total hardness ranging from 1500 to 3315 mg l as caco3 are given a rating of 1 4 2 3 calcium sulfate the molality of calcium sulfate caso4 in groundwater samples has been estimated using the phreeq c geochemical program it ranges from 0 26 to 2 1 mmol l esm 3 see section 3 1 fig 4c shows higher molality values of the caso4 in groundwater wells recorded in the northwest direction of the area in contrast lower molality are found in samples in the eastern direction additionally the saturation indices values for the gypsum mineral caso4 2h2o in all groundwater samples record negative values indicating an undersaturation level during the desalination process high molality of caso4 or gypsum saturation indices values give indication of precipitation on the membrane surface decreasing in permeate flow and shorter membrane life rahardianto et al 2008 tu et al 2011 wells with calcium sulfate ranging from 0 26 to 1 0 mmol l are given a rating of 3 while wells with a higher concentration of calcium sulfate ranging from 1 5 to 2 1 mmol l are given a rating of 1 4 2 4 iron the iron concentration of groundwater ranges from 0 033 to 17 4 mg l the concentration of iron in groundwater increases in the southwest direction as shown in fig 4d the existence of high dissolved iron concentrations in these locations is related to metal reduction mineral precipitation and ion adsorption snyder et al 2014 abdelazeem et al 2020 iron pretreatment is recommended before desalination due to its impact on membrane fouling increasing the cost of reverse osmosis desalination melliti et al 2019 the groundwater wells with an iron concentration range from 0 033 to 1 0 mg l are given 3 ratings while wells with an iron concentration range from 5 0 to 17 4 mg l are given ratings of 1 4 2 5 silica the source of dissolved silica in groundwater is mostly water rock interactions abdelazeem et al 2020 the silica concentration in the area ranges from 2 6 to 48 4 mg l as seen in fig 4e during the desalination process increased ca and mg concentrations promote silica polymerization on the membrane surface resulting in decreased membrane performance salvador et al 2014 consequently samples with silica concentrations ranging from 2 6 to 10 mg l are given ratings of 3 while samples with silica concentrations ranging from 20 0 to 48 4 are given ratings of 1 4 2 6 barium and strontium the source of barium in groundwater is the dissolution of barite mokrik et al 2009 while the source of strontium is the weathering of celestite rich rocks cai et al 2020 barium in groundwater in the area ranges from 0 002 to 0 07 mg l while strontium ranges from 0 98 to 8 2 mg l as shown in fig 4f g the groundwater wells with barium and strontium concentrations ranging from 0 002 to 0 02 mg l and from 0 98 to 2 5 mg l are given 3 ratings respectively on the other hand wells with concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l and from 5 0 to 8 2 mg l are given a rate of 1 for barium and strontium respectively the presence of ba and sr in feed water can cause membrane scaling so adding antiscalant to feed water is required to prevent membrane scaling zhang et al 2019 4 3 indicators for promising groundwater recharge the recharging sources for aquifers have been revealed by oxygen δ 18o and hydrogen δ 2h tracers they can be used to assess physical processes such as evaporation and groundwater mixing because they do not engage in geochemical reactions dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 the distribution of δ18o values increases southward and eastward in the study area fig 5 fig 6 a illustrates the relationship between δ18o and δ2h the groundwater samples have δ18o ranges from 1 64 well 31 to 2 49 well 3 and δ2h ranges from 11 4 well 11 to 4 9 well 3 the results show that all groundwater samples are distributed below the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and plotted on the trend line that extends between the nubian groundwater and the old nile water δ18o 0 6 and δ2h 4 3 awad et al 1994 the mean isotopic value for rainwater between october and april was reported at 5 0 for δ18o and 15 14 for δ 2h eissa et al 2016a b a sample of seawater from the mediterranean is displayed and it has substantially enriched isotopic values δ18o 1 12 δ2h 8 5 in fig 6b all groundwater samples of el moghra aquifer have been plotted in between three end members the nubian groundwater the old nile water and the recent seawater confirming that the main recharge comes from the meteoric water which is represented by the recent rainfall and the old nile water as well as upward recharge from the underneath nubian groundwater artesian aquifer through the structure of the deep seated faults azab 2014 el sayed and morsy 2018 the subsurface recharge to the el moghra from the artesian nubian aquifer has been estimated to range from 2 3 to 2 26 m3 s rizk and davis 1991 el sabri et al 2016 yousf et al 2018 the nubian groundwater aquifer had a paleo recharge water that was recharged during the pluvial period under a humid climate ali et al 1988 thorweihe and heinl 2002 in fig 6b groundwater samples highlighted by green polygon are plotted close to the old nile water isotopic signature due to the impact of nile water flooding through the ancient channels in the study area geirnart and laeven 1992 which was confirmed by the widespread of the petrified wood on the surface of the el moghra aquifer field trip observation nevertheless groundwater samples enriched with δ18o and δ2h indicate the predominance of evaporation processes in fig 6a b the groundwater in el moghra oasis mainly originated from a paleowater and evolved due to evaporation and mixing with marine water recent sea the marine deposits mainly come from the subsurface deeper layer of the el moghra formation which is formed mainly of deposits of marine origin which are considered the main reason for groundwater deterioration of el moghra oasis tritium 3h half lifetime t1 2 12 3 years a radioactive isotope has been measured in seven groundwater samples representing the el moghra aquifer esm 3 the tritium ranges between 0 49 well 52 to 2 33 tu well 51 fig 6c the present tritium level in local precipitation close to the study area ranges between 4 and 5 2 tu wannous et al 2021 cauquoin et al 2021 the tritium recorded higher concentrations tu in the deeper rather than shallow wells fig 6c the recent recharge indicated by the signature of tritium in the deep wells probably seepage from the seasonal rainfall through the fractures and faults plan that intersect the el moghra aquifer fig 2a and 2b these values indicate the aquifer receives a low amount of meteoric recharge because el moghra is located in the arid zone characterized by a little amount of rainfall 25 50 mm year and predominance of evaporation processes 5 4 29 2 mm day 4 4 miscellaneous parameters 4 4 1 global solar radiation the amount of solar radiance measures solar insolation over a certain period it is commonly measured during peak sun hours which are hours per day when the average solar radiation is 1 kwh m2 pv systems require 3 5 kwh m2 day of solar radiation to be economically viable noorollahi et al 2016 as seen in fig 7 a the gsr raster is converted from wh m2 to kwh m2 day for 2019 the annual gsr ranges from 3 7 to 4 2 kwh m2 day the lowest class ranges from 3 7 to 3 9 kwh m2 day and is given a rating of 1 the highest class ranges from 3 95 to 4 2 kwh m2 day and is given a rating of 3 the highest gsr in the study area was detected in summer ranging from 3 9 to 4 2 kwh m2 day it reaches the lowest value of 2 7 kwh m2 day in the winter 4 4 2 land slope the geography of el moghra oasis influences the selection of appropriate sites for solar desalination plants and is strongly influenced by the land slope the land slope is considered a major factor for land assessment as it effectively influences the feasibility and cost of any solar desalination project gerbo et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 7b the land slope in the study area ranges from 0 to 12 areas with a land slope ranging from 0 to 1 0 are given ratings of 3 however areas with a land slope ranging from 4 1 to 12 are rated 1 a land slope of more than 4 is not recommended for a pv system and desalination plant installation mokarram et al 2020 4 4 3 distance to roads the distance to roads map was created by using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 2 2 as seen in fig 7c the distance to the main roads ranges from 0 to 2 0 km the near distance roads are given a rating of 3 whereas the far distance roads are given a rating of 1 4 5 galdit model for delineating the best zones for desalination plants the suitability map for the best locations for constructing desalination plants was created using the galdit index equation by summing up the multiplication of the normalized weight of each fourteen factors from ahp and by the rating assigned for factors using arc gis 10 2 2 raster calculator tool consequently the suitability map for constructing desalination plants has been classified into three classes with the suitability from high suitability to low suitability as seen in table 3 this is attributed to 8 7 high suitability with an area of about 76 km2 55 9 medium suitability with an area of about 490 km2 and 35 5 low suitability with an area of about 311 km2 as seen in fig 8 high and medium suitable areas for constructing desalination plants are in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the area these areas have groundwater salinity ranging from 2565 to 7000 mg l therefore the cost of desalination in these areas will be relatively low in addition these areas have low values of iron total hardness calcium sulfates strontium and silica these areas also have very good aquifer parameters for groundwater wells furthermore these areas have good location parameters in contrast the western and southwestern parts of the area have low suitability for constructing desalination plants these areas are in the direction of the discharging el moghra aquifer which has high salinity and would make desalination much more expensive 5 conclusion and recommendations el moghra oasis represents one of the best and most strategic regions for sustainable development projects considering land reclamation groundwater is the major source of potable water in this region the groundwater in el moghra is mostly brackish water with salinity ranging from 2565 to 11 075 mg l because of the high salinity the groundwater in the el moghra region is not suitable for drinking and irrigation the environmental isotopes confirmed the scarcity of groundwater recharge from the annual rainfall the aquifer possesses mixing of marine water and paleo recharge water that had taken during the pluvial period groundwater desalination is the most feasible solution for finding a non conventional source of water in such remote areas the most cost wise and suitable locations for constructing reverse osmosis desalination plants were delineated using mcda ahp and gis the final suitability map shows that the best locations for constructing desalination plants are in the northeastern parts and represent 64 5 of the total area while the low suitability locations for constructing desalination plants are in the western and southwestern parts and represent 35 5 of the total area solar energy is the recommended power source instead of diesel as it is eco friendly and can be integrated with wind energy as an alternative renewable source in the area finding an innovative solution for brine disposal instead of injection into deep wells is also recommended as injection will greatly affect the deterioration of the groundwater quality in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11775,in arid regions water resources are scarce therefore sea and brackish groundwater desalination using reverse osmosis ro techniques is commonly used to provide freshwater for potable purposes el moghra oasis a case study of an inland depression represents an arid region in the western desert of egypt the oasis relies mainly on the brackish groundwater in el moghra aquifer for salt tolerant crop irrigation and feeding desalination plants the ro brackish groundwater desalination conserves about 75 of the total cost compared to seawater as feed water accordingly the main target of the present work is to allocate cost effective sites for constructing desalination plants to solve freshwater shortages the hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques have been applied to understand the aquifer recharge mechanism and the main factors that deteriorate the groundwater quality additionally an analytical hierarchy process ahp relying on the geographic information systems gis utilized to delineate the promising desalination sites four main criteria linked with the cost of ro groundwater desalination were investigated including aquifer hydraulic parameters hydrogeochemical characteristics recharge indicators based on isotopic tracers and other miscellaneous parameters related to the site accessibility and environmental issues these four main criteria include fourteen

chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the freshwater shortage has recently become a serious problem in egypt el bedawy 2014 eissa et al 2016a b egypt is located in north africa s arid climatic zones where the main water resources are the annual budget from the nile and fossil groundwater the rapid population growth threatens a severe shortage of drinking water supplies in the near future abd ellah 2020 in recent decades the egyptian government has started to increase the reclaimed land depending on non conventional water as a sustainable source of drinking water and agricultural projects abdel shafy and kamel 2016 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 the western desert of egypt represents appropriate and strategic regions for further land reclamation developmental projects moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 an arid climate characterizes el moghra oasis as a part of the western desert abdel mogith et al 2012 mohamaden et al 2017 yousf et al 2018 where the annual rainfall is scarce and mainly occurs in winter mohamaden et al 2017 sayed et al 2019 the study area has attracted the interest of governmental organizations and the private sector due to the availability of brackish groundwater in the el moghra aquifer of the lower miocene age for potable and irrigation uses the miocene groundwater is mostly brackish where the salinity ranges from 2100 to 7200 mg l el sabri et al 2016 according to the standard recommended limits world health organization 2004 the groundwater is not permissible for drinking however it is suitable for salt tolerant crops under specific soils and irrigation management el sayed and morsy 2018 eu delegation to egypt 2015 additionally groundwater desalination is crucial for human consumption and plant irrigation in remote areas during the last five decades drinking water produced from different desalination techniques in egypt using the sea as feedwater salinity 44 000 mg l has increased from 500 m3 d to 746 000 m3 d it is expected to be about 2 6 106 m3 d by the end of 2037 due to the further installation of mega desalination plants in the coastal cities of egypt hcww 2020 the cost of reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination ranges from 0 5 to 1 2 us m3 while the cost of brackish water desalination varies from 0 2 to 0 4 us m3 reddy and ghaffour 2007 ghaffour et al 2013 in groundwater desalination the aquifer parameters such as the depth to groundwater dtw saturated aquifer thickness and aquifer transmissivity are important characteristics to consider while conserving the water desalination cost and ensuring the sustainability of feed groundwater akhter and hasan 2016 schroeder et al 2021 shallow groundwater depth location sites are more favorable than deep groundwater due to the additional drilling and pumping costs of the latter furthermore thick aquifer saturation with high transmissivity enhances productivity and ensures a sustainable groundwater resource one of the other factors controlling the desalination cost is the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater including the salinity and quality of feed water paktinat et al 2014 therefore selecting the best sites throughout el moghra oasis for desalination plants will greatly reduce the daily operational and annual maintenance costs and consequently conserve the total resource ahmadi et al 2020 the dissolved salt assemblages in groundwater including caso4 caco3 baso4 and srso4 are alkaline earth salts that may participate to form scale buildup on the membrane top surface and deteriorate its productivity lin et al 2005 shirazi et al 2010 pe rez gonza lez et al 2012 to mitigate the scaling problem strategies such as ph adjustment antiscalant and chemical dosing need to be used which increase the cost of reverse osmosis desalination chesters 2009 additionally the concentration of dissolved trace and minor elements such as iron fe2 and silica sio2 in the groundwater of the el moghra aquifer have been detected in high concentrations el sabri et al 2016 iron precipitates upon changes in ph causing membrane fouling and drastically reducing the produced desalinated water aly et al 2012 in addition silica scaling mitigation in desalination processes has been a challenge until now ion exchange resins or accelerated seeded precipitation processes have to be used to remove silica from the inlet water rahardianto et al 2010 environmental isotopes δ18o and δ2h were employed to define the origins of sustainable groundwater recharge in semi arid aquifer regions eissa et al 2016a b ouhamdouch et al 2022 that can impact operation facilities and consequently affect the groundwater desalination cost owosina et al 1996 mongelli et al 2013 abidi et al 2017 other miscellaneous factors have also been considered in this research to prevent the environmental impacts of using fossil fuels for the desalination process and factors related to favorable site locations and accessibility solar energy instead of fossil fuels should operate reverse osmosis desalination plants for environmental reasons consequently the spatial variation of solar radiation in the study area has been well delineated to determine the most suitable site for constructing the ro plant eu delegation to egypt 2015 shouman et al 2016 aydin and sarptas 2020 moreover the land slope is an influential factor affecting photo voltaic pv panel installation land with a slope greater than 4 causes solar panels to shadow and adversely affects the system efficiency noorollahi et al 2016 distance from major roads is also critical for selecting a suitable desalination site as the construction of new access roads is very expensive and should be minimized sayed et al 2019 noorollahi et al 2016 many published types of research have been achieved to select promising sites for a desalination plant the analytical hierarchy process ahp a multi criteria decision making analysis mcda that was improved by saaty 1980 1994 was used to check the consistency of the decision to identify the suitable sites for desalination plants and to lower the bias in the decision making progression paktinat et al 2014 used multi criteria decision making and fuzzy logic to determine the promising solar desalination system sites the hybrid fuzzy analytical hierarchy process has been used to help stakeholders with a subjective selection of the feasible seawater desalination technology between seven alternatives ion exchange ie vapor compression vc multi stage flash distillation msf multi effect distillation med electrodialysis ed and ro jarada et al 2020 rustum et al 2020 to adequately investigated the groundwater in el moghra aquifer the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters geochemical groundwater characteristics and other miscellaneous associated with the optimum operational conditions required for the ro desalination plants have been weighted and reclassified according to their importance relative to each other the aquifer hydraulic parameters include depth to groundwater dtw saturated aquifer thickness st and transmissivity t the geochemical characteristics of groundwater include the total dissolved solids tds total hardness th caso4 sio2 fe sr b and stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h additionally other miscellaneous includes global solar radiation gsr land slope ls and distance to roads d have been determined while the regional hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotopic content of el moghra aquifer have been studied intensively i e ali and salman 1988 awad et al 1994 araffa et al 2021 awad et al 1994 mapping the potential groundwater zone s for delineating the best sites for ro groundwater desalination is still unclear the gis technique efficiently delineates the potential groundwater zone in arid regions and provides more accurate results jose et al 2012 lakshmi and reddy 2018 therefore the main objectives of this research are 1 utilize the gis techniques for aquifer mapping to identify the optimal locations for constructing desalination plants affiliated with feed groundwater quality 2 to determine the promising aquifer recharge zone s and hydraulic parameters in el moghra area to ensure the sustainability of feed groundwater 3 create a suitability map for the best locations for constructing desalination plants in the el moghra oasis using a multi criterion including geochemistry of groundwater isotopes and mcda analysis supported by a gis tool the scientific approach of this research could be applied globally to areas that have the similar climatic and hydrogeological conditions 2 study area description the area of the feasibility study is between latitudes 30 00 to 30 10 n and longitudes 28 30 to 29 00 e fig 1 in summer the average recorded temperature is 39 c while 23 c in winter mohamaden et al 2017 and humidity ranges from 39 5 in december to 19 in june the annual precipitation in el moghra area ranges from 25 to 50

5 4 mm day in december el sabri et al 2016 the study area comprises three main geomorphic units el diffa plateau dune belt and el moghra depression esm 1 el diffa plateau extends along the north part of the el moghra region where a well defined escarpment is developed and extends northward the dune belt is located in the main southern portion of el moghra and is divided into sand sheets and gravelly plains which constitute the main portion of the study area the el moghra depression is divided into lowlands sabkhas and el moghra lake el sayed and morsy 2018 the el moghra region is covered by rock units ranging in age from the lower miocene to the quaternary fig 2 the lower miocene unit includes the el moghra formation of fluviomarine sediments said 1962 it grades northwards to the mamura formation of marine facies pickford et al 2010 the middle miocene unit includes the marine fossiliferous carbonates of the marmarica formation the pliocene rock unit includes the el hagif formation which consists mainly of unfossiliferous limestone of smoky white color interbedded with marl layers the el moghra formation is the only aquifer in the study area and is divided into three water bearing formations arranged from top to bottom monqar el dawi upper qaret el rikab middle and el raml lower respectively yousf et al 2018 el sabri et al 2016 3 materials and methods the selection of ideal locations for constructing desalination plants was carried out in five steps 1 groundwater data from the field site in el moghra area was collected 2 the effective factors containing criteria were identified and screened 3 thematic layers were prepared using a geographical information system gis 4 every factor was weighted through multi criteria decision making mcda ahp and 5 the layers were then integrated to identify the proper locations using the galdit method based on geographical information systems gis the esm 2 presents the different steps of selecting of the best sites for cost wise desalination plants 3 1 groundwater data collection the el moghra aquifer is characterized by 55 groundwater samples in august 2019 furthermore rainwater and seawater samples were collected the depth to groundwater dtw and total depth td were measured during the fieldwork using the solinst sounder model 101 p7 probe water level meter instrument aquifer transmissivity t data were used to estimate aquifer potential t kb fetter 1988 where k is hydraulic conductivity m day and b is the aquifer thickness m during the field trip ph water electrical conductivity ec in μs cm and groundwater salinity tds mg l were measured the ph and ec were measured using a 3510 jenway uk meter and orion 150 a thermo electron corporation waltham ma usa respectively groundwater samples were collected to analyze the major cations and anions rainwater and thatcher 1960 fishman and friedman 1985 hem 1989 astm 2002 at the desert research centre in cairo egypt br ion was analyzed by the orion ea 940 thermo electron corporation fe ba sr sio2 were analyzed by icap 6500 duo thermo scientific england thermo scientific 2007 usepa method 6010 b 1996 the precision measurement accuracies for fe ba sr and si were 0 09 0 003 0 008 and 0 172 ppm respectively the saturation indices for halite calcite dolomite and gypsum minerals as well as the calcium sulfate concentration caso4 in mmol l were calculated by phreeqc 3 3 7 computer program esm 3 4 oxygen 18 and deuterium were measured at the isotope tracers and technologies lab in waterloo canada using picarro crds model l2130 i by the method described by coplen et al 1991 coplen 1995 deuterium and oxygen 18 as per mil and the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as isotopic standard reference material where δ 18o 16o sample 18o 16o standard 1 χ1000 craig 1961 the precision measurement accuracy for oxygen 18 was 0 1 and 1 for deuterium tritium 3h was determined by liquid scintillation counting ri carb model 2700 tr series at the atomic energy authority lab cairo egypt the analytical precision was approximately 0 65 tu i a e a 2012 3 2 identifying the effective factors criteria the membrane type power supply and system configuration for the ro desalination plant can vary based on the aquifer hydraulic characteristics feedwater chemistry aquifer recharge rate and solar radiation intensity ruiz garcía and nuez 2020 according to saeed et al 2019 the parameters which affect feed water chemistry are total dissolved solids total hardness calcium sulfate silica iron strontium and barium therefore these factors are focused on in this study 3 3 thematic layer preparation all the factor criteria were entered into arc gis 10 2 2 as input layers for site selection the digital elevation model dem is derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the data was collected in c band by the space shuttle endeavour in 2001 using a sar interferometry device these data were used to create land slope and area solar radiation maps using arcgis 10 2 2 spatial analyzer modules the empirical bayesian kriging ebk approach that automates the most challenging portions of creating a valid kriging model was used to interpolate the layers ebk unlike other kriging methods in geostatistical analyst uses subsetting and simulation to automatically produce these parameters ensuring that the findings are accurate krivoruchko and gribov 2019 gribova and krivoruchko 2020 after thematic layers preparation and interpolation of the selected criteria these layers were divided into three categories and reclassified using the reclassify tool in arc gis 10 2 2 for each criterion suitability ratings of 1 3 were adopted where rate 1 low 2 medium 3 high suitability table 1 3 4 analytical hierarchy process in this study three level hierarchy structure is developed the first level defines the objective of this study which is mapping suitable sites for constructing desalination plants the next level consists of organizing the effective criteria and sub criteria on the suitable sites for constructing desalination plants saaty 1980 proposed assigning weights for the relevant criteria and their associated features on a scale of 1 9 where 1 is prevalent to equal importance 2 weak importance 3 moderate importance and 4 moderate plus strong importance is given 5 while strong plus very strong super strong and extreme importance are given 6 7 8 9 respectively a pairwise comparison matrix a is constructed once the weights have been allocated the relative relevance of the two criteria is then evaluated on a range of 1 9 on a numerical scale the weights are then normalized by dividing each entry by the column total the requisite relative criteria weights are calculated by taking the average of the new matrix s rows then performing a consistency test using the consistency ratio as follows 1 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the average value of the consistency vector and n is the number of factors the consistency ratio cr is a metric for how consistent this pair wise comparison matrix is 2 c r c i r i where ri is the random index which depends on n values table 2 the cr must be equal to or less than 0 10 cr 0 10 to acquire accurate results with the ahp alternatively cr 0 10 means there is an inconsistency 3 5 galdit method the best locations for desalination plant construction are evaluated using the galdit method moghaddam et al 2015 chang et al 2019 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 galdit is an index mapping approach the suitability map is generated using thematic layers in raster format with the same cell size in the raster calculator tool in arcgis 10 2 2 by the integration of all the maps classified maps of tds dtw st t fe th caso4 sio2 ba sr δ18o gsr ls and d as the following equation 3 g a l d i t i n d e x n 1 10 w n χ r n where n w and r are the factors the criteria weight from ahp and the rating assigned to the ten factors respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer hydraulic characteristics 4 1 1 depth to groundwater dtw the depth to water of el moghra aquifer in the area ranges from 4 to 93 m the depth to water increases towards the southwest in the direction of the qattara depression as seen in fig 3 a samples which have a depth to groundwater ranging from 4 0 to 20 0 m are given a rating of 3 at the same time samples with depth to groundwater ranging from 50 to 93 m are given the lowest rating of 1 the depth to groundwater is an important element impacting the cost of drilling water wells and groundwater pumping resulting in the entire cost of desalination plant construction wada et al 2010 chen et al 2019 4 1 2 saturated aquifer thickness the el moghra aquifer is comprised of three thick layers of sand and sandstone separated by thin clay and shale laminae the aquifer saturated thickness decreases from east to west it ranges from 350 to 474 m as seen in fig 3b the saturated thickness considerably impacts the future increase in groundwater pumping costs foster et al 2017 merrill and guilfoos 2017 therefore areas with a saturated thickness ranging from 350 to 400 m are given the lowest rating of 1 while areas with a saturated thickness ranging from 450 to 474 are given the highest rating of 3 4 1 3 aquifer transmissivity the term transmissivity refers to the rate at which groundwater with a certain kinematic viscosity is transmitted across a unit width of the aquifer at a given hydraulic gradient todd 1980 it ranges from 800 to 6500 m2 day the highest transmissivity values are presented in the northeastern part of the area as seen in fig 3c it ranges from 3000 to 6500 m2 day indicating a large amount of groundwater in this part giving it a high rating of 3 in contrast the southwestern area has the lowest transmissivity values as it ranges from 800 to 1500 m2 day this indicates that the probability of groundwater in this part of the area is low 4 2 geochemical groundwater characteristics 4 2 1 groundwater salinity the total dissolved solids in groundwater of the el moghra aquifer range from 2565 to 11 075 mg l the groundwater salinity increases from southwest and northeast to the west with the same direction of groundwater net flow towards the qattara depression as shown in fig 4 a abdel mogith et al 2012 groundwater wells which have salinity ranging from 2565 to 5000 mg l are given a rating of 3 as it requires lower pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure of the salinized feed water consequently the energy consumption and costs are reduced than wells with salinity ranging from 7000 to 11 075 mg l which are rated 1 lattemann and höpner 2008 atab et al 2016 sodium na and chloride cl represent the main dissolved ions in groundwater where na na na in epm sum total cations in epm 100 ranges from 56 well 22 to 83 7 well 52 while cl cl cl in epm sum total anions in epm 100 ranges between 67 well 29 to 89 6 well 3 the calculated saturation indices si for halite in all the groundwater samples are less than zero indicating the nacl is completely dissolved in the groundwater and undersaturation limit plummer et al 1994 nacl is the main salt leading the groundwater salinization in el moghra aquifer esm 4 4 2 2 total hardness the total hardness th is associated with the amount of dissolved calcium ca and magnesium in groundwater the concentration of dissolved calcium in groundwater ranges from 109 mg l well 52 to 674 mg l well 50 while magnesium ranges between 66 mg l well 52 and 475 mg l well 3 hardwater possesses high dissolved calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as calcite and dolomite embedded in the aquifer matrix pickford et al 2010 the calculated saturation indices for the calcite caco3 and dolomite mgco3 are mostly positive ve calcite values 81 and ve dolomite 85 indicating supersaturation the th of groundwater in the el moghra aquifer ranges from 543 to 3315 mg l as caco3 as shown in fig 4b it increases westward with the same direction of groundwater flow this finding is related to the leaching and dissolution of carbonates which constitute the overlying middle miocene marmarica aquifer in addition the study area s total hardness results indicate that the groundwater in the study area is very hard and needs pretreatment before desalination to protect the membrane surface from scaling which decreases the water flux zaidi et al 2021 accordingly wells with th ranging from 543 to 1000 mg l as caco3 are given a rating of 3 while wells with total hardness ranging from 1500 to 3315 mg l as caco3 are given a rating of 1 4 2 3 calcium sulfate the molality of calcium sulfate caso4 in groundwater samples has been estimated using the phreeq c geochemical program it ranges from 0 26 to 2 1 mmol l esm 3 see section 3 1 fig 4c shows higher molality values of the caso4 in groundwater wells recorded in the northwest direction of the area in contrast lower molality are found in samples in the eastern direction additionally the saturation indices values for the gypsum mineral caso4 2h2o in all groundwater samples record negative values indicating an undersaturation level during the desalination process high molality of caso4 or gypsum saturation indices values give indication of precipitation on the membrane surface decreasing in permeate flow and shorter membrane life rahardianto et al 2008 tu et al 2011 wells with calcium sulfate ranging from 0 26 to 1 0 mmol l are given a rating of 3 while wells with a higher concentration of calcium sulfate ranging from 1 5 to 2 1 mmol l are given a rating of 1 4 2 4 iron the iron concentration of groundwater ranges from 0 033 to 17 4 mg l the concentration of iron in groundwater increases in the southwest direction as shown in fig 4d the existence of high dissolved iron concentrations in these locations is related to metal reduction mineral precipitation and ion adsorption snyder et al 2014 abdelazeem et al 2020 iron pretreatment is recommended before desalination due to its impact on membrane fouling increasing the cost of reverse osmosis desalination melliti et al 2019 the groundwater wells with an iron concentration range from 0 033 to 1 0 mg l are given 3 ratings while wells with an iron concentration range from 5 0 to 17 4 mg l are given ratings of 1 4 2 5 silica the source of dissolved silica in groundwater is mostly water rock interactions abdelazeem et al 2020 the silica concentration in the area ranges from 2 6 to 48 4 mg l as seen in fig 4e during the desalination process increased ca and mg concentrations promote silica polymerization on the membrane surface resulting in decreased membrane performance salvador et al 2014 consequently samples with silica concentrations ranging from 2 6 to 10 mg l are given ratings of 3 while samples with silica concentrations ranging from 20 0 to 48 4 are given ratings of 1 4 2 6 barium and strontium the source of barium in groundwater is the dissolution of barite mokrik et al 2009 while the source of strontium is the weathering of celestite rich rocks cai et al 2020 barium in groundwater in the area ranges from 0 002 to 0 07 mg l while strontium ranges from 0 98 to 8 2 mg l as shown in fig 4f g the groundwater wells with barium and strontium concentrations ranging from 0 002 to 0 02 mg l and from 0 98 to 2 5 mg l are given 3 ratings respectively on the other hand wells with concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l and from 5 0 to 8 2 mg l are given a rate of 1 for barium and strontium respectively the presence of ba and sr in feed water can cause membrane scaling so adding antiscalant to feed water is required to prevent membrane scaling zhang et al 2019 4 3 indicators for promising groundwater recharge the recharging sources for aquifers have been revealed by oxygen δ 18o and hydrogen δ 2h tracers they can be used to assess physical processes such as evaporation and groundwater mixing because they do not engage in geochemical reactions dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 the distribution of δ18o values increases southward and eastward in the study area fig 5 fig 6 a illustrates the relationship between δ18o and δ2h the groundwater samples have δ18o ranges from 1 64 well 31 to 2 49 well 3 and δ2h ranges from 11 4 well 11 to 4 9 well 3 the results show that all groundwater samples are distributed below the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and plotted on the trend line that extends between the nubian groundwater and the old nile water δ18o 0 6 and δ2h 4 3 awad et al 1994 the mean isotopic value for rainwater between october and april was reported at 5 0 for δ18o and 15 14 for δ 2h eissa et al 2016a b a sample of seawater from the mediterranean is displayed and it has substantially enriched isotopic values δ18o 1 12 δ2h 8 5 in fig 6b all groundwater samples of el moghra aquifer have been plotted in between three end members the nubian groundwater the old nile water and the recent seawater confirming that the main recharge comes from the meteoric water which is represented by the recent rainfall and the old nile water as well as upward recharge from the underneath nubian groundwater artesian aquifer through the structure of the deep seated faults azab 2014 el sayed and morsy 2018 the subsurface recharge to the el moghra from the artesian nubian aquifer has been estimated to range from 2 3 to 2 26 m3 s rizk and davis 1991 el sabri et al 2016 yousf et al 2018 the nubian groundwater aquifer had a paleo recharge water that was recharged during the pluvial period under a humid climate ali et al 1988 thorweihe and heinl 2002 in fig 6b groundwater samples highlighted by green polygon are plotted close to the old nile water isotopic signature due to the impact of nile water flooding through the ancient channels in the study area geirnart and laeven 1992 which was confirmed by the widespread of the petrified wood on the surface of the el moghra aquifer field trip observation nevertheless groundwater samples enriched with δ18o and δ2h indicate the predominance of evaporation processes in fig 6a b the groundwater in el moghra oasis mainly originated from a paleowater and evolved due to evaporation and mixing with marine water recent sea the marine deposits mainly come from the subsurface deeper layer of the el moghra formation which is formed mainly of deposits of marine origin which are considered the main reason for groundwater deterioration of el moghra oasis tritium 3h half lifetime t1 2 12 3 years a radioactive isotope has been measured in seven groundwater samples representing the el moghra aquifer esm 3 the tritium ranges between 0 49 well 52 to 2 33 tu well 51 fig 6c the present tritium level in local precipitation close to the study area ranges between 4 and 5 2 tu wannous et al 2021 cauquoin et al 2021 the tritium recorded higher concentrations tu in the deeper rather than shallow wells fig 6c the recent recharge indicated by the signature of tritium in the deep wells probably seepage from the seasonal rainfall through the fractures and faults plan that intersect the el moghra aquifer fig 2a and 2b these values indicate the aquifer receives a low amount of meteoric recharge because el moghra is located in the arid zone characterized by a little amount of rainfall 25 50 mm year and predominance of evaporation processes 5 4 29 2 mm day 4 4 miscellaneous parameters 4 4 1 global solar radiation the amount of solar radiance measures solar insolation over a certain period it is commonly measured during peak sun hours which are hours per day when the average solar radiation is 1 kwh m2 pv systems require 3 5 kwh m2 day of solar radiation to be economically viable noorollahi et al 2016 as seen in fig 7 a the gsr raster is converted from wh m2 to kwh m2 day for 2019 the annual gsr ranges from 3 7 to 4 2 kwh m2 day the lowest class ranges from 3 7 to 3 9 kwh m2 day and is given a rating of 1 the highest class ranges from 3 95 to 4 2 kwh m2 day and is given a rating of 3 the highest gsr in the study area was detected in summer ranging from 3 9 to 4 2 kwh m2 day it reaches the lowest value of 2 7 kwh m2 day in the winter 4 4 2 land slope the geography of el moghra oasis influences the selection of appropriate sites for solar desalination plants and is strongly influenced by the land slope the land slope is considered a major factor for land assessment as it effectively influences the feasibility and cost of any solar desalination project gerbo et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 7b the land slope in the study area ranges from 0 to 12 areas with a land slope ranging from 0 to 1 0 are given ratings of 3 however areas with a land slope ranging from 4 1 to 12 are rated 1 a land slope of more than 4 is not recommended for a pv system and desalination plant installation mokarram et al 2020 4 4 3 distance to roads the distance to roads map was created by using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 2 2 as seen in fig 7c the distance to the main roads ranges from 0 to 2 0 km the near distance roads are given a rating of 3 whereas the far distance roads are given a rating of 1 4 5 galdit model for delineating the best zones for desalination plants the suitability map for the best locations for constructing desalination plants was created using the galdit index equation by summing up the multiplication of the normalized weight of each fourteen factors from ahp and by the rating assigned for factors using arc gis 10 2 2 raster calculator tool consequently the suitability map for constructing desalination plants has been classified into three classes with the suitability from high suitability to low suitability as seen in table 3 this is attributed to 8 7 high suitability with an area of about 76 km2 55 9 medium suitability with an area of about 490 km2 and 35 5 low suitability with an area of about 311 km2 as seen in fig 8 high and medium suitable areas for constructing desalination plants are in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the area these areas have groundwater salinity ranging from 2565 to 7000 mg l therefore the cost of desalination in these areas will be relatively low in addition these areas have low values of iron total hardness calcium sulfates strontium and silica these areas also have very good aquifer parameters for groundwater wells furthermore these areas have good location parameters in contrast the western and southwestern parts of the area have low suitability for constructing desalination plants these areas are in the direction of the discharging el moghra aquifer which has high salinity and would make desalination much more expensive 5 conclusion and recommendations el moghra oasis represents one of the best and most strategic regions for sustainable development projects considering land reclamation groundwater is the major source of potable water in this region the groundwater in el moghra is mostly brackish water with salinity ranging from 2565 to 11 075 mg l because of the high salinity the groundwater in the el moghra region is not suitable for drinking and irrigation the environmental isotopes confirmed the scarcity of groundwater recharge from the annual rainfall the aquifer possesses mixing of marine water and paleo recharge water that had taken during the pluvial period groundwater desalination is the most feasible solution for finding a non conventional source of water in such remote areas the most cost wise and suitable locations for constructing reverse osmosis desalination plants were delineated using mcda ahp and gis the final suitability map shows that the best locations for constructing desalination plants are in the northeastern parts and represent 64 5 of the total area while the low suitability locations for constructing desalination plants are in the western and southwestern parts and represent 35 5 of the total area solar energy is the recommended power source instead of diesel as it is eco friendly and can be integrated with wind energy as an alternative renewable source in the area finding an innovative solution for brine disposal instead of injection into deep wells is also recommended as injection will greatly affect the deterioration of the groundwater quality in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

location srtm dem data has been downloaded from usgs earthexplorer ee using the link https earthexplorer usgs gov and data is converted into raster the converted raster data had used as an elevation image for drawing the interrelationship between water quality index and elevation values have been overlaid the precise flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 3 result and discussion 3 1 concentration maps of all parameters table 1 indicates the range and mean concentration values of 11 parameters and also indicates the permissible limit of these parameters given by bis 2012 fig 3 indicates the spatial variation maps of the study area regarding water quality parameters table 1 indicates that the range of values of ph is between 5 8 and 8 2 9 37 of water samples were not found in the bis 2012 standard limits the area which is not under the prescribed limit might be due to the algal growth and precipitation in that area during sampling time sushma et al 2017 in the previous studies only two areas were not found in the bis 2012 standard limits ph values were found in the spring water of kullu valley himachal pradesh was ranged between 6 18 and 8 thakur et al 2020 and in groundwater of nainital uttarakhand values was ranged between 5 9 and 8 1 jain et al 2010 the ec tds total hardness cl na and k values ranged from 192 8 to 855 8 μs cm 96 65 to 416 2 mg l 120 to 530 mg l 24 99 to 529 84 mg l 2 4 to 131 mg l and 0 83 to 45 9 mg l respectively as per the values all the above parameters are within the desirable limit prescribed by bis 2012 in the whole study area as per the previous studies concentration values of tds total hardness cl k and na were found within the prescribed limit by the bis 2012 for drinking water samples in the areas of south kashmir kullu and jammu lone et al 2021 taloor et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 in the case of electrical conductivity all the water samples are within the limits of bis 2012 standards but in previous studies two areas were exceeding the permissible limits ec values found in the spring water of basanter watershed jammu was ranged between 233 and 1523 μs cm taloor et al 2020 and in groundwater of kullu himachal pradesh values was ranged between 41 and 1795 μs cm thakur et al 2018 the concentration of hco3 varied from 73 2 to 610 mg l in which 18 75 of water samples are exceeding the prescribed limit by bis 2012 from previous studies which are indicated in table 2 only one area is exceeding the concentration of hco3 which ranged between 105 8 and 590 mg l taloor et al 2020 in south kashmir udhampur and kullu the concentration of hco3 ranged from 61 6 to 282 5 mg l lone et al 2021 79 to 445 mg l murtaza et al 2020 and 20 230 mg l thakur et al 2018 respectively in these areas the concentration of hco3 was reported within the permissible limits prescribed by bis 2012 the so4 2 and ca2 are found in the water sample within the range of 66 25 558 mg l and 53 458 mg l and the percentage of water samples that exceeds the prescribed limits of both the parameters are 15 62 and 34 37 all the cited studies from the relevant area of different sources like spring water bhat and pandit 2020 devi and gupta 2017 lone et al 2021 taloor et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 and ground water jain et al 2010 murtaza et al 2020 thakur et al 2018 reported so4 2 and ca2 concentration lower than the bis 2012 standards for drinking water table 2 mg2 is also detected in the water within the range of 17 197 mg l and about 12 5 of water samples exceeded the permissible limit given by bis 2012 the higher concentration of mg2 was also reported in a study from south kashmir and was found to have a mean concentration of 55 08 mg l having a range of 28 127 mg l lone et al 2021 the concentration of ca2 in some area is high may be due to the reason that water passes via deposits of limestone chalk or gypsum that are mainly composed of calcium carbonates basavaraj et al 2007 and the people living in the study area is mainly suffering from kidney and gall balladeer stones as per our sampling survey sulfate is a salt derived from sulfuric acid and are widely used in industry so it plays a vital role in everyday life sulfate occurs mostly in all natural waters due to the oxidation of sulphite ores the presence of shales and also due to industrial waste in the soil the primary source of bicarbonate ions is dissolved carbon dioxide in rainwater the uptake of carbon dioxide from the soil zone gases or direct atmospheric inputs can enter the groundwater system which results in the increase of bicarbonate ions generally in crystalline ground waters the concentration of the bicarbonate decreases with depth when organic matter undergoes decomposition it may also release carbon dioxide for dissolution in water the ions of the bicarbonate are present mainly with the association of ca2 and mg2 magnesium is the most abundant element found in nature and it is the having the main role in water hardness weathering of ferro magnesium and carbonate rocks are the main source of mg2 in water 3 2 water quality of the study area based on index map fig 4 indicates the water quality index map of study area the overall water quality of the study area is excellent the water quality index values are between 90 and 80 out of 10 classes according to the 11 parameters the study area is having excellent water quality the water of this area is fit for drinking and other domestic purposes the lowest highest and average values of 11 rank maps are illustrated in table 3 which are used to calculate wqi from table 3 it can be noted that the ca2 is having the highest mean rank value 4 82 which is having the largest impact on water quality of the study area the second and third most influential parameter of water quality of study area are ph and mg with a rank mean value of 4 71 and 4 38 respectively 3 3 sensitivity of water quality parameters table 4 indicates the variation index of all 11 parameters from the 11 parameters ph ca2 and na have the highest average value of variation index of 1 25 1 22 and 1 11 respectively this shows that ph ca2 and na are the most sensitive water quality parameters so these parameters are need to be monitored regularly with high accuracy the parameters which are having high variation index have a highest impact on the wqi the parameters ec and th have the lowest variation index 0 21 and 0 10 respectively have the lowest effect on the wqi as per the sensitivity analysis the removing of theses parameters will not have influence on the water quality index 3 4 hydro chemical facies characteristics the piper trilinear diagram explains the hydro geochemical faces on the basis of dominant ions in this diagram the major ionic component concentrations were plotted for the determination of water types piper 1944 according to gautam et al 2015 and s k singh et al 2015 finding the major ion percentage is defined by the cations and anions on the basis of their domains in the diagram the cationic and anionic composition of water is donated by the diamond shaped fields which are in between two triangles in the piper trilinear diagram for finding the geochemistry of the analyzed spring water samples the piper trilinear diagram should be designed with the help of the cationic and anionic composition of the water for easily determination moharir et al 2019 the piper trilinear diagram shows that 65 of spring water samples fall into the ca2 type whereas 20 fall into the mg2 type and remaining 15 fall into the no dominant into the cation facies regarding anions 60 of samples fall into cl type 10 fall into so4 2 types and remaining 30 fall into the no dominant type of anion facies the plot on the diamond shaped trilinear diagram indicates that all the water samples fall in the field of alkaline earth exceeds alkalies 80 of water samples fall in the field of calcium chloride facies 10 fall in the field of mixed type facies and remaining 10 fall in the field of magnesium bicarbonate facies therefore pieper trilinear diagram indicates that maximum water samples belong to the cacl2 type see table 5 3 5 statistical analysis for the assessment of the relationship of wqi with surface elevation descriptive analysis has been done as per the data values of wqi is ranges between 86 and 91 therefore wqi values has been categorized into three classes i e 86 87 88 89 and 90 analysis has been done for getting relationship among these variables and tabular data is given in table 5 3 6 relationship between surface elevation and water quality index wqi spatial relationship has been drawn between the water quality index and surface elevation fig 5 surface elevation has been derived from dem and wqi has been calculated from provencher and lamontagne 1977 water quality index equation the study shows at the higher surface elevation is having values of wqi i e above 90 table no 4 whereas in lower elevations the wqi values are between 86 and 87 table 4 so it shows that at higher elevations the water quality for drinking purpose is excellent as compared to the low elevation area but at overall the water quality of the study area is excellent so as we move from a higher elevation towards the lower elevation area water quality values reduce so it shows the positive relationship between each other variables fig 6 4 conclusion this study was accomplished in a sub tropical and hilly shivalik range of jammu division northern india for the estimation and characterization of drinking water quality parameters gis based technique spatial variation is used for the analysis of the quality of water in the study area on the basis of the water quality index method the quality of water in the study area was estimated for the identification of the most efficient water quality parameter map removal sensitivity analysis was done the range of concentration maps of the study area regarding water quality parameters specifies that the five parameters exceed the maximum permissible limit prescribed for water which is used for drinking purposes by bis 2012 the five parameters which exceed are ph hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 other parameters like ec tds th cl na and k are within the maximum permissible limit prescribed for drinking water by bis 2012 ca2 ph and mg2 regulate the spatial pattern of the wqi map the hydro geochemical facies also shows that most of the samples are cacl2 type i e maximum samples fall in the field of alkaline earth exceeds alkalies the computed wqi map indicated that comparatively high quality of water in that area so the water quality is good for drinking and domestic uses according to these 11 parameters moreover ph ca2 and na are need to be monitored regularly with high accuracy as ions of ph ca2 and na are the most sensitive water quality parameters the study finds the positive correlation between wqi and surface elevation indicated the good quality of water in the elevated regions this study gives a clear image of the water quality to the residing population which depends on the spring water for the drinking purposes of that particular study area declaration of

study area is situated at 32 73 n 74 87 e the mean elevation of the area is 300 m 980 ft the study area is situated in stumpy as well as elevated heights near the irregular ridges of the shivalik range the total study area was 11 828 km2 and the climatic conditions of the districts are the alpine type with monsoon having an important impact with annual precipitation of 349 mm the study area has a diverse topography ranging from mountainous regions foothill valleys and lofty mountain ranges the region is eminent for various tourist destinations like nathatop patnitop sudh mahadev purthu mansar baderwah and sukrala mata agriculture is the core livelihood of the residing population the study area is drained by six major rivers namely chenab rabi tawi devika basantar and ujh the study area comprises siwaliks murrees and dogra slates types of geological formations limestones panjal volcanic devonian rocks and ramsu formation are other geological formations the population of the study area is mainly dependent on spring water for drinking and household purpose groundwater occurs in piedmont deposits in the outer plains of jammu belonging to the upper pleistocene to the recent age piedmont deposits of the siwaliks exist in two types that is kandi and the surreal belt very coarse material with little clay comprises the kandi belt with the phenomenon of perched water body s occurrence sirowal belt is the finer outer wash of shivalik debris carried by the kandi belt that joins sirowal in the south both confined and unconfined conditions are responsible for groundwater occurrence this belt is featured by shallow water table conditions in the study area natural springs are used as a primary source of potable water for the residing population 2 2 analytical methods used for water quality parameters analysis ph ec and tds are analyzed using a multi parameter analyzer eutech pc 450 hardness chloride and bicarbonate are analyzed using the traditional titrimetric method apha 2012 sodium potassium and calcium are analyzed using a flame photometer model 1385 while sulfate is analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 3000 and magnesium is analyzed via an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 8000 apha 2012 2 3 data acquisition the samples of drinking water were collected from a study area by using a random sampling technique and analyzed in the laboratory by following the procedure of apha 2012 to measure different parameters of drinking water thirty two drinking water samples were acquired in jan 2019 out of 32 samples points most of the samples are taken from spring water sources which are used for supply for drinking and daily usage purpose data is acquired which is related to the date of collection sampling location of the site temperature population dependency etc out of all the data 11 parameters are taken place for getting the water quality index of that area the 11 parameters are ph total hardness total dissolved solids electrical conductivity ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl and so4 2 the range and bis threshold value of all 11 parameters are given in table 1 2 4 inverse distance weighted idw the precise locations of drinking water sources were noted down using google maps and further imported into gis software the data of both the longitude and latitude of the location from where samples were collected is in decimal format all the locations with parameters were imported in an excel file in csv format the data was imported into the gis software for the interpretation of data a tool was used to analyze the spatial condition in the gis software by the use of idw inverse distance weighted an interpolation technique the different thematic maps of all the parameters were created idw is a very elastic interpolation technique which is impartially accurate within a broad range of conditions and estimates the values of neighboring unknown locations s k singh et al 2015 after the analysis results were stored in a raster file format 2 5 determination of the water quality index wqi the determination of wqi entailed the undermentioned steps which are delineated below step 1 concentration maps of all parameters for the generation of concentration maps of all parameters idw inverse distance weighted interpolation technique was used in gis software step 2 normalized difference maps of all parameters for the construction of the normalized difference maps of each parameter undermentioned equation was used 1 n i c c m c c m in the above equation c indicates the value of every pixel for each thematic map of parameter cm indicates the permissible limit value prescribed by bis 2012 for every parameter of drinking water the pixel value of each normalized difference map is between 1 and 1 machiwal et al 2011 step 3 rank maps of all parameters the rank map for each parameter was created from the each ni map whose pixel value ranges from 1 to 10 rank 1 indicates the lowest influence and rank 10 indicates the highest influence on drinking water quality ni map of every parameter was transformed to rank map by using undermentioned equation babiker et al 2007 2 r 0 5 x n i 2 4 5 n i 5 in the above equation r is the rank value that is equal to its ni value and ni is the normalized map of every parameter step 4 computation of water quality index map provencher and lamontagne 1977 water quality index equation was used for the computation of wqi map 3 w q i 100 w 1 r 1 w 2 r 2 w n r n n in the above equation r is the rank value for every parameter w was determined from the mean value of every rank map and donates the relative weight of every parameter and n is the total number of parameters used in the computation of wqi to access the quality of drinking water the most necessary parameter having a higher mean rank value machiwal et al 2011 the classification of the wqi map was having 10 categories with an interval of 10 which ranges from 0 to 100 the pixel with a score index close to 0 indicates bad quality and close to 100 indicates excellent quality 2 6 water quality index wqi sensitivity analysis the process in which the parameters are identified on the basis of their highest and lowest impact on the water quality of a source is known as a sensitivity analysis lodwick et al 1990 finding the impact of deleting any one parameter from the calculation of wqi a map removal sensitivity technique was used and then imported into a gis software for the computation of the variation index the undermentioned equation was used in which each parameter map is removed from the wqi calculation for finds the sensitivity of the wqi map machiwal et al 2011 4 v w j w q i w q i w j w q i 100 where vwj indicates the variation index except jth rank map wqi indicates the water quality index and wqiwj indicates the water quality index except jth rank map 2 7 shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation dem dataset srtm dem data with 30 m spatial resolution gives information about the height of a particular location at any part of the earth surface khan et al 2016 every pixel of dem is having some value and this value indicates the height of that particular location srtm dem data has been downloaded from usgs earthexplorer ee using the link https earthexplorer usgs gov and data is converted into raster the converted raster data had used as an elevation image for drawing the interrelationship between water quality index and elevation values have been overlaid the precise flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 3 result and discussion 3 1 concentration maps of all parameters table 1 indicates the range and mean concentration values of 11 parameters and also indicates the permissible limit of these parameters given by bis 2012 fig 3 indicates the spatial variation maps of the study area regarding water quality parameters table 1 indicates that the range of values of ph is between 5 8 and 8 2 9 37 of water samples were not found in the bis 2012 standard limits the area which is not under the prescribed limit might be due to the algal growth and precipitation in that area during sampling time sushma et al 2017 in the previous studies only two areas were not found in the bis 2012 standard limits ph values were found in the spring water of kullu valley himachal pradesh was ranged between 6 18 and 8 thakur et al 2020 and in groundwater of nainital uttarakhand values was ranged between 5 9 and 8 1 jain et al 2010 the ec tds total hardness cl na and k values ranged from 192 8 to 855 8 μs cm 96 65 to 416 2 mg l 120 to 530 mg l 24 99 to 529 84 mg l 2 4 to 131 mg l and 0 83 to 45 9 mg l respectively as per the values all the above parameters are within the desirable limit prescribed by bis 2012 in the whole study area as per the previous studies concentration values of tds total hardness cl k and na were found within the prescribed limit by the bis 2012 for drinking water samples in the areas of south kashmir kullu and jammu lone et al 2021 taloor et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 in the case of electrical conductivity all the water samples are within the limits of bis 2012 standards but in previous studies two areas were exceeding the permissible limits ec values found in the spring water of basanter watershed jammu was ranged between 233 and 1523 μs cm taloor et al 2020 and in groundwater of kullu himachal pradesh values was ranged between 41 and 1795 μs cm thakur et al 2018 the concentration of hco3 varied from 73 2 to 610 mg l in which 18 75 of water samples are exceeding the prescribed limit by bis 2012 from previous studies which are indicated in table 2 only one area is exceeding the concentration of hco3 which ranged between 105 8 and 590 mg l taloor et al 2020 in south kashmir udhampur and kullu the concentration of hco3 ranged from 61 6 to 282 5 mg l lone et al 2021 79 to 445 mg l murtaza et al 2020 and 20 230 mg l thakur et al 2018 respectively in these areas the concentration of hco3 was reported within the permissible limits prescribed by bis 2012 the so4 2 and ca2 are found in the water sample within the range of 66 25 558 mg l and 53 458 mg l and the percentage of water samples that exceeds the prescribed limits of both the parameters are 15 62 and 34 37 all the cited studies from the relevant area of different sources like spring water bhat and pandit 2020 devi and gupta 2017 lone et al 2021 taloor et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 and ground water jain et al 2010 murtaza et al 2020 thakur et al 2018 reported so4 2 and ca2 concentration lower than the bis 2012 standards for drinking water table 2 mg2 is also detected in the water within the range of 17 197 mg l and about 12 5 of water samples exceeded the permissible limit given by bis 2012 the higher concentration of mg2 was also reported in a study from south kashmir and was found to have a mean concentration of 55 08 mg l having a range of 28 127 mg l lone et al 2021 the concentration of ca2 in some area is high may be due to the reason that water passes via deposits of limestone chalk or gypsum that are mainly composed of calcium carbonates basavaraj et al 2007 and the people living in the study area is mainly suffering from kidney and gall balladeer stones as per our sampling survey sulfate is a salt derived from sulfuric acid and are widely used in industry so it plays a vital role in everyday life sulfate occurs mostly in all natural waters due to the oxidation of sulphite ores the presence of shales and also due to industrial waste in the soil the primary source of bicarbonate ions is dissolved carbon dioxide in rainwater the uptake of carbon dioxide from the soil zone gases or direct atmospheric inputs can enter the groundwater system which results in the increase of bicarbonate ions generally in crystalline ground waters the concentration of the bicarbonate decreases with depth when organic matter undergoes decomposition it may also release carbon dioxide for dissolution in water the ions of the bicarbonate are present mainly with the association of ca2 and mg2 magnesium is the most abundant element found in nature and it is the having the main role in water hardness weathering of ferro magnesium and carbonate rocks are the main source of mg2 in water 3 2 water quality of the study area based on index map fig 4 indicates the water quality index map of study area the overall water quality of the study area is excellent the water quality index values are between 90 and 80 out of 10 classes according to the 11 parameters the study area is having excellent water quality the water of this area is fit for drinking and other domestic purposes the lowest highest and average values of 11 rank maps are illustrated in table 3 which are used to calculate wqi from table 3 it can be noted that the ca2 is having the highest mean rank value 4 82 which is having the largest impact on water quality of the study area the second and third most influential parameter of water quality of study area are ph and mg with a rank mean value of 4 71 and 4 38 respectively 3 3 sensitivity of water quality parameters table 4 indicates the variation index of all 11 parameters from the 11 parameters ph ca2 and na have the highest average value of variation index of 1 25 1 22 and 1 11 respectively this shows that ph ca2 and na are the most sensitive water quality parameters so these parameters are need to be monitored regularly with high accuracy the parameters which are having high variation index have a highest impact on the wqi the parameters ec and th have the lowest variation index 0 21 and 0 10 respectively have the lowest effect on the wqi as per the sensitivity analysis the removing of theses parameters will not have influence on the water quality index 3 4 hydro chemical facies characteristics the piper trilinear diagram explains the hydro geochemical faces on the basis of dominant ions in this diagram the major ionic component concentrations were plotted for the determination of water types piper 1944 according to gautam et al 2015 and s k singh et al 2015 finding the major ion percentage is defined by the cations and anions on the basis of their domains in the diagram the cationic and anionic composition of water is donated by the diamond shaped fields which are in between two triangles in the piper trilinear diagram for finding the geochemistry of the analyzed spring water samples the piper trilinear diagram should be designed with the help of the cationic and anionic composition of the water for easily determination moharir et al 2019 the piper trilinear diagram shows that 65 of spring water samples fall into the ca2 type whereas 20 fall into the mg2 type and remaining 15 fall into the no dominant into the cation facies regarding anions 60 of samples fall into cl type 10 fall into so4 2 types and remaining 30 fall into the no dominant type of anion facies the plot on the diamond shaped trilinear diagram indicates that all the water samples fall in the field of alkaline earth exceeds alkalies 80 of water samples fall in the field of calcium chloride facies 10 fall in the field of mixed type facies and remaining 10 fall in the field of magnesium bicarbonate facies therefore pieper trilinear diagram indicates that maximum water samples belong to the cacl2 type see table 5 3 5 statistical analysis for the assessment of the relationship of wqi with surface elevation descriptive analysis has been done as per the data values of wqi is ranges between 86 and 91 therefore wqi values has been categorized into three classes i e 86 87 88 89 and 90 analysis has been done for getting relationship among these variables and tabular data is given in table 5 3 6 relationship between surface elevation and water quality index wqi spatial relationship has been drawn between the water quality index and surface elevation fig 5 surface elevation has been derived from dem and wqi has been calculated from provencher and lamontagne 1977 water quality index equation the study shows at the higher surface elevation is having values of wqi i e above 90 table no 4 whereas in lower elevations the wqi values are between 86 and 87 table 4 so it shows that at higher elevations the water quality for drinking purpose is excellent as compared to the low elevation area but at overall the water quality of the study area is excellent so as we move from a higher elevation towards the lower elevation area water quality values reduce so it shows the positive relationship between each other variables fig 6 4 conclusion this study was accomplished in a sub tropical and hilly shivalik range of jammu division northern india for the estimation and characterization of drinking water quality parameters gis based technique spatial variation is used for the analysis of the quality of water in the study area on the basis of the water quality index method the quality of water in the study area was estimated for the identification of the most efficient water quality parameter map removal sensitivity analysis was done the range of concentration maps of the study area regarding water quality parameters specifies that the five parameters exceed the maximum permissible limit prescribed for water which is used for drinking purposes by bis 2012 the five parameters which exceed are ph hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 other parameters like ec tds th cl na and k are within the maximum permissible limit prescribed for drinking water by bis 2012 ca2 ph and mg2 regulate the spatial pattern of the wqi map the hydro geochemical facies also shows that most of the samples are cacl2 type i e maximum samples fall in the field of alkaline earth exceeds alkalies the computed wqi map indicated that comparatively high quality of water in that area so the water quality is good for drinking and domestic uses according to these 11 parameters moreover ph ca2 and na are need to be monitored regularly with high accuracy as ions of ph ca2 and na are the most sensitive water quality parameters the study finds the positive correlation between wqi and surface elevation indicated the good quality of water in the elevated regions this study gives a clear image of the water quality to the residing population which depends on the spring water for the drinking purposes of that particular study area declaration of

international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics patancheru 502324 corresponding author groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting has become a prime strategy to address water security and cope with the impact of climate change especially in semi arid regions increased water availability due to groundwater augmentation and its impact on rainfed agriculture has been well documented but its impact on groundwater quality was rarely explored in this study data collected over 33 months on groundwater quality and groundwater table from a micro watershed spread over 6000 ha in the semi arid region of peninsular india were explored to assess the association between rainfall groundwater augmentation and groundwater quality it was observed that the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawals around the monitoring wells and the distance between the wells and water storage structures the results of principal component analysis pca and hierarchal clustering revealed that the spatial and temporal variations in the groundwater quality governed by hydrogeochemical processes and preferential flow recharge processes might have been affected by groundwater augmentation and withdrawal the fertilizer use in croplands as a non point source of no3 n and nh4 n in groundwater was affected by rainfall distribution the high no3 n levels in the vicinity of a burial site had indicated a possible point source of groundwater contamination about 5 76 20 and 4 of water samples were classified as poor marginal fair and good as per the guidelines for drinking water with high fluoride and nh4 n content in groundwater as a point of concern the majority of water samples were also classified as high salinity and low sodium hazard water which may cause salt build up in the poorly drained soil and affect crop water availability graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting groundwater augmentation groundwater quality principal component analysis data availability data will

harvesting affects groundwater quality through the dilution of natural levels of chemical constituents in groundwater stiefel et al 2009 the overall objective of this study is to understand spatial and temporal variation in groundwater quality and its association with rainfall and groundwater augmentation a three year data of groundwater levels and water quality collected at a monthly interval from a 6000 ha micro watershed in the semi arid region of peninsular india was used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 site specification the study area comprising six villages in the sangareddy district of telangana state covering about 6000 ha area is located at 17 50 n 78 20 e and about 30 km north west from hyderabad city of india the gently sloping land in the study area is underlain by granite rock the soil depth in the study area was ranging from shallow to very deep with characteristics of clayey texture moderate erosion and well drained the climate in this area is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 920 mm of which about 86 of rainfall is distributed from june to october through the southwest monsoon in the study area about 84 of total cultivable land was rainfed with irrigation facility was available for 9 of the area and 6 of the cultivable area was kept fallow the main sources of irrigation were bore wells and open wells open wells have an average depth of 25 m with a water table of 20 m whereas bore wells were tapping water from nearly 85 m depth with a water table of 50 m perched water table generally forms during the monsoon period in the top 10 30 m depth and helps to recharge open wells but most of the open wells do not retain water during the post monsoon period because of the depletion of the groundwater table the average area irrigated from each of the open or bore wells is about 1 1 5 ha providing 4 5 irrigations in a season an earlier study conducted by subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2001 about 5 10 km downstream side of the present study area reported the groundwater characteristics with ph electrical conductivity ec calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 nitrate no3 and fluoride f

under the godavari river basin of peninsular india the streams flowing through the study area converge into one of the tributaries of the godavari river the manjira river about 30 km of stream network spread across the study area with the width of streams ranging from 3 to 15 m and a catchment area of about 100 km2 fig 1 the locations of important rainwater structures in the stream network are shown in figs 1 and 2 before 2015 eight check dams were available in the stream network no 4 5 8 9 12 13 14 and 17 with a storage capacity of 5600 m3 during 2015 19 a total of 300 soil and water conservation structures with a total water storage capacity of 60 000 m3 were constructed in the study area among these the masonry check dams and the use of defunct open wells as groundwater recharge zone were two important measures contributing to groundwater recharge with a total storage capacity of 32 856 and 14 400 m3 respectively the construction of check dams during the study period is graphically presented in fig 2 the cumulative water storage capacity available in form of check dams in the years 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 15 849 24 379 28 051 30 292 and 38 456 m3 respectively among the four streams flowing across the project villages a higher density of rainwater harvesting capacity was established in the second stream second stream from left in fig 1 with 24 767 m3 of storage capacity along the 6000 m of the stream 2 3 monitoring the daily rainfall data was collected from an automatic weather station installed in the study area the daily rainfall data was used to estimate runoff quantity following soil conservation service curve number scs cn methodologies mishra and singh 2003 the impact of rainwater harvesting on groundwater resources was evaluated by monitoring groundwater levels and groundwater quality in the selected bore wells the bore wells selected for groundwater monitoring are shown in figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels were recorded at monthly intervals using a water level recorder model 101 water level meters by solinst the water samples were also collected from the observation wells these bore wells were primarily used for irrigating the croplands and few of them were used as the source for domestic usage the water samples were collected from april 2017 to december 2019 2 4 chemical analysis the groundwater samples were stored at 4 c temperature and analyzed within 24 h electrical conductivity ec ph and total dissolved solids tds were measured using the handheld multiparameter meter eutech cyberscan pcd 650 the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n f so4 and total hardness in the water samples were determined by nesslerization acidimetric spands turbidimetric and edta method respectively apha et al 2012 other elements including ca mg na k arsenic as cobalt co cadmium cd chromium cr and copper cu were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy u s epa 1994 with the minimum detection limits of 20 10 15 45 5 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 3 μg l 1 respectively 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 quantifying harvested rainwater a one dimensional flow domain with rainfall and overland runoff as the top boundary and deep percolation as the bottom boundary condition was assumed to estimate rainwater infiltration into the ground through the stream bed the rate of water depletion inside the check dams was observed at selected check dams to estimate average infiltration rates in the different parts of the stream network the average infiltration rate was further used to estimate the cumulative infiltration depth and total rainwater harvested in each check dam garg et al 2020 this method of estimating the harvested rainwater was only applied to check dams this method does not account for the incoming base flow from the side ward streamflow however these estimates may be considered as an indicator of overall groundwater augmentation in the study area 2 5 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchical clustering based on principal components were employed using the factominer package in r lê et al 2008 the pca has been widely used for water quality assessment which transforms a large set of correlated variables into a few uncorrelated variables called principal components chen et al 2018 eslami et al 2019 li et al 2020 marghade et al 2015 marín celestino et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 pan et al 2019 sakram et al 2022a these principal components provide information on the processes influencing groundwater chemistry in the present study location wise average values of ph ec tds na ca mg k nh4 n no3 n so4 as b and f were used for pca the analysis was done separately for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 2 5 3 classification of groundwater for irrigation purposes the united state soil laboratory ussl diagram was adopted to classify groundwater as a source for irrigation aravinthasamy et al 2020 ussl 1954 groundwater samples are classified into sixteen groups based on the salinity and sodium hazards sodium absorption ratio sar was estimated using the following equations s a r n a c a m g 2 2 5 4 water quality index for drinking purposes the groundwater quality for drinking purposes was classified by using the water quality index wqi the canadian water quality index method ccme 2001 was adopted to derive the wqi which is also adopted for developing the global water quality index rickwood and carr 2008 this method is based on the three factors and derived using the following equations w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 where f 1 is the percentage of water quality parameters that exceed the standard values f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d p a r a m e t e r s t o t a l n u m b e r o f p a r a m

marginal and poor with wqi ranges of 95 100 80 to 94 65 to 79 45 to 64 and 0 to 44 respectively the acceptable limits for drinking water as per indian standard for drinking water is 10500 2012 table 1 were used as standards for estimating the wqi 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution the groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting structures is significantly influenced by the distribution of rainfall during the season the quantity length of dry spells and heavy rainfall events the total rainfall received in the years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 1165 968 537 and 776 mm respectively with the 980 956 486 and 703 mm rainfall that occurred from june to october in all four years there was a dry spell of 15 25 days in july which coincided with a period after crop sowing transplanting the total rainfall from june to october for 2016 and 2017 was similar and above normal but the rainfall distribution in 2016 was more uniform with lesser numbers of dry spells and high rainfall events as compared to 2017 fig 3 in 2016 pre monsoon rainfall of about 145 mm was received in may which might have filled the pore space in the vadose zone and resulted in good runoff during these rainfall events about 41 mm runoff might have occurred during pre monsoon rain in may 2016 on the contrary there was no pre monsoon rainfall and the frequency of dry spells of 3 5 days period was higher in june july during 2017 which might have affected the runoff generation during these months however there were six high rainfall events five events of daily rainfall of over 50 mm and one event of over 100 mm which generated high runoff the total runoff in 2017 might be about 255 mm as compared to 242 mm in 2016 in 2018 the rainfall was 40 deficit than the annual average with a higher frequency of dry spells and only one rainfall event of over 50 mm rain in a day that was preceded and followed by dry spells of more than 10 days the total runoff might be only about 46 mm in 2019 the rainfall during june and july was only 91 mm with four dry spells of 3 5 days and two dry spells each of 13 and 26 days but the rainfall received in august september and october was 200 296 and 112 mm respectively thus the total rainfall deficit for 2019 was just 13 however due to less number of high rainfall events the estimated runoff was only 51 mm 3 2 groundwater augmentation the values of harvested rainwater through the check dams were estimated based on the observed depletion rate of water levels in the check dams garg et al 2020 the total estimated rainwater harvested through check dams during 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 172 181 37 and 78 thousand cubic meters tcm among the four streams stream 2 with a high density of rainwater harvesting structures was contributing 40 50 to the total rainwater harvested the average groundwater levels at the start of the rainy season during july 2016 june 2017 june 2018 and june 2019 were 23 7 16 9 11 7 and 18 3 m below the ground level respectively after the rainy season the average groundwater levels during the november months of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 12 3 11 0 14 2 and 18 8 m below the ground level respectively thus the total change in the average groundwater levels from the start to the end of the rainy season in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 11 4 5 9 2 5 and 0 5 m respectively the time series graph of groundwater levels observed from july 2016 to december 2019 in the observation wells is shown in fig 4 the locations of these wells are shown in figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels increased gradually or rapidly during the rainy season depending on the rainfall quantity and distribution the distributed groundwater recharge zones in form of stream networks and rainwater harvesting structures were responsible for the groundwater augmentation and increase in the groundwater levels the wells in the vicinity of these recharge zones showed a higher recovery in the water levels for example well 2 located a few meters away from the stream and about 50 m upstream side of a check dam check dam no 6 showed a high recovery in response to runoff accumulated in the check dam on the contrary well 10 was far away from the stream and surrounded by agricultural land showing a lower water table apart from rainfall wastewater from residential housing colonies and villages was released into the stream which was also contributing to groundwater recharge throughout the year the wastewater was being released in stream 1 which was accumulated in check dam 20 and 28 throughout the year depending on the discharge of wastewater the impact of wastewater flow on the groundwater levels and quality was assessed by monitoring the borewell in the vicinity of these check dams well no 7 and 8 the water levels in well 7 were higher as compared to other wells but showed a declining trend similar to overall groundwater levels during the low rainfall years the water levels gradually declined after the rainy season because of groundwater withdrawal for domestic and agricultural usage among the observation wells three wells were being used as a source for domestic consumption by villagers the well 2 3 and 6 were connected to three villages covering 1348 642 and 752 households respectively the depletion of water levels in these wells was influenced by continuous groundwater withdrawal from the wells for domestic use and the withdrawal from surrounding wells for irrigation during the growing season thus these wells showed a faster decline in water levels as compared to other wells the ten observation wells may be categorized into two groups based on a clear difference in water levels observed from nov 2017 to june 2018 the group of well 1 3 4 7 11 and 12 always showed higher water levels as compared to the group of well 2 5 6 and 10 the difference in water levels between these two groups of observation wells from nov 2017 to june 2018 was about 7 5 m the group of wells with higher water levels was associated with the less irrigated agricultural area in surrounding of these wells and the availability of water in the stream for a longer period after the rainy season in form of wastewater well 7 or return flow well 11 from the irrigated field in the upstream area on the other hand the group of wells with lower water levels was associated with the comparatively higher irrigated agricultural area in surrounding of these wells and or groundwater withdrawal for domestic usage dangar et al 2021 overall the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels observed in observation wells were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawal around the observation wells and the distances between the wells and water storage streams or rainwater harvesting structures 3 3 groundwater quality 3 3 1 ph the groundwater from the study area was near neutral to alkaline with ph values ranging from 6 7 to 9 3 table 1 the highest ph value of 9 3 was observed only once during the sampling campaign the ph values were in agreement with the range of ph values observed in the earlier studies conducted in this region and the groundwater characteristics from granite rock geology adimalla and taloor 2020 subba rao et al 2021 the average ph value during the sampling campaign of 33 months was 7 57 with a variation of 5 only 3 of samples were recorded with ph values above the permissible limit of 8 5 for the drinking water the higher ph values might be caused by high concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates subba rao et al 2021 3 3 2 electrical conductivity electrical conductivity values indicated the ionic strength of groundwater which is majorly influenced by the types and concentrations of ions in the water the ec values were ranging from 0 31 to 1 99 ms cm 1 with average of 1 23 ms cm 1 and 24 variation table 1 the ec values of 94 of samples were greater than 0 7 ms cm 1 and may require slight to moderate restriction for irrigation usage to avoid the effects of salinity on crop water availability ayers 1977 a seasonal trend was observed in the ec values that the values decreased during the rainy season and gradually increased during the post rainy season this indicated that the fresh rainwater with less load of salts had augmented the groundwater through an artificial recharge zone and diluted the salt contents in the groundwater garcía menéndez et al 2021 3 3 3 total dissolved solids the tds is a collective representation of dissolved solids such as carbonates bicarbonates chlorides calcium sodium magnesium potassium phosphate etc total dissolved solids in groundwater samples were ranging from 211 to 1592 mg l 1 with an average of 871 and 25 variation table 1 the tds values of 94 of samples were above acceptable limits for the drinking water 500 mg l 1 but within the permissible limit of 2000 mg l 1 the guidelines for irrigation water quality state that water with tds values between 450 and 2000 mg l 1 need to be used with slight to moderate restrictions to avoid the impact of salinity on crop water availability ayers 1977 about 5 of samples had tds values less than 450 mg l 1 which occurred during the rainy season of 2017 and 2019 on the other hand out off 98 samples with tds values greater than 1000 mg l 1 61 samples were collected during the period with deficit rainfall jan 2018 to june 2019 this suggested that groundwater augmentation affected by the rainfall quantity and distribution had also influenced the groundwater quality raicy and elango 2020 sakram et al 2022b 3 3 4 sodium absorption ratio the sar values in combination with the ec values are used for assessing the potential hazard of irrigation water toward the infiltration rate of the soil ayers 1977 the sar values were ranging from 0 14 to 10 7 with an average of 2 38 and 73 variation table 1 the higher sar values were consistently found in only one observation well well 11 which were associated with higher na levels in water samples excessive irrigation with the water having higher sar values and lower salinity values might affect soil infiltration rate in the present study 19 out of 31 samples collected from well 11 had sar values greater than 6 and ec values less than 1 9 ms cm 1 indicating that the groundwater at this location may be used for irrigation with slight to moderate restriction the ec and sar values plotted on the ussl diagram are presented in fig 5 the majority of samples were under the region of high salinity higher ec values water and low sodium hazard lower sar values this indicates that excessive use of groundwater for irrigation may result in slat built up in the soil and affect crop water availability but in the study area the proportion of rainfed agriculture was higher and irrigated agriculture was a fraction of the cultivated area moreover any salt built up in the soil due to irrigation may get leached down during the rainy season cucci et al 2016 sharma and rao 1998 3 3 5 ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen the ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n concentration in the water samples was ranging from 0 05 to 3 7 mg l 1 with an average of 0 8 mg l 1 the nh4 n levels in 75 of samples were above the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 for drinking water the nitrate nitrogen no3 n content in groundwater samples was in the range of 0 03 13 1 mg l 1 with an average value of 4 8 mg l 1 and 66 variation during the sampling campaign table 1 the 10 water samples were having no3 n content above the permissible limits for the drinking water fig 6 shows the time series graph of average no3 n content in the groundwater and the daily rainfall during the early period of the rainy season of 2017 june month the average no3 n concentration in the groundwater was reduced to less than 1 6 mg l 1 indicating that the groundwater augmentation through rainwater and low fertilizer application during this period had diluted the no3 n content in the groundwater after july 2017 more than half of the sampling locations showed no3 n levels greater than 5 mg l 1 indicating possible n leaching from chemical n fertilizer along with the continued groundwater recharge during the crop growing season subba rao et al 2021 increased concentration of no3 n in drinking water can cause several health hazards such as blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia fan and steinberg 1996 fewtrell 2004 sadeq et al 2008 and gastric cancer barrett et al 1998 sandor et al 2001 subba rao 2021 van loon et al 1998 similar to 2017 the decline in the no3 n levels was observed during the early period of the rainy season of 2018 but the no3 n levels continued to decline during the crop growing season the deficit rainfall during 2018 reduced the runoff and the groundwater recharge thus even if the fertilizers might have been applied to the crops the deficit moisture regime had affected the nutrient uptake by crop and or transport to groundwater in 2019 a gradual increase in no3 n levels was observed in all the sampling locations which might be associated with n fertilizer application and good rainfall distribution thus it was clear that n fertilizer as a non point source and groundwater recharge processes as a transport mechanism were important factors influencing the fluctuations of no3 n concentration in the groundwater murphy et al 2021 nolan et al 2003 pool et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 3 3 6 major ions the average concentrations of na ca mg k so4 and f in groundwater samples were 94 58 52 4 1 52 and 1 56 mg l 1 respectively table 1 during all the sampling events the concentration of na was higher followed by ca mg so4 and k similar composition of ions in the groundwater were observed in the earlier studies conducted in this region reddy et al 2012 the groundwater samples from well 11 consistently showed high levels of na with an average of 192 mg l 1 during the sampling campaign and 50 of the samples from the well 11 had na levels greater than the acceptable limit 200 mg l 1 in the case of mg and ca about 90 and 28 of samples were above the acceptable limit together mg and ca affect the hardness of the water the total hardness of 86 of water samples was also above acceptable limits for drinking purposes the hardness values of the groundwater were ranging from 65 to 708 mg l 1 with an average of 349 mg l 1 the so4 concentration in groundwater was ranging from 2 to 119 mg l 1 table 1 which is far less than the acceptable limit of 200 mg l 1 for drinking water the average f concentration in groundwater was 1 56 mg l 1 ranging from 1 05 to 2 69 mg l 1 with 17 variation the f levels in all the water samples were above the acceptable limit for drinking water and about 57 of samples were having f levels above the permissible limits the earlier studies conducted in this region also reported higher levels of f in the groundwaters adimalla and qian 2020 adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 narsimha and sudarshan 2018 intake of drinking water with high f content leads to dental and skeletal fluorosis srivastava and flora 2020 the main source of f in the study area might be weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from granite rock due to water rock interaction adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 among the heavy metals concentrations of co cd cr and cu were most of the time below the detection limit the arsenic concentration in 20 samples was above the acceptable limit but less than the permissible limits for the drinking water with an average concentration of 0 01 mg l 1 3 3 7 water quality index the water quality index was derived based on the water quality parameters that failed to comply with standard acceptable limits for drinking purposes the water quality parameters considered while deriving the wqi were ph ca f mg nh4 n no3 n na so4 tds and total hardness the wqi values ranged from 38 poor to 91 good with an average of 56 and a variation of 16 table 1 the concentrations of ca f total hardness tds and nh4 n in the groundwater were above acceptable limits more frequently than the other quality parameters moreover the concentration of f and nh4 n in the groundwater were above the permissible limits for drinking water among these ca and f were geogenic but the source for nh4 n might be nitrogenous fertilizers often urea in croplands about 5 76 20 and 4 of water samples were classified as poor marginal fair and good as per the guidelines the water filtration system needs to be focused on suitable defluoridation techniques kimambo et al 2019 and the removal of nh4 n to mitigate the health related issues arising from using groundwater as a drinking water source in the study area 3 4 principle component analysis the pca results indicated that the first three principal components pc were explaining 74 77 and 76 variance in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2017 hardness mg ca no3 n na ph and k showed a higher correlation with the first principal component pc1 tds so4 and nh4 n had a higher correlation with the second principal component pc2 and as and f were having a higher correlation with third principal component pc3 in 2018 ca and na remained part of pc1 whereas hardness mg and no3 n indicated a higher correlation with pc2 along with tds so4 and nh4 n in 2019 both na and ca were having a higher correlation with pc2 whereas hardness tds mg so4 and nh4 n showed a higher influence on groundwater quality with a higher correlation with pc1 the biplots of pc1 and pc2 for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 7 the results of the hierarchal clustering analysis for grouping the observation wells into three groups indicated that the hardness tds na so4 and no3 n were the significant variables for clustering the wells among these the hardness and tds were prominently influencing the clustering analysis for all three years a cluster including well 1 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 was associated with low tds water group 1 whereas a cluster including well 2 3 4 11 and 12 was associated with high tds water group 2 interestingly the wells from group 1 and group 2 were also separated geographically by 5 km among the wells in group 1 well 5 7 8 and 9 were in the vicinity of streams carrying wastewater further a third cluster was identified based on the variation in no3 n in 2017 so4 in 2018 and na in 2019 in 2017 the average no3 n concentration in well 6 was 10 1 mg l 1 which was two to four times more no3 n concentration in the other groups in 2018 the high tds group group 2 got split into two groups based on so4 concentration the well 4 11 and 12 had low so4 concentrations as compared to the well 2 and 3 in 2019 well 11 was showing very high na concentration and was identified as a different water type than group 2 the changes in the values of groundwater quality in the study area were prominently influenced by hydrogeochemical processes adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 marghade et al 2015 reddy et al 2012 further the higher loading of no3 n and nh4 n was also indicative of anthropogenic activities influencing the groundwater quality the fertilizer use in croplands is a major non point source of n in groundwater but further spatial variation in no3 n and nh4 n content might be associated with a point source of groundwater contamination or a rapid transport of dissolved fertilizer to the groundwater for example the higher no3 n content in well 6 might be attributed to the leaching of chemical fertilizers from agricultural fields as a non point source of contamination and n leaching from a burial site size 1000 m2 located at a distance of 50 m from the observation well as a point source of contamination turajo et al 2019 the higher nh4 n levels in well 2 might be associated with the preferential flow recharge process through the vadose zone as the groundwater table also showed high recovery in response to runoff accumulation in the check dam the preferential flow process is one of the important recharge processes in fractured granite rock geology in the study region sukhija et al 2003 the adverse impact of wastewater disposal in the stream on the groundwater quality was not visible in terms of no3 n the wastewater accumulated in check dams 28 and 29 might have acted as a natural wetland as a favorable system for bioremediation of incoming wastewater this bioremediation process might have reduced a load of contaminants from wastewater and avoided contamination of groundwater sources kayranli et al 2010 apart from these factors the nutrient loading through the rainwater itself was also an influencing factor for groundwater quality an earlier study conducted by murthy et al 2000 near to present study area indicated that the average rainfall every year contributes about 580 kg of nitrogen 240 kg of potassium 490 kg of sulfur 170 kg of calcium 170 kg of magnesium and 1050 kg of sodium to each square kilometer land area 4 conclusions a study was conducted for over 33 months to understand the association between rainfall groundwater augmentation and groundwater quality data were collected at monthly intervals between april 2017 and december 2019 from 12 observation wells situated over a 6000 ha micro watershed area in the semi arid region of peninsular india the following are the key conclusions derived from the study the time series data of groundwater levels revealed that the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawals around the observation wells and the distances between the observation wells and water storage structures the rainwater harvesting structures constructed near the groundwater wells may provide more value in terms of water availability the statistical analysis of data on groundwater quality revealed that the hydrogeochemical processes and preferential flow recharge processes influenced the spatial variation in the groundwater quality the temporal variation in the water quality parameters also suggested that a dilution effect resulting from groundwater augmentation might have improved water quality whereas the use of chemical fertilizer during the cropping season might deteriorate the water quality in other words the extent of groundwater contamination resulting from either point or non point sources may be restrained by groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting in the study area about 76 of water samples were classified as of marginal quality for drinking purposes with high levels of f and nh4 n as issues of concern thus a suitable water treatment technique focusing on defluoridation and removal of nh4 n needs to be adopted for using groundwater sources for drinking purposes in the case of groundwater use for irrigation the majority of water samples were also classified as high salinity and low sodium hazard water which may cause salt build up in the poorly drained soil and affect crop water availability

international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics patancheru 502324 corresponding author groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting has become a prime strategy to address water security and cope with the impact of climate change especially in semi arid regions increased water availability due to groundwater augmentation and its impact on rainfed agriculture has been well documented but its impact on groundwater quality was rarely explored in this study data collected over 33 months on groundwater quality and groundwater table from a micro watershed spread over 6000 ha in the semi arid region of peninsular india were explored to assess the association between rainfall groundwater augmentation and groundwater quality it was observed that the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawals around the monitoring wells and the distance between the wells and water storage structures the results of principal component analysis pca and hierarchal clustering revealed that the spatial and temporal variations in the groundwater quality governed by hydrogeochemical processes and preferential flow recharge processes might have been affected by groundwater augmentation and withdrawal the fertilizer use in croplands as a non point source of no3 n and nh4 n in groundwater was affected by rainfall distribution the high no3 n levels in the vicinity of a burial site had indicated a possible point source of groundwater contamination about 5 76 20 and 4 of water samples were classified as poor marginal fair and good as per the guidelines for drinking water with high fluoride and nh4 n content in groundwater as a point of concern the majority of water samples were also classified as high salinity and low sodium hazard water which may cause salt build up in the poorly drained soil and affect crop water availability graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting groundwater augmentation groundwater quality principal component analysis data availability data will

harvesting affects groundwater quality through the dilution of natural levels of chemical constituents in groundwater stiefel et al 2009 the overall objective of this study is to understand spatial and temporal variation in groundwater quality and its association with rainfall and groundwater augmentation a three year data of groundwater levels and water quality collected at a monthly interval from a 6000 ha micro watershed in the semi arid region of peninsular india was used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 site specification the study area comprising six villages in the sangareddy district of telangana state covering about 6000 ha area is located at 17 50 n 78 20 e and about 30 km north west from hyderabad city of india the gently sloping land in the study area is underlain by granite rock the soil depth in the study area was ranging from shallow to very deep with characteristics of clayey texture moderate erosion and well drained the climate in this area is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 920 mm of which about 86 of rainfall is distributed from june to october through the southwest monsoon in the study area about 84 of total cultivable land was rainfed with irrigation facility was available for 9 of the area and 6 of the cultivable area was kept fallow the main sources of irrigation were bore wells and open wells open wells have an average depth of 25 m with a water table of 20 m whereas bore wells were tapping water from nearly 85 m depth with a water table of 50 m perched water table generally forms during the monsoon period in the top 10 30 m depth and helps to recharge open wells but most of the open wells do not retain water during the post monsoon period because of the depletion of the groundwater table the average area irrigated from each of the open or bore wells is about 1 1 5 ha providing 4 5 irrigations in a season an earlier study conducted by subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2001 about 5 10 km downstream side of the present study area reported the groundwater characteristics with ph electrical conductivity ec calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 nitrate no3 and fluoride f values of 7 9 1575 μs 64 mg l 1 24 mg l 1 200 mg l 1 2 mg l 1 60 mg l 1 150 mg l 1 1 mg l 1 and 2 25 mg l 1 respectively 2 2 groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting the study area falls under the godavari river basin of peninsular india the streams flowing through the study area converge into one of the tributaries of the godavari river the manjira river about 30 km of stream network spread across the study area with the width of streams ranging from 3 to 15 m and a catchment area of about 100 km2 fig 1 the locations of important rainwater structures in the stream network are shown in figs 1 and 2 before 2015 eight check dams were available in the stream network no 4 5 8 9 12 13 14 and 17 with a storage capacity of 5600 m3 during 2015 19 a total of 300 soil and water conservation structures with a total water storage capacity of 60 000 m3 were constructed in the study area among these the masonry check dams and the use of defunct open wells as groundwater recharge zone were two important measures contributing to groundwater recharge with a total storage capacity of 32 856 and 14 400 m3 respectively the construction of check dams during the study period is graphically presented in fig 2 the cumulative water storage capacity available in form of check dams in the years 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 15 849 24 379 28 051 30 292 and 38 456 m3 respectively among the four streams flowing across the project villages a higher density of rainwater harvesting capacity was established in the second stream second stream from left in fig 1 with 24 767 m3 of storage capacity along the 6000 m of the stream 2 3 monitoring the daily rainfall data was collected from an automatic weather station installed in the study area the daily rainfall data was used to estimate runoff quantity following soil conservation service curve number scs cn methodologies mishra and singh 2003 the impact of rainwater harvesting on groundwater resources was evaluated by monitoring groundwater levels and groundwater quality in the selected bore wells the bore wells selected for groundwater monitoring are shown in figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels were recorded at monthly intervals using a water level recorder model 101 water level meters by solinst the water samples were also collected from the observation wells these bore wells were primarily used for irrigating the croplands and few of them were used as the source for domestic usage the water samples were collected from april 2017 to december 2019 2 4 chemical analysis the groundwater samples were stored at 4 c temperature and analyzed within 24 h electrical conductivity ec ph and total dissolved solids tds were measured using the handheld multiparameter meter eutech cyberscan pcd 650 the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n f so4 and total hardness in the water samples were determined by nesslerization acidimetric spands turbidimetric and edta method respectively apha et al 2012 other elements including ca mg na k arsenic as cobalt co cadmium cd chromium cr and copper cu were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy u s epa 1994 with the minimum detection limits of 20 10 15 45 5 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 3 μg l 1 respectively 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 quantifying harvested rainwater a one dimensional flow domain with rainfall and overland runoff as the top boundary and deep percolation as the bottom boundary condition was assumed to estimate rainwater infiltration into the ground through the stream bed the rate of water depletion inside the check dams was observed at selected check dams to estimate average infiltration rates in the different parts of the stream network the average infiltration rate was further used to estimate the cumulative infiltration depth and total rainwater harvested in each check dam garg et al 2020 this method of estimating the harvested rainwater was only applied to check dams this method does not account for the incoming base flow from the side ward streamflow however these estimates may be considered as an indicator of overall groundwater augmentation in the study area 2 5 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchical clustering based on principal components were employed using the factominer package in r lê et al 2008 the pca has been widely used for water quality assessment which transforms a large set of correlated variables into a few uncorrelated variables called principal components chen et al 2018 eslami et al 2019 li et al 2020 marghade et al 2015 marín celestino et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 pan et al 2019 sakram et al 2022a these principal components provide information on the processes influencing groundwater chemistry in the present study location wise average values of ph ec tds na ca mg k nh4 n no3 n so4 as b and f were used for pca the analysis was done separately for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 2 5 3 classification of groundwater for irrigation purposes the united state soil laboratory ussl diagram was adopted to classify groundwater as a source for irrigation aravinthasamy et al 2020 ussl 1954 groundwater samples are classified into sixteen groups based on the salinity and sodium hazards sodium absorption ratio sar was estimated using the following equations s a r n a c a m g 2 2 5 4 water quality index for drinking purposes the groundwater quality for drinking purposes was classified by using the water quality index wqi the canadian water quality index method ccme 2001 was adopted to derive the wqi which is also adopted for developing the global water quality index rickwood and carr 2008 this method is based on the three factors and derived using the following equations w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 where f 1 is the percentage of water quality parameters that exceed the standard values f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d p a r a m e t e r s t o t a l n u m b e r o f p a r a m

marginal and poor with wqi ranges of 95 100 80 to 94 65 to 79 45 to 64 and 0 to 44 respectively the acceptable limits for drinking water as per indian standard for drinking water is 10500 2012 table 1 were used as standards for estimating the wqi 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution the groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting structures is significantly influenced by the distribution of rainfall during the season the quantity length of dry spells and heavy rainfall events the total rainfall received in the years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 1165 968 537 and 776 mm respectively with the 980 956 486 and 703 mm rainfall that occurred from june to october in all four years there was a dry spell of 15 25 days in july which coincided with a period after crop sowing transplanting the total rainfall from june to october for 2016 and 2017 was similar and above normal but the rainfall distribution in 2016 was more uniform with lesser numbers of dry spells and high rainfall events as compared to 2017 fig 3 in 2016 pre monsoon rainfall of about 145 mm was received in may which might have filled the pore space in the vadose zone and resulted in good runoff during these rainfall events about 41 mm runoff might have occurred during pre monsoon rain in may 2016 on the contrary there was no pre monsoon rainfall and the frequency of dry spells of 3 5 days period was higher in june july during 2017 which might have affected the runoff generation during these months however there were six high rainfall events five events of daily rainfall of over 50 mm and one event of over 100 mm which generated high runoff the total runoff in 2017 might be about 255 mm as compared to 242 mm in 2016 in 2018 the rainfall was 40 deficit than the annual average with a higher frequency of dry spells and only one rainfall event of over 50 mm rain in a day that was preceded and followed by dry spells of more than 10 days the total runoff might be only about 46 mm in 2019 the rainfall during june and july was only 91 mm with four dry spells of 3 5 days and two dry spells each of 13 and 26 days but the rainfall received in august september and october was 200 296 and 112 mm respectively thus the total rainfall deficit for 2019 was just 13 however due to less number of high rainfall events the estimated runoff was only 51 mm 3 2 groundwater augmentation the values of harvested rainwater through the check dams were estimated based on the observed depletion rate of water levels in the check dams garg et al 2020 the total estimated rainwater harvested through check dams during 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 172 181 37 and 78 thousand cubic meters tcm among the four streams stream 2 with a high density of rainwater harvesting structures was contributing 40 50 to the total rainwater harvested the average groundwater levels at the start of the rainy season during july 2016 june 2017 june 2018 and june 2019 were 23 7 16 9 11 7 and 18 3 m below the ground level respectively after the rainy season the average groundwater levels during the november months of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were 12 3 11 0 14 2 and 18 8 m below the ground level respectively thus the total change in the average groundwater levels from the start to the end of the rainy season in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 was 11 4 5 9 2 5 and 0 5 m respectively the time series graph of groundwater levels observed from july 2016 to december 2019 in the observation wells is shown in fig 4 the locations of these wells are shown in figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels increased gradually or rapidly during the rainy season depending on the rainfall quantity and distribution the distributed groundwater recharge zones in form of stream networks and rainwater harvesting structures were responsible for the groundwater augmentation and increase in the groundwater levels the wells in the vicinity of these recharge zones showed a higher recovery in the water levels for example well 2 located a few meters away from the stream and about 50 m upstream side of a check dam check dam no 6 showed a high recovery in response to runoff accumulated in the check dam on the contrary well 10 was far away from the stream and surrounded by agricultural land showing a lower water table apart from rainfall wastewater from residential housing colonies and villages was released into the stream which was also contributing to groundwater recharge throughout the year the wastewater was being released in stream 1 which was accumulated in check dam 20 and 28 throughout the year depending on the discharge of wastewater the impact of wastewater flow on the groundwater levels and quality was assessed by monitoring the borewell in the vicinity of these check dams well no 7 and 8 the water levels in well 7 were higher as compared to other wells but showed a declining trend similar to overall groundwater levels during the low rainfall years the water levels gradually declined after the rainy season because of groundwater withdrawal for domestic and agricultural usage among the observation wells three wells were being used as a source for domestic consumption by villagers the well 2 3 and 6 were connected to three villages covering 1348 642 and 752 households respectively the depletion of water levels in these wells was influenced by continuous groundwater withdrawal from the wells for domestic use and the withdrawal from surrounding wells for irrigation during the growing season thus these wells showed a faster decline in water levels as compared to other wells the ten observation wells may be categorized into two groups based on a clear difference in water levels observed from nov 2017 to june 2018 the group of well 1 3 4 7 11 and 12 always showed higher water levels as compared to the group of well 2 5 6 and 10 the difference in water levels between these two groups of observation wells from nov 2017 to june 2018 was about 7 5 m the group of wells with higher water levels was associated with the less irrigated agricultural area in surrounding of these wells and the availability of water in the stream for a longer period after the rainy season in form of wastewater well 7 or return flow well 11 from the irrigated field in the upstream area on the other hand the group of wells with lower water levels was associated with the comparatively higher irrigated agricultural area in surrounding of these wells and or groundwater withdrawal for domestic usage dangar et al 2021 overall the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels observed in observation wells were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawal around the observation wells and the distances between the wells and water storage streams or rainwater harvesting structures 3 3 groundwater quality 3 3 1 ph the groundwater from the study area was near neutral to alkaline with ph values ranging from 6 7 to 9 3 table 1 the highest ph value of 9 3 was observed only once during the sampling campaign the ph values were in agreement with the range of ph values observed in the earlier studies conducted in this region and the groundwater characteristics from granite rock geology adimalla and taloor 2020 subba rao et al 2021 the average ph value during the sampling campaign of 33 months was 7 57 with a variation of 5 only 3 of samples were recorded with ph values above the permissible limit of 8 5 for the drinking water the higher ph values might be caused by high concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates subba rao et al 2021 3 3 2 electrical conductivity electrical conductivity values indicated the ionic strength of groundwater which is majorly influenced by the types and concentrations of ions in the water the ec values were ranging from 0 31 to 1 99 ms cm 1 with average of 1 23 ms cm 1 and 24 variation table 1 the ec values of 94 of samples were greater than 0 7 ms cm 1 and may require slight to moderate restriction for irrigation usage to avoid the effects of salinity on crop water availability ayers 1977 a seasonal trend was observed in the ec values that the values decreased during the rainy season and gradually increased during the post rainy season this indicated that the fresh rainwater with less load of salts had augmented the groundwater through an artificial recharge zone and diluted the salt contents in the groundwater garcía menéndez et al 2021 3 3 3 total dissolved solids the tds is a collective representation of dissolved solids such as carbonates bicarbonates chlorides calcium sodium magnesium potassium phosphate etc total dissolved solids in groundwater samples were ranging from 211 to 1592 mg l 1 with an average of 871 and 25 variation table 1 the tds values of 94 of samples were above acceptable limits for the drinking water 500 mg l 1 but within the permissible limit of 2000 mg l 1 the guidelines for irrigation water quality state that water with tds values between 450 and 2000 mg l 1 need to be used with slight to moderate restrictions to avoid the impact of salinity on crop water availability ayers 1977 about 5 of samples had tds values less than 450 mg l 1 which occurred during the rainy season of 2017 and 2019 on the other hand out off 98 samples with tds values greater than 1000 mg l 1 61 samples were collected during the period with deficit rainfall jan 2018 to june 2019 this suggested that groundwater augmentation affected by the rainfall quantity and distribution had also influenced the groundwater quality raicy and elango 2020 sakram et al 2022b 3 3 4 sodium absorption ratio the sar values in combination with the ec values are used for assessing the potential hazard of irrigation water toward the infiltration rate of the soil ayers 1977 the sar values were ranging from 0 14 to 10 7 with an average of 2 38 and 73 variation table 1 the higher sar values were consistently found in only one observation well well 11 which were associated with higher na levels in water samples excessive irrigation with the water having higher sar values and lower salinity values might affect soil infiltration rate in the present study 19 out of 31 samples collected from well 11 had sar values greater than 6 and ec values less than 1 9 ms cm 1 indicating that the groundwater at this location may be used for irrigation with slight to moderate restriction the ec and sar values plotted on the ussl diagram are presented in fig 5 the majority of samples were under the region of high salinity higher ec values water and low sodium hazard lower sar values this indicates that excessive use of groundwater for irrigation may result in slat built up in the soil and affect crop water availability but in the study area the proportion of rainfed agriculture was higher and irrigated agriculture was a fraction of the cultivated area moreover any salt built up in the soil due to irrigation may get leached down during the rainy season cucci et al 2016 sharma and rao 1998 3 3 5 ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen the ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n concentration in the water samples was ranging from 0 05 to 3 7 mg l 1 with an average of 0 8 mg l 1 the nh4 n levels in 75 of samples were above the permissible limit of 0 5 mg l 1 for drinking water the nitrate nitrogen no3 n content in groundwater samples was in the range of 0 03 13 1 mg l 1 with an average value of 4 8 mg l 1 and 66 variation during the sampling campaign table 1 the 10 water samples were having no3 n content above the permissible limits for the drinking water fig 6 shows the time series graph of average no3 n content in the groundwater and the daily rainfall during the early period of the rainy season of 2017 june month the average no3 n concentration in the groundwater was reduced to less than 1 6 mg l 1 indicating that the groundwater augmentation through rainwater and low fertilizer application during this period had diluted the no3 n content in the groundwater after july 2017 more than half of the sampling locations showed no3 n levels greater than 5 mg l 1 indicating possible n leaching from chemical n fertilizer along with the continued groundwater recharge during the crop growing season subba rao et al 2021 increased concentration of no3 n in drinking water can cause several health hazards such as blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia fan and steinberg 1996 fewtrell 2004 sadeq et al 2008 and gastric cancer barrett et al 1998 sandor et al 2001 subba rao 2021 van loon et al 1998 similar to 2017 the decline in the no3 n levels was observed during the early period of the rainy season of 2018 but the no3 n levels continued to decline during the crop growing season the deficit rainfall during 2018 reduced the runoff and the groundwater recharge thus even if the fertilizers might have been applied to the crops the deficit moisture regime had affected the nutrient uptake by crop and or transport to groundwater in 2019 a gradual increase in no3 n levels was observed in all the sampling locations which might be associated with n fertilizer application and good rainfall distribution thus it was clear that n fertilizer as a non point source and groundwater recharge processes as a transport mechanism were important factors influencing the fluctuations of no3 n concentration in the groundwater murphy et al 2021 nolan et al 2003 pool et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 3 3 6 major ions the average concentrations of na ca mg k so4 and f in groundwater samples were 94 58 52 4 1 52 and 1 56 mg l 1 respectively table 1 during all the sampling events the concentration of na was higher followed by ca mg so4 and k similar composition of ions in the groundwater were observed in the earlier studies conducted in this region reddy et al 2012 the groundwater samples from well 11 consistently showed high levels of na with an average of 192 mg l 1 during the sampling campaign and 50 of the samples from the well 11 had na levels greater than the acceptable limit 200 mg l 1 in the case of mg and ca about 90 and 28 of samples were above the acceptable limit together mg and ca affect the hardness of the water the total hardness of 86 of water samples was also above acceptable limits for drinking purposes the hardness values of the groundwater were ranging from 65 to 708 mg l 1 with an average of 349 mg l 1 the so4 concentration in groundwater was ranging from 2 to 119 mg l 1 table 1 which is far less than the acceptable limit of 200 mg l 1 for drinking water the average f concentration in groundwater was 1 56 mg l 1 ranging from 1 05 to 2 69 mg l 1 with 17 variation the f levels in all the water samples were above the acceptable limit for drinking water and about 57 of samples were having f levels above the permissible limits the earlier studies conducted in this region also reported higher levels of f in the groundwaters adimalla and qian 2020 adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 narsimha and sudarshan 2018 intake of drinking water with high f content leads to dental and skeletal fluorosis srivastava and flora 2020 the main source of f in the study area might be weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from granite rock due to water rock interaction adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 among the heavy metals concentrations of co cd cr and cu were most of the time below the detection limit the arsenic concentration in 20 samples was above the acceptable limit but less than the permissible limits for the drinking water with an average concentration of 0 01 mg l 1 3 3 7 water quality index the water quality index was derived based on the water quality parameters that failed to comply with standard acceptable limits for drinking purposes the water quality parameters considered while deriving the wqi were ph ca f mg nh4 n no3 n na so4 tds and total hardness the wqi values ranged from 38 poor to 91 good with an average of 56 and a variation of 16 table 1 the concentrations of ca f total hardness tds and nh4 n in the groundwater were above acceptable limits more frequently than the other quality parameters moreover the concentration of f and nh4 n in the groundwater were above the permissible limits for drinking water among these ca and f were geogenic but the source for nh4 n might be nitrogenous fertilizers often urea in croplands about 5 76 20 and 4 of water samples were classified as poor marginal fair and good as per the guidelines the water filtration system needs to be focused on suitable defluoridation techniques kimambo et al 2019 and the removal of nh4 n to mitigate the health related issues arising from using groundwater as a drinking water source in the study area 3 4 principle component analysis the pca results indicated that the first three principal components pc were explaining 74 77 and 76 variance in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2017 hardness mg ca no3 n na ph and k showed a higher correlation with the first principal component pc1 tds so4 and nh4 n had a higher correlation with the second principal component pc2 and as and f were having a higher correlation with third principal component pc3 in 2018 ca and na remained part of pc1 whereas hardness mg and no3 n indicated a higher correlation with pc2 along with tds so4 and nh4 n in 2019 both na and ca were having a higher correlation with pc2 whereas hardness tds mg so4 and nh4 n showed a higher influence on groundwater quality with a higher correlation with pc1 the biplots of pc1 and pc2 for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 7 the results of the hierarchal clustering analysis for grouping the observation wells into three groups indicated that the hardness tds na so4 and no3 n were the significant variables for clustering the wells among these the hardness and tds were prominently influencing the clustering analysis for all three years a cluster including well 1 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 was associated with low tds water group 1 whereas a cluster including well 2 3 4 11 and 12 was associated with high tds water group 2 interestingly the wells from group 1 and group 2 were also separated geographically by 5 km among the wells in group 1 well 5 7 8 and 9 were in the vicinity of streams carrying wastewater further a third cluster was identified based on the variation in no3 n in 2017 so4 in 2018 and na in 2019 in 2017 the average no3 n concentration in well 6 was 10 1 mg l 1 which was two to four times more no3 n concentration in the other groups in 2018 the high tds group group 2 got split into two groups based on so4 concentration the well 4 11 and 12 had low so4 concentrations as compared to the well 2 and 3 in 2019 well 11 was showing very high na concentration and was identified as a different water type than group 2 the changes in the values of groundwater quality in the study area were prominently influenced by hydrogeochemical processes adimalla and venkatayogi 2016 marghade et al 2015 reddy et al 2012 further the higher loading of no3 n and nh4 n was also indicative of anthropogenic activities influencing the groundwater quality the fertilizer use in croplands is a major non point source of n in groundwater but further spatial variation in no3 n and nh4 n content might be associated with a point source of groundwater contamination or a rapid transport of dissolved fertilizer to the groundwater for example the higher no3 n content in well 6 might be attributed to the leaching of chemical fertilizers from agricultural fields as a non point source of contamination and n leaching from a burial site size 1000 m2 located at a distance of 50 m from the observation well as a point source of contamination turajo et al 2019 the higher nh4 n levels in well 2 might be associated with the preferential flow recharge process through the vadose zone as the groundwater table also showed high recovery in response to runoff accumulation in the check dam the preferential flow process is one of the important recharge processes in fractured granite rock geology in the study region sukhija et al 2003 the adverse impact of wastewater disposal in the stream on the groundwater quality was not visible in terms of no3 n the wastewater accumulated in check dams 28 and 29 might have acted as a natural wetland as a favorable system for bioremediation of incoming wastewater this bioremediation process might have reduced a load of contaminants from wastewater and avoided contamination of groundwater sources kayranli et al 2010 apart from these factors the nutrient loading through the rainwater itself was also an influencing factor for groundwater quality an earlier study conducted by murthy et al 2000 near to present study area indicated that the average rainfall every year contributes about 580 kg of nitrogen 240 kg of potassium 490 kg of sulfur 170 kg of calcium 170 kg of magnesium and 1050 kg of sodium to each square kilometer land area 4 conclusions a study was conducted for over 33 months to understand the association between rainfall groundwater augmentation and groundwater quality data were collected at monthly intervals between april 2017 and december 2019 from 12 observation wells situated over a 6000 ha micro watershed area in the semi arid region of peninsular india the following are the key conclusions derived from the study the time series data of groundwater levels revealed that the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures rainfall distribution during the rainy season groundwater withdrawals around the observation wells and the distances between the observation wells and water storage structures the rainwater harvesting structures constructed near the groundwater wells may provide more value in terms of water availability the statistical analysis of data on groundwater quality revealed that the hydrogeochemical processes and preferential flow recharge processes influenced the spatial variation in the groundwater quality the temporal variation in the water quality parameters also suggested that a dilution effect resulting from groundwater augmentation might have improved water quality whereas the use of chemical fertilizer during the cropping season might deteriorate the water quality in other words the extent of groundwater contamination resulting from either point or non point sources may be restrained by groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting in the study area about 76 of water samples were classified as of marginal quality for drinking purposes with high levels of f and nh4 n as issues of concern thus a suitable water treatment technique focusing on defluoridation and removal of nh4 n needs to be adopted for using groundwater sources for drinking purposes in the case of groundwater use for irrigation the majority of water samples were also classified as high salinity and low sodium hazard water which may cause salt build up in the poorly drained soil and affect crop water availability

11778,the toxicity of arsenic and its hazards to the human body are well known and its timely accurate and cost effective detection in water and foodstuffs and other environmental matrices is highly essential herein we present a simple and easy method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide ceria rgo ceo2 nanocomposite and its use for low level detection of as iii in water up to 0 93 μg l the presence of ceo2 on rgo surface is attributed to the enhanced electron transfer rate the material characterization was performed with different analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy sem raman spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd infrared spectroscopy ftir and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the electrochemical behaviour of the rgo ceo2 modified screen printed electrodes spe has been investigated by using cyclic voltammetry cv and differential pulse stripping voltammetry dpsv a highly linear response with a correlation coefficient of 0 9986 is achieved with a detection limit of 0 39 μg l finally the sensor was also tested with real world groundwater samples collected from the arsenic contaminated areas and acceptable recoveries were observed in the range of 85 95 as compared to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms analysis the electroanalytical performances of rgo ceo2 modified spe confirm that the as prepared sensor can be used for practical applications owing to its high sensitivity good selectivity robustness low cost high reproducibility reusability and ease of high scale production graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater arsenic detection electrochemical sensors paper based sensors disposable electrodes screen printed electrodes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater arsenic contamination is one of the most severe problems faced by many countries worldwide arsenic exists in the environment in various forms of which inorganic forms are much more toxic than organic forms jomova et al 2011 arsenic is present in groundwater sources as as iii and as v as iii reacts with the enzymes in human metabolism and is 50 times more toxic than as v cohen et al 2006 due to severe health hazards caused by the ingestion of arsenic the world health organization who has reduced the maximum permissible limit to 10 μg l srivastava and sharma 2013 identification of sources of arsenic and its removal is the big challenge posed to water utility management organizations and researchers it is extremely important to selectively detect arsenic in the environmental sources to identify the sources of contamination and to improve the efficiency of the existing treatment processes several standard analytical techniques are available for the analysis of arsenic in trace levels which includes high end sophisticated instruments proch and niedzielski 2020 although these methods are selective and sensitive for the toxicant they require high operating and maintenance costs as well as intricate sample preparation procedures besides instrumental techniques are not suitable for routine and on field analysis as samples need to be collected and transported to the location where they should be analysed the possibility of a significant error in the collection preservation and transportation of samples warrant the need for onsite environmental monitoring particularly for the field survey of water sources various techniques such as colourimetry fluorimetry and electrochemistry are explored for the onsite detection of contaminants electroanalytical techniques are an attractive alternative for the onsite monitoring of pollutants the electrochemical sensing systems are sensitive and selective towards electroactive species easy to operate compact fast portable and inexpensive palchetti and mascini 2008 zhu et al 2015 cyclic and stripping voltammetry are proven techniques for the detection of trace inorganic metals electrochemically the three electrodes cell can be replaced with spe which are prepared by coating electro conductive and insulating ink on a plastic or ceramic substrate carbon screen printed electrodes are popular due to their sensitivity ease of use and cost effectiveness wang and musameh 2004 these electrodes can be further modified with the appropriate characteristic receptors to obtain desired selectivity and sensitivity graphene is a highly researched material due to its excellent properties such as high mechanical strength electrical conductivity and thermal stability wu et al 2013 it is explored in many areas starting from catalysis a abdala 2014 batteries pumera 2011 supercapacitors paquin et al 2015 to nanosensor and nanoelectronics adhikari and chowdhury 2012 variety of metals are used for as iii detection which include gold dai et al 2004 silver simm et al 2005 platinum sanllorente méndez et al 2009 and mercury holak 1980 gold is the most widely studied material due to its ability to form an intermetallic compound with as iii which offers good sensitivity but it has limitations such as high cost and the interference caused by cu ii ions during detection babar et al 2019 though nobel metals are widely used there is a gap in the research which prevents its use in the infield analysis of as iii the research questions such as stability sensitivity shelf life interference of other ions and practical applicability of these materials in field are yet to be addressed researchers are trying to improve the performance by replacing gold with other materials various metal oxide nanoparticles are also employed for detection of as iii including tio2 mnox aunps modified glassy carbon electrodes cobalt oxide nanoparticles etc zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2014 li et al 2020 these sensors are also having several limitations owing to their cost narrow potential window and large background current arsenic adsorption capability plays an important role in electrochemical determination the research goal is to develop a material with better adsorptive properties using commonly found materials and using simple and green methods of synthesis metal oxides like mno2 zro2 fe2o3 and ceo2 signifies a class of materials having good adsorptive properties yu et al 2015 sawana et al 2017 guo et al 2015 cui et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2016 use of cerium dioxide is widely known due to its chemically stable nature also it is non toxic with reasonable cost and is widely available pulido reyes et al 2015 though ceria is rarely used in electrochemical applications due to its poor electrical conductivity it can be improved by different methods such as doping and size control to nano and micrometer etc herein we had used a combination of rgo and ceo2 for the detection of as iii in water an increase in conductivity and adsorptive properties of rgo ceo2 nanocomposite indicate a synergistic effect in comparison to the individual materials we had discussed a very simple and green method of synthesis of rgo metal oxide nanocomposite using a microwave method the combination of disposable screen printed electrodes fabricated in a laboratory and rgo ceo2 nanocomposite is first time used for the detection of as iii in real water samples 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used for the experiments were of analytical grade as iii standard stock solution was purchased from inorganic ventures inc va graphite fine powder and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 were obtained from thermo fischer india pvt ltd india sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl phosphoric acid h2po4 potassium permanganate kmno₄ cerium nitrate ce no3 3 potassium chloride kcl ethanol c2h5oh were purchased from merck millipore germany deionized water with a resistivity of 18 mω was obtained from the milliq water system with qpod element and was used throughout the experiments 2 2 synthesis of graphene oxide graphene oxide go was prepared as described by using the improved hummers method chen et al 2013 briefly concentrated h2so4 and h3po4 were mixed in 9 1 proportion 3 g graphite powder was added and 18 g of kmno4 is gradually added to the mixture with continuous stirring after heating for 12 h at 90 c ice cold water and 3 ml of h2o2 were added to the mixture which resulted in a yellow coloured solution the synthesized material was obtained by centrifugation followed by washing with 200 ml each of water 30 hcl and ethanol and drying in an oven the go was microwaved at 400 c in a microwave furnace for 15min to obtain rgo 2 3 fabrication of spe spe was fabricated using the traditional screen printing method the design of electrodes was exposed on the screen made from cloth and then conductive carbon and silver ink were printed using a squeegee reference electrode and counter electrodes consist of ag agcl and carbon material respectively sheets with printed electrodes were dried in an oven at 120 c as prepared electrodes were cut as per defined sizes and used for modifications after cleaning the cleaning of the electrode was done using 1 1 ethanol water solution the electrode was then washed with milliq water repeatedly this will remove the dust and dirt from the electrodes which leads to uninterrupted flow of electrons the electrodes are then used for modification with receptor material 2 4 synthesis of rgo ceo2 composite and electrode preparation the composite was prepared by using a microwave furnace iranmanesh et al 2020 go and ce no3 2 h2o were grounded in mortar and pestle in the ratio of 2 1 and the mixture was kept in a microwave furnace at 400 c for 15 min as obtained rgo ceo2 composite was then used for electrode modification 1 mg of rgo ceo2 composite is dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol and sonicated for 1 h this suspension is then dropcasted on the spe which was earlier cleaned by water and ethanol the spe is then dried in an oven at 50 c and used for the detection of as iii in water 2 5 analytical instruments used for characterisation of rgo ceo2 composite the surface topography of synthesized rgo ceo2 composite was investigated using scanning electron microscopy carl zeiss evo 18 germany x ray diffraction analysis was performed on an x ray diffractometer of make rigaku miniflex ph measurements were performed using a benchtop ph meter of make eutech instruments raman spectrum was recorded by renishaw invia reflex spectrometer ir spectra was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of make bruker 2 6 electrochemical analysis multichannel potentiostat parstat 1000 with versastudio software was used for the detection of as iii in water samples with techniques such as cv and dpsv electrochemical measurements were conducted with an unmodified and modified spe the redox reaction happening in the solution was investigated by running cv at a scan rate of 0 1 v s using a redox couple of 0 5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 0 1 m potassium nitrate the electrochemical performance for arsenic analysis was studied using dpsv in the deposition step target ion was electrodeposited onto the working electrode by applying a reduction potential and stripping was done in the range of 0 to 0 8 v with a potential increment of 4 mv and scan rate of 20 mv s 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the morphological characterization of the synthesized composite was performed using sem fig 1 shows the sem images of the rgo and rgo ceo2 composite the rgo shows sheet like morphology and some small aggregated particles were observed on the sheets in the rgo ceo2 composite which could be attributed to ceo2 nanoparticles the shape and size of particles are very small which could not be detected using sem fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of graphite go rgo ceo2 and rgo ceo2 composites the xrd spectra were measured in the range of 2θ from 10 to 90 the sharp peak observed at 26 61 in graphite spectra confirmed the presence of well arranged layer structure of graphite whereas this peak was shifted to 10 in spectra of go which confirms the complete oxidation of graphite to go a broader peak was observed in rgo at 23 76 which confirms the reduction of go elimination of oxygen containing functional group and formation of π conjugated structure of graphene the broader peak shape of rgo suggests randomly arranged crystal phase less intense peak was observed in go and rgo at 2θ 42 61 with 001 orientation attributed to the turbostratic band of disordered carbon materials strong and sharp diffraction peaks observed in the rgo ceo2 composite indicates good crystallinity of ceo2 in the composite the presence of peaks at 28 55 33 081 7 47 56 33 59 08 69 40 76 69 79 06 and 88 41 are attributed to 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 2 2 2 4 0 0 3 3 1 4 2 0 and 4 2 2 planes of ceo2 jcpds no 34 0394 respectively any other additional peaks were not observed which confirms that impurities were not present in the composite raman spectra of the graphite go and rgo were obtained to study defects and ordered disordered structures of materials synthesized raman spectra of rgo synthesized by microwave method at 400 c were obtained and compared with the graphite and go as shown in fig 3 a typical d and g band can be seen at 1351 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 respectively the 2d band was observed at 2711 cm 1 which represents the second order disorder of the d band also a small peak was observed at 2937 cm 1 representing the d g band the id ig ratio for rgo 1 017 is lower than go 1 301 indicating a more ordered structure and a lower number of defects also the reduction of the intensity of 2d and d g band in the spectrum confirmed the formation of rgo by reduction of go by the microwave assisted method the ftir spectra of go rgo ceo2 and rgo ceo2 composite is presented in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of go shows intense peaks at 3414 2344 1721 1624 1578 1383 1061cm 1 corresponding to o h groups c h stretching stretching vibrations of carboxylic acid groups vibrations due to remaining sp2 hybridized c group after oxidation graphitic carbon and c o alkoxy stretching vibrations respectively in the ftir spectra of rgo and rgo ceo2 the band at 1721 disappeared indicating reduction of go and removal of oxygen containing functional groups which confirms the formation rgo using microwave synthesis method the ceo2 spectrum shows band at 554 and 1637 cm 1 attributed to the ce o vibrations and the bending mode of the hydroxyl groups the band at 1637 1379 and 1121 in rgo ceo2 spectrum represents the characteristic bands of rgo and c oh the formation of rgo ceo2 is illustrated by the band obtained at 511 cm 1 attributed to the ce o vibrations dezfuli et al 2015 the shift in the peak position was also observed which may be due to the interaction of ceo2 with rgo the electrochemical behaviour of the spe modified with the rgo ceo2 composite was investigated using cv in 0 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 and 1 m kno3 solution fig si1 the pair of the well defined anodic and cathodic peaks were observed due to the redox reaction happening in fe cn 6 3 4 solution the enhancement in peak current is observed in rgo ceo2 modified spe compared to unmodified spe the cv were recorded at different scan rates in which peak potentials remained constant while peak current increases correspondingly to the square root of the scan rate this may be because the rgo ceo2 provides active sites on the electrode surface which increases the rate of charge transfer and facilitate the redox reaction the electroactive surface areas of these electrodes are calculated using the randles sevcik equation chatti et al 2019 1 i p a 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 1 2 v 1 2 c 2 i p a 2 99 10 5 n α n 1 2 a d 1 2 v 1 2 3 e p a e 0 r t α n f ln r t k 0 α n f r t α n f ln

constant 8 314 j mol k t temperature t f faraday constant 96 480 c mol the graph was plotted between square root of scan rate and anodic peak current the slope of line was used in equation 1 for the calculation of electroactive surface area equations 2 and 3 were followed for calculation of area of unmodified spe owing to its poor reversible properties of redox reaction the areas of unmodified spe go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spes were calculated to be 0 005 0 0758 0 0801 0 0893 and 0 1455 cm2 respectively the results suggested that the electroactive surface area of the electrode significantly increases after modification with rgo ceo2 which enhances the electrochemical activity for as iii detection the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is an important technique for investigating the resistance and electrical conductivity of the electrode material the typical eis plots consist of a semicircle in high frequency region and a line in low frequency region higher the diameter of semicircle higher are the values of charge transfer resistance indicating poor electrical conductivity the eis measurements were made in 1 m kno3 containing 0 5 m fe cn 6 3 4 in a frequency range of 100 000 to 0 01 hz fig si2 it can be seen that the obtained spectra of spe and go shows bigger semicircle diameter as compared to other materials after combining rgo with ceo2 the semicircle portion significantly disappeared indicating excellent electrical conductivity of rgo ceo2 nanocomposite the obtained results are in accordance with the calculated electroactive surface area the cyclic voltammetry response for unmodified go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe was recorded in 0 5 m h2so4 with as iii and without as iii a reduction peak was observed in 1000 μg l as iii solution in the potential range of 0 5 to 0 8 v as shown in fig 5 electrochemical detection of as iii was performed using differential pulse stripping voltammetry dpsv technique and the response of the electrodes for unmodified go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe were recorded as shown in fig 6 a very small stripping peak was appeared for as iii in the unmodified spe whereas peaks in the potential window of 0 5 to 0 8 v were obtained for go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe respectively the peak area for rgo modified spe is more than the go modified spe similarly rgo ceo2 composite modified spe shows improvement in the peak area compared to rgo and ceo2 modified spe also the response for as iii increases with an increase in concentration and no peak is observed in the blank electrolyte without asiii the mechanism of as iii detection can be explained as a during the deposition step the as iii present in the solution is accumulated and adsorbed on the surface of the electrode as as0 rgo provides high conductivity and more sites for adsorption on the surface and ceo2 increases the selectivity for the as iii b during the stripping step the accumulated as0 is oxidized and stripped off from the electrode generating a stripping current this current is then recorded which is proportional to as iii concentration in the sample preconcentration step as iii 3e image 1 as stripping step as image 2 as iii 3e 3 2 optimisation of the experimental variables experimental conditions such as deposition potential deposition time and volume of modifier were optimized for the detection of as iii using rgo ceo2 modified spe electrolyte plays an important role in the extraction and detection of target ion the response for the different electrolytes such as h2so4 hcl and hno3 were examined fig si3 the concentration of the selected electrolyte is then again optimized for the better response as shown in fig si4 and 0 5 m h2so4 is chosen as the best working electrolyte for the system the stripping current is dependent on the concentration of modifiers available on the electrode the modified spe was prepared by using the rgo ceo2 composite suspended in ethanol using it as a modifier for which different volume of suspension was drop casted on the electrode the effect of change in volume of modifier is studied fig si5 the maximum current is obtained with 2 μl volume of modifier and after that drop in current is observed which may be due to the thicker layer of modifier which decreases the electrical connectivity the deposition time is the crucial factor for the sensitive detection of as iii the sensitivity can be increased by increasing the time of deposition which also helps in low level detection of ions the results show an increase in stripping current with a time of deposition and after 180s the signal is levelled off which may be due to saturation of the surface fig si6 the deposition potential affects the detection efficiency hence optimized deposition potential is investigated fig si7 as the deposition potential reach 0 4 v the maximum stripping current is observed the reduction in peak current before 0 4 v maybe because of incomplete reduction of as iii to as0 and after 0 4 v hydrogen generation results in a reduction of peak current the bubbles of hydrogen cover the surface of the electrodes and hinder the reduction of as iii which ultimately reduces the peak current therefore the optimized deposition potential is found to be 0 4 v taking into account all the parameters 0 4 v 180s and 2 μl are selected as optimized deposition potential deposition time and volume of modifier respectively in 0 5 m h2so4 these optimized conditions were used for the detection of as iii in different concentration ranges and the five point calibration curve is plotted based on peak area as shown in fig 7 the graph shows good linearity in the range of 10 500 μg l with a correlation coefficient of 0 9986 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq for the detection of as iii is calculated to be 0 3 μg l and 0 93 μg l respectively using the formulas given in equations 4 and 5 4 l o d 3 s m 5 l o q 10 s m where s is standard deviation of blank samples and m is the slope of linear curve the obtained values of lod and loq are well below the guidelines prescribed by epa who and bis for arsenic in drinking water i e 10 μg l the different materials used in the literature for detection of as iii are presented in table 1 the most significant advancement of the present work is in terms of wide linear dynamic range and high sensitivity over other reported materials the linearity range of rgo ceo2 is in the range of 10 500 μg l most of the as iii present in india is well within this limit whereas other materials reported in the literature are having very limited linear range such as 1 20 or 10 80 μg l moreover rgo ceo2 exhibit high sensitivity as compared to the other reported materials the lod of rgo ceo2 is 0 39 μg l whereas other reported materials are well above this level comparison of data in table and all the above data concludes that the developed sensor is highly sensitive for as iii detection and can be a good alternative for infield detection of as iii see table 2 the material used for the modification of spe is redox active and metal oxides tend to be unstable in a low ph environment hence the stability of the electrodes needs to be assessed for their infield and practical use multiple electrochemical detections of as iii were performed to study the reproducibility of electrode preparation and modification the electrodes prepared in different batches show excellent repeatability with a standard deviation of 0 4 as shown in fig 8 for 100 ppb as iii concentration the electrodes are prepared and consequently reused for analysis which shows good reusability up to 5 cycles as depicted in fig 9 the shelf life and stability of the electrode was also examined as presented in fig 10 the stripping response is decreased only by 5 after storage for 10days 3 3 selectivity evaluation the selectivity of any sensor is the most important criterion for the implementation of a sensor in the field analysis varieties of other ions are present in the real groundwater along with as iii which can hinder the detection performance by co accumulating with the targeted ions as per the literature available so far copper cu ii ion forms cu as intermetallic compound demonstrating the major interference in as iii detection dai and compton 2006 thus the effect of the presence of cu ii ion was investigated along with the other interfering heavy metals such as cadmium cobalt chromium iron manganese magnesium nickel lead and other ions such as calcium sodium nitrates nitrites phosphates and sulphates as iii concentration was kept as 50 μg l and other ions are present in 5 times higher concentrations it was observed that the presence of cu ii ions shows a very limited effect on electrochemical performance the concentration of cu ii ions varies in the water around the globe but it is present in very low levels as the median values obtained in the usa and the united kingdom are 10 μg l and 6 μg l respectively florio 1997 therefore the sensor shows good anti interference activity for cu ii and other ions as presented in fig 11 in india iron fe ii is also observed in most arsenic contaminated water and the sensor must selectively detect arsenic in presence of fe ii ions the results of the interference study confirm that fe ii is not having any effect on as iii detection by rgo ceo2 spe the interference study reveals that rgo ceo2 spe shows good selectivity for detection of as iii in water in presence of other co existing ions 3 4 groundwater sample analysis the practical application of the rgo ceo2 composite is assessed by detection of as iii in groundwater samples collected from the arsenic affected area of rajnandgaon district of chhattisgarh india patel et al 2017 most of the population residing in the villages of rajanandgaon is dependent on groundwater sources for drinking and other purposes in kaudikasa village

11778,the toxicity of arsenic and its hazards to the human body are well known and its timely accurate and cost effective detection in water and foodstuffs and other environmental matrices is highly essential herein we present a simple and easy method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide ceria rgo ceo2 nanocomposite and its use for low level detection of as iii in water up to 0 93 μg l the

introduction groundwater arsenic contamination is one of the most severe problems faced by many countries worldwide arsenic exists in the environment in various forms of which inorganic forms are much more toxic than organic forms jomova et al 2011 arsenic is present in groundwater sources as as iii and as v as iii reacts with the enzymes in human metabolism and is 50 times more toxic than as v cohen et al 2006 due to severe health hazards caused by the ingestion of arsenic the world health organization who has reduced the maximum permissible limit to 10 μg l srivastava and sharma 2013 identification of sources of arsenic and its removal is the big challenge posed to water utility management organizations and researchers it is extremely important to selectively detect arsenic in the environmental sources to identify the sources of contamination and to improve the efficiency of the existing treatment processes several standard analytical techniques are available for the analysis of arsenic in trace levels which includes high end sophisticated instruments proch and niedzielski 2020 although these methods are selective and sensitive for the toxicant they require high operating and maintenance costs as well as intricate sample preparation procedures besides instrumental techniques are not suitable for routine and on field analysis as samples need to be collected and transported to the location where they should be analysed the possibility of a significant error in the collection preservation and transportation of samples warrant the need for onsite environmental monitoring particularly for the field survey of water sources various techniques such as colourimetry fluorimetry and electrochemistry are explored for the onsite detection of contaminants electroanalytical techniques are an attractive alternative for the onsite monitoring of pollutants the electrochemical sensing systems are sensitive and selective towards electroactive species easy to operate compact fast portable and inexpensive palchetti and mascini 2008 zhu et al 2015 cyclic and stripping voltammetry are proven techniques for the detection of trace inorganic metals electrochemically the three electrodes cell can be replaced with spe which are prepared by coating electro conductive and insulating ink on a plastic or ceramic substrate carbon screen printed electrodes are popular due to their sensitivity ease of use and cost effectiveness wang and musameh 2004 these electrodes can be further modified with the appropriate characteristic receptors to obtain desired selectivity and sensitivity graphene is a highly researched material due to its excellent properties such as high mechanical strength electrical conductivity and thermal stability wu et al 2013 it is explored in many areas starting from catalysis a abdala 2014 batteries pumera 2011 supercapacitors paquin et al 2015 to nanosensor and nanoelectronics adhikari and chowdhury 2012 variety of metals are used for as iii detection which include gold dai et al 2004 silver simm et al 2005 platinum sanllorente méndez et al 2009 and mercury holak 1980 gold is the most widely studied material due to its ability to form an intermetallic compound with as iii which offers good sensitivity but it has limitations such as high cost and the interference caused by cu ii ions during detection babar et al 2019 though nobel metals are widely used there is a gap in the research which prevents its use in the infield analysis of as iii the research questions such as stability sensitivity shelf life interference of other ions and practical applicability of these materials in field are yet to be addressed researchers are trying to improve the performance by replacing gold with other materials various metal oxide nanoparticles are also employed for detection of as iii including tio2 mnox aunps modified glassy carbon electrodes cobalt oxide nanoparticles etc zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2014 li et al 2020 these sensors are also having several limitations owing to their cost narrow potential window and large background current arsenic adsorption capability plays an important role in electrochemical determination the research goal is to develop a material with better adsorptive properties using commonly found materials and using simple and green methods of synthesis metal oxides like mno2 zro2 fe2o3 and ceo2 signifies a class of materials having good adsorptive properties yu et al 2015 sawana et al 2017 guo et al 2015 cui et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2016 use of cerium dioxide is widely known due to its chemically stable nature also it is non toxic with reasonable cost and is widely available pulido reyes et al 2015 though ceria is rarely used in electrochemical applications due to its poor electrical conductivity it can be improved by different methods such as doping and size control to nano and micrometer etc herein we had used a combination of rgo and ceo2 for the detection of as iii in water an increase in conductivity and adsorptive properties of rgo ceo2 nanocomposite indicate a synergistic effect in comparison to the individual materials we had discussed a very simple and green method of synthesis of rgo metal oxide nanocomposite using a microwave method the combination of disposable screen printed electrodes fabricated in a laboratory and rgo ceo2 nanocomposite is first time used for the detection of as iii in real water samples 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used for the experiments were of analytical grade as iii standard stock solution was purchased from inorganic ventures inc va graphite fine powder and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 were obtained from thermo fischer india pvt ltd india sulphuric acid h2so4

a resistivity of 18 mω was obtained from the milliq water system with qpod element and was used throughout the experiments 2 2 synthesis of graphene oxide graphene oxide go was prepared as described by using the improved hummers method chen et al 2013 briefly concentrated h2so4 and h3po4 were mixed in 9 1 proportion 3 g graphite powder was added and 18 g of kmno4 is gradually added to the mixture with continuous stirring after heating for 12 h at 90 c ice cold water and 3 ml of h2o2 were added to the mixture which resulted in a yellow coloured solution the synthesized material was obtained by centrifugation followed by washing with 200 ml each of water 30 hcl and ethanol and drying in an oven the go was microwaved at 400 c in a microwave furnace for 15min to obtain rgo 2 3 fabrication of spe spe was fabricated using the traditional screen printing method the design of electrodes was exposed on the screen made from cloth and then conductive carbon and silver ink were printed using a squeegee reference electrode and counter electrodes consist of ag agcl and carbon material respectively sheets with printed electrodes were dried in an oven at 120 c as prepared electrodes were cut as per defined sizes and used for modifications after cleaning the cleaning of the electrode was done using 1 1 ethanol water solution the electrode was then washed with milliq water repeatedly this will remove the dust and dirt from the electrodes which leads to uninterrupted flow of electrons the electrodes are then used for modification with receptor material 2 4 synthesis of rgo ceo2 composite and electrode preparation the composite was prepared by using a microwave furnace iranmanesh et al 2020 go and ce no3 2 h2o were grounded in mortar and pestle in the ratio of 2 1 and the mixture was kept in a microwave furnace at 400 c for 15 min as obtained rgo ceo2 composite was then used for electrode modification 1 mg of rgo ceo2 composite is dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol and sonicated for 1 h this suspension is then dropcasted on the spe which was earlier cleaned by water and ethanol the spe is then dried in an oven at 50 c and used for the detection of as iii in water 2 5 analytical instruments used for characterisation of rgo ceo2 composite the surface topography of synthesized rgo ceo2 composite was investigated using scanning electron microscopy carl zeiss evo 18 germany x ray diffraction analysis was performed on an x ray diffractometer of make rigaku miniflex ph measurements were performed using a benchtop ph meter of make eutech instruments raman spectrum was recorded by renishaw invia reflex spectrometer ir spectra was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of make bruker 2 6 electrochemical analysis multichannel potentiostat parstat 1000 with versastudio software was used for the detection of as iii in water samples with techniques such as cv and dpsv electrochemical measurements were conducted with an unmodified and modified spe the redox reaction happening in the solution was investigated by running cv at a scan rate of 0 1 v s using a redox couple of 0 5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 0 1 m potassium nitrate the electrochemical performance for arsenic analysis was studied using dpsv in the deposition step target ion was electrodeposited onto the working electrode by applying a reduction potential and stripping was done in the range of 0 to 0 8 v with a potential increment of 4 mv and scan rate of 20 mv s 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the morphological characterization of the synthesized composite was performed using sem fig 1 shows the sem images of the rgo and rgo ceo2 composite the rgo shows sheet like morphology and some small aggregated particles were observed on the sheets in the rgo ceo2 composite which could be attributed to ceo2 nanoparticles the shape and size of particles are very small which could not be detected using sem fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of graphite go rgo ceo2 and rgo ceo2 composites the xrd spectra were measured in the range of 2θ from 10 to 90 the sharp peak observed at 26 61 in graphite spectra confirmed the presence of well arranged layer structure of graphite whereas this peak was shifted to 10 in spectra of go which confirms the complete oxidation of graphite to go a broader peak was observed in rgo at 23 76 which confirms the reduction of go elimination of oxygen containing functional group and formation of π conjugated structure of graphene the broader peak shape of rgo suggests randomly arranged crystal phase less intense peak was observed in go and rgo at 2θ 42 61 with 001 orientation attributed to the turbostratic band of disordered carbon materials strong and sharp diffraction peaks observed in the rgo ceo2 composite indicates good crystallinity of ceo2 in the composite the presence of peaks at 28 55 33 081 7 47 56 33 59 08 69 40 76 69 79 06 and 88 41 are attributed to 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 2 2 2 4 0 0 3 3 1 4 2 0 and 4 2 2 planes of ceo2 jcpds no 34 0394 respectively any other additional peaks were not observed which confirms that impurities were not present in the composite raman spectra of the graphite go and rgo were obtained to study defects and ordered disordered structures of materials synthesized raman spectra of rgo synthesized by microwave method at 400 c were obtained and compared with the graphite and go as shown in fig 3 a typical d and g band can be seen at 1351 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 respectively the 2d band was observed at 2711 cm 1 which represents the second order disorder of the d band also a small peak was observed at 2937 cm 1 representing the d g band the id ig ratio for rgo 1 017 is lower than go 1 301 indicating a more ordered structure and a lower number of defects also the reduction of the intensity of 2d and d g band in the spectrum confirmed the formation of rgo by reduction of go by the microwave assisted method the ftir spectra of go rgo ceo2 and rgo ceo2 composite is presented in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of go shows intense peaks at 3414 2344 1721 1624 1578 1383 1061cm 1 corresponding to o h groups c h stretching stretching vibrations of carboxylic acid groups vibrations due to remaining sp2 hybridized c group after oxidation graphitic carbon and c o alkoxy stretching vibrations respectively in the ftir spectra of rgo and rgo ceo2 the band at 1721 disappeared indicating reduction of go and removal of oxygen containing functional groups which confirms the formation rgo using microwave synthesis method the ceo2 spectrum shows band at 554 and 1637 cm 1 attributed to the ce o vibrations and the bending mode of the hydroxyl groups the band at 1637 1379 and 1121 in rgo ceo2 spectrum represents the characteristic bands of rgo and c oh the formation of rgo ceo2 is illustrated by the band obtained at 511 cm 1 attributed to the ce o vibrations dezfuli et al 2015 the shift in the peak position was also observed which may be due to the interaction of ceo2 with rgo the electrochemical behaviour of the spe modified with the rgo ceo2 composite was investigated using cv in 0 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 and 1 m kno3 solution fig si1 the pair of the well defined anodic and cathodic peaks were observed due to the redox reaction happening in fe cn 6 3 4 solution the enhancement in peak current is observed in rgo ceo2 modified spe compared to unmodified spe the cv were recorded at different scan rates in which peak potentials remained constant while peak current increases correspondingly to the square root of the scan rate this may be because the rgo ceo2 provides active sites on the electrode surface which increases the rate of charge transfer and facilitate the redox reaction the electroactive surface areas of these electrodes are calculated using the randles sevcik equation chatti et al 2019 1 i p a 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 1 2 v 1 2 c 2 i p a 2 99 10 5 n α n 1 2 a d 1 2 v 1 2 3 e p a e 0 r t α n f ln r t k 0 α n f r t α n f ln

constant 8 314 j mol k t temperature t f faraday constant 96 480 c mol the graph was plotted between square root of scan rate and anodic peak current the slope of line was used in equation 1 for the calculation of electroactive surface area equations 2 and 3 were followed for calculation of area of unmodified spe owing to its poor reversible properties of redox reaction the areas of unmodified spe go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spes were calculated to be 0 005 0 0758 0 0801 0 0893 and 0 1455 cm2 respectively the results suggested that the electroactive surface area of the electrode significantly increases after modification with rgo ceo2 which enhances the electrochemical activity for as iii detection the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is an important technique for investigating the resistance and electrical conductivity of the electrode material the typical eis plots consist of a semicircle in high frequency region and a line in low frequency region higher the diameter of semicircle higher are the values of charge transfer resistance indicating poor electrical conductivity the eis measurements were made in 1 m kno3 containing 0 5 m fe cn 6 3 4 in a frequency range of 100 000 to 0 01 hz fig si2 it can be seen that the obtained spectra of spe and go shows bigger semicircle diameter as compared to other materials after combining rgo with ceo2 the semicircle portion significantly disappeared indicating excellent electrical conductivity of rgo ceo2 nanocomposite the obtained results are in accordance with the calculated electroactive surface area the cyclic voltammetry response for unmodified go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe was recorded in 0 5 m h2so4 with as iii and without as iii a reduction peak was observed in 1000 μg l as iii solution in the potential range of 0 5 to 0 8 v as shown in fig 5 electrochemical detection of as iii was performed using differential pulse stripping voltammetry dpsv technique and the response of the electrodes for unmodified go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe were recorded as shown in fig 6 a very small stripping peak was appeared for as iii in the unmodified spe whereas peaks in the potential window of 0 5 to 0 8 v were obtained for go ceo2 rgo and rgo ceo2 modified spe respectively the peak area for rgo modified spe is more than the go modified spe similarly rgo ceo2 composite modified spe shows improvement in the peak area compared to rgo and ceo2 modified spe also the response for as iii increases with an increase in concentration and no peak is observed in the blank

the five point calibration curve is plotted based on peak area as shown in fig 7 the graph shows good linearity in the range of 10 500 μg l with a correlation coefficient of 0 9986 the limit of

11779,traditional basin type solar stills are not as popular due to their lower productivity but a number of ways have been developed globally to increase their production capacity this article demonstrates an overview of the recent studies aimed at improving the productivities and the effective functioning of conventional solar stills in order to have a better insight of the thermal performance the studies focused on evaluating the thermodynamic efficiencies of solar stills have also been reviewed and found that active solar distillation has strong potential in enhancing the performance characteristics of basin type systems it was observed that enormous efforts made by various researchers in understanding and improving the thermal characteristics of solar stills for better output have been majorly examined in hotter and arid regions and solar stills for colder regions need an attention too in this context the proposed work attempts to carry out an experimental study to assess the effect of lower ambient conditions on performance characteristics of an active solar in an indian cold hilly location the observations from the study showed that the effective daily output of the active solar still was as high as twice the daily distillate output produced by the conventional passive still the thermodynamic efficiencies of the active system were also evaluated further during different sunny days the variation in average exergy and energy efficiencies of the active system ranged from 14 86 to 16 18 and 1 95 2 41 respectively due to the prevailing storing effect the nocturnal productivity of solar still was increased at deeper water levels the study also helped to conclude that the exergy destruction in solar still is highly influenced by low ambient temperatures and in future effective design optimization studies can be carried out to gain the benefits through minimized energy exergy losses graphical abstract image 1 keywords exergy

introduction water security and energy security pose the most crucial challenges for humankind in achieving sustainable development oceans of our planet contain 97 of the surface water which is not readily available for drinking purposes goyal and arora 2022 major portion of the remaining 3 fresh water is stored in the form of snow and glaciers and only 0 5 0 6 of the total surface water is available for human usage in the form of flowing rivers and stationary reservoirs dams wells etc gude 2017 however the contaminants waste arising from industrial agricultural and human activities deteriorate the quality of the available potable water and thus fresh water scarcity poses a great hindrance in sustainable development of many areas of the world huang et al 2021 the sustainable development goal sdg 6 was adopted by united nations under the agenda un2030 to achieve global sustainable development aimed at ensuring access of clean water and sanitation to all however the rising global water demand stands as a major challenge to un s policy agenda there has been a tremendous rise in demand for water resources with rapidly increasing population as statistics show addition of more than 80 million to the global population count every year sohani et al 2021 worldmeter website as reported by united nation environmental programme by the year 2030 almost 50 of the world will have to undergo severe water crisis and the global demand for water will surpass the supply by 40 united nations environment programme approximately 1 7 billion people residing around river basins have more water intake than the recharge rates as per a report by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco nearly 2 2 billion people around the world does not have access to potable water resources unicef and who 2019 salehi 2022 and approximately 2 6 million people die every year because of poor sanitation arunkumar et al 2022 india being a developing country also faces water shortage issues present scenario in india depicts that nearly 600 million people struggle with high to extreme water crisis emile et al 2022 jadeja et al 2022 many rural areas in india do not have access to piped clean drinking water facility and it has been estimated that 40 of indian population will face severe potable water shortage issues by the year 2030 thus it becomes necessary to tackle future water shortages which can be achieved either by conserving the potable water or by converting the salty brackish water of oceans to a drinkable form there are several techniques through which water can be purified distillation is one such technique that can be utilized for converting the saline water into consumable form the most frequently used distillation methods shatat et al 2013 feria díaz et al 2021 such as multi effect distillation med reverse osmosis ro cogeneration electrodialysis multistage flash distillation msfd humidification and dehumidification processes and vapor compression vc are dependent on unconventional sources of energy fossil fuels for their operation fossil fuels are prone to extinction and their burning causes co2 emissions in the environment which makes it uneconomical and hazardous to use fossil fuels as energy sources to overcome these problems renewable energy sources have transpired as a strong alternative one such alternative is the solar energy based distillation technique which is considered as an economic environment friendly and easy way to acquire potable water solar distillation is achieved with the help of solar stills these solar stills work on the principle of evaporation and condensation of water as insolation is received by glass cover of a solar still basin water gets heated and evaporation occurs the salts and minerals present in water do not evaporate with it and when these desalinated vapors come in contact with a cold surface condensation takes place this collected condensate is free from salts and can be used for domestic purposes modified solar stills with a provision of external thermal energy source perform much better than the simple and conventional stills these modified solar stills are popularly termed as active solar stills ass while traditional solar stills which do not have provision for additional thermal energy sources are called passive solar stills pss lea et al 2021 researchers have adopted various techniques with the objective of ameliorating the productivity of singular slope stills such as improving the design enhancing the absorptivity or the collection surface area of the basin lowering the temperature of condensing covers using reflectors etc this paper presents a two fold study comprising of literature review of various methods adopted to improve the output of sss along their thermodynamic efficiencies and a case study based on the literature survey the performance output of an active and similar sized pss has been compared for a cold climatic indian zone for easier comprehension of the active distillation system the active system was exposed to outdoor field testing and the effect on the variation in water levels on thermodynamic efficiencies has also been quantified the paper consists of seven sections section 1 comprises of a short introduction on solar distillation followed by literature survey of previous studies on the major productivity enhancement techniques along with their theoretical energy and exergy efficiencies section 2 of this paper presents a case study on active solar still along with the specifications of experimental set up and the methodology adopted to accomplish the study section 3 describes the relations and formulae used for determination of thermodynamic efficiencies section 4 of this paper comprises of results obtained after the successful accomplishment of experiments followed by cost investigation in section 5 section 6 comprises of the conclusions derived from the work and section 7 describes future scope of the study 1 1 state of the art review of the methods employed to enhance the productivity of basin type solar stills although solar distillation is one of the cleanest and cheapest technology to produce distil water the low productivity of simple ss has ceased its acceptance as a commercially viable device the productivity of basin type ss is influenced by several climatic meteorological design and operational characteristics as shown in fig 1 the meteorological parameters are uncontrollable and the improvement in the productivity can only be achieved by improving the design and operational characteristics 1 1 1 reflectors the solar powered technologies are highly dependent on intensity of solar radiation the water yield of solar still also increases with the increasing solar intensity nafey et al 2000 thus improving or enhancing the insolation collection by modifications in design of ss or by employing reflectors can improve the yield internal or external reflectors are quite efficient where low solar intensities are encountered reflectors concentrate additional thermal energy on the absorber plate of ss and cause a rise in basin water temperature tanaka and nakatake 2006 investigated the performance of conventional ss using internal as well as external reflectors as shown in fig 2 observed an annual increase in the productivity by 48 khalifa and ibrahim 2009 investigated the performance of ss in summer winter and autumn seasons by altering the tilt angle of external reflectors and found that use of reflectors is only advantageous in winter and autumn seasons similar results were recently obtained by bataineh and abbas 2020 stating the ineffectiveness of external reflectors in simple solar still during summers 1 1 2 active distillation active solar distillation systems utilize additional thermal energy which could be derived from sources such as solar heaters mechanical or chemical thermal devices waste heat recovery devices etc asss have also been employed for getting better yield since higher water temperatures are obtained active distillation systems are broadly classified as sampathkumar et al 2010 a high temperature active solar distillation an external solar collector is used to heat the feed water of the basin the temperature of the water is quite high ranging from 60 c to 80 c b pre heated water active solar distillation a pre heated water is fed to basin of the still while maintaining a continuous flow c nocturnal distillation nocturnal distillation means the distillation takes place in the absence of sunlight this is generally achieved by using the thermal energy storage mediums or by utilising the heat obtained as by product of some industrial process heated water is fed to the basin only one time in a day asss designed using external solar thermal collectors have also been developed by various researchers such systems require high initial investment and also have high maintenance expenditures associated with them but all these costs are balanced by the better distillate producing capabilities of these systems various types of active solar stills include the integration of solar energy collection sources such as singh et al 2020 flat plate collectors fpc evacuated tube collectors etc parabolic trough collectors ptc heat pipe solar pond hybrid photovoltaic thermal system etc parabolic trough collectors ptc evacuated tube collectors etc and flat plate collectors fpc are the most common systems used for the collection of solar thermal energy many researchers have developed active distillation systems based on ptc fpc and etc in order to maximize the productivity of simple solar stills tiwari et al 2007 developed thermal models for solar still integrated with fpc etc and ptc they found that the basin water temperatures and yield output were highest for the concentrating parabolic collectors thus the higher the temperature of basin water the more will be yield output of solar still sampathkumar and senthilkumar 2012 attached a solar evacuated tube water heater to a simple solar still a maximum temperature of 60 c was achieved by the water storage tank of etc collector and the performance of the active system was compared with a passive still which showed an effective increment of yield output by 77 dev and tiwari 2012 experimentally investigated the annual performance of an evacuated tubular collector integrated solar still eiss in new delhi india they concluded that eiss can be used for water heating as well as distillation purposes simultaneously almost a rise of 50 in the annual distillate output with eiss was observed during their study kumar et al 2014 developed a theoretical model and compared the performance of eiss in natural and forced mode it was observed that at specific flow rate is higher than eiss operating in natural mode panchal and awasthi 2017 directly integrated the solar evacuated tubes with traditional solar still and carried out theoretical as well as experimental studies on the system it was found that this system yields 140 more than the conventional passive still this could be one of the best designs since it eliminates the heat losses occurring in pipe connections when evacuated tubes solar heaters are used externally morad et al 2017 developed a desalination system using fpc integrated with a separate condenser rather than using passive still and glass cover the highest productivity of this system was 10 94 l day patel et al 2019 improved the yield output of a stepped type passive solar distillation system up to 24 by integrating etc solar water heater with it few researchers have also used porous materials such as calcium carbonate panchal et al 2020a and metallic solid fins panchal et al 2020b along with evacuated tubes in order to improve the productivity of conventional solar stills 1 1 3 energy absorbing materials the evaporation rate of basin water depends on the exposure area of energy absorbing surfaces as the exposure area increases the higher water temperatures are obtained for a longer duration of time fins have been used in thermal devices as extended surfaces to enhance the energy transfer in sss fins are used as extended energy absorbing surfaces to enhance the water evaporation velmurugan et al 2008 carried out investigations on stepped ss augmented with metallic circular rods as fins in order to enhance the free surface absorption area and observed more than 80 higher fresh water yield rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 studied the impact of two different types of fins having square and circular circumferential shapes on the output of sss square fins effectively increased the distillate water output by 36 7 while circular fins improved the performance by 26 3 as compared to simple ss without fins el sebaii and el naggar 2017 determined the effect of different fin materials in enhancing the yield of ss they checked various fin materials experimentally and concluded that changing the fin material does not significantly affect the performance of ss mevada et al 2020 studied the significance of different fin configurations and extensively reviewed various studies carried out by varying different fin material and configurations as productivity enhancement techniques and reported that shape as well as configuration of fins are also the important factors of consideration researchers in the past have also compared different wick materials e g black cotton clothes sponge sheet waste cotton and jute pieces and other porous materials for enhancing the yield of ss murugavel et al 2008 murugavel and srithar 2011 rajaseenivasan et al 2015 omara et al 2016 used wick material over a corrugated absorber in a solar still augmented with internal reflectors to carry out an experimental study productivity was improved by 90 in case when corrugated absorber was covered with wick abdullah et al 2019 modified a conventional ss by integrating a vertically spinning wick at the back wall and improved the distillate output by 14 72 with respect to ss without rotating wick tuly et al 2021 reported that baffle and floating absorbers are also tested by researchers in enhancing the output of ss 1 1 4 energy storage materials due to high heat capacities both sensible as well as latent heat storage materials are utilized to store energy during sunshine hours and improve the water yield of sss by releasing the stored energy during non sunshine hours arjunan et al 2017 experimentally showed that pebbles when used as heat storage material in the basin type solar still can boost the yield by 9 5 arunkumar et al 2020 through experimental investigations compared the effect of various energy absorbing and energy storage materials in simple ss the different aforesaid materials used were sponges made up of polyvinyl alcohol pva copper oxide based nano coated absorber plates cuo ncap naturally available pebbles and spherical clay balls as shown in fig 3 the productivity with pebbles was 2 80 l m2 day while cuo ncap augmented ss had a productivity of 2 90 l m2 day while minimum productivities achieved using spherical clay balls and sponges were 2 60 l m2 day and 1 90 l m2 day respectively latent heat storage aids the solar still by using phase changing material pcm for storing thermal energy in the presence of abundant sunlight and providing this energy to the still in the absence of sunlight el sebaii et al 2009 presented a transient model of simple basin type ss with and without the aid of pcm placed below the basin of ss steric acid was used as pcm and results of their study concluded that higher the amount of pcm more will be the productivity kabeel and abdelgaied 2016 stated an increase of 68 in the yield of fresh water by using paraffin wax as pcm with ss there are three classifications of pcms as organic inorganic and eutectic which are being used in integration with pss as well ass for storing thermal energy shukla et al 2017 and katekar and deshmukh 2020 reviewed different types of pcms used in performance enhancement in different types of ss technologies in their studies 1 1 5 nanofluids nano fluids have better thermal characteristics such as higher thermal conductivity and higher heat transfer coefficients as compared to water thus higher basin water temperatures are achieved using nano particles sharshir et al 2020 studied the effect of carbon tube nano particles to escalate the heat absorption of water in double slope stepped ss the efficiency of the system was improved by 110 50 while the productivity increment by 80 57 was observed during their investigation cuo copper oxide coated metallic absorber plate was used by arunkumar et al 2019 to boost the yield of ss elango et al 2015 investigated the basin type ss with nano fluids based on oxides of zinc aluminium and tin their results indicated highest performance with 29 95 increment in yield using aluminium oxide 1 1 6 cooling techniques improved condensation of evaporated water can be achieved by effective cooling in basin type sss lower glass temperatures result in higher condensation rate and more distillate output kumar and bai 2008 integrated aluminium cooling water tubes beneath the glass cover along the sidewalls of the still in reference to their study they reported that condensation rate is not only dependent on inner glass surface but also on the inner walls of the still arunkumar et al 2012 fabricated a hemispherical basin type ss and used flowing water to obtain higher efficiency of the system the effect of various parameters on effective condensation and evaporation rates of water in pss was reviewed by manokar et al 2014 and later a similar study was also extended to ass manokar et al 2019 1 1 7 other modifications and optimization of design to enhance productivity the effective working of a solar still is governed by various climatic conditions that involve ambient temperature solar irradiance clear or cloudy sky cover and wind speed solar still is a thermal device and the occurrence of different heat transfer phenomena inside the still depend upon the design and operational characteristics such as size of glass cover mainly its thickness the angle of inclination of condensing cover basin liner area salt concentration depth of water etc torchia núñez et al 2014 sharshir et al 2016 optimization of these parameters thus become necessary in order to have better performance and economic advantages feilizadeh et al 2017 optimized the geometrical dimensions height length and breadth of conventional solar still using a radiation model which minimized the shadowing effect of walls on the basin the study revealed that the height of the front wall has a major influence on the efficiency of solar still the shadow of the wall on the basin water causes thermal losses thus for better output the authors recommend the front face of the still must always be smaller than 10 cm and the aspect ratio length over breadth to be kept close to 2 1 ratio the productivity is affected adversely by the amount of water present in the basin liner as the water levels increase in the solar still there occurs a simultaneous drop in the distillate output tiwari and tiwari 2006 experimentally investigated the variation in water levels has on the efficiency of conventional solar stills they used different water levels ranging from 0 04 m to 0 18 m and found that the yield output dropped drastically from 1 714 l m2 day to 1 253 l m2 day respectively due to increase in depth of brackish water they also studied the impact on heat transfer coefficients which control the internal heat transfer characteristics of still and found that convective and evaporative heat transfer coefficients are majorly influenced by the variation of water levels in the absorber plate in another study jamil and akhtar 2016 through experimentations examined the consequences of variation in space between absorber plate and glass cover on the effectiveness of solar still it was observed that as the gap between basin and glass cover increases productivity of the system decreases thus water depth in the basin absorber is an important factor to be studied during the performance analysis of solar stills it is desirable that glass cover should have good transmittance to allow maximum insolation inside the ss along with the transmittance of glass the angle of inclination of glass and its thickness are the other two main properties which have major effect on the irradiation reaching the absorber basin singh and tiwari 2004 evaluated the monthly performance of pss and ass for five different indian cities and reported that the best results were obtained when glass inclination is equal to the latitude of locality glass has low thermal conductivity and the inner glass surface in contact with hot vapors keeps getting heated as a result of which the temperature of glass rises with time while the outer surface of glass loses this heat to the environment the thickness of glass should be such that the condensation of vapors and transmission of irradiation are maximum a glass thickness of 4 mm has been suggested by various researchers panchal and shah 2012 panchal 2016 salem et al 2020 for obtaining optimum distillate output from ss different types of designs have also been adopted by researchers to improve the performance of sss rajaseenivasan and murugavel 2013 theoretically as well as experimentally carried out research on double slope as well as double basin sss and discovered 85 improvement in distillate yield using these designs other improvements involve the use of wind turbine powered fan omara et al 2017 solar power driven stirrer rajaseenivasan et al 2017 ultrasound atomiser el said and abdelaziz 2020 and rotated hollow cylinders ayoub and malaeb 2014 to enhance the evaporation rates are shown in fig 4 1 2 energy and exergy efficiencies of solar stills the heat transfer characteristics of the solar still are mainly determined with the help of heat transfer coefficients agrawal et al 2017 investigated the impact of changing water height on the coefficients of heat transfer of a pss and confirmed that the evaporative heat transfer coefficient is the major factor influencing the performance of a still a solar still has internal energy transformations as well as heat interaction with the surroundings during these energy transformations the quality of energy deteriorates and is generally measured in terms of exergy exergy provides a meaningful insight on the quality of energy thus it becomes necessary to consider both energy and exergy efficiencies for evaluating the performance of the solar still in order to have a better understanding of the system torchia nunez et al 2008 investigated the destruction of exergy taking place in various components of a passive still the order of irreversibility was found to be highest in the absorber plate the overall exergy efficiency of the pss was 5 kumar et al 2014 developed a computational model for the evaluation of the performance of a single slope solar still attached with etcs and used meteorological data of new delhi for a particular day as input to calculate thermodynamic efficiencies of the system there was a huge difference observed in daily thermal efficiencies which were 33 8 energy and 2 6 exergy respectively singh et al 2016 evaluated the performance of an ass attached with hybrid pvt collector maximum values of thermal and electrical exergy efficiencies were found to be 20 74 and 28 53 respectively dubey et al 2021 carried out exergy and energy based performance investigation of double slope solar still integrated with etc and the daily energy and exergy efficiencies were estimated to be around 33 8 and 4 9 respectively table 1 summarises the energy and exergy efficiencies of various modified sss which used one of the productivity enhancement techniques described in section 1 1 the literature survey revealed that the dependence of solar still performance on meteorological parameters is quite high these parameters are site specific and vary from location to location solar still mainly finds its application in hot arid or coastal areas worldwide the research needs to be carried out in cold regions too so that the applicability of solar stills as an alternative to procure sustainable purification of water can be assessed also the effect of low ambient temperatures on the performance of solar stills can also be evaluated it was also found that major research on analyzing the thermodynamic characteristics of solar still augmented with fpcs or etcs has been mostly evaluated by mathematical models using the meteorological data for single day and there is a lack of long term experimental investigations on these systems thus a detailed experimental study on sss equipped with evacuated tubes has been presented in order to assess the repercussions of low ambient temperature conditions of an indian mountainous region on the thermodynamic efficiencies of the system 2 case study on an active solar still in colder region the literature survey carried out in above sections revealed that the best improvement in productivity of sss can be achieved by increasing the water temperature thus the solar stills integrated with additional thermal energy sources outperform their passive counterparts asss have shown to increase the distillate yield by more than 140 which is the highest as compared to other methods discussed in section 2 of this paper but this output is influenced by the various factors described in fig 1 one such factor i e variation in water level of the absorber plate basin has major influence on the productivity of stills thus in order to understand the thermal performance of sss a study was conducted in the hamirpur himachal pradesh to get a better insight of a ss augmented with three vacuum tube collectors although ptcs or concentrated solar thermal devices have higher temperatures and better productivity than etcs but concentrated devices operate under direct solar radiations and require tracking mechanism for their operation the additional tracking mechanisms will increase the overall cost of the system tiwari et al 2007 chandra and dixit 2018 thus etcs were chosen for current study which does not require tracking and work well under direct as well as diffuse solar radiations the effect of changing water levels under low ambient temperatures of the selected location on the performance of ass was quantified in terms of performance parameters such as basin water temperature and heat transfer coefficients as well as performance metrics such as energy and exergy efficiencies 2 1 materials and methods this study was conducted at the rooftop of centre for energy and environmental engineering now known as centre for energy studies at national institute of technology hamirpur india latitude n 31 42 longitude e 76 31 fig 5 shows various steps involved in carrying out the study 2 2 system description in order to carry out the study a simple solar still made of wooden housing attached with three equally spaced water in glass evacuated solar tubes was fabricated along with a similar sized simple singular slope solar still to increase solar energy gain the inclination angle of glass was chosen equal to latitude of location singh and tiwari 2004 to minimise the shading effect of side walls the aspect ratio length breadth of basin was kept equal to 2 1 feilizadeh et al 2017 the standard sized solar evacuated tubes commercially available were used in the set up the main components of ass along with their dimensional specifications are mentioned in table 2 2 3 measurement uncertainty the divergence in measured values from the accurate results may arise due to measuring equipment used thus errors associated with measuring equipment are quantified in terms of uncertainty as beckwith et al 2007 1 u e q u i p accuracy of measuring instrument max value measured by the instrument 100 table 3 shows error in measuring instruments used 2 4 experimental procedure the experiments were carried out between 8 00 a m to 5 00 p m activities like draining cleaning and pouring of fresh feed of water were conducted between 7 00 a m to 8 00 a m before the beginning of experiments an ass augmented with solar vacuum tubes was placed alongside with similar size conventional passive still for comparative studies as shown in fig 6 b both the solar stills were kept facing south in order to receive maximum insolation before the beginning of experiments the solar stills were daily fed with water by removing the cover the experimental study started at 8 a m and after a period of 1 h yield output readings were recorded using a conical flask borosilicate conical flasks having volumetric capacity of 500 ml were used to collect the distil water output of both the stills a measuring cylinder of capacity 10 ml marked with 1 ml graduations was also used for measuring the distillate output collected in conical flasks to achieve better accuracy in measurements k type thermocouples were used for temperature measurements the thermocouples were calibrated using an isotech millik dry block calibrator the calibration was carried out at four different temperatures 40 c 80 c 100 c and 120 c chosen on the basis of maximum and minimum temperatures that can be achieved by basin water the temperature measurement uncertainty of the thermocouples was found to be within 1 c range thermocouples were placed in the basin liner and inner glass surface to record temperatures the data for ambient conditions i e insolation on glass cover and ambient temperature was obtained from automatic weather station aws installed on the rooftop of centre for energy studies nit hamirpur the radiation incident upon evacuated tubes were measured using solar power meter after every 15 minutes the hourly averages of the all the measured parameters were used for calculations the experiments were performed at three different water depths 0 01 m 0 02 m and 0 03 m during different days of the month of april 2019 fig 6a shows the processes occurring within the solar still

carried out using the procedure demonstrated by kumar and tiwari 2007 and it was observed that the variation in standard deviations among experiments carried out at different days with all three water depths were quite less and internal uncertainties of experiments with 0 01 m 0 02 m and 0 03 m were found to be 8 46 8 90 and 9 74 respectively see tables 4 6 4 results and discussion in the present study evacuated tubes were directly attached with the basin of solar still to enhance the production output and the effect of water depth on the performance of the developed active system was examined the experiments were performed for entire month of april but in present study data of 15 different sunny days have been presented the depth of water in the basin were changed randomly and 5 different days for each depth have been shown in the results 4 1 effect of depth on yield 4 1 1 the ass performed better than its passive counterpart the productivity was enhanced by almost 93 when the water depth in both the stills were maintained at 0 01 m depth and more than 100 and almost 145 improvement in the yield respectively was observed when both the solar stills were filled up to 0 02 m and 0 03 m heights respectively as shown in fig 7 thus the asss are more effective as compared to psss at higher water depths as the water depth increased from 0 01 m to 0 03 m there was gradual decrease in the daytime productivity of solar stills but interestingly nocturnal productivity showed opposite behavior i e during non solar hours the distillate output increased with the increasing water level in the basin the maximum total daytime nocturnal productivity of active solar at 0 01 m 0 02 m and 0 03 m water depths was 1 741 l 1 627 l and 1 491 l respectively while for simple solar it was 0 899 l 0 735 l and 0 604 l respectively 4 2 effect of water depth on the performance of ass 4 2 1 daily average energy and exergy efficiencies fig 8 shows that the energy and exergy efficiencies being a function of distillate output decrease with the increasing water depth on different sunny days the range of daily energy and exergy efficiencies is shown in table 7 as under 4 2 2 performance of ass on typical sunny days at different water depths in order to have a better understanding of the behavior of active still the hourly variation of performance parameters needs to be analyzed fig 9 shows the climatic parameters and their impact on water and inner glass temperatures of asss during the experimental days incident solar radiation on the surface of evacuated tubes i were higher than what were received on glass cover surface i higher the ambient temperature tamb higher were the inner glass tg and water tw temperatures figs 7 and 8 show the hourly variation of different performance parameters at three different depths on the corresponding days with highest distillate output the solar intensity was maximum at 12 00 p m but water attained maximum temperature at 2 00 p m in case of 0 01 m 0 02 m water depths while due to prevailing storage effect the water temperature corresponding to 0 03 m depth reached its maxima at 3 00 p m as shown in fig 10 this was not the case with inner glass temperatures and variation of tg showed a similar trend in all three cases the highest temperature attained by basin water was 82 c at 0 01 m depth with 0 277 l hourly productivity while it only attained a maximum temperature of 76 c at 0 03 m water depth and the corresponding hourly distillate output was 0 207 l the hourly average energy efficiencies showed a similar increasing trend for all the water depths as shown in fig 11 while exergy efficiencies had a different trend for 0 01 m water depth the exergy efficiency is a function of ambient temperature which showed a sudden dropped after 2 00 p m on april 23 2019 i e the experimental day with 0 01 m depth evaporative heat transfer coefficients play a dominating role in forming the vapors and thus the effect of water depths on these coefficients is also similar to the productivity output i e it decreases with increasing water depths the highest value of evaporative heat transfer coefficient occurred at 0 01 m water depth was 56 61 w m2 while it was 43 02 w m2 when the water depth was 0 03 m 5 simple economic investigation a simple cost analysis has been carried out to evaluate the payback period of the ass considering costs of fabrication operation maintenance the approach for determining payback period has been adopted from panchal et al 2020a and also includes the subsidy granted by the government sectors the maximum daily yield of ass was obtained at 0 01 m water depth the average of net productivity day night of the system during five experimental days at 0 01 m water depth is 1 652 l to account the non sunshine days 200 days of operation per annum have been considered table is 8 shows the cost calculation details 6 conclusions this research work deals with a literature review of various productivity enhancement techniques adopted worldwide for improving the performance of basin type sss based on the literature survey it was found that sss have not been tested in cold regions and thus a case study was designed which involved an experimental investigation of a simple solar still integrated with solar vacuum tubes the thermal performance of the ass was analyzed in terms of evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermodynamic efficiencies the effect of low ambient conditions of the study location on the performance parameters of ass was also examined under the influence of different feed water depths following conclusions can be drawn from the current study by converting passive to active still with the application of three evacuated tubes there was substantial enhancement in productivity from 93 at water depth 0 01 m to 145 at water depth 0 03 m average thermodynamic efficiencies energy and exergy efficiencies decrease with the rising water level in the basin liner exergy efficiencies are highly influenced by ambient temperatures and do not always increase with water temperature while energy efficiencies are a strong function of solar radiation and water temperature thus it can be concluded that the low ambient temperature is responsible for exergy destruction due to heat leakage in the atmosphere a time lag was observed during the occurrence of maximum solar radiation intensities and maximum water temperature as a result of the prevailing storage effect this storage effect becomes more dominant when the level of the water rises in the basin as it was observed in case of basin filled with 0 03 m depth in which the maximum temperature occurred at 3 00 p m nocturnal productivity also depends upon storage effect i e higher the amount of hot water in the basin it will take more time to cool down and thus more yield is obtained with higher water depths the difference between glass and water temperatures followed a similar trend at all the water depths till 2 p m however due to the storage effect and low ambient temperatures after 2 p m this temperature difference enhanced with the increasing water depths the storage effect can thus play a significant role in improving the performance of sss on partial sunny days in which the sun only shines for a very short period of time and the weather is mostly cloudy the payback period of the ass was found to be 374 days 7 future recommendations the ass can be used as an alternate to conventional sss because of higher productivities however the suitability of active solar still for mountainous regions can only be justified through detailed economic and feasibility analysis which remains as a future prospective of the current study the future works can be extended by scaling up the size of the solar stills these systems can also be evaluated by integrating solar collector devices with higher operating ranges for example concentrating solar collectors for the further improvement in design the optimization studies on determining the optimal design parameters of sss using computational fluid dynamics cfd software can also be carried out in future the future research must focus on the evolution of cheap affordable easily accessible and clean solar energy techniques which are targeted to have long term benefits and can be well utilized for water purification purposes declaration

11779,traditional basin type solar stills are not as popular due to their lower productivity but a number of ways have been developed globally to increase their production capacity this article demonstrates an overview of the recent studies aimed at improving the productivities and the effective functioning of conventional solar stills in order to have a better insight of the thermal performance the studies focused on evaluating the thermodynamic efficiencies of solar stills have also been reviewed and found that active solar distillation has strong potential in enhancing the performance characteristics of basin type systems it was observed that enormous efforts made by various researchers in understanding and improving the thermal characteristics of solar stills for better output have been majorly examined in hotter and arid regions and solar stills for colder regions need an attention too in this context the proposed work attempts to carry out an experimental study to assess the effect of lower ambient conditions on performance characteristics of an active solar in an indian cold hilly location the observations from the study showed that the effective daily output of the active solar still was as high as twice the daily distillate output produced by the conventional passive still the thermodynamic efficiencies of the active system were also evaluated further during different sunny days the variation in average exergy and energy efficiencies of the active system ranged from 14 86 to 16 18 and 1 95 2 41 respectively due to the prevailing storing effect the nocturnal productivity of solar still was increased at deeper water levels the study also helped to conclude that the exergy destruction in solar still is highly influenced by low ambient temperatures and in future effective design optimization studies can be carried out to gain the benefits through minimized energy exergy losses graphical abstract image 1 keywords exergy

introduction water security and energy security pose the most crucial challenges for humankind in achieving sustainable development oceans of our planet contain 97 of the surface water which is not readily available for drinking purposes goyal and arora 2022 major portion of the remaining 3 fresh water is stored in the form of snow and glaciers and only 0 5 0 6 of the total surface water is available for human usage in the form of flowing rivers and stationary reservoirs dams wells etc gude 2017 however the contaminants waste arising from industrial agricultural and human activities deteriorate the quality of the available potable water and thus fresh water scarcity poses a great hindrance in sustainable development of many areas of the world huang et al 2021 the sustainable development goal sdg 6 was adopted by united nations under the agenda un2030 to achieve global sustainable development aimed at ensuring access of clean water and sanitation to all however the rising global water demand stands as a major challenge to un s policy agenda there has been a tremendous rise in demand for water resources with rapidly increasing population as statistics show addition of more than 80 million to the global population count every year sohani et al 2021 worldmeter website as reported by united nation environmental programme by the year 2030 almost 50 of the world will have to undergo severe water crisis and the global demand for water will surpass the supply by 40 united nations environment programme approximately 1 7 billion people residing around river basins have more water intake than the recharge rates as per a report by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco nearly 2 2 billion people around the world does not have access to potable water resources unicef and who 2019 salehi 2022 and approximately 2 6 million people die every year because of poor sanitation arunkumar et al 2022 india being a developing country also faces water shortage issues present scenario in india depicts that nearly 600 million people struggle with high to extreme water crisis emile et al 2022 jadeja et al 2022 many rural areas in india do not have access to piped clean drinking water facility and it has been estimated that 40 of indian population will face severe potable water shortage issues by the year 2030 thus it becomes necessary to tackle future water shortages which can be achieved either by conserving the potable water or by converting the salty brackish water of oceans to a drinkable form there are several techniques through which water can be purified distillation is one such technique that can be utilized for converting the saline water into consumable form the most frequently used distillation methods shatat et al 2013 feria díaz et al 2021 such as multi effect distillation med reverse osmosis ro cogeneration electrodialysis multistage flash distillation msfd humidification and dehumidification processes and vapor compression vc are dependent on unconventional sources of energy fossil fuels for their operation fossil fuels are prone to extinction and their burning causes co2 emissions in the environment which makes it uneconomical and hazardous to use fossil fuels as energy sources to overcome these problems renewable energy sources have transpired as a strong alternative one such alternative is the solar energy based distillation technique which is considered as an economic environment friendly and easy way to acquire potable water solar distillation is achieved with the help of solar stills these solar stills work on the principle of evaporation and condensation of water as insolation is received by glass cover of a solar still basin water gets heated and evaporation occurs the salts and minerals present in water do not evaporate with it and when these desalinated vapors come in contact with a cold surface condensation takes place this collected condensate is free from salts and can be used for domestic purposes modified solar stills with a provision of external thermal energy source perform much better than the simple and conventional stills these modified solar stills are popularly termed as active solar stills ass while traditional solar stills which do not have provision for additional thermal energy sources are called passive solar stills pss lea et al 2021 researchers have adopted various techniques with the objective of ameliorating the productivity of singular slope stills such as improving the design enhancing the absorptivity or the collection surface area of the basin lowering the temperature of condensing covers using reflectors etc this paper presents a two fold study comprising of literature review of various methods adopted to improve the output of sss along their thermodynamic efficiencies and a case study based on the literature survey the performance output of an active and similar sized pss has been compared for a cold climatic indian zone for easier comprehension of the active distillation system the active system was exposed to outdoor field testing and the effect on the variation in water levels on thermodynamic efficiencies has also been quantified the paper consists of seven sections section 1 comprises of a short introduction on solar distillation followed by literature survey of previous studies on the major productivity enhancement techniques along with their theoretical energy and exergy efficiencies section 2 of this paper presents a case study on active solar still along with the specifications of experimental set up and the methodology adopted to accomplish the study section 3 describes the relations and formulae used for determination of thermodynamic efficiencies section 4 of this paper comprises of results obtained after the successful accomplishment of experiments followed by cost investigation in section 5 section 6 comprises of the conclusions derived from the work and section 7 describes future scope of the study 1 1 state of the art review of the methods employed to enhance the productivity of basin type solar stills although solar distillation is one of the cleanest and cheapest technology to produce distil water the low productivity of simple ss has ceased its acceptance as a commercially viable device the productivity of basin type ss is influenced by several climatic meteorological design and operational characteristics as shown in fig 1 the meteorological parameters are uncontrollable and the improvement in the productivity can only be achieved by improving the design and operational characteristics 1 1 1 reflectors the solar powered technologies are highly dependent on intensity of solar radiation the water yield of solar still also increases with the increasing solar intensity nafey et al 2000 thus improving or enhancing the insolation collection by modifications in design of ss or by employing reflectors can improve the yield internal or external reflectors are quite efficient where low solar intensities are encountered reflectors concentrate additional thermal energy on the absorber plate of ss and cause a rise in basin water temperature tanaka and nakatake 2006 investigated the performance of conventional ss using internal as well as external reflectors as shown in fig 2 observed an annual increase in the productivity by 48 khalifa and ibrahim 2009 investigated the performance of ss in summer winter and autumn seasons by altering the tilt angle of external reflectors and found that use of reflectors is only advantageous in winter and autumn seasons similar results were recently obtained by bataineh and abbas 2020 stating the ineffectiveness of external reflectors in simple solar still during summers 1 1 2 active distillation active solar distillation systems utilize additional thermal energy which could be derived from sources such as solar heaters mechanical or chemical thermal devices waste heat recovery devices etc asss have also been employed for getting better yield since higher water temperatures are obtained active distillation systems are broadly classified as sampathkumar et al 2010 a high temperature active solar distillation an external solar collector is used to heat the feed water of the basin the temperature of the water is quite high ranging from 60 c to 80 c b pre heated water active solar distillation a pre heated water is fed to basin of the still while maintaining a continuous flow c nocturnal distillation nocturnal distillation means the distillation takes place in the absence of sunlight this is generally achieved by using the thermal energy storage mediums or by utilising the heat obtained as by product of some industrial process heated water is fed to the basin only one time in a day asss designed using external solar thermal collectors have also been developed by various researchers such systems require high initial investment and also have high maintenance expenditures associated with them but all these costs are balanced by the better distillate producing capabilities of these systems various types of active solar stills include the integration of solar energy collection sources such as singh et al 2020 flat plate collectors fpc evacuated tube collectors etc parabolic trough collectors ptc heat pipe solar pond hybrid photovoltaic thermal system etc parabolic trough collectors ptc evacuated tube collectors etc and flat plate collectors fpc are the most common systems used for the collection of solar thermal energy many researchers have developed active distillation systems based on ptc fpc and etc in order to maximize the productivity of simple solar stills tiwari et al 2007 developed thermal models for solar still integrated with fpc etc and ptc they found that the basin water temperatures and yield output were highest for the concentrating parabolic collectors thus the higher the temperature of basin water the more will be yield output of solar still sampathkumar and senthilkumar 2012 attached a solar evacuated tube water heater to a simple solar still a maximum temperature of 60 c was achieved by the water storage tank of etc collector and the performance of the active system was compared with a passive still which showed an effective increment of yield output by 77 dev and tiwari 2012 experimentally investigated the annual performance of an evacuated tubular collector integrated solar still eiss in new delhi india they concluded that eiss can be used for water heating as well as distillation purposes simultaneously almost a rise of 50 in the annual distillate output with eiss was observed during their study kumar et al 2014 developed a theoretical model and compared the performance of eiss in natural and forced mode it was observed that at specific flow rate is higher than eiss operating in natural mode panchal and awasthi 2017 directly integrated the solar evacuated tubes with traditional solar still and carried out theoretical as well as experimental studies on the system it was found that this system yields 140 more than the conventional passive still this could be one of the best designs since it eliminates the heat losses occurring in pipe connections when evacuated tubes solar heaters are used externally morad et al 2017 developed a desalination system using fpc integrated with a separate condenser rather than using passive still and glass cover the highest productivity of this system was 10 94 l day patel et al 2019 improved the yield output of a stepped type passive solar distillation system up to 24 by integrating etc solar water heater with it few researchers have also used porous materials such as calcium carbonate panchal et al 2020a and metallic solid fins panchal et al 2020b along with evacuated tubes in order to improve the productivity of conventional solar stills 1 1 3 energy absorbing materials the evaporation rate of basin water depends on the exposure area of energy absorbing surfaces as the exposure area increases the higher water temperatures are obtained for a longer duration of time fins have been used in thermal devices as extended surfaces to enhance the energy transfer in sss fins are used as extended energy absorbing surfaces to enhance the water evaporation velmurugan et al 2008 carried out investigations on stepped ss augmented with metallic circular rods as fins in order to enhance the free surface absorption area and observed more than 80 higher fresh water yield rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 studied the impact of two different types of fins having square and circular circumferential shapes on the output of sss square fins effectively increased the distillate water output by 36 7 while circular fins improved the performance by 26 3 as compared to simple ss without fins el sebaii and el naggar 2017 determined the effect of different fin materials in enhancing the yield of ss they checked various fin materials experimentally and concluded that changing the fin material does not significantly affect the performance of ss mevada et al 2020 studied the significance of different fin configurations and extensively reviewed various studies carried out by varying different fin material and configurations as productivity enhancement techniques and reported that shape as well as configuration of fins are also the important factors of consideration researchers in the past have also compared different wick materials e g black cotton clothes sponge sheet waste cotton and jute pieces and other porous materials for enhancing the yield of ss murugavel et al 2008 murugavel and srithar 2011 rajaseenivasan et al 2015 omara et al 2016 used wick material over a corrugated absorber in a solar still augmented with internal reflectors to carry out an experimental study productivity was improved by 90 in case when corrugated absorber was covered with wick abdullah et al 2019 modified a conventional ss by integrating a vertically spinning wick at the back wall and improved the distillate output by 14 72 with respect to ss without rotating wick tuly et al 2021 reported that baffle and floating absorbers are also tested by researchers in enhancing the output of ss 1 1 4 energy storage materials due to high heat capacities both sensible as well as latent heat storage materials are utilized to store energy during sunshine hours and improve the water yield of sss by releasing the stored energy during non sunshine hours arjunan et al 2017 experimentally showed that pebbles when used as heat storage material in the basin type solar still can boost the yield by 9 5 arunkumar et al 2020 through experimental investigations compared the effect of various energy absorbing and energy storage materials in simple ss the different aforesaid materials used were sponges made up of polyvinyl alcohol pva copper oxide based nano coated absorber plates cuo ncap naturally available pebbles and spherical clay balls as shown in fig 3 the productivity with pebbles was 2 80 l m2 day while cuo ncap augmented ss had a productivity of 2 90 l m2 day while minimum productivities achieved using spherical clay balls and sponges were 2 60 l m2 day and 1 90 l m2 day respectively latent heat storage aids the solar still by using phase changing material pcm for storing thermal energy in the presence of abundant sunlight and providing this energy to the still in the absence of sunlight el sebaii et al 2009 presented a transient model of simple basin type ss with and without the aid of pcm placed below the basin of ss steric acid was used as pcm and results of their study concluded that higher the amount of pcm more will be the productivity kabeel and abdelgaied 2016 stated an increase of 68 in the yield of fresh water by using paraffin wax as pcm with ss there are three classifications of pcms as organic inorganic and eutectic which are being used in integration with pss as well ass for storing thermal energy shukla et al 2017 and katekar and deshmukh 2020 reviewed different types of pcms used in performance enhancement in different types of ss technologies in their studies 1 1 5 nanofluids nano fluids have better thermal characteristics such as higher thermal conductivity and higher heat transfer coefficients as compared to water thus higher basin water temperatures are achieved using nano particles sharshir et al 2020 studied the effect of carbon tube nano particles to escalate the heat absorption of water in double slope stepped ss the efficiency of the system was improved by 110 50 while the productivity increment by 80 57 was observed during their investigation cuo copper oxide coated metallic absorber plate was used by arunkumar et al 2019 to boost the yield of ss elango et al 2015 investigated the basin type ss with nano fluids based on oxides of zinc aluminium and tin their results indicated highest performance with 29 95 increment in yield using aluminium oxide 1 1 6 cooling techniques improved condensation of evaporated water can be achieved by effective cooling in basin type sss lower glass temperatures result in higher condensation rate and more distillate output kumar and bai 2008 integrated aluminium cooling water tubes beneath the glass cover along the sidewalls of the still in reference to their study they reported that condensation rate is not only dependent on inner glass surface but also on the inner walls of the still arunkumar et al 2012 fabricated a hemispherical basin type ss and used flowing water to obtain higher efficiency of the system the effect of various parameters on effective condensation and evaporation rates of water in pss was reviewed by manokar et al 2014 and later a similar study was also extended to ass manokar et al 2019 1 1 7 other modifications and optimization of design to enhance productivity the effective working of a solar still is governed by various climatic conditions that involve ambient temperature solar irradiance clear or cloudy sky cover and wind speed solar still is a thermal device and the occurrence of different heat transfer phenomena inside the still depend upon the design and operational characteristics such as size of glass cover mainly its thickness the angle of inclination of condensing cover basin liner area salt concentration depth of water etc torchia núñez et al 2014 sharshir et al 2016 optimization of these parameters thus become necessary in order to have better performance and economic advantages feilizadeh et al 2017 optimized the geometrical dimensions height length and breadth of conventional solar still using a radiation model which minimized the shadowing effect of walls on the basin the study revealed that the height of the front wall has a major influence on the efficiency of solar still the shadow of the wall on the basin water causes thermal losses thus for better output the authors recommend the front face of the still must always be smaller than 10 cm and the aspect ratio length over breadth to be kept close to 2 1 ratio the productivity is affected adversely by the amount of water present in the basin liner as the water levels increase in the solar still there occurs a simultaneous drop in the distillate output tiwari and tiwari 2006 experimentally investigated the variation in water levels has on the efficiency of conventional solar stills they used different water levels ranging from 0 04 m to 0 18 m and found that the yield output dropped drastically from 1 714 l m2 day to 1 253 l m2 day respectively due to increase in depth of brackish water they also studied the impact on heat transfer coefficients which control the internal heat transfer characteristics of still and found that convective and evaporative heat transfer coefficients are majorly influenced by the variation of water levels in the absorber plate in another study jamil and akhtar 2016 through experimentations examined the consequences of variation in space between absorber plate and glass cover on the effectiveness of solar still it was observed that as the gap between basin and glass cover increases productivity of the system decreases thus water depth in the basin absorber is an important factor to be studied during the performance analysis of solar stills it is desirable that glass cover should have good transmittance to allow maximum insolation inside the ss along with the transmittance of glass the angle of inclination of glass and its thickness are the other two main properties which have major effect on the irradiation reaching the absorber basin singh and tiwari 2004 evaluated the monthly performance of pss and ass for five different indian cities and reported that the best results were obtained when glass inclination is equal to the latitude of locality glass has low thermal conductivity and the inner glass surface in contact with hot vapors keeps getting heated as a result of which the temperature of glass rises with time while the outer surface of glass loses this heat to the environment the thickness of glass should be such that the condensation of vapors and transmission of irradiation are maximum a glass thickness of 4 mm has been suggested by various researchers panchal and shah 2012 panchal 2016 salem et al 2020 for obtaining optimum distillate output from ss different types of designs have also been adopted by researchers to improve the performance of sss rajaseenivasan and murugavel 2013 theoretically as well as experimentally carried out research on double slope as well as double basin sss and discovered 85 improvement in distillate yield using these designs other improvements involve the use of wind turbine powered fan omara et al 2017 solar power driven stirrer rajaseenivasan et al 2017 ultrasound atomiser el said and abdelaziz 2020 and rotated hollow cylinders ayoub and malaeb 2014 to enhance the evaporation rates are shown in fig 4 1 2 energy and exergy efficiencies of solar stills the heat transfer characteristics of the solar still are mainly determined with the help of heat transfer coefficients agrawal et al 2017 investigated the impact of changing water height on the coefficients of heat transfer of a pss and confirmed that the evaporative heat transfer coefficient is the major factor influencing the performance of a still a solar still has internal energy transformations as well as heat interaction with the surroundings during these energy transformations the quality of energy deteriorates and is generally measured in terms of exergy exergy provides a meaningful insight on the quality of energy thus it becomes necessary to consider both energy and exergy efficiencies for evaluating the performance of the solar still in order to have a better understanding of the system torchia nunez et al 2008 investigated the destruction of exergy taking place in various components of a passive still the order of irreversibility was found to be highest in the absorber plate the overall exergy efficiency of the pss was 5 kumar et al 2014 developed a computational model for the evaluation of the performance of a single slope solar still attached with etcs and used meteorological data of new delhi for a particular day as input to calculate thermodynamic efficiencies of the system there was a huge difference observed in daily thermal efficiencies which were 33 8 energy and 2 6 exergy respectively singh et al 2016 evaluated the performance of an ass attached with hybrid pvt collector maximum values of thermal and electrical exergy efficiencies were found to be 20 74 and 28 53 respectively dubey et al 2021 carried out exergy and energy based performance investigation of double slope solar still integrated with etc and the daily energy and exergy efficiencies were estimated to be around 33 8 and 4 9 respectively table 1 summarises the energy and exergy efficiencies of various modified sss which used one of the productivity enhancement techniques described in section 1 1 the literature survey revealed that the dependence of solar still performance on meteorological parameters is quite high these parameters are site specific and vary from location to location solar still mainly finds its application in hot arid or coastal areas worldwide the research needs to be carried out in cold regions too so that the applicability of solar stills as an alternative to procure sustainable purification of water can be assessed also the effect of low ambient temperatures on the performance of solar stills can also be evaluated it was also found that major research on analyzing the thermodynamic characteristics of solar still augmented with fpcs or etcs has been mostly evaluated by mathematical models using the meteorological data for single day and there is a lack of long term experimental investigations on these systems thus a detailed experimental study on sss equipped with evacuated tubes has been presented in order to assess the repercussions of low ambient temperature conditions of an indian mountainous region on the thermodynamic efficiencies of the system 2 case study on an active solar still in colder region the literature survey carried out in above sections revealed that the best improvement in productivity of sss can be achieved by increasing the water temperature thus the solar stills integrated with additional thermal energy sources outperform their passive counterparts asss have shown to increase the distillate yield by more than 140 which is the highest as compared to other methods discussed in section 2 of this paper but this output is influenced by the various factors described in fig 1 one such factor i e variation in water level of the absorber plate basin has major influence on the productivity of stills thus in order to understand the thermal performance of sss a study was conducted in the hamirpur himachal pradesh to get a better insight of a ss augmented with three vacuum tube collectors although ptcs or concentrated solar thermal devices have higher temperatures and better productivity than etcs but concentrated devices operate under direct solar radiations and require tracking mechanism for their operation the additional tracking mechanisms will increase the overall cost of the system tiwari et al 2007 chandra and dixit 2018 thus etcs were chosen for current study which does not require tracking and work well under direct as well as diffuse solar radiations the effect of changing water levels under low ambient temperatures of the selected location on the performance of ass was quantified in terms of performance parameters such as basin water temperature and heat transfer coefficients as well as performance metrics such as energy and exergy efficiencies 2 1 materials and methods this study was conducted at the rooftop of centre for energy and environmental engineering now known as centre for energy studies at national institute of technology hamirpur india latitude n 31 42 longitude e 76 31 fig 5 shows various steps involved in carrying out the study 2 2 system description in order to carry out the study a simple solar still made of wooden housing attached with three equally spaced water in glass evacuated solar tubes was fabricated along with a similar sized simple singular slope solar still to increase solar energy gain the inclination angle of glass was chosen equal to latitude of location singh and tiwari 2004 to minimise the shading effect of side walls the aspect ratio length breadth of basin was kept equal to 2 1 feilizadeh et al 2017 the standard sized solar evacuated tubes commercially available were used in the set up the main components of ass along with their dimensional specifications are mentioned in table 2 2 3 measurement uncertainty the divergence in measured values from the accurate results may arise due to measuring equipment used thus errors associated with measuring equipment are quantified in terms of uncertainty as beckwith et al 2007 1 u e q u i p accuracy of measuring instrument max value measured by the instrument 100 table 3 shows error in measuring instruments used 2 4 experimental procedure the experiments were carried out between 8 00 a m to 5 00 p m activities like draining cleaning and pouring of fresh feed of water were conducted between 7 00 a m to 8 00 a m before the beginning of experiments an ass augmented with solar vacuum tubes was placed alongside with similar size conventional passive still for comparative studies as shown in fig 6 b both the solar stills were kept facing south in order to receive maximum insolation before the beginning of experiments the solar stills were daily fed with water by removing the cover the experimental study started at 8 a m and after a period of 1 h yield output readings were recorded using a conical flask borosilicate conical flasks having volumetric capacity of 500 ml were used to collect the distil water output of both the stills a measuring cylinder of capacity 10 ml marked with 1 ml graduations was also used for measuring the distillate output collected in conical flasks to achieve better accuracy in measurements k type thermocouples were used for temperature measurements the thermocouples were calibrated using an isotech millik dry block calibrator the calibration was carried out at four different temperatures 40 c 80 c 100 c and 120 c chosen on the basis of maximum and minimum temperatures that can be achieved by basin water the temperature measurement uncertainty of the thermocouples was found to be within 1 c range thermocouples were placed in the basin liner and inner glass surface to record temperatures the data for ambient conditions i e insolation on glass cover and ambient temperature was obtained from automatic weather station aws installed on the rooftop of centre for energy studies nit hamirpur the radiation incident upon evacuated tubes were measured using solar power meter after every 15 minutes the hourly averages of the all the measured parameters were used for calculations

n s 100 experimental results observed in real time may have associated uncertainties and errors arising due to various influencing factors the uncertainty analysis of the experimental outcomes was carried out using the procedure demonstrated by kumar and tiwari 2007 and it was observed that the variation in standard deviations among experiments carried out at different days with all three water depths were quite less and internal uncertainties of experiments with 0 01 m 0 02 m and 0 03 m were found to be 8 46 8 90 and 9 74 respectively see tables 4 6 4 results and discussion in the present study evacuated tubes were directly attached with the basin of solar still to enhance the production output and the effect of water depth on the performance of the developed active system was examined the experiments were performed for entire month of april but in present study data of 15 different sunny days have been presented the depth of water in the basin were changed randomly and 5 different days for each depth have been shown in the results 4 1 effect of depth on yield 4 1 1 the ass performed better than its passive counterpart the productivity was enhanced by almost 93 when the water depth in both the stills were maintained at 0 01 m depth and more than 100 and almost 145 improvement in the yield respectively was observed when both the solar stills were filled up to 0 02 m and 0 03 m heights respectively as shown in fig 7 thus the asss are more effective as compared to psss at higher water depths as the water depth increased from 0 01 m to 0 03 m there was gradual decrease in the daytime productivity of solar stills but interestingly nocturnal productivity showed opposite behavior i e during non solar hours the distillate output increased with the increasing water level in the basin the maximum total daytime nocturnal productivity of active solar at 0 01 m 0 02 m and 0 03 m water depths was 1 741 l 1 627 l and 1 491 l respectively while for simple solar it was 0 899 l 0 735 l and 0 604 l respectively 4 2 effect of water depth on the performance of ass 4 2 1 daily average energy and exergy efficiencies fig 8 shows that the energy and exergy efficiencies being a function of distillate output decrease with the increasing water depth on different sunny days the range of daily energy and exergy efficiencies is shown in table 7 as under 4 2 2 performance of ass on typical sunny days at different water depths in order to have a better understanding of the behavior of active still the hourly variation of performance parameters needs to be analyzed fig 9 shows the climatic parameters and their impact on water and inner glass temperatures of asss during the experimental days incident solar radiation on the surface of evacuated tubes i were higher than what were received on glass cover surface i higher the ambient temperature tamb higher were the inner glass tg and water tw temperatures figs 7 and 8 show the hourly variation of different performance parameters at three different depths on the corresponding days with highest distillate output the solar intensity was maximum at 12 00 p m but water attained maximum temperature at 2 00 p m in case of 0 01 m 0 02 m water depths while due to prevailing storage effect the water temperature corresponding to 0 03 m depth reached its maxima at 3 00 p m as shown in fig 10 this was not the case with inner glass temperatures and variation of tg showed a similar trend in all three cases the highest temperature attained by basin water was 82 c at 0 01 m depth with 0 277 l hourly productivity while it only attained a maximum temperature of 76 c at 0 03 m water depth and the corresponding hourly distillate output was 0 207 l the hourly average energy efficiencies showed a similar increasing trend for all the water depths as shown in fig 11 while exergy efficiencies had a different trend for 0 01 m water depth the exergy efficiency is a function of ambient temperature which showed a sudden dropped after 2 00 p m on april 23 2019 i e the experimental day with 0 01 m depth evaporative heat transfer coefficients play a dominating role in forming the vapors and thus the effect of water depths on these coefficients is also similar to the productivity output i e it decreases with increasing water depths the highest value of evaporative heat transfer coefficient occurred at 0 01 m water depth was 56 61 w m2 while it was 43 02 w m2 when the water depth was 0 03 m 5 simple economic investigation a simple cost analysis has been carried out to evaluate the payback period of the ass considering costs of fabrication operation maintenance the approach for determining payback period has been adopted from panchal et al 2020a and also includes the subsidy granted by the government sectors the maximum daily yield of ass was obtained at 0 01 m water depth the average of net productivity day night of the system during five experimental days at 0 01 m water depth is 1 652 l to account the non sunshine days 200 days of operation per annum have been considered table is 8 shows the cost calculation details 6 conclusions this research work deals with a literature review of various productivity enhancement techniques adopted worldwide for improving the performance of basin type sss based on the literature survey it was found that sss have not been tested in cold regions and thus a case study was designed which involved an experimental investigation of a simple solar still integrated with solar vacuum tubes the thermal performance of the ass was analyzed in terms of evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermodynamic efficiencies the effect of low ambient conditions of the study location on the performance parameters of ass was also examined under the influence of different feed water depths following conclusions can be drawn from the current study by converting passive to active still with the application of three evacuated tubes there was substantial enhancement in productivity from 93 at water depth 0 01 m to 145 at water depth 0 03 m average thermodynamic efficiencies energy and exergy efficiencies decrease with the rising water level in the basin liner exergy efficiencies are highly influenced by ambient temperatures and do not always increase with water temperature while energy efficiencies are a strong function of solar radiation and water temperature thus it can be concluded that the low ambient temperature is responsible for exergy destruction due to heat leakage in the atmosphere a time lag was observed during the occurrence of maximum solar radiation intensities and maximum water temperature as a result of the prevailing storage effect this storage effect becomes more dominant when the level of the water rises in the basin as it was observed in case of basin filled with 0 03 m depth in which the maximum temperature occurred at 3 00 p m nocturnal productivity also depends upon storage effect i e higher the amount of hot water in the basin it will take more time to cool down and thus more yield is obtained with higher water depths the difference between glass and water temperatures followed a similar trend at all the water depths till 2 p m however due to the storage effect and low ambient temperatures after 2 p m this temperature difference enhanced with the increasing water depths the storage effect can thus play a significant role in improving the performance of sss on partial sunny days in which the sun only shines for a very short period of time and the weather is mostly cloudy the payback period of the ass was found to be 374 days 7 future recommendations the ass can be used as an alternate to conventional sss because of higher productivities however the suitability of active solar still for mountainous regions can only be justified through detailed economic and feasibility analysis which remains as a future prospective of the current study the future works can be extended by scaling up the size of the solar stills these systems can also be evaluated by integrating solar collector devices with higher operating ranges for example concentrating solar collectors for the further improvement in design the optimization studies on determining the optimal design parameters of sss using computational fluid dynamics cfd software can also be carried out in future the future research must focus on the evolution of cheap affordable easily accessible and clean solar energy techniques which are targeted to have long term benefits and can be well utilized for water purification purposes declaration
