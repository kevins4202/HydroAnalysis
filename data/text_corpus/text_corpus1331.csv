6655,rainfall is considered the hardest weather variable to forecast and its cause effect relationships often cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms this study introduces a novel hybrid model to month ahead forecasting monthly rainfall amounts which is motivated to be used in semi arid basins the new approach called mpsa mggp is based on integrating multi period simulated annealing mpsa optimizer with multigene genetic programming mggp symbolic regression so that the hybrid model reflects the periodic patterns in rainfall time series into a pareto optimal multigene forecasting equation the model was trained and verified using observed rainfall at two meteorology stations located in north west of iran the model accuracy was also cross validated against two benchmarks conventional genetic programming gp and mggp the results indicated that the proposed gene annealing model provides slight to moderate decline in absolute error as well as noteworthy augment in nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency promising efficiency together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice particularly in semi arid regions keywords rainfall time series forecasting multigene genetic programming simulated annealing semiarid region 1 introduction medium to long term forecasts of rainfall amount are required for many practical purposes in watershed management such as optimal irrigation food production water allocation mine operations management of water infrastructure and flood preventive measures however it is known as one of the most challenging tasks in forecasting community mekanik et al 2013 abbot and marohasy 2014 feng et al 2015 farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 to realize the underling process a number of physically based and stochastic probabilistic models and approaches have been established in the literature stochastic modelling of rainfall events for long time scales such as monthly and seasonal has been attempted in earlier studies using classical time series modeling approaches such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima seasonal arima sarima and periodic autoregressive moving average parma e g delleur and kavvas 1978 kaushik and singh 2008 despite being popular these are basically linear models and incapable of truly capturing the irregularities of rainfall cramer et al 2018 they can be applied for stationary time series when month to month or season to season correlations do not vary throughout the year salas et al 2003 nourani et al 2009 machine learning ml methods are seen as robust alternatives and have become more popular over recent years those of ml methods commonly applied for rainfall forecasting include artificial neural networks anns nasseri et al 2008 aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 moustris et al 2011 fuzzy logic fl pongracz et al 2001 support vector regression svr chau and wu 2010 danandeh mehr et al 2019 and genetic programming gp kisi and shiri 2011 danandeh mehr et al 2017 despite desired flexibility recent studies have shown that stand alone ml methods are not suitable enough for rainfall forecasting at long time scales particularly in arid and semi arid regions where the time series of rainfall is highly discontinuous and probability of zero values are not negligible therefore hybrid ml methods such as wavelet ann nourani et al 2009 wu et al 2010 wavelet svr kisi and cimen 2012 wavelet gp kisi and shiri 2011 adaptive neuro fuzzy anfis partal and kişi 2007 mekanik et al 2016 and wavelet least square svr farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 were developed and recommended for instance singular spectrum analysis ssa was used by sivapragasam et al 2001 to improve forecasting accuracy of svr results genetic algorithm ga was utilized to optimize ann based rainfall forecasting model structures nasseri et al 2008 saxena et al 2014 chau and wu 2010 showed that combination of ssa and fuzzy c means clustering with anns and svr provides considerable accuracy in rainfall forecasting nourani et al 2009 showed that hybrid wavelet ann conjunction model may be effectively used for one month ahead rainfall forecasting at ligvan basin iran kisi and cimen 2012 studied the effect of wavelet decomposition on svr based rainfall forecasting in two meteorology stations in turkey and demonstrated that the hybrid model is able to statistically outperform the stand alone svr and ann models zhu and wu 2013 suggested a hybrid optimization algorithm in which ga is combined with simulated annealing sa to simultaneously choose the proper input variables and optimize svm parameters for monthly rainfall forecasting in guilin of guangxi china solgi et al 2014 showed that wavelet ann conjunction model is superior to anfis to forecast rainfall with one day ahead lead time in a rain gauge station in iran in a recent study firefly optimization technique was applied by yaseen et al 2018 to increase the accuracy of anfis based monthly rainfall forecasting in pahang river basin malaysia the results proved superiority of the hybrid model to the anfis in hydrological studies sa has been widely used as a classic adaptive optimization algorithm to solve different optimization problems in a preliminary study by pardo igúzquiza 1998 a new approach for constructing an optimal network design for the estimation of areal average of rainfall events has been presented the author used sa to optimize the objective function which includes both the accuracy of the areal mean estimation and the economic cost of the data collection in another study by wang et al 2010 neural network based wavelet function was applied to model rainfall runoff process the authors combined sa with ann and showed that the hybrid sa ann approach enables the prediction model to reach global optimal solutions and the hybrid model has superb performance in mapping non linear relations in the data sa has also been combined with ga to improve rainfall runoff forecasting models for instance a hybrid optimization strategy was developed by ding et al 2012 that integrates sa search methodology into ga in order to train and optimize the network architecture and connection weights of anns for rainfall runoff forecasting in a catchment area in a similar study by pan and wu 2014 the hybrid sa ga algorithm was used to simultaneously choose appropriate input variables and optimize all svr parameters for daily rainfall runoff modeling one month ahead forecast of rainfall as a medium to long term scenario is beneficial for many activities in planning and operation of water resource systems such as reservoir management drought monitoring and food production on the other hand forecasts with shorter lead times up to a day are particularly required to drive hydrological rainfall runoff models and operation of flood warning systems the majority of published works has so far focused on creating rainfall forecasting models at short time scales nevertheless there are only a few works investigating the efficiency of hybrid ml techniques for long lead time rainfall forecasting e g mekanik et al 2013 abbot and marohasy 2014 yaseen et al 2018 farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 and therefore additional research is required to model stochastic nature of rainfall events on long term basis the above mentioned review revealed that accurate forecast of monthly rainfall amounts is usually difficult because of underlying nonlinear interrelations between rainfall and its preceding amounts the task is more difficult particularly in arid and semi arid regions where the probability of zero values is not negligible the objective of the present study is therefore to propose a new hybrid model to enhance ability of available ai methods to forecast monthly rainfall amounts at heavily localized semi arid areas furthermore parsimony of rainfall forecasting models as another goal for the first time is taken into account in the present study so that the proposed model could be motivated to be used in practice to achieve these goals power of sa optimizer has been integrated with multi gene gp mggp technique to detect underlying non linear relations precisely despite different applications of sa in hydrological studies to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that couples sa with mggp to improve the forecasting accuracy of mggp based rainfall forecasting models the proposed model called mpsa mggp is trained and validated using monthly rainfall amounts from two meteorology stations in north west of iran that reflect rainfall pattern of semi arid regions step by step modelling procedure of the proposed mpsa mggp model is presented in the next section after a brief overview on the fundamentals of sa and mggp methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated annealing sa sa kirkpatrick et al 1983 is a classic adaptive optimization algorithm that has roots in statistical mechanics statistical mechanic models and analyzes the behavior of systems with large number of atoms in a sample liquid or solid matter the goal of statistical mechanics is to predict and explain the aggregate properties of atoms in a condensed matter during the annealing process in which the temperature approaches the ground state i e when the temperature decrease so much that the system reaches to its lowest energy state in the annealing process first the system is melted at a high temperature then the temperature is decreased slowly according to a pre specified annealing schedule annealing process is traditionally applied to condensed matters to improve or optimize their physical or chemical properties sa benefits from the analogy between the annealing process and the mathematical optimization using the statistical mechanics theory a concise sa algorithm is provided in the pseudo code in fig 1 in fig 1 x0 represents initial solution t0 is the starting temperature m and n are number of stages and moves per stage respectively the parameter α is the cooling schedule parameter ω is the moving operator u is a uniform distribution based acceptance criterion threshold and f x is the objective function 2 2 multi gene gp mggp mggp is multi branch presentation of standard gp koza 1992 in which initial population of potential solutions are gp trees where in standard gp one may manipulate a gene s nodes branches to enhance its goodness of fit features i e the well known natural evolution the evolutionary process in mggp is performed in both node branch and gene scales that may lead to better solutions searson 2015 fundamentals of self structuring standard gp and its advancements either in the framework of dimension less hydrologic modeling or dimensionally aware gp were well documented in the literature e g keijzer and babovic 1999 babovic and keijzer 2000 danandeh mehr et al 2018 thus here we only present a short overview of mggp the mggp hinchliffe et al 1996 also called multi branches gp oliver morales and rodríguez vázquez 2004 is the advanced gp variant that linearly combines low depth gp blocks in order to improve the fitness of solutions evolved by standard gp thus the dependent variable xpre is computed by the weighted outcome of each gene in the multigene chromosome plus a stochastic term referred to bias the simplified mggp model is mathematically expressed by eq 1 1 x pre d 0 d 1 gene 1 d 2 gene 2 d i gene i where the genei is mathematical expression of standard gp for the ith gene evolved for the input parameters d0 is bias term and d1 d2 di are the gene weights i e regression coefficients that are generally determined by the ordinary least squares method searson 2015 the index i represents the number of maximum genes specified by the modeler for the problem at hand as an example fig 2 illustrates a pseudo linear mggp model in which the dependent variable is a function of three function each represented by a gene of the given input variables x1 x2 and x2 the functions add3 mult3 sqrt and sin in the figure respectively denote addition with tree argument multiplication with three arguments square root and sinus functions examples of mggp based hydrologic models are available in the recent studies of eray et al 2018 as well as danandeh mehr and nourani 2018 for more details about mggp and its evolutionary processes interested readers are referred to hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 2 3 new hybrid mpsa mggp model for monthly rainfall forecasting understanding the rules among cumulative rainfall amounts at successive months has been a challenging subject for research generally most of the stochastic models that are available for rainfall forecasting in long time scales such as monthly are based on the ml methods inasmuch as the relationship between the successive rainfall amounts is highly nonlinear contaminated with noises danandeh mehr et al 2019 hence stand alone ml techniques are not accurate enough to map such nonlinear behavior nasseri et al 2008 mekanik et al 2016 in such cases hybrid ml models benefited from either data pre processing or post processing techniques may provide more satisfactory results bearing in mind that they are case sensitive and may exhibit dissimilar performance in different regions the proposed mpsa mggp is a hybrid model that uses a simple data pre processing approach explained later in this section as well as sa optimizer as a post processing tool to increase mggp based forecasting accuracy sa has a metropolis acceptance criterion metropolis et al 1953 inherited from statistical mechanics that allows escaping local optimums and reach the global optimum in an extremely non linear solution space this feature makes sa a powerful technique to reflect the periodic e g monthly patterns in the extremely non linear rainfall data and improve the rainfall forecasting models more specifically the metropolis acceptance criterion provides a generalization of iterative improvement in which controlled uphill steps can also be incorporated in the search for a better solution kirkpatrick et al 1983 the idea here is first preprocessing the data and then the use of mggp method to construct an initial rainfall forecasting model next sa is used to re optimize and post process the initial pareto optimal mggp model into periodic forecasting model as both sa and mggp are metaheuristic models the new hybrid mpsa mggp approach is deployed in metaheuristic modelling category chau 2017 it is well known that monthly rainfall time series is composed of three basic properties of tendency periodicity and stochasticity salas 1980 yevjevich 1987 the seasonality and trend components as deterministic components are usually separated from the main time series first using some data pre processing method and then the stochastic component is modelled after forecasting the stochastic component these components should be added to the forecasted stochastic component following this common method in classic time series forecasting the proposed mpsa mggp model see fig 3 includes three main phases of data pre processing first phase modeling second phase and post processing annealing third phase in the first phase a certain type of data pre processing method recommended by delleur and kavvas 1978 are used to standardized input output variables and remove their nonstationary features in this phase total monthly rainfall tmr series are square root transformed and then standardized so that they have zero mean and unit variance by subtracting the monthly means trend in the mean is removed and the variance is reduced such process yields in a weak stationary time series that is satisfied for practical applications delleur and kavvas 1978 in the second phase i e modelling phase the stand alone mggp is used to drive a parsimonious multigene model with the specified number of genes to select a parsimony model a trade off analysis between model complexity and accuracy is accomplished using pareto front method suggested by danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 it is worth mentioning that the number of input vectors defined in the first phase is also optimized in this phase through evolutionary search algorithm that exists in mggp in the third phase post processing phase the proposed multi period sa approach is used to improve the pareto optimal multigene model obtained in the second phase the mpsa is a probabilistic technique based on the sa and random search that accepts an initial input solution and then optimizes the solution considering a given objective function the general mathematical expression for the objective function of the proposed mpsa is 2 z min d r i r j f d g d ω where z is the objective function d is the multi period matrix of gene weights i e the input decision variables to be optimized ɡ is the gene function ω is an adjustable move operator determined by the annealing method f is the fitness function e g mean square error considering training data set i is the number of genes and j is the number of periods the lower the value of z the better the mggp model one important point in this phase is the minimum possible value for the z let s say z here that should be defined carefully as mpsa might result in an overfitting model for some periods in such cases the gene weights produced by mpsa must be ignored and replaced with those of pareto optimal mggp model at the given period the idea behind the proposed approach is to perform an energy guided search of the mggp model space using the analogy with the stepwise annealing schedule in this way mpsa performs a global search of the input matrix d such that the resulting z value gets closer to z value than the initial z value of the mggp model while avoiding the over fit situation as a simple example for the proposed mpsa method lets return to the vector of gene weights given in eq 1 if this is a pareto optimal mggp solution then the proposed mpsa model constructs the input matrix of d as given below 3 d d 00 d 01 d 02 d 0 i d 10 d 11 d 12 d 1 i d 20 d 21 d 22 d 2 i d j 0 d j 1 d j 2 d ji where the index i represents the number of maximum genes selected for a given problem and the index j denotes the maximum number of periods in the phenomenon in monthly rainfall forecasting the index j is set to 12 months thus each row of the multi period matrix d represents the vector of gene weights for one specific month given the multi period matrix d we have the following equation 4 x k pre g d k where dk is the kth row vector of matrix d and ɡ is the gene function obtained from the pareto optimal mggp model the xk pre is the predicted rainfall for kth month using the vector of the predicted rainfall data x pre and the vector of observed rainfall data x obs a fitness function f is defined as for instance the root mean square error rmse between the vectors x pre and x obs in each step of the mpsa a single trial solution for the matrix d is modified at random using a move operator ω then the defined fitness function f is used to evaluate the energy the goodness of the modified solution d the goal is the acquisition of a better solution through minimizing the total energy changes which lead to a lower energy are always accepted an increase is probabilistically accepted where the probability is given by e δ t where δ is the change in energy and t is the temperature initially the temperature is high corresponding to a melting state where momentous changes in energy levels are possible the temperature is gradually reduced using a cooling schedule so allowing smaller changes until the system freezes at a low energy solution vecchi and kirkpatrick 1983 in this paper the cost function e g rmse plays the role of total energy therefore we use the cost function in place of the energy and we define configurations by the set of rainfall forecasting parameters to re optimize the rainfall forecasting model at some effective temperature this temperature is simply a control parameter in our model in the same units as the cost function kirkpatrick et al 1983 to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study in the literature that construct the multi period matrix for gene weights and use the optimal matrix values for improving a multigene forecasting model one of the main advantages of the proposed mpsa algorithm is that it does not increase the number of genes deployed for the forecasting the proposed mpsa method uses the same multigene model in conjunction with the optimized gene weight matrix and provides better forecasting results another advantage of the proposed mpsa approach is that it reflects the effect of periodic patterns into the mggp model also the proposed mpsa is fast because it works on one solution and it does not carry a population of solutions which require more computation power as sa is applied on the constructed multi period matrix and optimizes the matrix we call the new algorithm mpsa multi period simulated annealing in the following case studies we partition the rainfall training dataset for the mpsa into 12 separate subsets where each of them belongs to a specific period here a month then we optimize the variables at each row of the multi period matrix i e the row dk using its corresponding period subset for the proposed mpsa algorithm we consider rmse measure as the objective function to be minimized this is a quadratic scoring rule which measures the average magnitude of the error at training data set 2 4 case studies the proposed pareto optimal mpsa mggp model was trained and verified using cumulative rainfall series over successive months i e discrete tmr from two meteorology stations namely tabriz and urmia located in urmia lake basin a semiarid region at north west of iran fig 4 a long term average of rainfall in the country is about 250 mm per year with a maximum rate in spring months mehr et al 2018 fig 4b depicts the observed tmr time series for the recent 25 years january 1990 to december 2014 at each stations the statistical and geographical features of the stations were listed in table 1 2 5 efficiency criteria nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse eq 5 as a relative error measure and rmse eq 6 as an absolute error measure were used in our study to compare the proficiency of the forecasting models while the nse shows how the observed and estimated data scatter around best fit line the rmse reveals the mean difference between them any hydro environmental forecasting method can be sufficiently evaluated by these two criteria but others may also be used 5 nse 1 i 1 n x i obs x i pre 2 i 1 n x i obs x mean obs 2 6 rmse i 1 n x i obs x i pre 2 n where x i obs and x i pre are observed and forecasted value of monthly rainfall x respectively x mean obs is mean value of observed rainfall series comprising n months observations 2 6 selection of optimal lags model inputs selection of optimal set of lags i e independent variables is an important task in ml based models it may lead to a parsimonious solution in a short run time in contrast inadequate or extra lags typically yields in poor cumbersome solutions danandeh mehr et al 2018 in the context of time series modeling dominant lags may identify via correlogram analysis or trial and error method fig 5 shows the auto correlation acf and partial auto correlation pacf functions of rainfall series at the stations the acf encompass annual periodicity i e 12 month period such year to year serial dependency of monthly rainfall values has been also discussed in previous studies delleur and kavvas 1978 aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 danandeh mehr et al 2018 furthermore pacf diagrams illustrate more correlation between tmr at the current month r t and those of lag 1 lag 11 lag 12 and lag 24 consequently 1 11 12 and 24 month lags were selected as the extent of optimal set of lags eq 7 used for one month ahead rainfall forecasting in the present study 7 r t f r t 1 r t 11 r t 12 r t 24 ε t the indices t 1 and t 11 are referred to as 1 month 11 month lags and so on the ε t is the bias term 3 results and discussion to attain the best stand alone gp and mggp models i e benchmarks at each rain gauge station two open source gp toolbox written in matlab language i e gplabv4 silva and almeida 2003 and gptips2 searson 2015 were used in the present study the former includes most of the standard gp rules with highly modular structure that makes it a particularly versatile and easily extendable tool for creating classic gp solutions by contrast the latter stands on the multigene variant of gp that drives the automatic multigene solutions in a least square sense to use these toolboxes their default setups were used with some minor manipulation as itemized below rmse was used as the fitness function the smaller the rmse the better adaptation of the model to the observed data basic arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication and protected division together with sin and tan functions were used in function set standardized tmr series i e independent variables see eq 7 as well as a set of random floating point numbers in the range 1 0 1 0 were used in order to increase genetic diversity in terminal set the other parameters methods used for stand alone gp and mggp setup have been tabulated in table 2 these are user specified values methods that were set on the basis of the authors experience as well as trial and error procedure maximum values of genes and tree depth were selected with respect to the complexity of the solutions so that they are not over trained regarding the rate of genetic operations the applied mutation rate is ratter high as the observed time series are highly discontinuous with little to no connection between each month this underpins that the tmr series are largely random and gp mggp tends to fluctuate around the observable mean of training sets in both stations thus by choosing higher mutation rates gp mggp creates diverse population of solutions at each generation that impede the tendency of trapping into local optima we presented the findings for the best evolved gp and mggp models in table 3 it is seen that mggp provides slightly better generalization ability than standard gp comparing the results of testing period the highest improvement about 30 in nse was obtained at urmia station however the nse results are not in a desired level of accuracy yet to cope with the problem the pareto optimal mggp solutions as the winner at a competition between gp and mggp were selected to be additionally improved through the proposed mpsa algorithm as illustrated in fig 3 to this end first pareto diagrams of best evolved mggp models at each station are depicted as illustrated in fig 6 then the pareto optimal solution the individuals circled in black in fig 6 are selected so that it secures not more than 10 decrease in model efficiency neither at training nor at validation periods the mathematical expression of pareto optimal mggp models at tabriz and urmia stations were presented in eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 x pre

periods j is set to 12 in the present study therefore the gene function ɡ see eq 4 to run the mpsa algorithm at tabriz and urmia station can be constructed as eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 x k pre d k

solution space of the gene coefficients at the multi period matrix aiming at minimizing rmse at the training period the summaries of parameter setup used to run mpsa algorithm were given it table 4 the optimum multi period matrices of gene coefficients obtained for tabriz and urmia stations were given at tables 5 and 6 respectively performance indices of the pareto optimal mggp and pareto optimal mpsa mggp models are compared in table 7 the results revealed that the pareto optimal multigene structures improved by optimum multi period gene coefficients provide more accurate forecasts according to the results at the validation period the pareto optimal mpsa mggp provides better fit than pareto optimal mggp and therefore it can be more useful for generalization on the focus of the average results the table implied that the mpsa improves the mggp forecasts with approximately 12 0 13 0 decrease in rmse and around 49 0 56 0 increase in nse promising accuracy together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice the observed and forecasted tmr series and their scatter plots during the validation period were shown in fig 7 the right column of the figure shows both models are more or less capable of capturing the periodic pattern of the observed data one remarkable aspect is that our stochastic model is capable of better mimicking the both local and global maxima than the benchmark the outcome is consistent with earlier studies e g wang et al 2010 that justify the power of sa in achieving global optimal solutions for ann based rainfall runoff models even though the mpsa mggp model improves the mggp forecasts markedly the left column of the figure illustrates that the new forecasts are not at the desired level of accuracy yet therefore further studies to develop more accurate models for long lead time rainfall forecasting in the case study region is inevitable in fig 8 the monthly results for rmse measure in validation period are summarized according to the monthly rmse values the mpsa mggp model results in either similar or lower forecasting error than the pareto optimal mggp model in validation period the forecasting error of both pareto optimal mggp and mpsa mggp models are identical in some months particularly in urmia rain gauge which implies the proposed model optimized the pareto optimal mggp model where it produces high errors 4 conclusion in this study a new pareto optimal multi period simulated annealing multigene genetic programming model mpsa mggp was developed to month ahead forecast of total monthly rainfall tmr in a semi arid region rainfall records from two rain gauges located in urmia lake basin were used to train and verify the model the original tmr observations were transformed into weak stationary time series and imported to mggp engine to construct initial pareto optimal multigene regression model that uses 1 11 12 and 24 month lags of the time series as predictors eventually a new mpsa optimization algorithm was applied to construct and optimize a multi period matrix of gene weights which is embodied into the original mggp model the proposed hybrid mpsa mggp method demonstrates the periodic behaviour in the data and results in higher forecasting accuracy the rainfall prediction results indicated that the mpsa mggp was the most suitable model which significantly outperformed the benchmarks on both case study stations in fact utilization of the mpsa as an external optimizer for mggp resulted in the acquisition of a robust system that leads to significant improvement i e 49 56 in terms of nse in the predictive accuracy owing to the optimal values of periodic gene weights attained in the hybrid model the reason behind such improvement has also root in the inherent periodic patterns in the extremely non linear rainfall data annual periodicity due to the fact that the monthly rainfall at the stations is more correlated to its previous year amount than that of previous months considering the previous studies it must be stated that neither ad hoc ann aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 nor svr feng et al 2015 mehr et al 2018 were capable of truly modelling tmr in arid regions this emphasise the complexity of the process and therefore one may need hybrid approaches to achieve a favorable forecasts the reason behind may rely on the binary wet or dry sequences of months that underpins the cumulative rainfall amount is largely random moreover there exists other uncertainties originating from natural variability of local climate that does not include in historical behaviour the proposed hybrid model employed the power of sa and mggp algorithms to address these difficulties and showed that the hybrid pareto optimal mpsa mggp model is capable of decreasing predictive errors of standalone gp and mggp models however the authors believe that there is still room for more investigations about long term rainfall forecasting particularly in arid regions our study was limited to a i month ahead forecasting scenario using historical rainfall observations and a ii simple data pre processing approach for the efficient use of the rainfall forecasts in practice one way for future work includes adopting both historical rainfall and oceanic atmospheric circulation factors as model inputs for mpsa mggp algorithm moreover efficiency of the proposed algorithm could be investigated to forecast monthly streamflow as well as rainfall with longer lead times finally effect of advanced data pre processing approaches like wavelet decomposition on the efficiency of mpsa mggp can be investigated in future studies conflict of interest none acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant

6655,rainfall is considered the hardest weather variable to forecast and its cause effect relationships often cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms this study introduces a novel hybrid model to month ahead forecasting monthly rainfall amounts which is motivated to be used in semi arid basins the new approach called mpsa mggp is based on integrating multi period simulated annealing mpsa optimizer with multigene genetic programming mggp symbolic regression so that the hybrid model reflects the periodic patterns in rainfall time series into a pareto optimal multigene forecasting equation the model was trained and verified using observed rainfall at two meteorology stations located in north west of iran the model accuracy was also cross validated against two benchmarks conventional genetic programming gp and mggp the results indicated that the proposed gene annealing model provides slight to moderate decline in absolute error as well as noteworthy augment in nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency promising efficiency together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice particularly in semi arid regions keywords rainfall time series forecasting multigene genetic programming simulated annealing semiarid region 1 introduction medium to long term forecasts of rainfall amount are required for many practical purposes in watershed management such as optimal irrigation food production water allocation mine operations management of water infrastructure and flood preventive measures however it is known as one of the most challenging tasks in forecasting community mekanik et al 2013 abbot and marohasy 2014 feng et al 2015 farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 to realize the underling process a number of physically based and stochastic probabilistic models and approaches have been established in the literature stochastic modelling of rainfall events for long time scales such as monthly and seasonal has been attempted in earlier studies using classical time series modeling approaches such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima seasonal arima sarima and periodic autoregressive moving average parma e g delleur and kavvas 1978 kaushik and singh 2008 despite being popular these are basically linear models and incapable of truly capturing the irregularities of rainfall cramer et al 2018 they can be applied for stationary time series when month to month or season to season correlations do not vary throughout the year salas et al 2003 nourani et al 2009 machine learning ml methods are seen as robust alternatives and have become more popular over recent years those of ml methods commonly applied for rainfall forecasting include

c means clustering with anns and svr provides considerable accuracy in rainfall forecasting nourani et al 2009 showed that hybrid wavelet ann conjunction model may be effectively used for one month ahead rainfall forecasting at ligvan basin iran kisi and cimen 2012 studied the effect of wavelet decomposition on svr based rainfall forecasting in two meteorology stations in turkey and demonstrated that the hybrid model is able to statistically outperform the stand alone svr and ann models zhu and wu 2013 suggested a hybrid optimization algorithm in which ga is combined with simulated annealing sa to simultaneously choose the proper input variables and optimize svm parameters for monthly rainfall forecasting in guilin of guangxi china solgi et al 2014 showed that wavelet ann conjunction model is superior to anfis to forecast rainfall with one day ahead lead time in a rain gauge station in iran in a recent study firefly optimization technique was applied by yaseen et al 2018 to increase the accuracy of anfis based monthly rainfall forecasting in pahang river basin malaysia the results proved superiority of the hybrid model to the anfis in hydrological studies sa has been widely used as a classic adaptive optimization algorithm to solve different optimization problems in a preliminary study by pardo igúzquiza 1998 a new approach for constructing an optimal network design for the estimation of areal average of rainfall events has been presented the author used sa to optimize the objective function which includes both the accuracy of the areal mean estimation and the economic cost of the data collection in another study by wang et al 2010 neural network based wavelet function was applied to model rainfall runoff process the authors combined sa with ann and showed that the hybrid sa ann approach enables the prediction model to reach global optimal solutions and the hybrid model has superb performance in mapping non linear relations in the data sa has also been combined with ga to improve rainfall runoff forecasting models for instance a hybrid optimization strategy was developed by ding et al 2012 that integrates sa search methodology into ga in order to train and optimize the network architecture and connection weights of anns for rainfall runoff forecasting in a catchment area in a similar study by pan and wu 2014 the hybrid sa ga algorithm was used to simultaneously choose appropriate input variables and optimize all svr parameters for daily rainfall runoff modeling one month ahead forecast of rainfall as a medium to long term scenario is beneficial for many activities in planning and operation of water resource systems such as reservoir management drought monitoring and food production on the other hand forecasts with shorter lead times up to a day are particularly required to drive hydrological rainfall runoff models and operation of flood warning systems the majority of published works has so far focused on creating rainfall forecasting models at short time scales nevertheless there are only a few works investigating the efficiency of hybrid ml techniques for long lead time rainfall forecasting e g mekanik et al 2013 abbot and marohasy 2014 yaseen et al 2018 farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 and therefore additional research is required to model stochastic nature of rainfall events on long term basis the above mentioned review revealed that accurate forecast of monthly rainfall amounts is usually difficult because of underlying nonlinear interrelations between rainfall and its preceding amounts the task is more difficult particularly in arid and semi arid regions where the probability of zero values is not negligible the objective of the present study is therefore to propose a new hybrid model to enhance ability of available ai methods to forecast monthly rainfall amounts at heavily localized semi arid areas furthermore parsimony of rainfall forecasting models as another goal for the first time is taken into account in the present study so that the proposed model could be motivated to be used in practice to achieve these goals power of sa optimizer has been integrated with multi gene gp mggp technique to detect underlying non linear relations precisely despite different applications of sa in hydrological studies to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that couples sa with mggp to improve the forecasting accuracy of mggp based rainfall forecasting models the proposed model called mpsa mggp is trained and validated using monthly rainfall amounts from two meteorology stations in north west of iran that reflect rainfall pattern of semi arid regions step by step modelling procedure of the proposed mpsa mggp model is presented in the next section after a brief overview on the fundamentals of sa and mggp methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated annealing sa sa kirkpatrick et al 1983 is a classic adaptive optimization algorithm that has roots in statistical mechanics statistical mechanic models and analyzes the behavior of systems with large number of atoms in a sample liquid or solid matter the goal of statistical mechanics is to predict and explain the aggregate properties of atoms in a condensed matter during the annealing process in which the temperature approaches the ground state i e when the temperature decrease so much that the system reaches to its lowest energy state in the annealing process first the system is melted at a high temperature then the temperature is decreased slowly according to a pre specified annealing schedule annealing process is traditionally applied to condensed matters to improve or optimize their physical or chemical properties sa benefits from the analogy between the annealing process and the mathematical optimization using the statistical mechanics theory a concise sa algorithm is provided in the pseudo code in fig 1 in fig 1 x0 represents initial solution t0 is the starting temperature m and n are number of stages and moves per stage respectively the parameter α is the cooling schedule parameter ω is the moving operator u is a uniform distribution based acceptance criterion threshold and f x is the objective function 2 2 multi gene gp mggp mggp is multi branch presentation of standard gp koza 1992 in which initial population of potential solutions are gp trees where in standard gp one may manipulate a gene s nodes branches to enhance its goodness of fit features i e the well known natural evolution the evolutionary process in mggp is performed in both node branch and gene scales that may lead to better solutions searson 2015 fundamentals of self structuring standard gp and its advancements either in the framework of dimension less hydrologic modeling or dimensionally aware gp were well documented in the literature e g keijzer and babovic 1999 babovic and keijzer 2000 danandeh mehr et al 2018 thus here we only present a short overview of mggp the mggp hinchliffe et al 1996 also called multi branches gp oliver morales and rodríguez vázquez 2004 is the advanced gp variant that linearly combines low depth gp blocks in order to improve the fitness of solutions evolved by standard gp thus the dependent variable xpre is computed by the weighted outcome of each gene in the multigene chromosome plus a stochastic term referred to bias the simplified mggp model is mathematically expressed by eq 1 1 x pre d 0 d 1 gene 1 d 2 gene 2 d i gene i where the genei is mathematical expression of standard gp for the ith gene evolved for the input parameters d0 is bias term and d1 d2 di are the gene weights i e regression coefficients that are generally determined by the ordinary least squares method searson 2015 the index i represents the number of maximum genes specified by the modeler for the problem at hand as an example fig 2 illustrates a pseudo linear mggp model in which the dependent variable is a function of three function each represented by a gene of the given input variables x1 x2 and x2 the functions add3 mult3 sqrt and sin in the figure respectively denote addition with tree argument multiplication with three arguments square root and sinus functions examples of mggp based hydrologic models are available in the recent studies of eray et al 2018 as well as danandeh mehr and nourani 2018 for more details about mggp and its evolutionary processes interested readers are referred to hrnjica and danandeh mehr 2019 2 3 new hybrid mpsa mggp model for monthly rainfall forecasting understanding the rules among cumulative rainfall amounts at successive months has been a challenging subject for research generally most of the stochastic models that are available for rainfall forecasting in long time scales such as monthly are based on the ml methods inasmuch as the relationship between the successive rainfall amounts is highly nonlinear contaminated with noises danandeh mehr et al 2019 hence stand alone ml techniques are not accurate enough to map such nonlinear behavior nasseri et al 2008 mekanik et al 2016 in such cases hybrid ml models benefited from either data pre processing or post processing techniques may provide more satisfactory results bearing in mind that they are case sensitive and may exhibit dissimilar performance in different regions the proposed mpsa mggp is a hybrid model that uses a simple data pre processing approach explained later in this section as well as sa optimizer as a post processing tool to increase mggp based forecasting accuracy sa has a metropolis acceptance criterion metropolis et al 1953 inherited from statistical mechanics that allows escaping local optimums and reach the global optimum in an extremely non linear solution space this feature makes sa a powerful technique to reflect the periodic e g monthly patterns in the extremely non linear rainfall data and improve the rainfall forecasting models more specifically the metropolis acceptance criterion provides a generalization of iterative improvement in which controlled uphill steps can also be incorporated in the search for a better solution kirkpatrick et al 1983 the idea here is first preprocessing the data and then the use of mggp method to construct an initial rainfall forecasting model next sa is used to re optimize and post process the initial pareto optimal mggp model into periodic forecasting model as both sa and mggp are metaheuristic models the new hybrid mpsa mggp approach is deployed in metaheuristic modelling category chau 2017 it is well known that monthly rainfall time series is composed of three basic properties of tendency periodicity and stochasticity salas 1980 yevjevich 1987 the seasonality and trend components as deterministic components are usually separated from the main time series first using some data pre processing method and then the stochastic component is modelled after forecasting the stochastic component these components should be added to the forecasted stochastic component following this common method in classic time series forecasting the proposed mpsa mggp model see fig 3 includes three main phases of data pre processing first phase modeling second phase and post processing annealing third phase in the first phase a certain type of data pre processing method recommended by delleur and kavvas 1978 are used to standardized input output variables and remove their nonstationary features in this phase total monthly rainfall tmr series are square root transformed and then standardized so that they have zero mean and unit variance by subtracting the monthly means trend in the mean is removed and the variance is reduced such process yields in a weak stationary time series that is satisfied for practical applications delleur and kavvas 1978 in the second phase i e modelling phase the stand alone mggp is used to drive a parsimonious multigene model with the specified number of genes to select a parsimony model a trade off analysis between model complexity and accuracy is accomplished using pareto front method suggested by danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 it is worth mentioning that the number of input vectors defined in the first phase is also optimized in this phase through evolutionary search algorithm that exists in mggp in the third phase post processing phase the proposed multi period sa approach is used to improve the pareto optimal multigene model obtained in the second phase the mpsa is a probabilistic technique based on the sa and random search that accepts an initial input solution and then optimizes the solution considering a given objective function the general mathematical expression for the objective function of the proposed mpsa is 2 z min d r i r j f d g d ω where z is the objective function d is the multi period matrix of gene weights i e the input decision variables to be optimized ɡ is the gene function ω is an adjustable move operator determined by the annealing method f is the fitness function e g mean square error considering training data set i is the number of genes and j is the number of periods the lower the value of z the better the mggp model one important point in this phase is the minimum possible value for the z let s say z here that should be defined carefully as mpsa might result in an overfitting model for some periods in such cases the gene weights produced by mpsa must be ignored and replaced with those of pareto optimal mggp model at the given period the idea behind the proposed approach is to perform an energy guided search of the mggp model space using the analogy with the stepwise annealing schedule in this way mpsa performs a global search of the input matrix d such that the resulting z value gets closer to z value than the initial z value of the mggp model while avoiding the over fit situation as a simple example for the proposed mpsa method lets return to the vector of gene weights given in eq 1 if this is a pareto optimal mggp solution then the proposed mpsa model constructs the input matrix of d as given below 3 d d 00 d 01 d 02 d 0 i d 10 d 11 d 12 d 1 i d 20 d 21 d 22 d 2 i d j 0 d j 1 d j 2 d ji where the index i represents the number of maximum genes selected for a given problem and the index j denotes the maximum number of periods in the phenomenon in monthly rainfall forecasting the index j is set to 12 months thus each row of the multi period matrix d represents the vector of gene weights for one specific month given the multi period matrix d we have the following equation 4 x k pre g d k where dk is the kth row vector of matrix d and ɡ is the gene function obtained from the pareto optimal mggp model the xk pre is the predicted rainfall for kth month using the vector of the predicted rainfall data x pre and the vector of observed rainfall data x obs a fitness function f is defined as for instance the root mean square error rmse between the vectors x pre and x obs in each step of the mpsa a single trial solution for the matrix d is modified at random using a move operator ω then the defined fitness function f is used to evaluate the energy the goodness of the modified solution d the goal is the acquisition of a better solution through minimizing the total energy changes which lead to a lower energy are always accepted an increase is probabilistically accepted where the probability is given by e δ t where δ is the change in energy and t is the temperature initially the temperature is high corresponding to a melting state where momentous changes in energy levels are possible the temperature is gradually reduced using a cooling schedule so allowing smaller changes until the system freezes at a low energy solution vecchi and kirkpatrick 1983 in this paper the cost function e g rmse plays the role of total energy therefore we use the cost function in place of the energy and we define configurations by the set of rainfall forecasting parameters to re optimize the rainfall forecasting model at some effective temperature this temperature is simply a control parameter in our model in the same units as the cost function kirkpatrick et al 1983 to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study in the literature that construct the multi period matrix for gene weights and use the optimal matrix values for improving a multigene forecasting model one of the main advantages of the proposed mpsa algorithm is that it does not increase the number of genes deployed for the forecasting the proposed mpsa method uses the same multigene model in conjunction with the optimized gene weight matrix and provides better forecasting results another advantage of the proposed mpsa approach is that it reflects the effect of periodic patterns into the mggp model also the proposed mpsa is fast because it works on one solution and it does not carry a population of solutions which require more computation power as sa is applied on the constructed multi period matrix and optimizes the matrix we call the new algorithm mpsa multi period simulated annealing in the following case studies we partition the rainfall training dataset for the mpsa into 12 separate subsets where each of them belongs to a specific period here a month then we optimize the variables at each row of the multi period matrix i e the row dk using its corresponding period subset for the proposed mpsa algorithm we consider rmse measure as the objective function to be minimized this is a quadratic scoring rule which measures the average magnitude of the error at training data set 2 4 case studies the proposed pareto optimal mpsa mggp model was trained and verified using cumulative rainfall series over successive months i e discrete tmr from two meteorology stations namely tabriz and urmia located in urmia lake basin a semiarid region at north west of iran fig 4 a long term average of rainfall in the country is about 250 mm per year with a maximum rate in spring months mehr et al 2018 fig 4b depicts the observed tmr time series for the recent 25 years january 1990 to december 2014 at each stations the statistical and geographical features of the stations were listed in table 1 2 5 efficiency criteria nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse eq 5 as a relative error measure and rmse eq 6 as an absolute error measure were used in our study to compare the proficiency of the forecasting models while the nse shows how the observed and estimated data scatter around best fit line the rmse reveals the mean difference between them any hydro environmental forecasting method can be sufficiently evaluated by these two criteria but others may also be used 5 nse 1 i 1 n x i obs x i pre 2 i 1 n x i obs x mean obs 2 6 rmse i 1 n x i obs x i pre 2 n where x i obs and x i pre are observed and forecasted value of monthly rainfall x respectively x mean obs is mean value of observed rainfall series comprising n months observations 2 6 selection of optimal lags model inputs selection of optimal set of lags i e independent variables is an important task in ml based models it may lead to a parsimonious solution in a short run time in contrast inadequate or extra lags typically yields in poor cumbersome solutions danandeh mehr et al 2018 in the context of time series modeling dominant lags may identify via correlogram analysis or trial and error method fig 5 shows the auto correlation acf and partial auto correlation pacf functions of rainfall series at the stations the acf encompass annual periodicity i e 12 month period such year to year serial dependency of monthly rainfall values has been also discussed in previous studies delleur and kavvas 1978 aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 danandeh mehr et al 2018 furthermore pacf diagrams illustrate more correlation between tmr at the current month r t and those of lag 1 lag 11 lag 12 and lag 24 consequently 1 11 12 and 24 month lags were selected as the extent of optimal set of lags eq 7 used for one month ahead rainfall forecasting in the present study 7 r t f r t 1 r t 11 r t 12 r t 24 ε t the indices t 1 and t 11 are referred to as 1 month 11 month lags and so on the ε t is the bias term 3 results and discussion to attain the best stand alone gp and mggp models i e benchmarks at each rain gauge station two open source gp toolbox written in matlab language i e gplabv4 silva and almeida 2003 and gptips2 searson 2015 were used in the present study the former includes most of the standard gp rules with highly modular structure that makes it a particularly versatile and easily extendable tool for creating classic gp solutions by contrast the latter stands on the multigene variant of gp that drives the automatic multigene solutions in a least square sense to use these toolboxes their default setups were used with some minor manipulation as itemized below rmse was used as the fitness function the smaller the rmse the better adaptation of the model to the observed data basic arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication and protected division together with sin and tan functions were used in function set standardized tmr series i e independent variables see eq 7 as well as a set of random floating point numbers in the range 1 0 1 0 were used in order to increase genetic diversity in terminal set the other parameters methods used for stand alone gp and mggp setup have been tabulated in table 2 these are user specified values methods that were set on the basis of the authors experience as well as trial and error procedure maximum values of genes and tree depth were selected with respect to the complexity of the solutions so that they are not over trained regarding the rate of genetic operations the applied mutation rate is ratter high as the observed time series are highly discontinuous with little to no connection between each month this underpins that the tmr series are largely random and gp mggp tends to fluctuate around the observable mean of training sets in both stations thus by choosing higher mutation rates gp mggp creates diverse population of solutions at each generation that impede the tendency of trapping into local optima we presented the findings for the best evolved gp and mggp models in table 3 it is seen that mggp provides slightly better generalization ability than standard gp comparing the results of testing period the highest improvement about 30 in nse was obtained at urmia station however the nse results are not in a desired level of accuracy yet to cope with the problem the pareto optimal mggp solutions as the winner at a competition between gp and mggp were selected to be additionally improved through the proposed mpsa algorithm as illustrated in fig 3 to this end first pareto diagrams of best evolved mggp models at each station are depicted as illustrated in fig 6 then the pareto optimal solution the individuals circled in black in fig 6 are selected so that it secures not more than 10 decrease in model efficiency neither at training nor at validation periods the mathematical expression of pareto optimal mggp models at tabriz and urmia stations were presented in eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 x pre

solution space of the gene coefficients at the multi period matrix aiming at minimizing rmse at the training period the summaries of parameter setup used to run mpsa algorithm were given it table 4 the optimum multi period matrices of gene coefficients obtained for tabriz and urmia stations were given at tables 5 and 6 respectively performance indices of the pareto optimal mggp and pareto optimal mpsa mggp models are compared in table 7 the results revealed that the pareto optimal multigene structures improved by optimum multi period gene coefficients provide more accurate forecasts according to the results at the validation period the pareto optimal mpsa mggp provides better fit than pareto optimal mggp and therefore it can be more useful for generalization on the focus of the average results the table implied that the mpsa improves the mggp forecasts with approximately 12 0 13 0 decrease in rmse and around 49 0 56 0 increase in nse promising accuracy together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice the observed and forecasted tmr series and their scatter plots during the validation period were shown in fig 7 the right column of the figure shows both models are more or less capable of capturing the periodic pattern of the observed data one remarkable aspect is that our stochastic model is capable of better mimicking the both local and global maxima than the benchmark the outcome is consistent with earlier studies e g wang et al 2010 that justify the power of sa in achieving global optimal solutions for ann based rainfall runoff models even though the mpsa mggp model improves the mggp forecasts markedly the left column of the figure illustrates that the new forecasts are not at the desired level of accuracy yet therefore further studies to develop more accurate models for long lead time rainfall forecasting in the case study region is inevitable in fig 8 the monthly results for rmse measure in validation period are summarized according to the monthly rmse values the mpsa mggp model results in either similar or lower forecasting error than the pareto optimal mggp model in validation period the forecasting error of both pareto optimal mggp and mpsa mggp models are identical in some months particularly in urmia rain gauge which implies the proposed model optimized the pareto optimal mggp model where it produces high errors 4 conclusion in this study a new pareto optimal multi period simulated annealing multigene genetic programming model mpsa mggp was developed to month ahead forecast of total monthly rainfall tmr in a semi arid region rainfall records from two rain gauges located in urmia lake basin were used to train and verify the model the original tmr observations were transformed into weak stationary time series and imported to mggp engine to construct initial pareto optimal multigene regression model that uses 1 11 12 and 24 month lags of the time series as predictors eventually a new mpsa optimization algorithm was applied to construct and optimize a multi period matrix of gene weights which is embodied into the original mggp model the proposed hybrid mpsa mggp method demonstrates the periodic behaviour in the data and results in higher forecasting accuracy the rainfall prediction results indicated that the mpsa mggp was the most suitable model which significantly outperformed the benchmarks on both case study stations in fact utilization of the mpsa as an external optimizer for mggp resulted in the acquisition of a robust system that leads to significant improvement i e 49 56 in terms of nse in the predictive accuracy owing to the optimal values of periodic gene weights attained in the hybrid model the reason behind such improvement has also root in the inherent periodic patterns in the extremely non linear rainfall data annual periodicity due to the fact that the monthly rainfall at the stations is more correlated to its previous year amount than that of previous months considering the previous studies it must be stated that neither ad hoc ann aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 nor svr feng et al 2015 mehr et al 2018 were capable of truly modelling tmr in arid regions this emphasise the complexity of the process and therefore one may need hybrid approaches to achieve a favorable forecasts the reason behind may rely on the binary wet or dry sequences of months that underpins the cumulative rainfall amount is largely random moreover there exists other uncertainties originating from natural variability of local climate that does not include in historical behaviour the proposed hybrid model employed the power of sa and mggp algorithms to address these difficulties and showed that the hybrid pareto optimal mpsa mggp model is capable of decreasing predictive errors of standalone gp and mggp models however the authors believe that there is still room for more investigations about long term rainfall forecasting particularly in arid regions our study was limited to a i month ahead forecasting scenario using historical rainfall observations and a ii simple data pre processing approach for the efficient use of the rainfall forecasts in practice one way for future work includes adopting both historical rainfall and oceanic atmospheric circulation factors as model inputs for mpsa mggp algorithm moreover efficiency of the proposed algorithm could be investigated to forecast monthly streamflow as well as rainfall with longer lead times finally effect of advanced data pre processing approaches like wavelet decomposition on the efficiency of mpsa mggp can be investigated in future studies conflict of interest none acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant

6656,this study presents a three dimensional discrete fracture network fault 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn and a deformable 3d fault the fault slip induced shear displacement and normal displacement are taken into account under a constant normal stiffness cns boundary condition the normal displacement gives rise to an increase in the normal stress and a decrease in the aperture of the fractures connected to the fault which are then incorporated into the model finally a numerical code is developed to simulate fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model during shearing and the effects of the aperture heterogeneity shear displacement and fracture structure on the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses are estimated the results show that an obvious channeling flow in the fracture networks is observed as remarkable localizations of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes the aperture heterogeneity of fractures tends to hinder the overall flow through the dfn fault model during shearing the equivalent permeability decreases at the beginning of shear because of the stress induced closure of fractures with increasing the shear displacement the equivalent permeability of the model in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction either increases or decreases depending on the competition of two effects i the permeability is enhanced by the shear induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths by connecting the dead ends of fractures that are intersected to the fault ii the permeability decreases due to the closure of fractures which is influenced by the increase in the dilation dependent normal stress however as the shear displacement continuously increases the equivalent permeability in the direction parallel

respectively 1 introduction the fractured rock masses are commonly subjected to stress changes resulting from various natural and human activities such as earthquakes underground constructions and geothermal energy reservoir productions segall and fitzgerald 1998 stein 1999 martin et al 2003 sun and zhao 2010 chen et al 2019 due to the relatively high stiffness of rock matrix the deformation occurs along the fractures for most cases with a normal displacement and a shear displacement which significantly changes the aperture and permeability of fractures this hydro mechanical coupling process has been attracted substantial interest to various earth science and engineering disciplines since the fractures undergoing complex stress deformation paths provide the main flow channels of resources and hazardous materials such as groundwater geothermal fluids and high level nuclear wastes olsson and barton 2001 rutqvist and stephansson 2003 blum et al 2009 adler et al 2013 the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses is stress dependent rojstaczer and wolf 1992 beeler and hickman 2004 min et al 2004 elkhoury et al 2006 many previous studies have estimated the effect of stress on hydraulic properties of single fractures li et al 2008 matsuki et al 2010 xiong et al 2011 rong et al 2016 the results show that the permeability of single fractures decreases due to the normal stress induced closures and increases due to the shear stress induced dilations auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2008 thirukumaran and indraratna 2016 huang et al 2017a in crystalline rocks the major fracture i e the fault is surrounded by damaged zones containing a great number of small fractures knott et al 1996 schultz and fossen 2008 torabi and berg 2011 thus the discrete fracture network dfn approach is used to evaluate fluid flow through fractured rock masses which can consider the size volume and geometric properties i e fracture length aperture and orientation of a fracture network jing and stephansson 2007 lei et al 2015 yan and zheng 2016 li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 in the 2d dfns the fractures are represented by line segments connecting the starting and ending points of a fracture however the natural rock fractures have 3d geometrical heterogeneities in both macro the arrangement of fractures in complex networks and micro the internal topography of single fractures scales brush and thomson 2003 yang et al 2012 kang et al 2016 hyman et al 2018 chen et al 2018 therefore the 2d dfns should be further improved to the 3d dfns to describe the orientation connectivity and permeability tensor of real fractured rock masses and explicitly represent the hydraulic behavior of individual fractures in numerical models lang et al 2014 huang et al 2017b berrone et al 2018 the upscaling from 2d to 3d model gives rise to a significant complication of meshing and flow calculation owing to the geometrical complexity of 3d dfns in which the fractures are represented by planes that have zero to several intersections with other fractures up to now the investigations via 3d dfn modeling do not take into account the boundary stress hyman et al 2016 kirkby and heinson 2017 or assume an isotropic boundary stress applied on the model de dreuzy et al 2012 the dfns with a confining stress imposed on the model boundaries are usually implemented to quantify their hydraulic response yet the direct shear stress is absent because of the difficulty of representing the mobilized sliding and opening of pre existing fractures during shearing during earthquakes in the nature the fault slips separating the fractured rock masses resulting in a shear displacement along the fault slip direction and a normal displacement stress change perpendicular to the fault slip direction recently a 2d dfn fault model was proposed to analyze the effect of direct shear stress displacement on fluid flow through 2d dfns liu et al 2018a 2018b the results have revealed that the shear process can either increase or decrease the permeability of a 2d dfn fault model depending on the relative inclination between the directions of the macroscopic flow and the shear displacement however the 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn and a deformable 3d fault which is more suitable for simulating the fault slip and fluid flow than the 2d dfn fault model has not been reported if any in this study a 3d dfn fault model was proposed to simulate the slip of faults and the aperture evolution of fractures due to the changes in shear and normal stresses the fluid flow simulations were performed by developing a numerical code on the sheared 3d dfn fault model and the effects of fault slip and aperture heterogeneity on hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses were investigated 2 3d dfn fault model under normal and shear stresses the schematic view of a 3d dfn model embedded with a fault is shown in fig 1 a the model is under a triaxial stress condition in which the constant normal stiffness cns is applied on the boundaries of the model the cns boundary condition has been used in previous analyses of the shear effect on deep seated single fractures jiang et al 2004 indraratna et al 2015 which is more realistic than the constant normal load cnl boundary condition li et al 2018 the fault can slip under the shear stress σ z which is encountered when the rock mass is sheared during earthquakes rojstaczer and wolf 1992 brodsky et al 2003 the initial aperture of the fault is assumed to be 0 to facilitate the calculation which indicates that the two walls of the fault are well mated representing a generated fresh fault due to the difficulty of representing the mobilized sliding of the fractures in the fracture network the assumptions are made that the increased triaxial stresses can only result in the normal closure of the fractures in dfns and the shear does not occur on the fractures this assumption has been employed for the study of persistent fracture systems considering the boundary stress baghbanan and jing 2008 garipov et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b although in natural fractured rock masses both the sliding of pre existing fractures and propagation of new cracks may occur due to significant shearing process the fault is allowed to generate both normal displacement v s and shear displacement u s during the fault slip as shown in fig 1 b the permeability of the 3d dfn fault model can be significantly changed by the stresses acting on the rock masses the fault dilation induced by the shear stress displacement is the main source of the permeability change in the direction parallel to the shear direction z direction whereas the sources leading to the permeability alteration in direction perpendicular to the shear direction x direction are very complex first the fracture network originally cut by the fault is separated into two parts which can be schematically illustrated by the evolution of the region a in fig 1 a to the region a in fig 1 b second the t intersection which is a fracture ending up on the fault and acting as a dead end maillot et al 2016 provides additional flow paths in x direction once the fault is dilated with a nonzero aperture this process can be exhibited by the evolution of the region b in fig 1 a to the region b in fig 1 b therefore the single fracture fault model as shown in fig 1 c and t intersection fault model as shown in fig 1 d are generated to investigate the effect of fault slip on the fluid flow characteristics in the single fractures and t intersections respectively note that an additional fracture connecting to the opposing model boundaries is involved in the t intersection fault model to avoid the zero permeability in x direction at the initial state the 3d dfn fault model as shown in fig 1 e is generated to estimate the overall hydraulic response of the complex fracture network the model in fig 1 e contains 18 fractures whose position and orientation are uniformly distributed and length follows a power law distribution with an exponent of 2 0 bour and davy 1997 1998 comparing to the special cases shown in fig 1 c and d in which the fractures are orthogonal with the fault the 3d dfn fault model shown in fig 1 e involves a number of fractures intersected to the fault that is a general case the size of models in fig 1 c e is 1 1 1 m the geometrical models under the shear displacements of u s 40 80 120 and 160 mm are established after shearing a smaller model of 1 1 0 84 m is extracted from the center of each model the increasement of shear stress results in the fault slip in spite of the constraint of the normal stress thereby generating a relative shear displacement between the two fault surfaces consequently due to the surface roughness a normal displacement is induced as the two walls of the fault depart from each other during shearing normal displacement is the most important parameter in the coupled shear flow behavior for quantifying the change of permeability it shows an initially small contraction at the beginning of the shear followed by the dilation with increasing the shear displacement for simplification the relationship between the shear displacement and normal displacement is incorporated into the model to investigate the shear effect on the fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model to describe the shear process of the fault in the 3d dfn fault model the shear behavior of a single fracture j3 with the size of 0 2 0 1 0 1 m obtained in the laboratory test by li et al 2008 is adopted after considering the size effect a constant normal stiffness of 0 5 gpa m and an initial normal stress of 1 0 mpa are applied fig 2 a shows the variations in shear stress and normal stress with shear displacement for fracture j3 and fig 2 b shows the corresponding shear induced normal displacement during shearing the details of specimen preparations and test procedures are described in li et al 2008 since the wall surface and shear behaviour of rock fractures are self affine li et al 2017 an assumption is made that the shear responses of the fracture are correlated with the maximum height of fracture asperities this assumption is employed for easily taking consideration of the size effect when applying the shear response of fracture specimen to the fault the maximum height h j3 of the asperities of fracture j3 with increasing areas is displayed in fig 2 c in which a logarithmic relationship is obtained the scanning data of the surface of fracture j3 is enlarged according to the obtained logarithmic relationship to constitute the surface of the fault in the model then the shear responses of the fault including the shear stress normal stress and normal displacement can be estimated as 1 r j3 r fault h j3 h fault where r j3 and r fault represent the shear responses including the shear stress normal stress and normal displacement of fracture j3 and fault respectively and h fault is the maximum height of the asperities of fault the calculated shear responses of the fault are tabulated in table 1 the stress applied on the model in y direction σ y is fixed equaling to 1 0 mpa since the two surfaces of the fault are well mated at the initial state the aperture b f of the fault under the shear displacement u s can be calculated as 2 b f z y z z u s y z z y v s if z z u s y z z y v s 0 if z z u s y z z y v s where z z y represents the aperture asperity height of a fault wall v s is the normal displacement the single fracture in the 3d dfn fault model has rough surfaces and the distribution of its aperture field b at the initial state is assumed following a truncated gaussian distribution with a spatial correlation lapcevic et al 1999 3 f b 1 σ 2 π e b b m 2 2 σ 2 if b 0 0 if b 0 where b m and σ is the mean value and deviation of the distribution respectively a series of truncated gaussian distributions with different b m varying from 0 5 to 2 0 mm and different σ varying from 0 to 2 0 are generated and used as the initial aperture distribution of the fractures in the model the triaxial stresses σ x σ y and σ z applied on the model boundaries can be transferred to the normal stress σ n applied on each single fracture in the local x y z coordinate system as shown in fig 2 e the unit normal vector z of the fracture plane in the original x y z coordinate system is calculated according to the coordinate transformation as follows 4 z tan θ tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 tan α tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 1 tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 where θ and α are the orientations of fracture plane with respect to the x and y directions respectively fig 2 d then the σ n is estimated using the following equation liu et al 2018c 5 σ n cos 2 z x σ x cos 2 z y σ y cos 2 z z σ z where cos z x cos z y and cos z z are the cosine angles between z in the x y z coordinate system and x y and z in the x y z coordinate system respectively since the shear displacement of the fractures is negligible the σ n gives rise to a normal deformation closure v n as shown in fig 2 e the bandis s hyperbolic function is used to correlate v n with σ n written as bandis et al 1983 6 σ n k 0 v n 1 v n v n max where k 0 is the initial stiffness and v nmax is the maximum fracture closure that is 0 9 times of the initial fracture aperture b i e v nmax 0 9b baghbanan and jing 2008 fig 2 f shows the evolution of v n with σ n when k 0 0 5 gpa m with increasing σ n v n increases significantly first and then gradually approaches to the maximum value during shearing under cns conditions the normal stress σ x increases with increasing the normal displacement resulting in the increment of σ n therefore the v n varies according to the change in σ n during shearing and the aperture distribution of each single fracture in the model is recalculated at each shear displacement which equals to the difference between b and v n 3 numerical calculations the fluid flow through the fractures is modeled by solving reynolds equation zimmerman et al 1991 zhao et al 2010 in order to describe the fluid flow in each fracture in the 3d dfn fault model a fracture plane ωf represented by x y is defined the reynolds equation in ωf is written as 7 x ρ g b 3 12 μ h x y ρ g b 3 12 μ h y 0 where h is the hydraulic head μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration the aperture anisotropy is incorporated into the model by assigning spatially variable values to b in eq 7 which is widely accepted when simulating the flow through a geologically rough fracture brown 1987 xiong et al 2011 wanniarachchi et al 2018 the flow within a single fracture is complemented with the continuity conditions on fracture intersections sk written as erhel et al 2009 de dreuzy et al 2012 8 h k f h k f f k f f k q k f n k f 0 where fk is the set of fracture intersecting on sk hk is the hydraulic head on sk hk f is the trace of the head on sk in ωf q k f is the flow through intersection of ωf and n k f is the unit vector on sk in ωf two kinds of boundary conditions are considered in this study unidirectional flows in x direction perpendicular to the shear direction and z direction parallel to the shear direction a constant hydraulic gradient of 1 0 is applied between the inlet and outlet boundaries and other boundaries are impermeable the fluid is assumed to be water which has a density of 998 2 kg m3 at a room temperature of 20 and has a dynamic viscosity of 0 001 pa s a numerical code that was developed by the authors huang et al 2016 is used to generate the 3d dfn fault model and to solve the fluid flow through the model the dfn is divided into the left and right parts by the fault in which the right part is fixed and the left part is slipped both horizontally and vertically to simulate the shear process for each shear displacement a smaller model of 1 1 0 84 m is extracted from the center of the sheared model then the model is meshed with two constraints one is that the mesh is 2d in each fracture and the fault plane and the other one is that the discretization of the intersection between fractures and or the intersection between fracture and fault is uniquely defined erhel et al 2009 ngo et al 2017 fourno et al 2019 the constraints allow an easy definition of the discrete continuity conditions of eq 8 the fluid flow is solved using the galerkin method under a particular consideration of the continuity of mass and flux at the intersections as an example there are 83 248 meshes in the dfn fault model shown in fig 1 e and the calculation takes approximately 6 h using a computer with an i7 core to achieve a steady state fluid flow the total volumetric flux q through the fracture networks is equal to the integral of local fluxes through outlet boundary of the model the equivalent permeability k of the model is then back calculated according to 9 q k a ρ g μ j where a is the cross area and j is the hydraulic gradient between the inlet and outlet boundaries 4 fluid flow in the direction perpendicular to fault slip direction fig 3 a c show the aperture distributions with b m 1 0 mm σ 1 0 and us 160 mm in the single fracture fault model t intersection fault model and dfn fault model respectively the fractures and fault have heterogeneous aperture distributions with a large number of contacts and a wide range of local apertures fig 3 d f display the resulting flow paths within the models in x direction in which the color intensity indicates the spatial distribution of the ratios of the local flow rate fe within each element to the total flow rate ft the elements with ratios smaller than 0 01 1 of the total flow rate are assumed to contribute negligibly to the flow watanabe et al 2009 the phenomenon of preferential flow paths i e channeling flow has been clearly observed as a remarkable localization of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes these preferential flow paths are mainly concentrated in the noncontact regions that are geometrically connected from the inlet to outlet boundaries fig 3 g i depict the main flow paths in the fault extracted from each model the flow patterns within the fault for the three models are different depending on the geometrical structure of the fractures connected to the fault in the single fracture fault model the single fracture is separated into two parts connected in series by the fault thus the connection provided by the fault alters the originally continuous flow paths in the fracture for the t intersection fault model some new flow paths are generated after fault slips resulting in the enhancement of permeability of the model in the dfn fault model a large number of small fractures are intersected with the fault which easily forms bottle necks the aperture distribution within the fault under a shear controls the overall flow patterns the ratio of the equivalent permeability of the model with different u s to that of the model with u s 0 k k 0 in x direction is calculated fig 4 a f show the comparisons of k k 0 for the single fracture fault model t intersection fault model and dfn fault model with different b m and different u s respectively the fractures in these models are parallel plates with σ 0 to eliminate the effect of aperture heterogeneity of fractures on the flow for all cases k k 0 decreases abruptly with increasing u s from 0 to 40 mm although the dilation of the fault tends to enhance the flow the overall response of the model results in the reduction of the permeability due to the significant fracture closure induced by the increase in the normal stress at the beginning of the loading as shown in fig 2 f the comparison among the curves of the three models in fig 4 a c shows that the fault slip results in the largest permeability reduction in the single fracture fault model the reduction gradually decreases with increasing the fracture number density in the model as u s continuously increases from 40 mm to 160 mm the k k 0 of the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model generally increases whereas the k k 0 of the dfn fault model fluctuates with u s this fluctuation is caused by the correlation between the aperture fields within the fault and the position of the fault fracture intersection the comparison among the curves with different b m for the three models in fig 4 d f depicts that the model with a smaller b m results in a larger permeability reduction the k k 0 of the t intersection fault model with b m 2 0 increases obviously with increasing u s which demonstrates the permeability enhancement caused by the newly generated flow paths in the t intersections by connecting the dead ends of fractures through the fault slip see fig 3 e to analyze the aperture heterogeneity of the fracture on the flow the k k 0 of three models with b m 1 0 mm and different σ is calculated and displayed in the fig 4 g i with increasing σ the k k 0 of the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model generally increases the value of k k 0 is larger than 1 0 for the t intersection fault model with σ 2 0 which indicates the void space of large aperture within the t intersections and fault converges into a few major channels to promote the flow the k k 0 of the dfn fault model generally decreases with increasing σ with the exception of the case of σ 2 0 which shows that the aperture heterogeneity within the fractures tends to hinder the overall flow during shearing this is mainly because the small fractures in the dfn fault model generate a large number of bottle necks around the fault these bottle necks falling into closed or small aperture areas dramatically reduce the effective flow paths and the permeability of the model while the large local apertures in the bottle necks slightly increase the permeability 5 fluid flow in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction since the fractures in the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model connect to the opposing model boundaries in x direction and barely contribute to the flow in z direction only the flow behavior in z direction parallel to the fault slip direction for the 3d dfn fault model is analyzed in this section fig 5 a and b show the aperture distribution in the dfn fault model under u s 40 and 160 mm respectively the initial b m of the fractures is 1 0 mm with σ 0 the calculated flow paths are displayed in fig 5 c d and the extracted flow paths in the fault are displayed in fig 5 e and f as u s increases from 40 to 160 mm the continuous flow paths in the fault grow into a few main flow channels with a dramatic decrease in contact area and an increase in aperture this phenomenon is consistent with the previous shear flow analysis on single fractures koyama et al 2009 xiong et al 2011 some continuous flow paths are observed within the dfns when u s 40 mm as shown in fig 5 c with increasing the aperture of the fault i e increasing u s from 40 to 160 mm the flow rate through the dfn is much smaller than that in the fault as shown in fig 5 d the ratio of the flow rate in the dfn and fault to the total flow rate through the model at the outlet boundary is calculated respectively and the results are displayed in fig 6 a at the initial state with u s 0 all fluids flow through the dfn since the fault is assumed to be well mated with an aperture equaling to 0 with increasing u s the flow rate ratio of the dfn decreases regularly to approximately 0 0 while the flow rate ratio of the fault increases approaching to 1 0 which indicates that the dfn contributes decreasingly to the total flow and the fault gradually becomes the dominated flow plane the evolution of the k k 0 of the dfn fault model in z direction during shearing is exhibited in fig 6 b the normal closure of fractures in the dfn tends to decrease the permeability while the shear induced dilation of the fault tends to increase the permeability by allowing the flow to pass through the fault at the beginning of the shear the k k 0 decreases to be smaller than 1 0 which indicates that the degree of permeability reduction due to fracture closure is larger than that of permeability enhancement due to fault slip with continuously increasing u s the k k 0 steadily increases and reaches to almost 5 0 when u s 160 mm the equivalent permeability of the model in z direction is commonly much larger than that in x direction which is consistent with the results reported by lang et al 2018 they concluded that the equivalent permeability is most pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the slip direction for individual fractures however at the fracture network scale lang et al 2018 found that the direction of maximum permeability of an isotropic fracture network tends to be aligned with the direction of the intermediate principal stress this indicates that the fault slip alters the permeability tensor of the original dfn in which the permeability in the fault slip direction is significantly enhanced 6 conclusions in this study a 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn embedded with a deformable fault is presented to analyze the shear flow coupling characteristics of fractured rock masses the shear response of the fault under cns conditions is determined based on the laboratory test on single fractures after considering the size effect due to the shear induced increase in the normal stress that is applied on the surrounding rocks the aperture of fractures within these surrounding rocks decreases following bandis s hyperbolic function fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model in the directions parallel and perpendicular to fault slip direction is simulated using a developed numerical code and the evolutions of aperture flow path and equivalent permeability during shearing are estimated the results show that there exist the competing effects of enhancement and reduction on the permeability during shearing of the 3d dfn fault model the enhancement is induced by the shear induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths connected to the fault the reduction is due to the fracture closure induced by the increase in normal stress during shearing under a cns condition the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction sharply decreases and then fluctuates with increasing the shear displacement the maximum reduction reaches to a factor of approximately 0 1 the enhancement of permeability in direction perpendicular to the shear direction occurs in the t intersection fault model with the maximum enhancement equaling to a factor of 2 55 the permeability in the direction parallel to the shear direction decreases first and then steadily increases with increasing the shear displacement the increment can reach to a factor of approximately 5 0 compared with the initial permeability of the model the shear augments the permeability of 3d dfn fault model in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction while the permeability in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction decreases which results in a strong flow anisotropy in the present study the fault is simplified in the y z plane which is utilized for characterizing the influence of fault slip on macroscopic flow behavior through the model as a prior work that aims to quantify the effects of aperture heterogeneity and fault slip on hydraulic property of 3d dfn fault model the fluid flow characteristics through the models with different fault orientations are not calculated but will be considered in the future studies the present study established the 3d dfn fault model with simplified shear behaviour of the fault which is therefore merely an initial step to explore the concerned topic more realistic models of the fault movement supported by in situ measurement data need to be incorporated into the proposed numerical approach to improve the understanding of the shear flow behavior of fractured rock masses besides more sophisticated factors involving the deformability of the rock matrix heterogeneity of the stress as well as the sliding of the fractures should be analyzed to understand the fully coupled hydro mechanical behaviour of fractured rock masses in the future works the generation of the complex 3d dfn fault model the meshing of the models under different shear and normal displacements and the fluid flow calculation are a time consuming work in the future works we will improve our codes for generating and meshing the model and improve the iterative efficiency when modelling fluid flow which can then be used to investigate the

6656,this study presents a three dimensional discrete fracture network fault 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn and a deformable 3d fault the fault slip induced shear displacement and normal displacement are taken into account under a constant normal stiffness cns boundary condition the normal displacement gives rise to an increase in the normal stress and a decrease in the aperture of the fractures connected to the fault which are then incorporated into the model finally a numerical code is developed to simulate fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model during shearing and the effects of the aperture heterogeneity shear displacement and fracture structure on the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses are estimated the results show that an obvious channeling flow in the fracture networks is observed as remarkable localizations of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes the aperture heterogeneity of fractures tends to hinder the overall flow through the dfn fault model during shearing the equivalent permeability decreases at the beginning of shear because of the stress induced closure of fractures with increasing the shear displacement the equivalent permeability of the model in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction either increases or decreases depending on the competition of two effects i the permeability is enhanced by the shear induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths by connecting the dead ends of fractures that are intersected to the fault ii the permeability decreases due to the closure of fractures which is influenced by the increase in the dilation dependent normal stress however as the shear displacement continuously increases the equivalent permeability in the direction parallel

respectively 1 introduction the fractured rock masses are commonly subjected to stress changes resulting from various natural and human activities such as earthquakes underground constructions and geothermal energy reservoir productions segall and fitzgerald 1998 stein 1999 martin et al 2003 sun and zhao 2010 chen et al 2019 due to the relatively high stiffness of rock matrix the deformation occurs along the fractures for most cases with a normal displacement and a shear displacement which significantly changes the aperture and permeability of fractures this hydro mechanical coupling process has been attracted substantial interest to various earth science and engineering disciplines since the fractures undergoing complex stress deformation paths provide the main flow channels of resources and hazardous materials such as groundwater geothermal fluids and high level nuclear wastes olsson and barton 2001 rutqvist and stephansson 2003 blum et al 2009 adler et al 2013 the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses is stress dependent rojstaczer and wolf 1992 beeler and hickman 2004 min et al 2004 elkhoury et al 2006 many previous studies have estimated the effect of stress on hydraulic properties of single fractures li et al 2008 matsuki et al 2010 xiong et al 2011 rong et al 2016 the results show that the permeability of single fractures decreases due to the normal stress induced closures and increases due to the shear stress induced dilations auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2008 thirukumaran and indraratna 2016 huang et al 2017a in crystalline rocks the major fracture i e the fault is surrounded by damaged zones containing a great number of small fractures knott et al 1996 schultz and fossen 2008 torabi and berg 2011 thus the discrete fracture network dfn approach is used to evaluate fluid flow through fractured rock masses which can consider the size volume and geometric properties i e fracture length aperture and orientation of a fracture network jing and stephansson 2007 lei et al 2015 yan and zheng 2016 li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 in the 2d dfns the fractures are represented by line segments connecting the starting and ending points of a fracture however the natural rock fractures have 3d geometrical heterogeneities in both macro the arrangement of fractures in complex networks and micro the internal topography of single fractures scales brush and thomson 2003 yang et al 2012 kang et al 2016 hyman et al 2018 chen et al 2018 therefore the 2d dfns should be further improved to the 3d dfns to describe the orientation connectivity and permeability tensor of real fractured rock masses and explicitly represent the hydraulic behavior of individual fractures in numerical models lang et al 2014 huang et al 2017b berrone et al 2018 the upscaling from 2d to 3d model gives rise to a significant complication of meshing and flow calculation owing to the geometrical complexity of 3d dfns in which the fractures are represented by planes that have zero to several intersections with other fractures up to now the investigations via 3d dfn modeling do not take into account the boundary stress hyman et al 2016 kirkby and heinson 2017 or assume an isotropic boundary stress applied on the model de dreuzy et al 2012 the dfns with a confining stress imposed on the model boundaries are usually implemented to quantify their hydraulic response yet the direct shear stress is absent because of the difficulty of representing the mobilized sliding and opening of pre existing fractures during shearing during earthquakes in the nature the fault slips separating the fractured rock masses resulting in a shear displacement along the fault slip direction and a normal displacement stress change perpendicular to the fault slip direction recently a 2d dfn fault model was proposed to analyze the effect of direct shear stress displacement on fluid flow through 2d dfns liu et al 2018a 2018b the results have revealed that the shear process can either increase or decrease the permeability of a 2d dfn fault model depending on the relative inclination between the directions of the macroscopic flow and the shear displacement however the 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn and a deformable 3d fault which is more suitable for simulating the fault slip and fluid flow than the 2d dfn fault model has not been reported if any in this study a 3d dfn fault model was proposed to simulate the slip of faults and the aperture evolution of fractures due to the changes in shear and normal stresses the fluid flow simulations were performed by developing a numerical code on the sheared 3d dfn fault model and the effects of fault slip and aperture heterogeneity on hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses were investigated 2 3d dfn fault model under normal and shear stresses the schematic view of a 3d dfn model embedded with a fault is shown in fig 1 a the model is under a triaxial stress condition in which the constant normal stiffness cns is applied on the boundaries of the model the cns boundary condition has been used in previous analyses of the shear effect on deep seated single fractures jiang et al 2004 indraratna et al 2015 which is more realistic than the constant normal load cnl boundary condition li et al 2018 the fault can slip under the shear stress σ z which is encountered when the rock mass is sheared during earthquakes rojstaczer and wolf 1992 brodsky et al 2003 the initial aperture of the fault is assumed to be 0 to facilitate the calculation which indicates that the two walls of the fault are well mated representing a generated fresh fault due to the difficulty of representing the mobilized sliding of the fractures in the fracture network the assumptions are made that the increased triaxial stresses can only result in the normal closure of the fractures in dfns and the shear does not occur on the fractures this assumption has been employed for the study of persistent fracture systems considering the boundary stress baghbanan and jing 2008 garipov et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b although in natural fractured rock masses both the sliding of pre existing fractures and propagation of new cracks may occur due to significant shearing process the fault is allowed to generate both normal displacement v s and shear displacement u s during the fault slip as shown in fig 1 b the permeability of the 3d dfn fault model can be significantly changed by the stresses acting on the rock masses the fault dilation induced by the shear stress displacement is the main source of the permeability change in the direction parallel to the shear direction z direction whereas the sources leading to the permeability alteration in direction perpendicular to the shear direction x direction are very complex first the fracture network originally cut by the fault is separated into two parts which can be schematically illustrated by the evolution of the region a in fig 1 a to the region a in fig 1 b second the t intersection which is a fracture ending up on the fault and acting as a dead end maillot et al 2016 provides additional flow paths in x direction once the fault is dilated with a nonzero aperture this process can be exhibited by the evolution of the region b in fig 1 a to the region b in fig 1 b therefore the single fracture fault model as shown in fig 1 c and t intersection fault model as shown in fig 1 d are generated to investigate the effect of fault slip on the fluid flow characteristics in the single fractures and t intersections respectively note that an additional fracture connecting to the opposing model boundaries is involved in the t intersection fault model to avoid the zero permeability in x direction at the initial state the 3d dfn fault model as shown in fig 1 e is generated to estimate the overall hydraulic response of the complex fracture network the model in fig 1 e contains 18 fractures whose position and orientation are uniformly distributed and length follows a power law distribution with an exponent of 2 0 bour and davy 1997 1998 comparing to the special cases shown in fig 1 c and d in which the fractures are orthogonal with the fault the 3d dfn fault model shown in fig 1 e involves a number of fractures intersected to the fault that is a general case the size of models in fig 1 c e is 1 1 1 m the geometrical models under the shear displacements of u s 40 80 120 and 160 mm are established after shearing a smaller model of 1 1 0 84 m is extracted from the center of each model the increasement of shear stress results in the fault slip in spite of the constraint of the normal stress thereby generating a relative shear displacement between the two fault surfaces consequently due to the surface roughness a normal displacement is induced as the two walls of the fault depart from each other during shearing normal displacement is the most important parameter in the coupled shear flow behavior for quantifying the change of permeability it shows an initially small contraction at the beginning of the shear followed by the dilation with increasing the shear displacement for simplification the relationship between the shear displacement and normal displacement is incorporated into the model to investigate the shear effect on the fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model to describe the shear process of the fault in the 3d dfn fault model the shear behavior of a single fracture j3 with the size of 0 2 0 1 0 1 m obtained in the laboratory test by li et al 2008 is adopted after considering the size effect a constant normal stiffness of 0 5 gpa m and an initial normal stress of 1 0 mpa are applied fig 2 a shows the variations in shear stress and normal stress with shear displacement for fracture j3 and fig 2 b shows the corresponding shear induced normal displacement during shearing the details of specimen preparations and test procedures are described in li et al 2008 since the wall surface and shear behaviour of rock fractures are self affine li et al 2017 an assumption is made that the shear responses of the fracture are correlated with the maximum height of fracture asperities this assumption is employed for easily taking consideration of the size effect when applying the shear response of fracture specimen to the fault the maximum height h j3 of the asperities of fracture j3 with increasing areas is displayed in fig 2 c in which a logarithmic relationship is obtained the scanning data of the surface of fracture j3 is enlarged according to the obtained logarithmic relationship to constitute the surface of the fault in the model then the shear responses of the fault including the shear stress normal stress and normal displacement can be estimated as 1 r j3 r fault h j3 h fault where r j3 and r fault represent the shear responses including the shear stress normal stress and normal displacement of fracture j3 and fault respectively and h fault is the maximum height of the asperities of fault the calculated shear responses of the fault are tabulated in table 1 the stress applied on the model in y direction σ y is fixed equaling to 1 0 mpa since the two surfaces of the fault are well mated at the initial state the aperture b f of the fault under the shear displacement u s can be calculated as 2 b f z y z z u s y z z y v s if z z u s y z z y v s 0 if z z u s y z z y v s where z z y represents the aperture asperity height of a fault wall v s is the normal displacement the single fracture in the 3d dfn fault model has rough surfaces and the distribution of its aperture field b at the initial state is assumed following a truncated gaussian distribution with a spatial correlation lapcevic et al 1999 3 f b 1 σ 2 π e b b m 2 2 σ 2 if b 0 0 if b 0 where b m and σ is the mean value and deviation of the distribution respectively a series of truncated gaussian distributions with different b m varying from 0 5 to 2 0 mm and different σ varying from 0 to 2 0 are generated and used as the initial aperture distribution of the fractures in the model the triaxial stresses σ x σ y and σ z applied on the model boundaries can be transferred to the normal stress σ n applied on each single fracture in the local x y z coordinate system as shown in fig 2 e the unit normal vector z of the fracture plane in the original x y z coordinate system is calculated according to the coordinate transformation as follows 4 z tan θ tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 tan α tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 1 tan 2 θ tan 2 α 1 where θ and α are the orientations of fracture plane with respect to the x and y directions respectively fig 2 d then the σ n is estimated using the following equation liu et al 2018c 5 σ n cos 2 z x σ x cos 2 z y σ y cos 2 z z σ z where cos z x cos z y and cos z z are the cosine angles between z in the x y z coordinate system and x y and z in the x y z coordinate system respectively since the shear displacement of the fractures is negligible the σ n gives rise to a normal deformation closure v n as shown in fig 2 e the bandis s hyperbolic function is used to correlate v n with σ n written as bandis et al 1983 6 σ n k 0 v n 1 v n v n max where k 0 is the initial stiffness and v nmax is the maximum fracture closure that is 0 9 times of the initial fracture aperture b i e v nmax 0 9b baghbanan and jing 2008 fig 2 f shows the evolution of v n with σ n when k 0 0 5 gpa m with increasing σ n v n increases significantly first and then gradually approaches to the maximum value during shearing under cns conditions the normal stress σ x increases with increasing the normal displacement resulting in the increment of σ n therefore the v n varies according to the change in σ n during shearing and the aperture distribution of each single fracture in the model is recalculated at each shear displacement which equals to the difference between b and v n 3 numerical calculations the fluid flow through the fractures is modeled by solving reynolds equation zimmerman et al 1991 zhao et al 2010 in order to describe the fluid flow in each fracture in the 3d dfn fault model a fracture plane ωf represented by x y is defined the reynolds equation in ωf is written as 7 x ρ g b 3 12 μ h x y ρ g b 3 12 μ h y 0 where h is the hydraulic head μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration the aperture anisotropy is incorporated into the model by assigning spatially variable values to b in eq 7 which is widely accepted when simulating the flow through a geologically rough fracture brown 1987 xiong et al 2011 wanniarachchi et al 2018 the flow within a single fracture is complemented with the continuity conditions on fracture intersections sk written as erhel et al 2009 de dreuzy et al 2012 8 h k f h k f f k f f k q k f n k f 0 where fk is the set of fracture intersecting on sk hk is the hydraulic head on sk hk f is the trace of the head on sk in ωf q k f is the flow through intersection of ωf and n k f is the unit vector on sk in ωf two kinds of boundary conditions are considered in this study unidirectional flows in x direction perpendicular to the shear direction and z direction parallel to the shear direction a constant hydraulic gradient of 1 0 is applied between the inlet and outlet boundaries and other boundaries are impermeable the fluid is assumed to be water which has a density of 998 2 kg m3 at a room temperature of 20 and has a dynamic viscosity of 0 001 pa s a numerical code that was developed by the authors huang et al 2016 is used to generate the 3d dfn fault model and to solve the fluid flow through the model the dfn is divided into the left and right parts by the fault in which the right part is fixed and the left part is slipped both horizontally and vertically to simulate the shear process for each shear displacement a smaller model of 1 1 0 84 m is extracted from the center of the sheared model then the model is meshed with two constraints one is that the mesh is 2d in each fracture and the fault plane and the other one is that the discretization of the intersection between fractures and or the intersection between fracture and fault is uniquely defined erhel et al 2009 ngo et al 2017 fourno et al 2019 the constraints allow an easy definition of the discrete continuity conditions of eq 8 the fluid flow is solved using the galerkin method under a particular consideration of the continuity of mass and flux at the intersections as an example there are 83 248 meshes in the dfn fault model shown in fig 1 e and the calculation takes approximately 6 h using a computer with an i7 core to achieve a steady state fluid flow the total volumetric flux q through the fracture networks is equal to the integral of local fluxes through outlet boundary of the model the equivalent permeability k of the model is then back calculated according to 9 q k a ρ g μ j where a is the cross area and j is the hydraulic gradient between the inlet and outlet boundaries 4 fluid flow in the direction perpendicular to fault slip direction fig 3 a c show the aperture distributions with b m 1 0 mm σ 1 0 and us 160 mm in the single fracture fault model t intersection fault model and dfn fault model respectively the fractures and fault have heterogeneous aperture distributions with a large number of contacts and a wide range of local apertures fig 3 d f display the resulting flow paths within the models in x direction in which the color intensity indicates the spatial distribution of the ratios of the local flow rate fe within each element to the total flow rate ft the elements with ratios smaller than 0 01 1 of the total flow rate are assumed to contribute negligibly to the flow watanabe et al 2009 the phenomenon of preferential flow paths i e channeling flow has been clearly observed as a remarkable localization of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes these preferential flow paths are mainly concentrated in the noncontact regions that are geometrically connected from the inlet to outlet boundaries fig 3 g i depict the main flow paths in the fault extracted from each model the flow patterns within the fault for the three models are different depending on the geometrical structure of the fractures connected to the fault in the single fracture fault model the single fracture is separated into two parts connected in series by the fault thus the connection provided by the fault alters the originally continuous flow paths in the fracture for the t intersection fault model some new flow paths are generated after fault slips resulting in the enhancement of permeability of the model in the dfn fault model a large number of small fractures are intersected with the fault which easily forms bottle necks the aperture distribution within the fault under a shear controls the overall flow patterns the ratio of the equivalent permeability of the model with different u s to that of the model with u s 0 k k 0 in x direction is calculated fig 4 a f show the comparisons of k k 0 for the single fracture fault model t intersection fault model and dfn fault model with different b m and different u s respectively the fractures in these models are parallel plates with σ 0 to eliminate the effect of aperture heterogeneity of fractures on the flow for all cases k k 0 decreases abruptly with increasing u s from 0 to 40 mm although the dilation of the fault tends to enhance the flow the overall response of the model results in the reduction of the permeability due to the significant fracture closure induced by the increase in the normal stress at the beginning of the loading as shown in fig 2 f the comparison among the curves of the three models in fig 4 a c shows that the fault slip results in the largest permeability reduction in the single fracture fault model the reduction gradually decreases with increasing the fracture number density in the model as u s continuously increases from 40 mm to 160 mm the k k 0 of the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model generally increases whereas the k k 0 of the dfn fault model fluctuates with u s this fluctuation is caused by the correlation between the aperture fields within the fault and the position of the fault fracture intersection the comparison among the curves with different b m for the three models in fig 4 d f depicts that the model with a smaller b m results in a larger permeability reduction the k k 0 of the t intersection fault model with b m 2 0 increases obviously with increasing u s which demonstrates the permeability enhancement caused by the newly generated flow paths in the t intersections by connecting the dead ends of fractures through the fault slip see fig 3 e to analyze the aperture heterogeneity of the fracture on the flow the k k 0 of three models with b m 1 0 mm and different σ is calculated and displayed in the fig 4 g i with increasing σ the k k 0 of the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model generally increases the value of k k 0 is larger than 1 0 for the t intersection fault model with σ 2 0 which indicates the void space of large aperture within the t intersections and fault converges into a few major channels to promote the flow the k k 0 of the dfn fault model generally decreases with increasing σ with the exception of the case of σ 2 0 which shows that the aperture heterogeneity within the fractures tends to hinder the overall flow during shearing this is mainly because the small fractures in the dfn fault model generate a large number of bottle necks around the fault these bottle necks falling into closed or small aperture areas dramatically reduce the effective flow paths and the permeability of the model while the large local apertures in the bottle necks slightly increase the permeability 5 fluid flow in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction since the fractures in the single fracture fault model and t intersection fault model connect to the opposing model boundaries in x direction and barely contribute to the flow in z direction only the flow behavior in z direction parallel to the fault slip direction for the 3d dfn fault model is analyzed in this section fig 5 a and b show the aperture distribution in the dfn fault model under u s 40 and 160 mm respectively the initial b m of the fractures is 1 0 mm with σ 0 the calculated flow paths are displayed in fig 5 c d and the extracted flow paths in the fault are displayed in fig 5 e and f as u s increases from 40 to 160 mm the continuous flow paths in the fault grow into a few main flow channels with a dramatic decrease in contact area and an increase in aperture this phenomenon is consistent with the previous shear flow analysis on single fractures koyama et al 2009 xiong et al 2011 some continuous flow paths are observed within the dfns when u s 40 mm as shown in fig 5 c with increasing the aperture of the fault i e increasing u s from 40 to 160 mm the flow rate through the dfn is much smaller than that in the fault as shown in fig 5 d the ratio of the flow rate in the dfn and fault to the total flow rate through the model at the outlet boundary is calculated respectively and the results are displayed in fig 6 a at the initial state with u s 0 all fluids flow through the dfn since the fault is assumed to be well mated with an aperture equaling to 0 with increasing u s the flow rate ratio of the dfn decreases regularly to approximately 0 0 while the flow rate ratio of the fault increases approaching to 1 0 which indicates that the dfn contributes decreasingly to the total flow and the fault gradually becomes the dominated flow plane the evolution of the k k 0 of the dfn fault model in z direction during shearing is exhibited in fig 6 b the normal closure of fractures in the dfn tends to decrease the permeability while the shear induced dilation of the fault tends to increase the permeability by allowing the flow to pass through the fault at the beginning of the shear the k k 0 decreases to be smaller than 1 0 which indicates that the degree of permeability reduction due to fracture closure is larger than that of permeability enhancement due to fault slip with continuously increasing u s the k k 0 steadily increases and reaches to almost 5 0 when u s 160 mm the equivalent permeability of the model in z direction is commonly much larger than that in x direction which is consistent with the results reported by lang et al 2018 they concluded that the equivalent permeability is most pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the slip direction for individual fractures however at the fracture network scale lang et al 2018 found that the direction of maximum permeability of an isotropic fracture network tends to be aligned with the direction of the intermediate principal stress this indicates that the fault slip alters the permeability tensor of the original dfn in which the permeability in the fault slip direction is significantly enhanced 6 conclusions in this study a 3d dfn fault model that contains a 3d dfn embedded with a deformable fault is presented to analyze the shear flow coupling characteristics of fractured rock masses the shear response of the fault under cns conditions is determined based on the laboratory test on single fractures after considering the size effect due to the shear induced increase in the normal stress that is applied on the surrounding rocks the aperture of fractures within these surrounding rocks decreases following bandis s hyperbolic function fluid flow through the 3d dfn fault model in the directions parallel and perpendicular to fault slip direction is simulated using a developed numerical code and the evolutions of aperture flow path and equivalent permeability during shearing are estimated the results show that there exist the competing effects of enhancement and reduction on the permeability during shearing of the 3d dfn fault model the enhancement is induced by the shear induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths connected to the fault the reduction is due to the fracture closure induced by the increase in normal stress during shearing under a cns condition the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction sharply decreases and then fluctuates with increasing the shear displacement the maximum reduction reaches to a factor of approximately 0 1 the enhancement of permeability in direction perpendicular to the shear direction occurs in the t intersection fault model with the maximum enhancement equaling to a factor of 2 55 the permeability in the direction parallel to the shear direction decreases first and then steadily increases with increasing the shear displacement the increment can reach to a factor of approximately 5 0 compared with the initial permeability of the model the shear augments the permeability of 3d dfn fault model in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction while the permeability in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction decreases which results in a strong flow anisotropy in the present study the fault is simplified in the y z plane which is utilized for characterizing the influence of fault slip on macroscopic flow behavior through the model as a prior work that aims to quantify the effects of aperture heterogeneity and fault slip on hydraulic property of 3d dfn fault model the fluid flow characteristics through the models with different fault orientations are not calculated but will be considered in the future studies the present study established the 3d dfn fault model with simplified shear behaviour of the fault which is therefore merely an initial step to explore the concerned topic more realistic models of the fault movement supported by in situ measurement data need to be incorporated into the proposed numerical approach to improve the understanding of the shear flow behavior of fractured rock masses besides more sophisticated factors involving the deformability of the rock matrix heterogeneity of the stress as well as the sliding of the fractures should be analyzed to understand the fully coupled hydro mechanical behaviour of fractured rock masses in the future works the generation of the complex 3d dfn fault model the meshing of the models under different shear and normal displacements and the fluid flow calculation are a time consuming work in the future works we will improve our codes for generating and meshing the model and improve the iterative efficiency when modelling fluid flow which can then be used to investigate the influences of fault orientation power law exponent of fracture length distributions and shear related parameters i e shear and normal displacements stiffness of surrounding rock masses on the

6657,dilution of sewage caused by extraneous water is believed to have a negative effect on the daily operation of the wastewater infrastructure ecological consequences arise due to an increased activity of combined sewer overflows cso and to a decreasing efficiency of treatment processes while the elevated pumping activity induces a proportional increase in operational cost this work aims at putting these drawbacks into perspective by an in depth investigation of several catchments for which detailed sewer and treatment plant models were set up to verify the effect of a virtual removal of the existing sewage dilution results showed that extraneous water is responsible for 5 35 higher cso volume effects at the treatment plant seem less significant with small gains in treatment efficiency 2 4 energy savings up to 5 only marginally exceed the rise in sludge production cost assuming this extraneous water would be eliminated finally a pragmatic approach towards strategies of removing dilution is suggested by the use of a decision tree keywords infiltration and inflow i i parasitic water extraneous water dilution of sewage 1 introduction the phenomenon of extraneous water also called infiltration and inflow i i or parasitic water is extensively reported in literature e g ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 in short i i represents the sum of unintended infiltration of groundwater and inflow of surface water to the combined sewer system the first one is usually of diffuse origin while the latter mostly originates from singular inputs fig 1 summarizes these potential inputs to the sewer system as a sum of contributions from surface water creeks streams and groundwater infiltration deliberate drainage lowering of groundwater table dirckx et al 2016 the input of i i is believed to have significant detrimental effects on the daily operation of a sewage system both ecologically and economically thorndahl et al 2016 therefore several wastewater operators have put serious efforts in determining the quantities of the influx of these undesired flows as in germany weiss et al 2002 austria ertl et al 2002 the netherlands voorhoeve van de kerk 2003 france de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 flanders belgium dirckx et al 2009 switzerland staufer et al 2012 portugal rodriguez 2013 and sweden mollander 2015 often conclusions reveal surprisingly high figures of parasitic water at least comprising 20 but sometimes up to more than 50 of the total flow fig 2 for example gives an overview of dilution rates of the catchments of belgium s flemish region for the year 2015 with a registered total rainfall of 737 mm being below the current average for the region the dilution rate is defined as the amount of parasitic water flow pwf to the dry weather flow dwf pwf dwf in other words the amount of dilution into the flow arriving at the treatment plant during dry conditions the map shows the treatment catchments coloured according to their dilution rates comparing yearly volumes of parasitic water to the total dry weather flow figures were calculated using the software fleatrap which was developed by the flemish wastewater operator aquafin it incorporates three mathematical methods atv dvwk a198 2003 weiss et al 2002 determining the daily parasitic flow in a first step a dry weather flow curve is derived from the total registered flow over the considered period next the parasitic flow is calculated from the dwf as the difference with the foul flow or wastewater flow wwf which is assumed constant over the period of analysis and determined from the number of connected households this last figure can be calculated from census or indirectly from influent kjeldahl nitrogen measurements as this parameter is considered as a proxy for wastewater of domestic origin for the determination of the dwf curve two of the methods use a floating timeframe determining either a central moving or an antecedent minimum assuming some statistical conditions regarding the local rainfall the third method ranks the total flow in an ascending order expressed as a percentage of the maximum flow the number of rain days also in is then set out from the right side on the total flow curve finally this point is connected to the wwf point of the maximum flow day at 100 above this line only rain weather flow can be found for more details the reader is referred to dirckx et al 2009 many authors have highlighted the negative consequences of the presence of parasitic water csos will be faster and longer activated ellis and revitt 2002 treatment efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is jeopardised by a diluted influent ellis bertrand krajewski 2010 and pump energy costs will rise as more water volume is transported within the sewage system kracht et al 2008 an advantage however could be a lowered risk of sediment deposition schilperoort 2004 in order to mitigate the impact of extraneous water infrastructural sewer rehabilitation programmes have been endorsed in several national and regional investment programmes nonetheless an exhaustive evaluation of i i impact on sewer systems and wwtps seems to be missing this work focuses on a thorough evaluation of the consequences of the presence of extraneous water in terms of economic and ecological key performances parameters on the sewer systems via csos by examining several data sets of cso volumes with and without the presence of parasitic water all results are based on calibrated hydrodynamic sewer models using long time series of rainfall as input pumping costs are evaluated separately wwtps by calibrated asm activated sludge model based models with influent flows with and without i i as input cost evaluation is in this case inherent in the analysis the novelty of this study is the in depth analysis of both sewer and wwtp infrastructure chosen in order to cover different design sizes aiming to realistically quantify costs and rehabilitation possibilities of i i flows 2 material and methods 2 1 methodology the analytical nature of some methods used to determine the parasitic water flows out of the dry weather flow allows to recompose a virtual situation as if no extraneous water were present the approach for the treatment plant analysis is somehow different from the one used for the sewer modelling as will be explained further 2 2 general description of the investigated wwtp and sewer catchments for the scope of analysis available wwtp models brugge mechelen aartselaar and bornem from previous studies de gussem et al 2014 wambecq et al 2013 fenu et al 2010 kroll et al 2018 were used in order to maintain a coherent report the same catchments were used for the sewer system analysis two extra catchments antwerpen noord dirckx et al 2018 and oudenaarde were added to enlarge the dataset for detailed analysis table 1 summarizes the catchments main characteristics with key parameters for the wwtp and sewer system 2 3 modelling the effect of dilution on treatment plant operation in a first step a situation without i i is derived from the original registered influent curve both the method of the moving minimum and antecedent minimum being two variants of the methodology described in the german guideline atv dvwk a198 2003 determine a dry weather flow curve from the total flow registered at the wwtp or pumping station as the method of the central moving minimum was found to be the most conservative regarding the pwf volumes the method of the antecedent minimum was used for this analysis a higher pwf volume indeed allows to investigate the potential maximum effect of its removal the contribution of foul flow wastewater is assumed to be constant over the period of analysis due to the changing seasonal input of i i also the dwf curve will change over time fig 3 if in a next step the daily amount of pwf is subtracted from the dwf curve a new curve can be established representing a likely situation as if no parasitic water would be present in the sewage system fig 3 demonstrates this principle the new curve can now be further used for the modelling of wwtp influent as input for wwtp models and as validation curve for sewer models as this should represent the end of the pipe flow from a sewer system the activated sludge processes are modelled using the activated sludge model 2d asm henze et al 1999 on a matlab simulink simulation platform the different zones of the oxidation ditch are represented by a series of 10 continuously stirred tank reactors secondary settling is modelled by a layered settler model takács et al 1991 the model is calibrated based on energy power consumption effluent quality and waste sludge production for one year of dynamic operational data wambecq et al 2013 calibration period lasts 365 days in order to include all seasonal variations an influent generator as frequently applied for dynamic wwtp modelling see e g gernaey et al 2011 was used to generate a continuous time series for flow and all relevant pollutants with a duration of 365 days and a 10 min temporal resolution this ensures that the full range of influent dynamics such as dry weather first flush rain weather and last flush conditions are modelled during validation and for all scenarios influent and effluent flow composite samples were collected every 2 weeks samples were analysed for bod5 bod20 cod and 0 45 μm filtered cod tss tn tkn nh4 oxidized nitrogen o po4 and tp 1 bod5 bod20 biological oxygen demand measured after 5 and 20 days respectively cod chemical oxygen demand tss total suspended solids tn total nitrogen tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen nh4 ammonium o po4 ortho phosphate tp total phosphor 1 sewage water temperature is measured on line due to the lack and the complexity of specific measurements the temperature of extraneous water is considered equal to the measured sewage water temperature all samples were analysed according to standard methods apha 1999 a power meter fluke 1735 power logger was used to log the electric power of the influent works effluent works blowers agitators and recirculation pumps to gather information for model building instantaneous energy consumption of each device was continuously logged while the control frequencies were manually adjusted stepwise every 10 min averages of the hereby obtained values are used to model the full scale energy consumption depending on the device either based only on flow aeration system thickening table pre treatment influent effluent works flow and water level pumps or flow and viscosity agitators once the dynamic model is calibrated the most sensitive process parameters are chosen based on experience with similar installations i e ammonia operating range oxygen set point recycle flows etc a set of 3 predefined values is assigned to each of these parameters finally each possible combination of parameter values forms one scenario for which the wwtp model is run for a time series of 1 year of dynamic input data the model output is then averaged for the results shown in figs 6 and 7 where each scenario represents one point depending on the envisaged analysis either two of the parameters sludge production t y power consumption both expressed in kwh y and in euro y and effluent quality tn removal are plotted as clouds of dots where every dot represents the simulation result of one modelled year for a given set of model parameters cfr figs 6 and 7 for general conclusions the results are compared by use of the arithmetic mean values of all these scenario s all points of the clouds 2 4 modelling the effect of dilution on sewer system operation the approach followed for the sewer system analysis is a little different from the one used for the wwtp analysis for the sewer system modelling the hydrodynamic software infoworks icm was used local rain gauges stations of oostkamp ieper wilrijk bonheiden and maarke kerkem provided rainfall input for the models over the envisaged time span of 2010 2015 some of the simulation years were omitted due to high uncertainty on the rain input data and or substantial changes in the sewer model this was the case for brugge 2010 2011 antwerpen noord 2010 and oudenaarde 2015 outcome of the analysis comprised a comparison of cso spill volume with and without parasitic water to this end a monthly dilution factor derived from the dry weather flow curves calculated with fleatrap was added on top of the regular foul flow as the modelling software infoworks icm does not allow daily dilution factors a monthly correction factor is the best possible approximation when using modified dwf profiles to model infiltration as demonstrated in fig 4 a monthly factor represents the average over the month in consideration meaning that in some cases the daily dilution factor can be either slightly over or underestimated despite this small inaccuracy this approach allows to model influent flows to the wwtp in a far more realistic manner as is shown in fig 5 flows ending up at the wwtp in the highly diluted catchment of antwerpen noord would be considerably underestimated when dilution factors should be ignored in winter months as january and february the wwtp receives about three times as much dry weather flow as theoretically assumed consumed power p is proportional to the pumped flow q p q ρ g h ηp ηm 2 ρ water density g gravitational acceleration h water level difference between down and upstream water table ηp pump efficiency ηm efficiency of the engine 2 since the mass density ρ and the gravity acceleration g are constant and water heights h are hardly fluctuating with or without parasitic water also pump and motor efficiency ηp and ηm respectively will not alter substantially within the range of operation however additional losses are expected to be induced by the switching on off frequency of the pumps as energy consumption during start up or shut down phases could be disproportional to the regular working regime during which the above formula is valid detailed determination of pumping costs was not part of this work therefore pumping costs are assumed to be proportional to the pumped flow only cox koyen 2012 this means e g a doubling of operational pumping costs when dry weather flow increases with 100 due to i i 3 results 3 1 effect of dilution on treatment plant operation 3 1 1 treatment efficiency and operational costs the results of the scenario analysis indicate that subtracting the extraneous water from the inflow always leads to higher tn removal see fig 6 and also demonstrates that the extent of this gain is site specific and ranges from 0 3 tn in brugge to 3 9 tn in aartselaar this observation is in agreement with literature indeed rödel et al 2017 conclude that the higher the percentage of extraneous water dilution at the wwtp the lower the degradation rate of organic compounds such as n p cod and bod5 similarly hennerkes and dohmann 2006 showed that the efficiency of cod removal decreases this can be explained by the fact that these wwtps are equipped with process control that aims to produce a constant effluent tn concentration irrespective of influent flow rate and concentrations thus in presence of extraneous water the influent concentrations are lower but the effluent concentrations are not affected consequently there is a lower net decrease in the concentration of soluble tn compounds during biological treatment or put differently a reduction of the removal efficiency the present study however highlights another mechanism that significantly contributes to the efficiency of the treatment plant when i i is involved i e the hydraulic capacity of secondary clarifiers during operation one can observe that they are often incapable to deal with the high surface loadings caused by the additional extraneous water inflow this is the case for wwtp aartselaar where the operation of the secondary clarifiers is sub optimal reduction of parasitic inflow especially during rain events would improve the performance of the clarification process and prevent effluent suspended solids and its relative organic n fraction washout extraneous water inflow limitation cannot be considered as a mandatory approach to improve effluent water quality even when the improvement in tn removal is significant for instance the case of wwtp aartselaar it is questionable whether targeting the limitation of infiltration and inflow in the sewer pipes by rehabilitating the sewer pipes is the most effective solution to reaching higher effluent quality performances this aspect will be further discussed in the following sections based on the scenario analysis performed for several wwtps one can conclude that operational costs can be decreased when infiltration and inflow of extraneous water in the sewers is prevented however operational cost savings seem rather limited for example 1 6 for the wwtp mechelen fig 6 bottom left when all operational costs are accounted for the impact of i i rehabilitation on the yearly operational costs of a municipal wwtp is in this study proven to be more limited compared to the few studies present in literature decker 1998 for instance concluded that groundwater infiltration leads to higher annual costs 7 9 with increased pumping costs as major contributor this higher estimation of the impact of extraneous water on operational cost in past studies might be the result of not considering all costs of a wwtp regarding the effect of possible influent water temperature changes due to i i removal focus is on winter months when wwtp capacity is limited by temperature influenced biological treatment performance using the soil temperature profile as monitored near the flemish city of antwerpen by abdel aal et al 2014 as a proxy for i i water temperature the soil temperature 8 9 c from january to march appears higher than the sewage temperature in winter months removing the i i water from the wastewater including its relative heat would imply lower sewage water temperature entering the wwtp in winter months by use of such assumption and a preliminary check by modelling wwtp aartselaar no significant difference in effluent water quality performance could however be observed modelled yearly operational costs increase by

6657,dilution of sewage caused by extraneous water is believed to have a negative effect on the daily operation of the wastewater infrastructure ecological consequences arise due to an increased activity of combined sewer overflows cso and to a decreasing efficiency of treatment processes while the elevated pumping activity induces a proportional increase in operational cost this work aims at putting these drawbacks into perspective by an in depth investigation of several catchments for which detailed sewer and treatment plant models were set up to verify the effect of a virtual removal of the existing sewage dilution results showed that extraneous water is responsible for 5 35 higher cso volume effects at the treatment plant seem less significant with small gains in treatment efficiency 2 4 energy savings up to 5 only marginally exceed the rise in sludge production cost assuming this extraneous water would be eliminated finally a pragmatic approach towards strategies of removing dilution is suggested by the use of a decision tree keywords infiltration and inflow i i parasitic water extraneous water dilution of sewage 1 introduction the phenomenon of extraneous water also called infiltration and inflow i i or parasitic water is extensively reported in literature e g ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 in short i i represents the sum of unintended infiltration of groundwater and inflow of surface water to the combined sewer system the first one is usually of diffuse origin while the latter mostly originates from singular inputs fig 1 summarizes these potential inputs to the sewer system as a sum of contributions from surface water creeks streams and groundwater infiltration deliberate drainage lowering of groundwater table dirckx et al 2016 the input of i i is believed to have significant detrimental effects on the daily operation of a sewage system both ecologically and economically thorndahl et al 2016 therefore several wastewater operators have put serious efforts in determining the quantities of the influx of these undesired flows as in germany weiss et al 2002 austria ertl et al 2002 the netherlands voorhoeve van de kerk 2003 france de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 flanders belgium dirckx et al 2009 switzerland staufer et al 2012 portugal rodriguez 2013 and sweden mollander 2015 often conclusions reveal surprisingly high figures of parasitic water at least comprising 20 but sometimes up to more than 50 of the total flow fig 2 for example gives an overview of dilution rates of the catchments of belgium s flemish region for the year 2015 with a registered total rainfall of 737 mm being below the current average for the region the dilution rate is defined as the amount of parasitic water flow pwf to the dry weather flow dwf pwf dwf in other words the amount of dilution into the flow arriving at the treatment plant during dry conditions the map shows the treatment catchments coloured according to their dilution rates comparing yearly volumes of parasitic water to the total dry weather flow figures were calculated using the software fleatrap which was developed by the flemish wastewater operator aquafin it incorporates three mathematical methods atv dvwk a198 2003 weiss et al 2002 determining the daily parasitic flow in a first step a dry weather flow curve is derived from the total registered flow over the considered period next the parasitic flow is calculated from the dwf as the difference with the foul flow or wastewater flow wwf which is assumed constant over the period of analysis and determined from the number of connected households this last figure can be calculated from census or indirectly from influent kjeldahl nitrogen measurements as this parameter is considered as a proxy for wastewater of domestic origin for the determination of the dwf curve two of the methods use a floating timeframe determining either a central moving or an antecedent minimum assuming some statistical conditions regarding the local rainfall the third method ranks the total flow in an ascending order expressed as a percentage of the maximum flow the number of rain days also in is then set out from the right side on the total flow curve finally this point is connected to the wwf point of the maximum flow day at 100 above this line only rain weather flow can be found for more details the reader is referred to dirckx et al 2009 many authors have highlighted the negative consequences of the presence of parasitic water csos will be faster and longer activated ellis and revitt 2002 treatment efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is jeopardised by a diluted influent ellis bertrand krajewski 2010 and pump energy costs will rise as more water volume is transported within the sewage system kracht et al 2008 an advantage however could be a lowered risk of sediment deposition schilperoort 2004 in order to mitigate the impact of extraneous water infrastructural sewer rehabilitation programmes have been endorsed in several national and regional investment programmes nonetheless an exhaustive evaluation of i i impact on sewer systems and wwtps seems to be missing this work focuses on a thorough evaluation of the consequences of the presence of extraneous water in terms of economic and ecological key performances parameters on the sewer systems via csos by examining several data sets of cso volumes with and without the presence of parasitic water all results are based on calibrated hydrodynamic sewer models using long time series of rainfall as input pumping costs are evaluated separately wwtps by calibrated asm activated sludge model based models with influent flows with and without i i as input cost evaluation is in this case inherent in the analysis the novelty of this study is the in depth analysis of both sewer and wwtp infrastructure chosen in order to cover different design sizes aiming to realistically quantify costs and rehabilitation possibilities of i i flows 2 material and methods 2 1 methodology the analytical nature of some methods used to determine the parasitic water flows out of the dry weather flow allows to recompose a virtual situation as if no extraneous water were present the approach for the treatment plant analysis is somehow different from the one used for the sewer modelling as will be explained further 2 2 general description of the investigated wwtp and sewer catchments for the scope of analysis available wwtp models brugge mechelen aartselaar and bornem from previous studies de gussem et al 2014 wambecq et al 2013 fenu et al 2010 kroll et al 2018 were used in order to maintain a coherent report the same catchments were used for the sewer system analysis two extra catchments antwerpen noord dirckx et al 2018 and oudenaarde were added to enlarge the dataset for detailed analysis table 1 summarizes the catchments main characteristics with key parameters for the wwtp and sewer system 2 3 modelling the effect of dilution on treatment plant operation in a first step a situation without i i is derived from the original registered influent curve both the method of the moving minimum and antecedent minimum being two variants of the methodology described in the german guideline atv dvwk a198 2003 determine a dry weather flow curve from the total flow registered at the wwtp or pumping station as the method of the central moving minimum was found to be the most conservative regarding the pwf volumes the method of the antecedent minimum was used for this analysis a higher pwf volume indeed allows to investigate the potential maximum effect of its removal the contribution of foul flow wastewater is assumed to be constant over the period of analysis due to the changing seasonal input of i i also the dwf curve will change over time fig 3 if in a next step the daily amount of pwf is subtracted from the dwf curve a new curve can be established representing a likely situation as if no parasitic water would be present in the sewage system fig 3 demonstrates this principle the new curve can now be further used for the modelling of wwtp influent as input for wwtp models and as validation curve for sewer models as this should represent the end of the pipe flow from a sewer system the activated sludge processes are modelled using the activated sludge model 2d asm henze et al 1999 on a matlab simulink simulation platform the different zones of the oxidation ditch are represented by a series of 10 continuously stirred tank reactors secondary settling is modelled by a layered settler model takács et al 1991 the model is calibrated based on energy power consumption effluent quality and waste sludge production for one year of dynamic operational data wambecq et al 2013 calibration period lasts 365 days in order to include all seasonal variations an influent generator as frequently applied for dynamic wwtp modelling see e g gernaey et al 2011 was used to generate a continuous time series for flow and all relevant pollutants with a duration of 365 days and a 10 min temporal resolution this ensures that the full range of influent dynamics such as dry weather first flush rain weather and last flush conditions are modelled during validation and for all scenarios influent and effluent flow composite samples were collected every 2 weeks samples were analysed for bod5 bod20 cod and 0 45 μm filtered cod tss tn tkn nh4 oxidized nitrogen o po4 and tp 1 bod5 bod20 biological oxygen demand measured after 5 and 20 days respectively cod chemical oxygen demand tss total suspended solids tn total nitrogen tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen nh4 ammonium o po4 ortho phosphate tp total phosphor 1 sewage water temperature is measured on line due to the lack and the complexity of specific measurements the temperature of extraneous water is considered equal to the measured sewage water temperature all samples were analysed according to standard methods apha 1999 a power meter fluke 1735 power logger was used to log the electric power of the influent works effluent works blowers agitators and recirculation pumps to gather information for model building instantaneous energy consumption of each device was continuously logged while the control frequencies were manually adjusted stepwise every 10 min averages of the hereby obtained values are used to model the full scale energy consumption depending on the device either based only on flow aeration system thickening table pre treatment influent effluent works flow and water level pumps or flow and viscosity agitators once the dynamic model is calibrated the most sensitive process parameters are chosen based on experience with similar installations i e ammonia operating range oxygen set point recycle flows etc a set of 3 predefined values is assigned to each of these parameters finally each possible combination of parameter values forms one scenario for which the wwtp model is run for a time series of 1 year of dynamic input data the model output is then averaged for the results shown in figs 6 and 7 where each scenario represents one point depending on the envisaged analysis either two of the parameters sludge production t y power consumption both expressed in kwh y and in euro y and effluent quality tn removal are plotted as clouds of dots where every dot represents the simulation result of one modelled year for a given set of model parameters cfr figs 6 and 7 for general conclusions the results are compared by use of the arithmetic mean values of all these scenario s all points of the clouds 2 4 modelling the effect of dilution on sewer system operation the approach followed for the sewer system analysis is a little different from the one used for the wwtp analysis for the sewer system modelling the hydrodynamic software infoworks icm was used local rain gauges stations of oostkamp ieper wilrijk bonheiden and maarke kerkem provided rainfall input for the models over the envisaged time span of 2010 2015 some of the simulation years were omitted due to high uncertainty on the rain input data and or substantial changes in the sewer model this was the case for brugge 2010 2011 antwerpen noord 2010 and oudenaarde 2015 outcome of the analysis comprised a comparison of cso spill volume with and without parasitic water to this end a monthly dilution factor derived from the dry weather flow curves calculated with fleatrap was added on top of the regular foul flow as the modelling software infoworks icm does not allow daily dilution factors a monthly correction factor is the best possible approximation when using modified dwf profiles to model infiltration as demonstrated in fig 4 a monthly factor represents the average over the month in consideration meaning that in some cases the daily dilution factor can be either slightly over or underestimated despite this small inaccuracy this approach allows to model influent flows to the wwtp in a far more realistic manner as is shown in fig 5 flows ending up at the wwtp in the highly diluted catchment of antwerpen noord would be considerably underestimated when dilution factors should be ignored in winter months as january and february the wwtp receives about three times as much dry weather flow as theoretically assumed consumed power p is proportional to the pumped flow q p q ρ g h ηp ηm 2 ρ water density g gravitational acceleration h water level difference between down and upstream water table ηp pump efficiency ηm efficiency of the engine 2 since the mass density ρ and the gravity acceleration g are constant and water heights h are hardly fluctuating with or without parasitic water also pump and motor efficiency ηp and ηm respectively will not alter substantially within the range of operation however additional losses are expected to be induced by the switching on off frequency of the pumps as energy consumption during start up or shut down phases could be disproportional to the regular working regime during which the above formula is valid detailed determination of pumping costs was not part of this work therefore pumping costs are assumed to be proportional to the pumped flow only cox koyen 2012 this means e g a doubling of operational pumping costs when dry weather flow increases with 100 due to i i 3 results 3 1 effect of dilution on treatment plant operation 3 1 1 treatment efficiency and operational costs the results of the scenario analysis indicate that subtracting the extraneous water from the inflow always leads to higher tn removal see fig 6 and also demonstrates that the extent of this gain is site specific and ranges from 0 3 tn in brugge to 3 9 tn in aartselaar this observation is in agreement with literature indeed rödel et al 2017 conclude that the higher the percentage of extraneous water dilution at the wwtp the lower the degradation rate of organic compounds such as n p cod and bod5 similarly hennerkes and dohmann 2006 showed that the efficiency of cod removal decreases this can be explained by the fact that these wwtps are equipped with process control that aims to produce a constant effluent tn concentration irrespective of influent flow rate and concentrations thus in presence of extraneous water the influent concentrations are lower but the effluent concentrations are not affected consequently there is a lower net decrease in the concentration of soluble tn compounds during biological treatment or put differently a reduction of the removal efficiency the present study however highlights another mechanism that significantly contributes to the efficiency of the treatment plant when i i is involved i e the hydraulic capacity of secondary clarifiers during operation one can observe that they are often incapable to deal with the high surface loadings caused by the additional extraneous water inflow this is the case for wwtp aartselaar where the operation of the secondary clarifiers is sub optimal reduction of parasitic inflow especially during rain events would improve the performance of the clarification process and prevent effluent suspended solids and its relative organic n fraction washout extraneous water inflow limitation cannot be considered as a mandatory approach to improve effluent water quality even when the improvement in tn removal is significant for instance the case of wwtp aartselaar it is questionable whether targeting the limitation of infiltration and inflow in the sewer pipes by rehabilitating the sewer pipes is the most effective solution to reaching higher effluent quality performances this aspect will be further discussed in the following sections based on the scenario analysis performed for several wwtps one can conclude that operational costs can be decreased when infiltration and inflow of extraneous water in the sewers is prevented however operational cost savings seem rather limited for example 1 6 for the wwtp mechelen fig 6 bottom left when all operational costs are accounted for the impact of i i rehabilitation on the yearly operational costs of a municipal wwtp is in this study proven to be more limited compared to the few studies present in literature decker 1998 for instance concluded that groundwater infiltration leads to higher annual costs 7 9 with increased pumping costs as major contributor this higher estimation of the impact of extraneous water on operational cost in past studies might be the result of not considering all costs of a wwtp regarding the effect of possible influent water temperature changes due to i i removal focus is on winter months when wwtp capacity is limited by temperature influenced biological treatment performance using the soil temperature profile as monitored near the flemish city of antwerpen by abdel aal et al 2014 as a proxy for i i water temperature the soil temperature 8 9 c from january to march appears higher than the sewage temperature in winter months removing the i i water from the wastewater including its relative heat would imply lower sewage water temperature entering the wwtp in winter months by use of such assumption and a preliminary check by modelling wwtp aartselaar no significant difference in effluent water quality performance could however be observed modelled yearly operational costs increase by a marginal average of 0 22 besides the limited impact it remains unclear whether soil temperature can be used as a proxy for i i water temperature according to abdel aal et al 2014 also the in sewers air temperature plays a major role in cooling heating the sewage water summarizing i i removal seems to only have a negligible temperature effect on both treatment plant efficiency and operational cost 3 1 2 energy consumption and sludge production for the wwtps brugge mechelen and bornem energy cost slightly decreases when parasitic water is virtually removed according to kolisch et al 2010

driving as liberation remain unresolved to address these issues we provide the extensive characterization of om in shallow groundwater surface water and sediments near a permanent wetland and a dried wetland in the hetao basin with high as groundwater and low as groundwater respectively using fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis parafac dissolved organic matter dom of shallow groundwater and sediments near the permanent wetland had higher biological index bix and more protein like components and microbially derived components relative to that near the dried wetland showing higher bioreactivity fingerprint of water stable isotopes and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater pointed to the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater laboratory incubations of the sediment with more bioreactive om obtained near the permanent wetland mobilized more as both dom properties and laboratory incubations indicate that om with high bioreactivity promoted as mobility mainly by fuelling microbial respiration of fe oxide reduction recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater introduced bioreactive dom into shallow aquifer groundwater dom near the permanent wetland was typically sourced from both wetland dom and sedimentary om with high bioreactivity however sedimentary om was the major source of groundwater dom near the dried wetland it suggested that downward infiltration of surface derived om and perturbations of aquifer sediments by changing groundwater flow regimes increase bioreactivity of groundwater dom and therefore enhance as mobility keywords organic carbon labile groundwater iron oxides reductive dissolution 1 introduction arsenic as mobilization in aquifers has been widely accepted to be triggered by organic matter via reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or reductive desorption of adsorbed as v islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2013a however the source of organic matter supporting microbial metabolism remains unclear studies have shown that organic matter was sourced from sediments which was evidenced by the relationship between sedimentary organic matter and dissolved as and the occurrence of organic rich deposits around high as groundwater meharg et al 2006 quicksall et al 2008 mcarthur et al 2008 papacostas et al 2008 mao et al 2018 this scenario was also supported by laboratory incubations of sediments showing that any perturbations enhance mobilization of bioavailable sedimentary organic matter neumann et al 2014 in contrast others concluded that organic matter was introduced from surface or near surface derived organic matter along with recharging water which was supported by young ages of dissolved inorganic carbon and microbial biomass in high as groundwater harvey et al 2002 mailloux et al 2013 whaley martin et al 2016 by similar chemicals and isotopic characteristics between surface water and high as groundwater polizzotto et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 and by identification of sterol biomarkers of human livestock waste whaley martin et al 2017 identification of the source of organic matter is of significant importance in both accurately predicting changes in groundwater as in the future and in efficiently developing solutions to remediation of as contamination although the reactivity of organic matter has been assessed by incubation experiments islam et al 2004 neumann et al 2014 guo et al 2008 radloff et al 2007 and spectroscopic characteristics huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 effect of the reactivity of organic matter om on as mobilization remains elusive most investigations showed that om which contributed to as mobility was bioavailable to microbes as biodegradable pool islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 van geen et al 2013 neumann et al 2014 radloff et al 2007 lawson et al 2016 vega et al 2017 however others suggested that refractory om with chemical reactivity should promote as mobility via as fe om complexation reactions mladenov et al 2015 kulkarni et al 2017 li et al 2017a electron shuttles for reduction of as bearing fe oxides chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2009 and competitive adsorption with as reza et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 for the biodegradable pool the type and the bioreactivity of om are the key factors controlling as mobility utilization of om with different bioreactivity led to different rates of fe oxide reduction and therefore different rates of as mobility into groundwater with relatively higher rates concerning younger om having higher bioreactivity postma et al 2012 for the latter the functional groups of om to complex as are of significance in enhancing as mobility such as reactive humic moieties and n and s containing functional groups as well as quinone like components mladenov et al 2015 reza et al 2010 chen et al 2017 therefore it is important to reveal roles of om in mobilizing as in aquifers with respect to different sources and or chemical compositions which will improve our understanding of as mobilization mechanisms absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques are rapid sensitive and reliable tools for characterization of bioreactive and chemically reactive fractions of dissolved organic matter dom and extractable sediment organic matter huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2015 uv visible absorption spectra for dom provide information about source molecular weight humification and aromaticity helms et al 2008 on the other hand three dimensional fluorescence can be used to quantitatively analyze dom source biological activity and degree of humification in the aqueous environment huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2015 huguet et al 2009 in addition parallel factor analysis parafac of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem data allows to quantitatively identify individual fluorescent components of dom including humic like protein like terrestrially derived and microbially derived components cory and mcknight 2005 mladenov et al 2015 based on which comprehensive indices have been calculated for dom characterization such as the redox index mladenov et al 2010 2015 the humic protein index and the terrestrial microbial index kulkarni et al 2017 all those data provide insights into source reactivity and transformation of dom in aqueous environment in this study two sites were selected in the hetao basin to investigate reactivity of om in both shallow groundwater and sediments and its sources with respect to as mobility one was located near a permanent wetland where high as groundwater was observed as 50 μg l the other was near a dried wetland with the occurrence of low as groundwater as 50 μg l the objectives are to 1 characterize the nature of om in groundwater and sediments by using optical spectroscopic analysis and parallel factor analysis parafac of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem data 2 evaluate the sources of reactive organic matter in high as groundwater 3 assess roles of reactive organic matter in as mobility in groundwater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the hetao basin is filled with a sequence of quaternary sediments with thicknesses of 1500 8000 m accessible groundwater mainly occurs in the quaternary alluvial alluvial pluvial and alluvial lacustrine aquifers jia et al 2014 there are many natural surface water bodies including lagoons lakes and wetlands guo et al 2011 details on the study area are provided in supporting information the study area is located in the distal alluvial fans where a typical dried wetland dw and a typical permanent wetland pw are present fig 1 although dw was recharged from groundwater under natural hydrogeological conditions it was dried about 14 years ago due to lowering groundwater levels after groundwater has been pumped for agricultural irrigation remote sensing images showed that pw has lasted for 40 year groundwater recharged the wetland before the year 2000 while water of drainage channel has mainly recharged the wetland after the year 2000 the recharge of the wetland water into shallow groundwater near pw was inferred hydraulically by the higher water tables of the wetland shallow groundwater near pw generally has high as concentrations while near dw low as groundwater is normally observed guo et al 2016a groundwater tables varied between 3 0 and 4 0 m below land surface bls in pw while between 5 0 and 8 0 m bls in dw 2 2 sediment and water sampling sediment porewater and groundwater samples were taken from dw site and pw site porewater samples were extracted from sediment samples by centrifugation while groundwater samples were taken from wells with depths between 10 and 20 m eleven boreholes with depths 10 m including eight in pw site and three in dw site fig 1 were drilled with a handheld breaker drilling machine cobra pro altlas copco the metal core barrel outfitted with a plastic liner and plastic core catcher was used to take sediment samples immediately after taken from the boreholes intact sediments were sliced into two sections under a nitrogen atmosphere one was wrapped by aluminum foils and sealed in n2 filled polyethylene bags which were kept at 4 c the other was immediately used for porewater sampling which was centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm in a nitrogen atmosphere keimowitz et al 2005 in this study 384 sediment samples and 137 sediment samples were taken from dw and pw sites respectively the sampling depth interval was around 10 cm and additional samples were taken in the case of lithological change after filtered through 0 45 µm millipore filter on site thirty seven porewater samples and twelve groundwater samples were taken for laboratory analysis details on groundwater sampling and on site analysis can be found in supporting information 2 3 analytical methods details on analysis of major cations anions trace elements as species dissolved organic carbon doc and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water samples can be found in supporting information analytical details of as fe mn total sedimentary organic carbon soc and difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 and 520 nm in sediment samples are also provided in supporting information to delineate the variability in dom properties about source and chemical characteristics uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were made by a uv visible spectrophotometer with a 10 mm path length uv8100 labtech ltd and a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer jobin yvon horiba respectively the specific uv absorbance suva254 routinely as an indicator of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was calculated as the uv absorbance at 254 nm normalized to doc concentration l m mg fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of intensities emitted at 470 520 nm at 370 nm excitation cory mcknight 2005 to distinguish microbial and terrestrial sources of dom in surface water mcknight et al 2001 wilson xenopoulos 2009 and groundwater mladenov et al 2015 humification index hix an indicator of the degree of dom humification was calculated as the peak area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm normalized to the peak area from 300 nm to 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm kulkarni et al 2017 biological index bix was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 380 430 nm at 310 nm excitation huguet et al 2009 to estimate autochthonous biological activity in aquatic environments excitation emission matrices eems were collected with an excitation range of 250 400 nm at 4 nm increments and an emission range of 300 550 nm at 2 nm increments milli q water blanks were subtracted to remove water scatter signal from each sample eem all spectra were corrected for the inner filter effect the domfluor toolbox stedmon bro 2008 was used to establish a parafac model for our sample dataset these eems were normalized to the raman peak area of a wavelength corrected raman scan using the method of murphy et al 2010 a four component model was verified by split half analysis residual intensities generated by subtracting the parafac modeled eem from the measured eem were within 10 of measured eem intensities for all samples which shows a good fit of the established model cawley et al 2012 the recognized four components included terrestrial humic like component c1 humic like components impacted by agriculture c2 microbial humic like component c3 and protein like component c4 fig s2 table s1 two indices based on the parafac components were developed to characterize the dom nature the protein humic ratio was calculated as the ratio of the protein like dom component c4 to the sum of humic like dom components c1 c2 c3 the microbial terrestrial microb terr ratio was obtained as the ratio of the sum of microbial humic like dom components c3 c4 to the sum of terrestrial humic like dom components c1 c2 two defined fractions water extractable organic matter weom toosi et al 2012 and salt extractable organic matter seom rennert et al 2007 were extracted from representative sediments thirteen from pw site and sixteen from dw site by using 0 01 mol l cacl2 and 0 5 mol l k2so4 respectively in the presence of a divalent cation stabilizing the potentially soluble om in sediments extraction by 0 01 mol l cacl2 generally represents the organic fractions freely present in sediment solutions zsolnay 2003 however seom was extracted via om desorption due to the presence of a competing anion so4 2 with an intermediate affinity for the sediment matrix rennert et al 2007 which is considered as the refractory pool jones willett 2006 the extracted solutions were used for doc uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements 2 4 incubation experiments batch experiments were carried out to investigate control of organic matter properties on as mobility by mixing sediments with autoclaved deionized water under anaerobic conditions based on analytical results of as fe mn and soc two representative fine sand samples were selected one from borehole 7 in pw at a depth of around 9 5 m ps and the other from borehole 10 in dw at a depth of around 7 5 m ds table 1 briefly in an anaerobic glovebox coy laboratory products usa under a n2 h2 92 5 7 5 v v atmosphere the sediment was added into deoxygenated deionized water with the solid liquid ratio of 20 g 100 ml in 150 ml acid washed and autoclaved serum bottles which were homogenized and then sealed with sterilized butyl rubber stoppers chemglass us abiotic controls were carried out with sterilized sediments being autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min supernatant samples were taken at different time intervals filtered with 0 45 μm millipore filter in the anaerobic glovebox and analyzed for as species fe ii total as total dissolved fe doc and uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy incubation experiments were conducted in duplicate and results are reported as averages 2 5 statistical analyses software package spss ibm version 17 was used for statistical analysis simple regression was made to establish relationships between two parameters both pearson correlation coefficients and p values were given for correlation analysis a p value 0 05 was considered as significant a two tailed t test was used to compare the statistically significant variability among samples 3 results 3 1 variability in solutes of porewater and groundwater total dissolved solid tds values of porewaters were mostly around 2000 mg l although porewaters from 9 in pw site had higher tds up to 20 000 mg l at a depth of 2 5 m bls fig 2 generally porewaters from pw site were mostly of na hco3 or na cl types while those from dw site were mostly of na so4 type fig s3 nitrate concentrations were mostly lower than 3 0 mg l in pw site higher meq ratios of so4 2 cl were observed in porewaters of dw site mostly around 2 than those of pw site mostly 0 8 1 0 the difference in water chemistry between two sites may be due to the relatively lower redox potentials in pw site which allowed the reduction of so4 2 details on variations in major components of porewater and groundwater can be found in supporting information relatively higher as concentrations were observed in porewaters of pw site than those of dw site at the depth around 9 5 m porewater had as concentrations of 98 4 μg l at 7 near pw site and 1 5 μg l at 10 near dw site in addition as concentrations generally increased with sampling depths fig 2 in 7 as concentrations increased from around 10 to about 100 μg l with increasing depths from 0 5 to 9 5 m in 11 an increasing trend of as concentrations was also found from 1 2 to 47 3 μg l the increases in as concentrations with depth was possibly the result of the decreases in redox potential although relatively higher fe concentrations were found in porewaters of pw site than those of dw site dissolved fe concentrations were mostly lower than 3 0 mg l arsenic concentrations in pw groundwater 161 347 μg l were much higher than those in dw groundwater 17 1 22 1 μg l arsenic iii was the major as species in groundwater which accounted for 50 of total as similar to porewater groundwater had higher fe concentrations in pw site than in dw site in addition higher as concentrations were observed in groundwater than porewater possibly due to the deeper sampling depths of groundwater pw groundwater had relatively higher doc concentrations 4 41 8 52 mg l than dw groundwater 1 06 2 90 mg l high doc concentration was also found in wetland water up to 10 2 mg l which provided a potential organic pool for shallow groundwater 3 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water samples dw porewaters were generally depleted in d and 18o δd 77 1 to 67 4 δ18o 10 6 to 9 0 in relative to pw porewaters δd 69 2 to 45 8 δ18o 8 9 to 5 0 the wetland water had higher δd and δ18o with average δd of 42 3 and average δ18o of 3 50 showing the strong influence of evaporation with the d excess between 8 3 and 15 9 in both pw and dw sites groundwater had similar δd and δ18o to porewater fig 3 however in pw site both groundwater and porewaters were plotted near the wetland waters in the diagram of δd versus δ18o fig 3 indicating the infiltration of the wetland water into shallow groundwater 3 3 sediment geochemistry in pw site fine sand silty sand silty clay and clay were observed in all boreholes silty sand mainly occurred at depths between 2 and 3 m bls clay was mainly observed at depths between 2 and 6 m bls which showed a decreasing trend in thickness toward the wetland and changed in color from light brown to grey downward three fine sand layers are present at shallow 0 2 m middle 3 3 5 m and deep depths 9 10 m fig 1c in dw site sum of clay layers was thinner than that in pw site although four clay layers were observed fig 1d three fine sand layers occur at depths between 0 and 2 m between 4 and 6 m between 7 5 and 9 0 m bls in pw site sediment as ranged between 5 33 and 49 7 mg kg median 14 6 mg kg n 384 which was positively correlated with fe between 11 4 and 73 0 g kg and a median of 28 4 g kg and mn 198 1490 mg kg with a median of 568 mg kg with correlation coefficients of 0 76 and 0 75 p 0 01 n 384 respectively higher as contents were observed in clay layers in relative to fine sand layers fig s4 in dw site contents of as ranged between 0 76 and 40 4 mg kg median 14 7 mg kg n 137 fe between 9 56 and 66 8 g kg median 34 0 g kg and mn between 228 and 1270 mg kg median 612 mg kg which were identical to those in pw site positive correlations were also observed between as and fe r 0 53 p 0 05 n 137 and between as and mn r 0 57 p 0 05 n 137 slightly higher soc were observed in sediments from pw site than those from dw site in pw site soc ranged between 0 04 and 12 9 g kg although the highest soc value was found in dw site 34 1 g kg the median 2 33 g kg n 137 was relatively lower than that in pw site median 2 79 g kg n 384 in both pw and dw sites clay generally had higher soc contents than fine sand reflectance difference between 530 and 520 nm of sediments was usually higher near land surface and lower in or near clay layers 3 4 spectroscopic properties of bulk om in sediment extracts and groundwater generally eom including weom and seom from representative sediment samples had relatively higher bix and lower hix and suva254 values in pw sediment extracts in relative to dw sediment extracts fig 4 a h the lower suva254 values showed lower aromaticity levels of organic matter in pw sediments although fi values of seom in pw sediment extracts were identical to those in dw sediment extracts fig 4g weom in pw sediment extracts had slightly lower fi values than in dw sediment extracts fig 4c furthermore in comparison with weom fig 4a and b relatively lower bix and higher hix were observed for seom fig 4e and f the results are similar to those of previous studies showing that weom is the soluble om as the immediate labile om pool and seom is relatively refractory as a potential recharge for microbially consumed soluble om jones willett 2006 huang et al 2015 in each site groundwater samples had similar bix hix fi and suva254 values to weom samples fig 4 in pw site groundwater had bix between 0 77 and 0 84 average 0 81 fig 4i which were identical to those of weom 0 72 0 93 with an average of 0 83 fig 4a medians of suva254 values in groundwater and weom were 2 31 and 1 91 respectively similar spectroscopic properties of groundwater dom to weom were also observed by huang et al 2015 slightly higher bix values were observed in pw groundwater 0 77 0 84 than in dw groundwater 0 73 0 78 however dw groundwater samples had higher hix and suva254 values 4 34 6 61 and 4 34 6 05 respectively in relative to pw groundwater samples 2 26 3 72 and 1 83 3 29 respectively pw groundwater had similar hix and suva254 to the wetland water fig 4j l while bix values of the wetland water were slightly higher than those of pw groundwater 3 5 parafac model components four components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified in weom seom and groundwater by the parafac model generally c2 was predominated in weom median 31 2 followed by c1 c4 and c3 while c1 was the highest in seom median 37 1 followed by c2 c4 and c3 in both weom and seom relative contributions of c3 and c4 to total fluorescence expressed as were higher in pw sediment extracts than those in dw sediment extracts table s2 weom of pw sediment extracts had c4 range between 11 0 and 43 2 median 28 8 which are generally greater than those in dw sediment extracts 5 7 to 30 9 median 21 1 higher c4 were also observed in seom of pw sediment extracts 9 4 45 7 median 22 6 relative to dw sediment extracts 3 3 28 9 median 21 3 however in both weom and seom relative contributions of c1 and c2 were higher in dw sediment extracts than those in pw sediment extracts table s2 protein humic and microb terr ratios of sediment extracts are shown in fig 5 a and b and table s2 generally pw sediment extracts had higher protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios relative to dw sediment extracts microb terr ratios of pw sediment weom ranged between 0 56 and 1 61 with a median of 0 92 while dw sediment weom between 0 55 and 0 92 median 0 66 systematically weom had higher microb terr and protein humic ratios than seom showing that weom were featured by more microbe associated om microb terr ratios of pw sediment seom had the range between 0 49 and 1 54 median 0 83 which are generally higher than those in dw sediment seom 0 42 0 87 median 0 60 in addition protein humic ratios were positively correlated with microb terr ratios in both weom r 0 94 and seom r 0 95 p 0 01 fig 5a and b generally groundwater samples had the highest c2 34 2 44 7 followed by c3 c1 and c4 showing the predominance of humic like components impacted by agriculture higher relative contents of c4 and c3 and lower relative contents of c1 were observed in pw groundwater in relative to dw groundwater accordingly pw groundwater showed higher microb terr and protein humic ratios 0 63 0 73 and 0 12 0 15 respectively than dw groundwater 0 38 0 57 and 0 08 0 09 respectively fig 5c in addition the wetland water had higher c4 and lower c3 in relative to groundwater in the pw site while c1 and c2 were identical to those of pw groundwater microb terr ratios of the wetland water were similar to those of pw groundwater while the wetland water had slightly higher protein humic ratios than pw groundwater fig 5c 3 6 variations in dissolved as and organic matter properties during incubation two representative fine sands selected for incubation experiments had similar contents of total as fe mn and soc but their spectroscopic indices and parafac model components representing organic matter properties were different table 1 the relative contribution of c4 to total fluorescence expressed as was higher in ps than in ds while ds had higher relative contents of c1 and c2 table 1 showing more bioreactive om pool in ps than ds although total as contents were similar in ps and ds more as was released from ps than ds during incubation fig 6 a for ps the kinetic rate of as release was fast 0 88 μg kg h during the whole experiment at the end of incubation as concentration increased to 452 μg l which is much higher than that in ds batches 159 μg l in contrast concentrations of doc generally showed decreasing trends in both ps and ds batches more organic matter was degraded in ps batches with doc decreasing from 12 0 to 1 5 mg l than that in ds batches with doc decreasing from 15 0 to 6 6 mg l which led to more as release in ps batches in addition more as release from ps would be related to organic matter properties which had higher relative contents of c4 during incubation c4 decreased from 12 to 6 9 in ps batches which is more evident than ds batches from 7 5 to 5 8 fig 6b it indicates that as release would be associated with decreases in c4 which had higher bioreactivity in abiotic controls both as and relative contents of c4 kept relatively constant which were around 8 5 μg l and 8 5 in ds batches and 45 μg l and 16 in ps batches respectively fig 6 relative contents of refractory organic matter c1 and c2 components slightly increased fig 7 concentrations of fe and mn generally increased during ps incubation which showed different trends from ds incubation figs 6c and s5 dissolved fe concentrations first increased and then decreased in ps batches while they gently increased in ds batches in addition fe ii concentrations were similar to total dissolved fe generally more mn was released from ds batches than ps batches 166 μg l vs 48 μg l at the end of experiments in abiotic batches both dissolved fe and mn kept relatively constant which were around 280 μg l and 65 μg l from ds batches and 340 μg l and 13 μg l from ps batches respectively solution ph kept relatively stable during incubation which was between 7 5 and 7 9 in ds batches median 7 6 and between 8 2 and 8 5 in ps batches median 8 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of wetland water on groundwater dom infiltration of surface water wetland water introduced organic matter into shallow groundwater from the pw site which had relatively higher contents of bioavailable om the wetland water generally had higher bix protein humic ratio microb terr ratio and lower hix in comparison with groundwater figs 4 and 5 the higher bix and lower hix values indicate that the wetland water had more autochthonous components such as algae and bacteria huguet et al 2009 although fi values indicate the mixed contribution from microbially derived and terrestrially derived dom components the eems of wetland water samples with a peak in the protein like fluorescence near excitation emission of 258 334 nm also supported the microbial dom source kulkarni et al 2017 in addition relatively higher protein humic and microb terr ratios provided the further evidence of the microbial dom source the combined spectroscopic properties jointly showed higher contributions of protein like components and microbially derived components in the wetland water which was believed to be more bioreactive huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 other studies also observed labile bioreactive dom in surface water mladenov et al 2010 and pond water neumann et al 2010 in high as groundwater affected areas in bangladesh isotopic characteristics showed influence of the wetland water on porewater and shallow groundwater in pw site fig 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of porewater nearest the wetland were similar to those of the wetland water indicating the recharge of wetland water into porewater although more depleted d and 18o were observed in other porewater and groundwater samples in pw site they were the result of mixing of wetland water groundwater and precipitation the recharge of wetland water into pw shallow groundwater was also supported by the higher levels of the wetland water than the shallow groundwater levels fig s6 the recharge from the wetland water not only inherited isotopic signature but also carried the bioreactive organic matter into the shallow groundwater of the pw site neumann et al 2010 found that recharge of pond water took the labile organic matter into shallow aquifers which increased concentrations of biologically degradable organic carbon in porewater beneath ponds downward migration of young organic matter was also expected to occur in shallow as affected groundwater in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 mailloux et al 2013 and cambodia lawson et al 2016 richards et al 2018 in west bengal where groundwater was extensively pumped pond derived organic matter was transported into shallow groundwater vertically farooq et al 2012 lawson et al 2013 majumder et al 2016 4 2 association of dom with weom linkage between weom and groundwater dom was evidenced in the study area although spectroscopic properties of weom were different from seom similar spectroscopic indices were observed between weom and groundwater dom in both pw and dw sites fig 4 weom and groundwater dom had relatively higher bix and fi values in relative to seom fi values in both weom and groundwater dom were around 1 6 showing the mixed contribution from microbially derived and terrestrially derived dom components cory mcknight 2005 the higher bix values of weom and groundwater dom also supported more autochthonous components huguet et al 2009 spectroscopic fingerprint traced groundwater dom to weom pool in sediments indicating the source of groundwater dom from sediments in both pw and dw sites previous studies in high as groundwater affected areas also indicate that groundwater dom was sourced from aquifer sediments sengupta et al 2008 concluded that components of high as groundwater were not introduced from pondwater implying that groundwater dom was geogenically sourced from aquifer sediments in west bengal ghosh et al 2015 showed that som was potentially available to indigenous heterotrophic microbes in grey sand aquifers from bengal delta plain mcarthur et al 2004 observed that som in peat contributed to labile dom in high as groundwater in vietnam postma et al 2012 indicated that labile dom contributing to as mobilization originated from young sediments soluble om was believed to seep from sediment layers into the adjacent aquifer in van phuc vietnam eiche et al 2017 it is also consistent with results of laboratory incubations showing that som added substantially to labile pool of groundwater dom neumann et al 2014 although the possibility that large sized om may not pass through the sediment matrix into groundwater cannot be ruled out the relatively lower protein humic and microb terr ratios of groundwater dom than weom in both pw and dw sites fig 5 indicate that protein like components and microbially derived dom components would be predominantly degraded during dispersion of weom from sediments into groundwater this was evidenced by results of our incubation experiments 4 3 roles of labile organic matter in as mobilization in relative to dw site weom and groundwater dom from pw site having relatively higher bix higher protein humic and microb terr ratios figs 4 and 5 showed higher bioreactivity which corresponded to higher as concentrations in both porewater and groundwater it indicates that dissolved as concentrations were dependent on bioreactivity of organic matter in both aqueous phase and water extractable pool in sediments due to the limited volume of porewater no porewater samples were measured for spectroscopic properties herein comparison between porewater as and spectroscopic indices of weom at matched depths was made for both pw and dw sites porewater as concentrations were positively correlated with microb terr ratios and protein humic ratios of sediment weom with correlation coefficients of 0 86 and 0 81 respectively p 0 01 fig 8 the labile organic matter with high microb terr and protein humic ratios drove reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides neidhardt et al 2014 and subsequently mobilized the adsorbed as stuckey et al 2015 the weak correlation between porewater as concentrations and fe concentrations would result from siderite precipitation in porewater being oversaturated with respect to siderite phreeqc calculation showed that the median of sisiderite was 0 66 in the studied porewater with the range between 1 6 and 1 7 due to the limited adsorption of as on siderite under anoxic conditions guo et al 2013b more as was released from fe iii oxide reduction than that scavenged by siderite precipitation which led to high as concentrations guo et al 2013a roles of sediment derived labile organic matter in as mobilization was also evidenced by incubation experiments anaerobic incubations of the ps sediment with higher bix higher microb terr and protein humic ratios in weom released more as which is consistent with more consumption of protein like components and or microbially derived dom components by indigenous bacteria fig 6 due to their high bioreactivity kulkarni et al 2017 huang et al 2015 previous studies showed that those indigenous bacteria included fe iii oxide reducers li et al 2017b 2014 variations in doc concentrations during incubation also illustrated that more organic matter was degraded in ps batches from 12 0 to 1 5 mg l than ds batches from 15 0 to 6 6 mg l biodegradation of protein like components and microbially derived components led to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and therefore as mobilization in ps batches higher as concentrations were associated with higher dissolved fe concentrations fig 6a and c although dissolved fe ii concentrations decreased after 300 h incubation in ps batches it may result from siderite precipitation sisiderite 0 4 as discussed above siderite precipitation cannot decrease concentrations of as released from reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides after biodegradation relative contents of bioreactive organic matter c4 component decreased fig 6b this is consistent with the observation that the bioreactivity of som decreased after buried and degraded postma et al 2012 katsev and crowe 2015 this decrease in organic matter bioreactivity would decrease kinetics of fe oxide reduction and slow down groundwater as enrichment postma et al 2016 therefore bioreactive organic matter as carbon source and electron donor played an important role in as mobilization via reductive dissolution of fe oxides although we cannot rule out complexation and electron shuttling of humic like organic matter in increasing as mobility from aquifer sediments mladenov et al 2010 2015 kulkarni et al 2017 in addition to weom from sediments the wetland water with relatively higher bioreactivity recharging shallow groundwater in the pw site due to the higher levels of the wetland water than groundwater levels fig s6 was another possible cause of higher bix higher microb terr and protein humic ratios of groundwater dom in pw than those of groundwater dom in dw as discussed in the section 4 1 the heavier o and h isotopes of porewater and groundwater in the pw site also supported the recharge of the wetland water into shallow aquifer it indicates that recharge of more bioreactive om from the wetland water would lead to relatively higher contributions of protein like components and microbially derived dom components to shallow groundwater and therefore fuel as mobility stuckey et al 2015 4 4 environmental implications our investigation demonstrates that bioreactive organic matter was originated from both surface water wetland water and sedimentary matrix near the wetland which fueled microbial reactions and led to as mobilization surface water generally contained relatively higher contents of bioavailable organic matter huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 the downward migration of this component increased the bioreactivity of organic matter in the aquifers to the indigenous microbial community farooq et al 2010 this downward migration was accelerated by groundwater pumping lawson et al 2013 burgess et al 2010 due to the increase in the hydraulic gradients between surface water and groundwater the hydraulic gradients increased from 0 5 to 1 from april to august due to summer irrigation near the pw site zhang et al 2018 this was one of the reasons that high as groundwater occurred near the wetland in the distal alluvial fans of the hetao basin where many wells were used for agricultural irrigation guo et al 2016b in addition weom in pw sediments had high bioreactivity to microbial metabolism although we had no dating data the sediments near natural wetlands were possibly relatively young due to the higher sedimentation rates li 2006 bioreactive weom can be released into groundwater by any physical and chemical disturbances neumann et al 2014 demonstrated that perturbations to the aquifer sediments can mobilize labile som to indigenous bacteria including variations of groundwater flow patterns by extracting groundwater van geen et al 2013 and alternations of chemical conditions mikutta et al 2006 as long as bioreactive organic matter was introduced into groundwater either from surface water or from sediment matrix the organic matter especially protein like components and microbially derived components was preferentially utilized by microbial respiration this is consistent with radiocarbon data from other high as groundwater systems in cambodia bangladesh and west bengal mailloux et al 2013 lawson et al 2013 2016 showing a mixture of surface derived om and som in high as groundwater relatively lower bioreactivity of organic matter was observed in areas with no wetlands which was associated with the absence of surface water and lower contents of labile som figs 4 and 5 although incubation of ds sediment released as into solutions which again indicated that perturbations exposed labile organic matter to indigenous microbial community neumann et al 2014 groundwater as were relatively low in the dw site these low as concentrations were not only related to low contents of labile som but also due to the limited mobilization of stabilized som 5 conclusion high as concentrations were usually observed in shallow groundwater and porewater near the permanent wetland pw while dissolved as concentrations were normally low near the dried wetland dw contents of sedimentary fe and mn in pw were identical to those in dw although slightly higher contents of soc were observed than those from dw generally eom including weom and seom had relatively higher bix and lower hix values in pw sediment extracts in relative to dw sediment extracts indicating that pw sediments had more bioavailable organic matter this observation is also supported by results of parafac model showing that pw sediment extracts had higher protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios similar water stable isotopes between wetland water and shallow groundwater and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater indicated the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater being recharged from wetland water pw groundwater showed higher bix values protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios than dw groundwater indicating higher bioreactivity of dom in pw groundwater therefore higher bioreactivity of organic matter mainly protein like and microbial components in both groundwater and water extractable pool in sediments resulted in higher dissolved as concentrations incubation experiments showing that more as was released from the pw sediment along with the greater decrease in relative contents of protein like component c4 in relative to the dw sediment also proved that the bioreactive organic matter as carbon source and electron donor played an important role in as mobilization via reductive dissolution of fe oxides accordingly both the downward migration of bioreactive surface dom and destabilization of biodegradable som would enhance as mobility in shallow aquifer sediments dependence of groundwater as distribution on bioreactivity of organic matter is important to develop processes based models for accurately predicting spatiotemporal variations of groundwater as at a local scale conflict of interest the authors

6658,organic matter om is widely accepted to be the trigger for arsenic as mobilization from sediments into groundwater identifications of reactivity and sources of organic matter responsible for driving as liberation remain unresolved to address these issues we provide the extensive characterization of om in shallow groundwater surface water and sediments near a permanent wetland and a dried wetland in the hetao basin with high as groundwater and low as groundwater respectively using fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis parafac dissolved organic matter dom of shallow groundwater and sediments near the permanent wetland had higher biological index bix and more protein like components and microbially derived components relative to that near the dried wetland showing higher bioreactivity fingerprint of water stable isotopes and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater pointed to the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater laboratory incubations of the sediment with more bioreactive om obtained near the permanent wetland mobilized more as both dom properties and laboratory incubations indicate that om with high bioreactivity promoted as mobility mainly by fuelling microbial respiration of fe oxide reduction recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater introduced bioreactive dom into shallow aquifer groundwater dom near the permanent wetland was typically sourced from both wetland dom and sedimentary om with high bioreactivity however sedimentary om was the major source of groundwater dom near the dried wetland it suggested that downward infiltration of surface derived om and perturbations of aquifer sediments by changing groundwater flow regimes increase bioreactivity of groundwater dom and therefore enhance as mobility keywords organic carbon labile groundwater iron oxides reductive dissolution 1 introduction arsenic as mobilization in aquifers has been widely accepted to be triggered by organic matter via reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or reductive desorption of adsorbed as v islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2013a however the source of organic matter supporting microbial metabolism remains unclear studies have shown that organic matter was sourced from sediments which was evidenced by the relationship between sedimentary organic matter and dissolved as and the occurrence of organic rich deposits around high as groundwater meharg et al 2006 quicksall et al 2008 mcarthur et al 2008 papacostas et al 2008 mao et al 2018 this scenario was also supported by laboratory incubations of sediments showing that any perturbations enhance mobilization of bioavailable sedimentary organic matter neumann et al 2014 in contrast others concluded that organic matter was introduced from surface or near surface derived organic matter along with recharging water which was supported by young ages of dissolved inorganic carbon and microbial biomass in high as groundwater harvey et al 2002 mailloux et al 2013 whaley martin et al 2016 by similar chemicals and isotopic characteristics between surface water and high as groundwater polizzotto et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 and by identification of sterol biomarkers of human livestock waste whaley martin et al 2017 identification of the source of organic matter is of significant importance in both accurately predicting changes in groundwater as in the future and in efficiently developing solutions to remediation of as contamination although the reactivity of organic matter has been assessed by incubation experiments islam et al 2004 neumann et al 2014 guo et al 2008 radloff et al 2007 and spectroscopic characteristics huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 effect of the reactivity of organic matter om on as mobilization remains elusive most investigations showed that om which contributed to as mobility was bioavailable to microbes as biodegradable pool islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 van geen et al 2013 neumann et al 2014 radloff et al 2007 lawson et al 2016 vega et al 2017 however others suggested that refractory om with chemical reactivity should promote as mobility via as fe om complexation reactions mladenov et al 2015 kulkarni et al 2017 li et al 2017a electron shuttles for reduction of as bearing fe oxides chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2009 and competitive adsorption with as reza et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 for the biodegradable pool the type and the bioreactivity of om are the key factors controlling as mobility utilization of om with different bioreactivity led to different rates of fe oxide reduction and therefore different rates of as mobility into groundwater with relatively higher rates concerning younger om having higher bioreactivity postma et al 2012 for the latter the functional groups of om to complex as are of significance in enhancing as mobility such as reactive humic moieties and n and s containing functional groups as well as quinone like components mladenov et al 2015 reza et al 2010 chen et al 2017 therefore it is important to reveal roles of om in mobilizing as in aquifers with respect to different sources and or chemical compositions which will improve our understanding of as mobilization mechanisms absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques are rapid sensitive and reliable tools for characterization of bioreactive and chemically reactive fractions of dissolved organic matter dom and extractable sediment organic matter huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2015 uv visible absorption spectra for dom provide information about source molecular weight humification and aromaticity helms et al 2008 on the other hand three dimensional fluorescence can be used to quantitatively analyze dom source biological activity and degree of humification in the aqueous environment huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2015 huguet et al 2009 in addition parallel factor analysis parafac of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem data allows to quantitatively identify individual fluorescent components of dom including humic like protein like terrestrially derived and microbially derived components cory and mcknight 2005 mladenov et al 2015 based on which comprehensive indices have been calculated for dom characterization such as the redox index mladenov et al 2010 2015 the humic protein index and the terrestrial microbial index kulkarni et al 2017 all those data provide insights into source reactivity and transformation of dom in aqueous environment in this study two sites were selected in the hetao basin to investigate reactivity of om in both shallow groundwater and sediments and its sources with respect to as mobility one was located near a permanent wetland where high as groundwater was observed as 50 μg l the other was near a dried wetland with the occurrence of low as groundwater as 50 μg l the objectives are to 1 characterize the nature of om in groundwater and sediments by using optical spectroscopic analysis and parallel factor analysis parafac of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem data 2 evaluate the sources of reactive organic matter in high as groundwater 3 assess roles of reactive organic matter in as mobility in groundwater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the hetao basin is filled with a sequence of quaternary sediments with thicknesses of 1500 8000 m accessible groundwater mainly occurs in the quaternary alluvial alluvial pluvial and alluvial lacustrine aquifers jia et al 2014 there are many natural surface water bodies including lagoons lakes and wetlands guo et al 2011 details on the study area are provided in supporting information the study area is located in the distal alluvial fans where a typical dried wetland dw and a typical permanent wetland pw are present fig 1 although dw was recharged from groundwater under natural hydrogeological conditions it was dried about 14 years ago due to lowering groundwater levels after groundwater has been pumped for agricultural irrigation remote sensing images showed that pw has lasted for 40 year groundwater recharged the wetland before the year 2000 while water of drainage channel has mainly recharged the wetland after the year 2000 the recharge of the wetland water into shallow groundwater near pw was inferred hydraulically by the higher water tables of the wetland shallow groundwater near pw generally has high as concentrations while near dw low as groundwater is normally observed guo et al 2016a groundwater tables varied between 3 0 and 4 0 m below land surface bls in pw while between 5 0 and 8 0 m bls in dw 2 2 sediment and water sampling sediment porewater and groundwater samples were taken from dw site and pw site porewater samples were extracted from sediment samples by centrifugation while groundwater samples were taken from wells with depths between 10 and 20 m eleven boreholes with depths 10 m including eight in pw site and three in dw site fig 1 were drilled with a handheld breaker drilling machine cobra pro altlas copco the metal core barrel outfitted with a plastic liner and plastic core catcher was used to take sediment samples immediately after taken from the boreholes intact sediments were sliced into two sections under a nitrogen atmosphere one was wrapped by aluminum foils and sealed in n2 filled polyethylene bags which were kept at 4 c the other was immediately used for porewater sampling which was centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm in a nitrogen atmosphere keimowitz et al 2005 in this study 384 sediment samples and 137 sediment samples were taken from dw and pw sites respectively the sampling depth interval was around 10 cm and additional samples were taken in the case of lithological change after filtered through 0 45 µm millipore filter on site thirty seven porewater samples and twelve groundwater samples were taken for laboratory analysis details on groundwater sampling and on site analysis can be found in supporting information 2 3 analytical methods details on analysis of major cations anions trace elements as species dissolved organic carbon doc and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water samples can be found in supporting information analytical details of as fe mn total sedimentary organic carbon soc and difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 and 520 nm in sediment samples are also provided in supporting information to delineate the variability in dom properties about source and chemical characteristics uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were made by a uv visible spectrophotometer with a 10 mm path length uv8100 labtech ltd and a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer jobin yvon horiba respectively the specific uv absorbance suva254 routinely as an indicator of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was calculated as the uv absorbance at 254 nm normalized to doc concentration l m mg fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of intensities emitted at 470 520 nm at 370 nm excitation cory mcknight 2005 to distinguish microbial and terrestrial sources of dom in surface water mcknight et al 2001 wilson xenopoulos 2009 and groundwater mladenov et al 2015 humification index hix an indicator of the degree of dom humification was calculated as the peak area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm normalized to the peak area from 300 nm to 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm kulkarni et al 2017 biological index bix was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 380 430 nm at 310 nm excitation huguet et al 2009 to estimate autochthonous biological activity in aquatic environments excitation emission matrices eems were collected with an excitation range of 250 400 nm at 4 nm increments and an emission range of 300 550 nm at 2 nm increments milli q water blanks were subtracted to remove water scatter signal from each sample eem all spectra were corrected for the inner filter effect the domfluor toolbox stedmon bro 2008 was used to establish a parafac model for our sample dataset these eems were normalized to the raman peak area of a wavelength corrected raman scan using the method of murphy et al 2010 a four component model was verified by split half analysis residual intensities generated by subtracting the parafac modeled eem from the measured eem were within 10 of measured eem intensities for all samples which shows a good fit of the established model cawley et al 2012 the recognized four components included terrestrial humic like component c1 humic like components impacted by agriculture c2 microbial humic like component c3 and protein like component c4 fig s2 table s1 two indices based on the parafac components were developed to characterize the dom nature the protein humic ratio was calculated as the ratio of the protein like dom component c4 to the sum of humic like dom components c1 c2 c3 the microbial terrestrial microb terr ratio was obtained as the ratio of the sum of microbial humic like dom components c3 c4 to the sum of terrestrial humic like dom components c1 c2 two defined fractions water extractable organic matter weom toosi et al 2012 and salt extractable organic matter seom rennert et al 2007 were extracted from representative sediments thirteen from pw site and sixteen from dw site by using 0 01 mol l cacl2 and 0 5 mol l k2so4 respectively in the presence of a divalent cation stabilizing the potentially soluble om in sediments extraction by 0 01 mol l cacl2 generally represents the organic fractions freely present in sediment solutions zsolnay 2003 however seom was extracted via om desorption due to the presence of a competing anion so4 2 with an intermediate affinity for the sediment matrix rennert et al 2007 which is considered as the refractory pool jones willett 2006 the extracted solutions were used for doc uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements 2 4 incubation experiments batch experiments were carried out to investigate control of organic matter properties on as mobility by mixing sediments with autoclaved deionized water under anaerobic conditions based on analytical results of as fe mn and soc two representative fine sand samples were selected one from borehole 7 in pw at a depth of around 9 5 m ps and the other from borehole 10 in dw at a depth of around 7 5 m ds table 1 briefly in an anaerobic glovebox coy laboratory products usa under a n2 h2 92 5 7 5 v v atmosphere the sediment was added into deoxygenated deionized water with the solid liquid ratio of 20 g 100 ml in 150 ml acid washed and autoclaved serum bottles which were homogenized and then sealed with sterilized butyl rubber stoppers chemglass us abiotic controls were carried out with sterilized sediments being autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min supernatant samples were taken at different time intervals filtered with 0 45 μm millipore filter in the anaerobic glovebox and analyzed for as species fe ii total as total dissolved fe doc and uv visible absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy incubation experiments were conducted in duplicate and results are reported as averages 2 5 statistical analyses software package spss ibm version 17 was used for statistical analysis simple regression was made to establish relationships between two parameters both pearson correlation coefficients and p values were given for correlation analysis a p value 0 05 was considered as significant a two tailed t test was used to compare the statistically significant variability among samples 3 results 3 1 variability in solutes of porewater and groundwater total dissolved solid tds values of porewaters were mostly around 2000 mg l although porewaters from 9 in pw site had higher tds up to 20 000 mg l at a depth of 2 5 m bls fig 2 generally porewaters from pw site were mostly of na hco3 or na cl types while those from dw site were mostly of na so4 type fig s3 nitrate concentrations were mostly lower than 3 0 mg l in pw site higher meq ratios of so4 2 cl were observed in porewaters of dw site mostly around 2 than those of pw site mostly 0 8 1 0 the difference in water chemistry between two sites may be due to the relatively lower redox potentials in pw site which allowed the reduction of so4 2 details on variations in major components of porewater and groundwater can be found in supporting information relatively higher as concentrations were observed in porewaters of pw site than those of dw site at the depth around 9 5 m porewater had as concentrations of 98 4 μg l at 7 near pw site and 1 5 μg l at 10 near dw site in addition as concentrations generally increased with sampling depths fig 2 in 7 as concentrations increased from around 10 to about 100 μg l with increasing depths from 0 5 to 9 5 m in 11 an increasing trend of as concentrations was also found from 1 2 to 47 3 μg l the increases in as concentrations with depth was possibly the result of the decreases in redox potential although relatively higher fe concentrations were found in porewaters of pw site than those of dw site dissolved fe concentrations were mostly lower than 3 0 mg l arsenic concentrations in pw groundwater 161 347 μg l were much higher than those in dw groundwater 17 1 22 1 μg l arsenic iii was the major as species in groundwater which accounted for 50 of total as similar to porewater groundwater had higher fe concentrations in pw site than in dw site in addition higher as concentrations were observed in groundwater than porewater possibly due to the deeper sampling depths of groundwater pw groundwater had relatively higher doc concentrations 4 41 8 52 mg l than dw groundwater 1 06 2 90 mg l high doc concentration was also found in wetland water up to 10 2 mg l which provided a potential organic pool for shallow groundwater 3 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water samples dw porewaters were generally depleted in d and 18o δd 77 1 to 67 4 δ18o 10 6 to 9 0 in relative to pw porewaters δd 69 2 to 45 8 δ18o 8 9 to 5 0 the wetland water had higher δd and δ18o with average δd of 42 3 and average δ18o of 3 50 showing the strong influence of evaporation with the d excess between 8 3 and 15 9 in both pw and dw sites groundwater had similar δd and δ18o to porewater fig 3 however in pw site both groundwater and porewaters were plotted near the wetland waters in the diagram of δd versus δ18o fig 3 indicating the infiltration of the wetland water into shallow groundwater 3 3 sediment geochemistry in pw site fine sand silty sand silty clay and clay were observed in all boreholes silty sand mainly occurred at depths between 2 and 3 m bls clay was mainly observed at depths between 2 and 6 m bls which showed a decreasing trend in thickness toward the wetland and changed in color from light brown to grey downward three fine sand layers are present at shallow 0 2 m middle 3 3 5 m and deep depths 9 10 m fig 1c in dw site sum of clay layers was thinner than that in pw site although four clay layers were observed fig 1d three fine sand layers occur at depths between 0 and 2 m between 4 and 6 m between 7 5 and 9 0 m bls in pw site sediment as ranged between 5 33 and 49 7 mg kg median 14 6 mg kg n 384 which was positively correlated with fe between 11 4 and 73 0 g kg and a median of 28 4 g kg and mn 198 1490 mg kg with a median of 568 mg kg with correlation coefficients of 0 76 and 0 75 p 0 01 n 384 respectively higher as contents were observed in clay layers in relative to fine sand layers fig s4 in dw site contents of as ranged between 0 76 and 40 4 mg kg median 14 7 mg kg n 137 fe between 9 56 and 66 8 g kg median 34 0 g kg and mn between 228 and 1270 mg kg median 612 mg kg which were identical to those in pw site positive correlations were also observed between as and fe r 0 53 p 0 05 n 137 and between as and mn r 0 57 p 0 05 n 137 slightly higher soc were observed in sediments from pw site than those from dw site in pw site soc ranged between 0 04 and 12 9 g kg although the highest soc value was found in dw site 34 1 g kg the median 2 33 g kg n 137 was relatively lower than that in pw site median 2 79 g kg n 384 in both pw and dw sites clay generally had higher soc contents than fine sand reflectance difference between 530 and 520 nm of sediments was usually higher near land surface and lower in or near clay layers 3 4 spectroscopic properties of bulk om in sediment extracts and groundwater generally eom including weom and seom from representative sediment samples had relatively higher bix and lower hix and suva254 values in pw sediment extracts in relative to dw sediment extracts fig 4 a h the lower suva254 values showed lower aromaticity levels of organic matter in pw sediments although fi values of seom in pw sediment extracts were identical to those in dw sediment extracts fig 4g weom in pw sediment extracts had slightly lower fi values than in dw sediment extracts fig 4c furthermore in comparison with weom fig 4a and b relatively lower bix and higher hix were observed for seom fig 4e and f the results are similar to those of previous studies showing that weom is the soluble om as the immediate labile om pool and seom is relatively refractory as a potential recharge for microbially consumed soluble om jones willett 2006 huang et al 2015 in each site groundwater samples had similar bix hix fi and suva254 values to weom samples fig 4 in pw site groundwater had bix between 0 77 and 0 84 average 0 81 fig 4i which were identical to those of weom 0 72 0 93 with an average of 0 83 fig 4a medians of suva254 values in groundwater and weom were 2 31 and 1 91 respectively similar spectroscopic properties of groundwater dom to weom were also observed by huang et al 2015 slightly higher bix values were observed in pw groundwater 0 77 0 84 than in dw groundwater 0 73 0 78 however dw groundwater samples had higher hix and suva254 values 4 34 6 61 and 4 34 6 05 respectively in relative to pw groundwater samples 2 26 3 72 and 1 83 3 29 respectively pw groundwater had similar hix and suva254 to the wetland water fig 4j l while bix values of the wetland water were slightly higher than those of pw groundwater 3 5 parafac model components four components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified in weom seom and groundwater by the parafac model generally c2 was predominated in weom median 31 2 followed by c1 c4 and c3 while c1 was the highest in seom median 37 1 followed by c2 c4 and c3 in both weom and seom relative contributions of c3 and c4 to total fluorescence expressed as were higher in pw sediment extracts than those in dw sediment extracts table s2 weom of pw sediment extracts had c4 range between 11 0 and 43 2 median 28 8 which are generally greater than those in dw sediment extracts 5 7 to 30 9 median 21 1 higher c4 were also observed in seom of pw sediment extracts 9 4 45 7 median 22 6 relative to dw sediment extracts 3 3 28 9 median 21 3 however in both weom and seom relative contributions of c1 and c2 were higher in dw sediment extracts than those in pw sediment extracts table s2 protein humic and microb terr ratios of sediment extracts are shown in fig 5 a and b and table s2 generally pw sediment extracts had higher protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios relative to dw sediment extracts microb terr ratios of pw sediment weom ranged between 0 56 and 1 61 with a median of 0 92 while dw sediment weom between 0 55 and 0 92 median 0 66 systematically weom had higher microb terr and protein humic ratios than seom showing that weom were featured by more microbe associated om microb terr ratios of pw sediment seom had the range between 0 49 and 1 54 median 0 83 which are generally higher than those in dw sediment seom 0 42 0 87 median 0 60 in addition protein humic ratios were positively correlated with microb terr ratios in both weom r 0 94 and seom r 0 95 p 0 01 fig 5a and b generally groundwater samples had the highest c2 34 2 44 7 followed by c3 c1 and c4 showing the predominance of humic like components impacted by agriculture higher relative contents of c4 and c3 and lower relative contents of c1 were observed in pw groundwater in relative to dw groundwater accordingly pw groundwater showed higher microb terr and protein humic ratios 0 63 0 73 and 0 12 0 15 respectively than dw groundwater 0 38 0 57 and 0 08 0 09 respectively fig 5c in addition the wetland water had higher c4 and lower c3 in relative to groundwater in the pw site while c1 and c2 were identical to those of pw groundwater microb terr ratios of the wetland water were similar to those of pw groundwater while the wetland water had slightly higher protein humic ratios than pw groundwater fig 5c 3 6 variations in dissolved as and organic matter properties during incubation two representative fine sands selected for incubation experiments had similar contents of total as fe mn and soc but their spectroscopic indices and parafac model components representing organic matter properties were different table 1 the relative contribution of c4 to total fluorescence expressed as was higher in ps than in ds while ds had higher relative contents of c1 and c2 table 1 showing more bioreactive om pool in ps than ds although total as contents were similar in ps and ds more as was released from ps than ds during incubation fig 6 a for ps the kinetic rate of as release was fast 0 88 μg kg h during the whole experiment at the end of incubation as concentration increased to 452 μg l which is much higher than that in ds batches 159 μg l in contrast concentrations of doc generally showed decreasing trends in both ps and ds batches more organic matter was degraded in ps batches with doc decreasing from 12 0 to 1 5 mg l than that in ds batches with doc decreasing from 15 0 to 6 6 mg l which led to more as release in ps batches in addition more as release from ps would be related to organic matter properties which had higher relative contents of c4 during incubation c4 decreased from 12 to 6 9 in ps batches which is more evident than ds batches from 7 5 to 5 8 fig 6b it indicates that as release would be associated with decreases in c4 which had higher bioreactivity in abiotic controls both as and relative contents of c4 kept relatively constant which were around 8 5 μg l and 8 5 in ds batches and 45 μg l and 16 in ps batches respectively fig 6 relative contents of refractory organic matter c1 and c2 components slightly increased fig 7 concentrations of fe and mn generally increased during ps incubation which showed different trends from ds incubation figs 6c and s5 dissolved fe concentrations first increased and then decreased in ps batches while they gently increased in ds batches in addition fe ii concentrations were similar to total dissolved fe generally more mn was released from ds batches than ps batches 166 μg l vs 48 μg l at the end of experiments in abiotic batches both dissolved fe and mn kept relatively constant which were around 280 μg l and 65 μg l from ds batches and 340 μg l and 13 μg l from ps batches respectively solution ph kept relatively stable during incubation which was between 7 5 and 7 9 in ds batches median 7 6 and between 8 2 and 8 5 in ps batches median 8 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of wetland water on groundwater dom infiltration of surface water wetland water introduced organic matter into shallow groundwater from the pw site which had relatively higher contents of bioavailable om the wetland water generally had higher bix protein humic ratio microb terr ratio and lower hix in comparison with groundwater figs 4 and 5 the higher bix and lower hix values indicate that the wetland water had more autochthonous components such as algae and bacteria huguet et al 2009 although fi values indicate the mixed contribution from microbially derived and terrestrially derived dom components the eems of wetland water samples with a peak in the protein like fluorescence near excitation emission of 258 334 nm also supported the microbial dom source kulkarni et al 2017 in addition relatively higher protein humic and microb terr ratios provided the further evidence of the microbial dom source the combined spectroscopic properties jointly showed higher contributions of protein like components and microbially derived components in the wetland water which was believed to be more bioreactive huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 other studies also observed labile bioreactive dom in surface water mladenov et al 2010 and pond water neumann et al 2010 in high as groundwater affected areas in bangladesh isotopic characteristics showed influence of the wetland water on porewater and shallow groundwater in pw site fig 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of porewater nearest the wetland were similar to those of the wetland water indicating the recharge of wetland water into porewater although more depleted d and 18o were observed in other porewater and groundwater samples in pw site they were the result of mixing of wetland water groundwater and precipitation the recharge of wetland water into pw shallow groundwater was also supported by the higher levels of the wetland water than the shallow groundwater levels fig s6 the recharge from the wetland water not only inherited isotopic signature but also carried the bioreactive organic matter into the shallow groundwater of the pw site neumann et al 2010 found that recharge of pond water took the labile organic matter into shallow aquifers which increased concentrations of biologically degradable organic carbon in porewater beneath ponds downward migration of young organic matter was also expected to occur in shallow as affected groundwater in bangladesh harvey et al 2002 mailloux et al 2013 and cambodia lawson et al 2016 richards et al 2018 in west bengal where groundwater was extensively pumped pond derived organic matter was transported into shallow groundwater vertically farooq et al 2012 lawson et al 2013 majumder et al 2016 4 2 association of dom with weom linkage between weom and groundwater dom was evidenced in the study area although spectroscopic properties of weom were different from seom similar spectroscopic indices were observed between weom and groundwater dom in both pw and dw sites fig 4 weom and groundwater dom had relatively higher bix and fi values in relative to seom fi values in both weom and groundwater dom were around 1 6 showing the mixed contribution from microbially derived and terrestrially derived dom components cory mcknight 2005 the higher bix values of weom and groundwater dom also supported more autochthonous components huguet et al 2009 spectroscopic fingerprint traced groundwater dom to weom pool in sediments indicating the source of groundwater dom from sediments in both pw and dw sites previous studies in high as groundwater affected areas also indicate that groundwater dom was sourced from aquifer sediments sengupta et al 2008 concluded that components of high as groundwater were not introduced from pondwater implying that groundwater dom was geogenically sourced from aquifer sediments in west bengal ghosh et al 2015 showed that som was potentially available to indigenous heterotrophic microbes in grey sand aquifers from bengal delta plain mcarthur et al 2004 observed that som in peat contributed to labile dom in high as groundwater in vietnam postma et al 2012 indicated that labile dom contributing to as mobilization originated from young sediments soluble om was believed to seep from sediment layers into the adjacent aquifer in van phuc vietnam eiche et al 2017 it is also consistent with results of laboratory incubations showing that som added substantially to labile pool of groundwater dom neumann et al 2014 although the possibility that large sized om may not pass through the sediment matrix into groundwater cannot be ruled out the relatively lower protein humic and microb terr ratios of groundwater dom than weom in both pw and dw sites fig 5 indicate that protein like components and microbially derived dom components would be predominantly degraded during dispersion of weom from sediments into groundwater this was evidenced by results of our incubation experiments 4 3 roles of labile organic matter in as mobilization in relative to dw site weom and groundwater dom from pw site having relatively higher bix higher protein humic and microb terr ratios figs 4 and 5 showed higher bioreactivity which corresponded to higher as concentrations in both porewater and groundwater it indicates that dissolved as concentrations were dependent on bioreactivity of organic matter in both aqueous phase and water extractable pool in sediments due to the limited volume of porewater no porewater samples were measured for spectroscopic properties herein comparison between porewater as and spectroscopic indices of weom at matched depths was made for both pw and dw sites porewater as concentrations were positively correlated with microb terr ratios and protein humic ratios of sediment weom with correlation coefficients of 0 86 and 0 81 respectively p 0 01 fig 8 the labile organic matter with high microb terr and protein humic ratios drove reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides neidhardt et al 2014 and subsequently mobilized the adsorbed as stuckey et al 2015 the weak correlation between porewater as concentrations and fe concentrations would result from siderite precipitation in porewater being oversaturated with respect to siderite phreeqc calculation showed that the median of sisiderite was 0 66 in the studied porewater with the range between 1 6 and 1 7 due to the limited adsorption of as on siderite under anoxic conditions guo et al 2013b more as was released from fe iii oxide reduction than that scavenged by siderite precipitation which led to high as concentrations guo et al 2013a roles of sediment derived labile organic matter in as mobilization was also evidenced by incubation experiments anaerobic incubations of the ps sediment with higher bix higher microb terr and protein humic ratios in weom released more as which is consistent with more consumption of protein like components and or microbially derived dom components by indigenous bacteria fig 6 due to their high bioreactivity kulkarni et al 2017 huang et al 2015 previous studies showed that those indigenous bacteria included fe iii oxide reducers li et al 2017b 2014 variations in doc concentrations during incubation also illustrated that more organic matter was degraded in ps batches from 12 0 to 1 5 mg l than ds batches from 15 0 to 6 6 mg l biodegradation of protein like components and microbially derived components led to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and therefore as mobilization in ps batches higher as concentrations were associated with higher dissolved fe concentrations fig 6a and c although dissolved fe ii concentrations decreased after 300 h incubation in ps batches it may result from siderite precipitation sisiderite 0 4 as discussed above siderite precipitation cannot decrease concentrations of as released from reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides after biodegradation relative contents of bioreactive organic matter c4 component decreased fig 6b this is consistent with the observation that the bioreactivity of som decreased after buried and degraded postma et al 2012 katsev and crowe 2015 this decrease in organic matter bioreactivity would decrease kinetics of fe oxide reduction and slow down groundwater as enrichment postma et al 2016 therefore bioreactive organic matter as carbon source and electron donor played an important role in as mobilization via reductive dissolution of fe oxides although we cannot rule out complexation and electron shuttling of humic like organic matter in increasing as mobility from aquifer sediments mladenov et al 2010 2015 kulkarni et al 2017 in addition to weom from sediments the wetland water with relatively higher bioreactivity recharging shallow groundwater in the pw site due to the higher levels of the wetland water than groundwater levels fig s6 was another possible cause of higher bix higher microb terr and protein humic ratios of groundwater dom in pw than those of groundwater dom in dw as discussed in the section 4 1 the heavier o and h isotopes of porewater and groundwater in the pw site also supported the recharge of the wetland water into shallow aquifer it indicates that recharge of more bioreactive om from the wetland water would lead to relatively higher contributions of protein like components and microbially derived dom components to shallow groundwater and therefore fuel as mobility stuckey et al 2015 4 4 environmental implications our investigation demonstrates that bioreactive organic matter was originated from both surface water wetland water and sedimentary matrix near the wetland which fueled microbial reactions and led to as mobilization surface water generally contained relatively higher contents of bioavailable organic matter huang et al 2015 mladenov et al 2010 2015 the downward migration of this component increased the bioreactivity of organic matter in the aquifers to the indigenous microbial community farooq et al 2010 this downward migration was accelerated by groundwater pumping lawson et al 2013 burgess et al 2010 due to the increase in the hydraulic gradients between surface water and groundwater the hydraulic gradients increased from 0 5 to 1 from april to august due to summer irrigation near the pw site zhang et al 2018 this was one of the reasons that high as groundwater occurred near the wetland in the distal alluvial fans of the hetao basin where many wells were used for agricultural irrigation guo et al 2016b in addition weom in pw sediments had high bioreactivity to microbial metabolism although we had no dating data the sediments near natural wetlands were possibly relatively young due to the higher sedimentation rates li 2006 bioreactive weom can be released into groundwater by any physical and chemical disturbances neumann et al 2014 demonstrated that perturbations to the aquifer sediments can mobilize labile som to indigenous bacteria including variations of groundwater flow patterns by extracting groundwater van geen et al 2013 and alternations of chemical conditions mikutta et al 2006 as long as bioreactive organic matter was introduced into groundwater either from surface water or from sediment matrix the organic matter especially protein like components and microbially derived components was preferentially utilized by microbial respiration this is consistent with radiocarbon data from other high as groundwater systems in cambodia bangladesh and west bengal mailloux et al 2013 lawson et al 2013 2016 showing a mixture of surface derived om and som in high as groundwater relatively lower bioreactivity of organic matter was observed in areas with no wetlands which was associated with the absence of surface water and lower contents of labile som figs 4 and 5 although incubation of ds sediment released as into solutions which again indicated that perturbations exposed labile organic matter to indigenous microbial community neumann et al 2014 groundwater as were relatively low in the dw site these low as concentrations were not only related to low contents of labile som but also due to the limited mobilization of stabilized som 5 conclusion high as concentrations were usually observed in shallow groundwater and porewater near the permanent wetland pw while dissolved as concentrations were normally low near the dried wetland dw contents of sedimentary fe and mn in pw were identical to those in dw although slightly higher contents of soc were observed than those from dw generally eom including weom and seom had relatively higher bix and lower hix values in pw sediment extracts in relative to dw sediment extracts indicating that pw sediments had more bioavailable organic matter this observation is also supported by results of parafac model showing that pw sediment extracts had higher protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios similar water stable isotopes between wetland water and shallow groundwater and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater indicated the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater being recharged from wetland water pw groundwater showed higher bix values protein humic ratios and microbial terrestrial ratios than dw groundwater indicating higher bioreactivity of dom in pw groundwater therefore higher bioreactivity of organic matter mainly protein like and microbial components in both groundwater and water extractable pool in sediments resulted in higher dissolved as concentrations incubation experiments showing that more as was released from the pw sediment along with the greater decrease in relative contents of protein like component c4 in relative to the dw sediment also proved that the bioreactive organic matter as carbon source and electron donor played an important role in as mobilization via reductive dissolution of fe oxides accordingly both the downward migration of bioreactive surface dom and destabilization of biodegradable som would enhance as mobility in shallow aquifer sediments dependence of groundwater as distribution on bioreactivity of organic matter is important to develop processes based models for accurately predicting spatiotemporal variations of groundwater as at a local scale conflict of interest the authors

editor eastern arabian peninsula represents the main natural groundwater discharge area of the arabian platform fossil aquifer system in such settings connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood herein we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the qatar peninsula using landsat sentinel 2 and alos palsar scenes correlated with field gpr and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics our results suggest that ene wsw oriented fold related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit i e umm er radhuma and rus in southern qatar peninsula on the other hand downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the dammam aquifer take place in northern qatar peninsula the deep brackish and gaseous rich waters ascending along faults in south qatar peninsula in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers future large scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities keywords fractured carbonate aquifer eastern arabian peninsula groundwater mounding geological structures arid environments 1 introduction karsts aquifers are complex systems with high heterogeneity in their hydrogeological characteristics including void sizes patterns of connections flow rates and degree of structural control bakalowicz 2005 the quick development of integrated karst systems generally less than 50 ka and their high sensitivity to climate variability and environmental changes add more complexity to assessing the dynamics of karst aquifers e g atkinson et al 1978 dreybrodt and eisenlohr 2000 understanding the karst conduit systems in arid and hyper arid regions is even more complex with scarce modern precipitations and consequent limitation of the use of natural hydrogeochemical and fluorescent artificial tracers goldscheider et al 2008 tracers are essential for karst aquifer characterization where classical methods such as bore hole pumping test and distributed models are inappropriate in such complex systems bakalowicz 2005 with substantial low modern annual precipitation 100 mm yr and limited groundwater data carbonate aquifers in the arabian peninsula represent one of the least understood karst aquifer systems therefore assessing the hydrogeological framework and the role of geological structures where fracture pattern predetermines the karst network grillot and drogue 1977 razack 1980 is a cornerstone in deciphering the complexity of karst aquifers in hyper arid regions furthermore the integration of remote sensing data and gis techniques supports regional and comprehensive investigations of the spatial distribution and physical controls on the karst features orndorff et al 2000 weary and orndorff 2001 orndorff et al 2018 therefore future earth orbital missions such as the orbiting arid subsurface and ice sheet sounder oasis provide a unique opportunity to perform a large scale and time coherent geophysical propping delineate the spatial distribution of fossil aquifers and assess their dynamics in hyper arid environments heggy et al 2013 oasis mission aims to probe shallow aquifers 100 m deep assessing aquifers connections structural control on the groundwater flow using a 45 mhz center frequency radar sounder with 10 mhz bandwidth heggy et al 2013 freeman et al 2017 a pre requisite of the mission is to select the candidate sites for low frequency gpr surveys where mission science objectives and measurement requirements could be validated hence understanding the framework of groundwater systems and dynamics in the arabian peninsula which is one of the most promising areas for conducting the oasis measurements is essential to maximize the ongoing mission formulation studies particularly to comprehend the vertical groundwater movements geographically the arabian peninsula occupies 3 2 million km2 in western asia and is bounded by the red sea the arabian sea and the arabian gulf from the west the south and the east respectively and is connected to the levant through jordan in the north fig 1 hyper arid climatic conditions prevail in the arabian peninsula with an average annual precipitation of less than 100 mm yr except for some localized regions along the elevated red sea hills where average annual precipitation reaches up to 777 mm yr fig 1 nevertheless isotopic composition of groundwater samples hötzl and zötl 1978 clark et al 1987 sultan et al 2008 proxies from thick and widely

this climate variability over the arabian peninsula together with the fluctuation of the sea level are expected to contribute to the development of complex karst systems with superposed structures especially in the discharge zone areas such as the qatar peninsula where the effects of the changes of karstification base level are considerably increased bakalowicz 2005 during the quaternary wet climatic periods the fossil aquifers in the arabian peninsula as well as in the african sahara were recharged hötzl and zötl 1978 sultan et al 2007 abotalib et al 2016 examples of the major fossil aquifers in arabia include the upper mega aquifer system uma in saudi arabia qatar kuwait bahrain and united arab emirates siebert et al 2016 the rub al khali aquifer system in southern saudi arabia yemen oman and united arab emirates sultan et al 2008 and the saq aquifer in saudi arabia and jordan sharaf and hussein 1996 othman et al 2018 the uma is one the largest aquifers in arid environments covering an area of about 1 8 106 km2 the uma receives recharge in central arabia and extends across eastern arabian peninsula to the coast of the arabian gulf where discharge takes place fig 1 fao 1979 divided the uma in eastern arabian peninsula into lower middle and upper systems with mainly sandstones in the lower part transitioning upward to carbonates the lower system includes the cretaceous wasia biyadh and aruma aquifers the middle system consists of the umm er radhuma and rus aquifers and the upper system is composed of those aquifers overlying the rus formation the middle system of umm er radhuma and rus represents the most important aquifer in the uma because of the high hydraulic parameters e g transmissivity is up to 6 4 10 1 m2 s in saudi arabia 9 8 10 2 m2 s in the qatar peninsula and 4 6 10 1 m2 s in bahrain and storativity attains 1 4 10 2 in saudi arabia 8 6 10 1 in the qatar peninsula and 2 0 10 1 in bahrain un escwa and bgr 2013 generally low depth to water 25 m saturated thickness of more than 500 m and good water quality mostly 1 g l bakiewicz et al 1982 alsharhan et al 2001 un escwa and bgr 2013 aquifer parameters water origin and first order estimates of the water reserves in umm er radhuma and rus aquifer is relatively well known however little consideration has been given to the role of geological structures such as faults folds and joints in controlling groundwater flow connecting deep and shallow aquifers complicating karst networks and modifying the landscape this structural control is more prominent in the discharge zones where water table is closer to the surface and near the coast of the arabian gulf where intensive tectonic deformations particularly salt tectonics murris 1984 perotti et al 2011 and rejuvenation of pre neogene faults and flexures al awadi et al 1998 al sulaimi and mukhopadhyay 2000 are reported the structural control on the groundwater flow is expressed on the surface by the distribution of continental sabkhas and offshore springs especially over the domal and anticlinal structures where karst features faults and joint systems are abundant un escwa and bgr 2013 othman et al 2018 the dammam formation which dominates the surface geology of eastern arabian peninsula shows intensive karstification especially in the qatar peninsula and the dammam dome area tleel 1973 embabi and ali 1990 sadiq and nasir 2002 these karst landforms are interpreted as slumping features that were formed by dissolution of the basal support of the evaporitic rus formation followed by collapse of the overlying dammam carbonates tleel 1973 orndorff et al 2018 yet a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of formation of these karst features how groundwater dynamics acted in their formation and the role of geologic structures in controlling groundwater flow in the discharge zone of eastern arabian peninsula is still needed to address this deficiency we adopt an integrated approach that utilizes readily available geological and hydrological datasets of eastern arabian peninsula aquifer systems with emphasis on the qatar peninsula together with isotopic data gpr field surveys and optical and radar remote sensing datasets to investigate the role of geological structures in connecting aquifer units and modifying the landscape of the qatar peninsula finally we assess the potential of using the qatar peninsula as a candidate site for future airborne and orbital large scale geophysical sounding measurements 2 geological and hydrogeological settings of the qatar peninsula the surface of the qatar peninsula is dominated by the middle eocene dammam formation fig 2 which is mainly composed of the shaly midra member at the bottom transitioning to limestone and dolomitic limestone towards the top al saad 2005 the dammam formation is underlain by the rus formation which consists of limestones and evaporites outcropping near the southern borders and in the center of the peninsula al hajari 1990 the dammam formation is overlain by the early miocene argillaceous limestones of the dam formation which occurs in association with the overlying fluvial sandstones of the late miocene pleistocene hofuf formation with the two units cropping out at the south of the qatar peninsula along faulted paleochannels al saad et al 2002 underlying the rus formation are the umm er radhuma and aruma formation which belong to the paleocene and upper cretaceous respectively al hajari 1990 the sedimentary cover of the qatar peninsula is highly affected by the regional gentle anticline of the qatar south fars arch and the salt diaperism of the proterozoic hormuz formation and associated faulting fig 2 perotti et al 2011 karst geomorphology and sinkholes dominate qatar s surface leading to the formation of natural depressions that range in size from few meters to few kilometers in diameter these karst features are concentrated along the exposures of the carbonates and evaporites in the qatar peninsula baalousha 2016 and preferentially along ne sw and nw se orientations following the main directions of the joint and fracture systems sadiq and nasir 2002 hydrogeologically the qatar peninsula is composed of three major aquifers fig 3 a the main aquifer unit b the freshwater lens system and c the deep aruma aquifer system al hajari 1990 shamrukh et al 2012 the main aquifer unit fig 3 comprises the rus and umm er radhuma formations al hajari 1990 un escwa and bgr 2013 in addition to the dammam formation herein referred to as the upper aquifer unit the upper aquifer unit has limited water reserves as a continuous water bearing horizon al hajari 1990 in comparison to the main aquifer unit rus and umm er radhuma formations are hydrogeologically connected to varying degrees and are partially separated from the overlying upper aquifer unit by the middle aquitard unit fig 3 the main aquifer unit receives recharge from the central arabian peninsula and then underflows to the east to discharge in the arabian gulf fig 1 with a general flow from southwest to northeast sharaf 2001 this aquifer system represents the main part of the uma with high hydraulic parameters in the qatar peninsula including high transmissivity 2 3 10 5 to 9 8 10 2 m2 s high storativity 2 0 10 9 to 8 6 10 1 significant reserves 2 5 109 m3 and low salinity 1000 mg l un escwa and bgr 2013 the freshwater lens system fig 3 occupies the northern portion of the qatar peninsula and occurs as discontinuous lenses of freshwater within the dammam formation this system receives recharge from flash rain events and associated runoff lloyd et al 1987 recently drilled deep wells in south qatar shamrukh et al 2012 indicate the deep aruma aquifer system fig 3 occurs at depths of more than 450 m below the ground surface and contains brackish waters up to 6000 ppm and high h2s concentrations up to 5 mg l shamrukh et al 2012 the deep aquifer system is isolated from the overlying main aquifer unit by the aruma aquitard units of marl and shale fig 3 the aquifer has relatively low hydraulic parameters compare to the main aquifer system with transmissivity ranges from 4 6 10 5 to 6 9 10 5 m2 s and storativity of approximately around 5 0 10 5 however the groundwater flow resembles that of the overlying main aquifer system i e southwest to northeast towards the arabian gulf shamrukh et al 2012 though numerous publications throughout the last 40 years have investigated the hydrologic settings and aquifer characterizations of the qatar peninsula yet the role of the geological structures in connecting the aquifer units and consequently their effects on the water quality and development of collapse structures on the surface is still poorly constrained 3 data and methods we co register all collected data layers to a unified geographic projection datum wgs 84 utm zone n39 in a gis environment first we examine and compile stratigraphic profiles potentiometric head maps and geological maps of the arabian peninsula and qatar from previously published data lloyd et al 1987 al hajari 1990 alsharhan et al 2001 shamrukh et al 2012 and we regenerate geocoded geographically corrected and updated versions of these maps using arcgis subsequently these maps are used to produce a potentiometric head difference map with updated hydrologic profiles and to conduct further detailed spatial analysis and mapping second remote sensing datasets are used including 1 a false color composite blue band 2 green band 4 and red

imagery viewable on google earth e g ikonos geoeye 1 and quickbird to validate the satellite and field based mapping of faults third the location of the faults is validated and the exact position of the fault plane is refined using gpr field surveys we performed surveys crossing orthogonally the approximate location of the fault as deduced from the remote sensing and field data in particular the subsurface is probed using two wide band frequencies antennas centered at 150 mhz and 500 mhz to optimize both subsurface penetration and horizontal and vertical resolutions the profiles are acquired in continuous time mode with the soundings range being set to 115 ns 7 m at v 0 122 m ns which corresponds to εr 6 to explore the structural discontinuity of the first 10 m with a sampling rate of 512 samples trace to allow the optimal vertical resolution we process the data by removing the dewow noises and then filtering the radar signal using a narrow band pass butterworth filter centered around the antenna s central frequency to remove the effects of the strong vhf background noise produced by the nearby military base 25 km distance the antenna s ringing noise is removed by average trace subtraction and we then finally correct for the antenna surface coupling effect the resulting profiles show the different shallow structural properties of the ground subsurface across the suggested fault zone detailed analysis of gpr performance and capability to assess structural features in karsts are detailed in mukherjee et al 2010 fourth we conduct spatial analysis of mapped faults and potentiometric head maps of different aquifer units to examine whether the mapped faults have significant control on the groundwater flow in the studied aquifers fifth we use isotopic data of the groundwater isotopes deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o in the qatar peninsula from yurtsever and payne 1979 and in eastern saudi arabia from sharaf 2001 in addition to the precipitation data from the nearest international atomic energy agency iaea isotope monitoring station in bahrain to validate the role of faults in connecting aquifer units the groundwater isotope data are compiled from previous publications see yurtsever and payne 1979 sharaf 2001 and reinterpretation of these data are provided the precipitation isotopic data are downloaded from the global isotope database on the iaea data portal https nucleus iaea org wiser finally a conceptual model is developed to explain the role of faults in controlling groundwater flow aquifers connection and their contribution to the landscape evolution in the qatar peninsula 4 results 4 1 groundwater hydraulics in order to assess the connection between the deep brackish aruma aquifer and the overlying main aquifer unit we need to estimate the net deep leakage which represents the difference between upward and downward leakage between the two aquifers the two aquifer units are hydrologically separated by the approximately 100 m thick aruma aquitard unit fig 3 hence the leakages between the two aquifers would be constrained to areas where the aquitard unit is absent or broken up through tectonic deformation deep leakage between the aruma aquifer and the main aquifer unit could be inferred using a hydraulic head difference map between these two units positive values will indicate that leakage is upward into the main aquifer unit upwards hydraulic gradient whereas a negative sign will suggest that leakage is downward into the aruma aquifer downwards hydraulic gradient nativ 1992 raiber et al 2009 potentiometric head data of the deep aruma aquifer of 2012 shamrukh et al 2012 and the overlying main aquifer unit of 1980 al hajari 1990 are implemented into a gis mapping environment where we spatially interpolate them to a common grid and we generate thematic maps of the interpolated head contours fig 4 the negative head values that are contained in the small localized area few kilometers along the western coast are minor anomalies and thus are not considered in our analysis finally the difference in the interpolated heads between the two aquifers is estimated fig 4c we decide to use in our calculations a relatively old head data of the main aquifer i e al hajari 1990 and we neglect more updated head data maps i e schlumberger 2009 to avoid the additional effect of the lowering down of the water table and the consequent disturbance in the potentiometric heads caused by the excessive groundwater withdrawal occurred in the last three decades during this period groundwater abstraction mainly from the main aquifer unit increased from 160 106 m3 in 1993 to 250 106 m3 in 2010 shamrukh et al 2012 we also hypothesize that the water level contours in the two aquifers are vertical to ease the calculation of the net deep leakage additionally the 2009 head data of the main aquifer unit are significantly affected by the injection of recycled water into the main aquifer unit which increased from 0 m3 yr in 2000 to 26 106 m3 yr in 2010 al muraikhi and shamrukh 2016 on the other hand the deep water levels low transmissivity high salinity and elevated h2s content of the aruma aquifer impede the usage of the aquifer water and hence no significant changes of the potentiometric heads of the aquifer between 1990 and 2012 are expected this approach aims to constrain the errors associated to the anthropogenic effects on the groundwater flow and perturbation of the heads hence allowing us to assess the solely effect of the natural controlling factors e g karst fractures etc the head differences between the two aquifers range from 5 to 55 m fig 4c the positive sign refers to a dominant upwards hydraulic gradient and leakage from the deep aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit if a passage exists through the confining aruma aquitard passages through the confining shaly aquitard most likely occur along structural features such as faults folds and domal structures thus detailed mapping of these structural features is essential for the assessment of groundwater dynamics in the qatar peninsula 4 2 mapping of geological structures in the qatar peninsula integration of multispectral polarimetric radar and high resolution remote sensing datasets together with field investigations and results from previous studies enable detailed mapping of both structural and geomorphological features in arid environments and their impacts on groundwater dynamics e g abotalib and mohamed 2013 zaki et al 2014 geological structures in the qatar peninsula are mainly related to the jurassic to miocene salt diapirism of the infracambrian salt of hormuz formation qgpc aqpc et al 1991 these structures include arches and anticlines e g qatar south fars arch and dokhan anticline and fold related faults especially along the crestal areas of these folds fig 2 spatial distribution patterns and kinematic evolution of the arches and anticlines in the qatar peninsula are well understood qgpc aqpc et al 1991 perotti et al 2011 however little consideration has been given to the fold related faults the faults are mapped using characteristics described in singhal and gupta 2010 which include 1 displacement of beds along linear planes 2 subparallel alignment of topography and 3 presence of scarps inspection of the sentinel 2 pca mosaic indicates the presence of a major ene wsw dextral strike slip fault that laterally displaced the miocene pliocene rocks of the dam and the overlying hofuf formations fig 5 along the al wakra road in south central qatar for about 3 km traces of lineaments with approximately the same ene wsw fault are also noted north and south of the main fault fig 5 the ene wsw trend represents one of the two regional tension fracture systems formed during the uplift of qatar arch el kassas and ashour 1990 mechanism of formation of the dextral fault is still not clear however conjugate sets of hinge oblique faults that are associated with fold limbs are commonly reported moustafa 2013 it is worth mentioning that the late pliocene tectonic movement that caused the formation of the salwa syncline and the dokhan anticline also affected the miocene pliocene deposits of the dam and hofuf formations al saad et al 2002 therefore the two stratigraphic units are commonly mapped along the hinge of a synclines or an anticline to the west of qatar arch fig 2 despite of having the same linear pattern and attaining higher altitudes occurrences of the dam and hofuf formations along the eastern side of the qatar arch are not associated with folding in the literature fig 6 shows and example of a resulting radargram acquired orthogonally across the mapped fault location in particular we observe a 6 m wide and 7 m deep oblique fractured area located at the intersection between the orthogonal single directions of the gpr profile and the mapped fault these fractures represent the ene wsw fault plane and damage zones furthermore the areas on the left and right sides of the fracture appear unperturbed both the 150 and 500 mhz radargrams for the profiles acquired in the unperturbed area show limited numbers of small fractures i e cracks associated to the dolomitic limestone erosion in the first few meters for the 150 mhz radargrams the low frequency is less sensitive to scattering and present a better penetration capability hence the low frequency profile shows the shape of the large fracture and their vertical continuity and inclination through the subsurface as seen in fig 6 on the contrary the high frequency and the wide band associated with the 500 mhz profiles improve our capacity to distinguish the major and relatively deep tectonic fractures i e up to 7 m these larger discontinuities are also associated with the occurrence of fragmented rocks in the subsurface that generate hyperbolic reflection around and within the fracture locations as shown in fig 6 inside the highlighted area in the unperturbed area we observe that the mapped fractures are less dense in their spatial occurrence and smaller in size and depth than those observed in the faulted area analysis of the dual polarimetric palsar scenes also indicate the presence of parallel sub parallel elongated belts that appear as dark zones on the dual polarimetric radar images fig 7 on the field these dark zones appear as aligned residual hills with scarps up to 8 m and or as elongated ridges up to 2 m higher than the surroundings that extend for several kilometers fig 7 we interpret these dark zones as faults however more detailed investigations are needed to identify their kinematics and mechanism of formation finally a geocoded map of the groundwater table in the main aquifer unit for the entire qatar peninsula is produced to be correlated with the mapped faults fig 8 4 3 spatial correlation between groundwater heads and faults location recharge of the main aquifer unit umm er radhuma and rus aquifers in the qatar peninsula is believed to largely take place in the central arabian peninsula during the pluvial periods throughout the quaternary this is supported by the old groundwater ages 20 ka in eastern saudi arabia wagner and geyh 1999 the depleted deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 isotopes shampine et al 1979 in addition to the low precipitation less than 100 mm yr over the aquifer outcrops fig 1 and the consequent limited recharge less than 0 5 mm yr engelhardt et al 2013 under the present day arid conditions however bonded runoff within collapse depressions in the qatar peninsula is suggested to contribute to the recharge of the main aquifer unit al hajari 1990 given the remote and local limited recharge of the aquifer and the absence of excessive abstraction of groundwater prior to 1980 we would expect that the potentiometric head data in the main aquifer unit are homogeneous and undisturbed with a smooth hydraulic gradient towards the ultimate discharge in the arabian gulf however inspection of the potentiometric surface map fig 8 indicates that this is not the case alternatively there are two recharge mounds in the water table associated with steeper hydraulic gradient than the surroundings the first mound m1 occurs in central south qatar and occupies an area of about 1000 km2 the water table abruptly increases from 3 m to 10 m amsl at the center of the mound and creates a local groundwater divide within the aquifer the second groundwater mound m2 occurs to the north of m1 and occupies a larger area 1750 km2 but attains only an elevation of 7 m amsl along its central axis superimposing the mapped faults and folds over the potentiometric head data fig 8 shows that the two mounds are located along the axis of qatar arch where faults and fractures intensity typically increases thus these structural features would facilitate either upward or downward recharge to the main aquifer unit as shown in fig 8 mound m1 is spatially correlated with our newly mapped ene wsw dextral fault system in central south qatar whereas mound m2 has little correlation with our mapped faults along the northwestern coast occurrence of mound m2 at northern qatar peninsula particularly underlying the freshwater lenses in the dammam aquifer lloyd et al 1987 fig 3a suggests a downward recharge from the freshwater lenses to the main aquifer unit yet this explanation is not applicable for m1 where recent meteoritic recharge is sparse analysis of the isotopic composition of the groundwater from north and south qatar peninsula from wells tapping the main aquifer unit yurtsever and payne 1979 and the comparison of these values with the isotopic composition of fossil groundwater in the eastern arabian peninsula sharaf 2001 and the modern precipitation could provide more constraints on the recharge sources hussien et al 2017 of the groundwater mounds in the qatar peninsula the long term monitoring system in the bahrain station which involves the isotopic composition oxygen and hydrogen and precipitation amounts for the rainfall events occurred between 1964 and 2013 enables the calculation of a weighted average value of the modern precipitation in the study area δd 7 4 δ18o 0 68 fig 9 isotopic composition of groundwater from north qatar peninsula is enriched δd 23 to 1 δ18o 3 7 to 1 2 compared to groundwater from south qatar peninsula δd 42 5 to 28 δ18o 5 2 to 2 6 fig 9 isotopic values of groundwater in north qatar are located along the global meteoric water line gmwl between the fossil groundwater from eastern saudi arabia and the weighted average of modern precipitation from bahrain station additionally tritium values of groundwater from north qatar show high values up to 20 tu in the approximate location of the groundwater mound m2 and gradual decrease away from the center of the mound to reach 1 tu in central qatar alsharhan et al 2001 these observations support the hypothesis that groundwater mounding in north qatar peninsula m2 is mainly related to downward recharge from the overlying freshwater lens system on the other hand the depleted isotopic values of the groundwater samples in south qatar peninsula even when compared to the average of fossil groundwater from eastern saudi arabia δd 24 4 δ18o 3 73 fig 9 indicate that groundwater mounding in south qatar peninsula is most likely related to artesian upward leakage from the deep fossil waters in aruma aquifer the absence of depleted isotopic composition of groundwater from the main aquifer unit in north qatar peninsula m2 implies a limited artesian recharge from the deep aruma aquifer in the north increasing the thicknesses of the main aquifer unit and the depths to the aruma aquifer toward the north al hajari 1990 could affect the potentiality of artesian vertical flow from the deep aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit moreover the isotopic signature of ascending deep groundwater could be diluted by the modern rainfall recharge to the main aquifer unit in the north up to 10 6 106 m3 yr in 2015 al muraikhi and shamrukh 2016 thus detailed isotopic and hydrochemical analyses of the groundwater in the main aquifer unit in north qatar are necessary to better understand the aquifer recharge dynamics and the effect of groundwater processes on landscape evolution in north qatar peninsula 5 discussion and implications for the development of karst features the demonstrated upward leakage along the geological structures in south qatar peninsula that is associated to the mound m1 could considerably deteriorate the water quality of the main aquifer unit with the upwelling of significant amount of brackish h2s rich water up to 5 mg l shamrukh et al 2012 from the underlying aruma aquifer the ascending groundwater causes anomalous increase in the salinity of the main aquifer unit in areas characterized by dense faulting and groundwater mounding m1 in south qatar peninsula shamrukh et al 2012 for instance in saudi arabia recharge of the umm er radhuma aquifer mainly originates from the vertical upwelling of groundwater from the aruma aquifer and to a lesser extent from the downward leakage of the overlying dammam aquifer estimated to be 1208 106 m3 yr which is greater than the primary annual lateral recharge through the aquifer outcrops 1048 106 m3 yr alsharhan et al 2001 therefore major attention should be devoted to quantifying and better understanding the vertical recharge of the main aquifer unit and the effects of this recharge on groundwater quality in the qatar peninsula moreover the ascending groundwater along faults could potentially contribute to the evolution of the landscape and the development of collapse features particularly in carbonates for example during the quaternary the carbonate plateaus in the sahara have been heavily excavated by the ascending groundwater from the deep co2 rich groundwater of the nubian aquifer system nas into the overlying carbonate post nubian aquifer system pnas leading to the formation of widespread natural depressions and collapse structures abotalib et al 2016 despite of the rapid equilibration between the groundwater and the host carbonates and the consequent saturation of groundwater with respect to dissolved carbonates back et al 1979 the presence of high concentrations of h2s could still affect the calcite solubility and promote the carbonate dissolution assaad and jordan 1994 corbella and ayora 2003 the mixture of reduced groundwater rich in hydrogen sulfide e g aruma aquifer with a more oxidizing one e g the main aquifer unit leads to the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and the production of carbonic acid h 2 s a q 2 o 2 a q c a c o 3 c a s o 4 h 2 c o 3 when this reaction occurs in a carbonate host rock dissolution of carbonates takes place with the production of calcium hydrocarbonate c a c o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a h c o 3 2 the dissolution typically takes place along the vertical sub vertical faults that connect the two aquifer units and the intensity of dissolution would decrease away from the faulted zones if we consider the role of ascending h2s rich groundwater along salt diaperism related faults and folds in the qatar peninsula a conceptual model for the formation of the collapse features on the surface can be developed fig 10 in this model the artesian upward leakage of the deep aruma groundwater along vertical sub vertical faults would lead to the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites of the overlying umm er radhuma rus and dammam formations and the development of hypogenic caves with time the caves bottom will be subjected to partial collapse by downward acting gravitational forces resulting in intensive bending of the overlying stratigraphic units finally sagging subsidence occurs in the surface leading to the formation of multi scale collapse landforms with densely fractured margins this model explains the mechanism of formation of collapse structures in south qatar where ascending gaseous rich groundwater along vertical subvertical faults is demonstrated however collapse structures in north qatar could have been formed by different mechanisms including enhanced dissolution along faults by surface percolation of precipitation water or dissolution under wetter climatic periods where thick soil profiles were abundant regardless of the constrained geographic extension of the qatar peninsula this area represents a unique case study for groundwater dynamics aquifer connections structural control on groundwater flow and groundwater related landscape evolution in fossil fractured carbonate aquifers under arid conditions the complex hydrogeologic settings together with the shallow groundwater levels and the mostly un vegetated lands indicate that the qatar peninsula is among important candidate sites for conducting future large scale geophysical mapping in earth hyper arid environments such as the oasis mission 6 conclusions our integrated approach indicates that groundwater dynamics in arid areas such as the qatar peninsula can be heavily controlled by geological structures the qatar peninsula has diverse aquifer leakage mechanisms that make it an ideal site for investigating structural controls in fossil aquifers connections specifically we suggest that salt diaperism related structures folds and faults have significant control on the groundwater flow in the qatar peninsula artesian upward leakage from the deep h2s rich aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit is demonstrated in south qatar peninsula and is expressed in a southern recharge mound this groundwater upwelling in addition to deteriorating the groundwater quality plays a key role in the evolution of the landscape and the development of collapse features in the southern part of the qatar peninsula by enhancing the carbonate dissolution oppositely the northern part of the qatar peninsula shows a downward leakage from the fresh water lens to the main aquifer unit creating a northern recharge mound these important variabilities in vertical groundwater dynamics makes the qatar peninsula and ideal candidate site for future testing of large scale subsurface geophysical

editor eastern arabian peninsula represents the main natural groundwater discharge area of the arabian platform fossil aquifer system in such settings connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood herein we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the qatar peninsula using landsat sentinel 2 and alos palsar scenes correlated with field gpr and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics our results suggest that ene wsw oriented fold related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit i e umm er radhuma and rus in southern qatar peninsula on the other hand downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the dammam aquifer take place in northern qatar peninsula the deep brackish and gaseous rich waters ascending along faults in south qatar peninsula in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers future large scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities keywords fractured carbonate aquifer eastern arabian peninsula groundwater mounding geological structures arid environments 1 introduction karsts aquifers are complex systems with high heterogeneity in their hydrogeological characteristics including void sizes patterns of connections flow rates and degree of structural control bakalowicz 2005 the quick development of integrated karst systems generally less than 50 ka and their high sensitivity to climate variability and environmental changes add more complexity to assessing the dynamics of karst aquifers e g atkinson et al 1978 dreybrodt and eisenlohr 2000 understanding the karst conduit systems in arid and hyper arid regions is even more complex with scarce modern precipitations and consequent limitation of the use of natural hydrogeochemical and fluorescent artificial tracers goldscheider et al 2008 tracers are essential for karst aquifer characterization where classical methods such as bore hole pumping test and distributed models are inappropriate in such complex systems bakalowicz 2005 with substantial low modern annual precipitation 100 mm yr and limited groundwater data carbonate aquifers in the arabian peninsula represent one of the least understood karst aquifer systems therefore assessing the hydrogeological framework and the role of geological structures where fracture pattern predetermines the karst network grillot and drogue 1977 razack 1980 is a cornerstone in deciphering the complexity of karst aquifers in hyper arid regions furthermore the integration of remote sensing data and gis techniques supports regional and comprehensive investigations of the spatial distribution and physical controls on the karst features orndorff et al 2000 weary and orndorff 2001 orndorff et al 2018 therefore future earth orbital missions such as the orbiting arid subsurface and ice sheet sounder oasis provide a unique opportunity to perform a large scale and time coherent geophysical propping delineate the spatial distribution of fossil aquifers and assess their dynamics in hyper arid environments heggy et al 2013 oasis mission aims to probe shallow aquifers 100 m deep assessing aquifers connections structural control on the groundwater flow using a 45 mhz center frequency radar sounder with 10 mhz bandwidth heggy et al 2013 freeman et al 2017 a pre requisite of the mission is to select the candidate sites for low frequency gpr surveys where mission science objectives and measurement requirements could be validated hence understanding the framework of groundwater systems and dynamics in the arabian peninsula which is one of the most promising areas for conducting the oasis measurements is essential to maximize the ongoing mission formulation studies particularly to comprehend the vertical groundwater movements geographically the arabian peninsula occupies 3 2 million km2 in western asia and is bounded by the red sea the arabian sea and the arabian gulf from the west the south and the east respectively and is connected to the levant through jordan in the north fig

this climate variability over the arabian peninsula together with the fluctuation of the sea level are expected to contribute to the development of complex karst systems with superposed structures especially in the discharge zone areas such as the qatar peninsula where the effects of the changes of karstification base level are considerably increased bakalowicz 2005 during the quaternary wet climatic periods the fossil aquifers in the arabian peninsula as well as in the african sahara were recharged hötzl and zötl 1978 sultan et al 2007 abotalib et al 2016 examples of the major fossil

covering an area of about 1 8 106 km2 the uma receives recharge in central arabia and extends across eastern arabian peninsula to the coast of the arabian gulf where discharge takes place fig 1 fao 1979 divided the uma in eastern arabian peninsula into lower middle and upper systems with mainly sandstones in the lower part transitioning upward to carbonates the lower system includes the cretaceous wasia biyadh and aruma aquifers the middle system consists of the umm er radhuma and rus aquifers and the upper system is composed of those aquifers overlying the rus formation the middle

estimates of the water reserves in umm er radhuma and rus aquifer is relatively well known however little consideration has been given to the role of geological structures such as faults folds and joints in controlling groundwater flow connecting deep and shallow aquifers complicating karst networks and modifying the landscape this structural control is more prominent in the discharge zones where water table is closer to the surface and near the coast of the arabian gulf where intensive tectonic deformations particularly salt tectonics murris 1984 perotti et al 2011 and rejuvenation of pre neogene faults and flexures al awadi et al 1998 al sulaimi and mukhopadhyay 2000 are reported the structural control on the groundwater flow is expressed on the surface by the distribution of continental sabkhas and offshore springs especially over the domal and anticlinal structures where karst features faults and joint systems are abundant un escwa and bgr 2013 othman et al 2018 the dammam formation which dominates the surface geology of eastern arabian peninsula shows intensive karstification especially in the qatar peninsula and the dammam dome area tleel 1973 embabi and ali 1990 sadiq and nasir 2002 these karst landforms are interpreted as slumping features that were formed by dissolution of the basal support of the evaporitic rus formation followed by collapse of the overlying dammam carbonates tleel 1973 orndorff et al 2018 yet a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of formation of these karst features how groundwater dynamics acted in their formation and the role of geologic structures in controlling groundwater flow in the discharge zone of eastern arabian peninsula is still needed to address this deficiency we adopt an integrated approach that utilizes readily available geological and hydrological datasets of eastern arabian peninsula aquifer systems with emphasis on the qatar peninsula together with isotopic data gpr field surveys and optical and radar remote sensing datasets to investigate the role of geological structures in connecting aquifer units and modifying the landscape of the qatar peninsula finally we assess the potential of using the qatar peninsula as a candidate site for future airborne and orbital large scale geophysical sounding measurements 2 geological and hydrogeological settings of the qatar peninsula the surface of the qatar peninsula is dominated by the middle eocene dammam formation fig 2 which is mainly composed of the shaly midra member at the bottom transitioning to limestone and dolomitic limestone towards the top al saad 2005 the dammam formation is underlain by the rus formation which consists of limestones and evaporites outcropping near the southern borders and in the center of the peninsula al hajari 1990 the dammam formation is overlain by the early miocene argillaceous limestones of the dam formation which occurs in association with the overlying fluvial sandstones of the late miocene pleistocene hofuf formation with the two units cropping out at the south of the qatar peninsula along faulted paleochannels al saad et al 2002 underlying the rus formation are the umm er radhuma and aruma formation which belong to the paleocene and upper cretaceous respectively al hajari 1990 the sedimentary cover of the qatar peninsula is highly affected by the regional gentle anticline of the qatar south fars arch and the salt diaperism of the proterozoic hormuz formation and associated faulting fig 2 perotti et al 2011 karst geomorphology and sinkholes dominate qatar s surface leading to the formation of natural depressions that range in size from few meters to few kilometers in diameter these karst features are concentrated along the exposures of the carbonates and evaporites in the qatar peninsula baalousha 2016 and preferentially along ne sw and nw se orientations following the main directions of the joint and fracture systems sadiq and nasir 2002 hydrogeologically the qatar peninsula is composed of three major aquifers fig 3 a the main aquifer unit b the freshwater lens system and c the deep aruma aquifer system al hajari 1990

hydrogeologically connected to varying degrees and are partially separated from the overlying upper aquifer unit by the middle aquitard unit fig 3 the main aquifer unit receives recharge from the central arabian peninsula and then underflows to the east to discharge in the arabian gulf fig 1 with a general flow from southwest to northeast sharaf 2001 this aquifer system represents the main

northeast towards the arabian gulf shamrukh et al 2012 though numerous publications throughout the last 40 years have investigated the hydrologic settings and aquifer characterizations of the qatar peninsula yet the role of the geological structures in connecting the aquifer units and consequently their effects on the water quality and development of collapse structures on the surface is still poorly constrained 3 data and methods we co register all collected data layers to a unified geographic projection datum wgs 84 utm zone n39 in a gis environment first we examine and compile stratigraphic profiles potentiometric head maps and geological maps of the arabian peninsula and qatar from previously published data lloyd et al 1987 al hajari 1990 alsharhan et al 2001 shamrukh et al 2012 and we regenerate geocoded geographically corrected and updated versions of these maps using arcgis subsequently these maps are used to produce a potentiometric head difference map with updated hydrologic profiles and to conduct further detailed spatial analysis and mapping second remote sensing datasets are used including 1 a false color composite blue band 2 green band 4 and red

advanced land observation satellite alos palsar l band dual polarization hh and hv synthetic aperture radar sar data images are also used to uncover the structural and geomorphological features that

and nest together with envi 5 1 and arcgis are used to process the dual polarimetric hh and hv palsar data each individual image is imported to the polsarpro for the multi looking process using one time in range and five times in azimuth direction finally speckle noise is reduced by applying a 7 7 lee refined filter followed by conversions to the 2 2 covariance matrix 5 high resolution satellite imagery viewable on google earth e g ikonos geoeye 1 and quickbird to validate the satellite and field based mapping of faults third the location of the faults is validated and the exact position of the fault plane is refined using gpr field surveys we performed surveys crossing orthogonally the approximate location of the fault as deduced from the remote sensing and field data in particular the subsurface is probed using two wide band frequencies antennas centered at 150 mhz and 500 mhz to optimize both subsurface penetration and horizontal and vertical resolutions the profiles are acquired in continuous time mode with the soundings range being set to 115 ns 7 m at v 0 122 m ns which corresponds to εr 6 to explore the structural discontinuity of the first 10 m with a sampling rate of 512 samples trace to allow the optimal vertical resolution we process the data by removing the dewow noises and then filtering the radar signal using a narrow band pass butterworth filter centered around the antenna s central frequency to remove the effects of the strong vhf background noise produced by the nearby military base 25 km distance the antenna s ringing noise is removed by average trace subtraction and we then finally correct for the antenna surface coupling effect the resulting profiles show the different shallow structural properties of the ground subsurface across the suggested fault zone detailed analysis of gpr performance and capability to assess structural features in karsts are detailed in mukherjee et al 2010 fourth we conduct spatial analysis of mapped faults and potentiometric head maps of different aquifer units to examine whether the mapped faults have significant control on the groundwater flow in the studied aquifers fifth we use isotopic data of the groundwater isotopes deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o in the qatar peninsula from yurtsever and payne 1979 and in eastern saudi arabia from sharaf 2001 in addition to the precipitation data from the nearest international atomic energy agency iaea isotope monitoring station in bahrain to validate the role of faults in connecting aquifer units the groundwater isotope data are compiled from previous publications see yurtsever and payne 1979 sharaf 2001 and reinterpretation of these data are provided the precipitation isotopic data are downloaded from the global isotope database on the iaea data portal https nucleus iaea org wiser finally a conceptual model is developed to explain the role of faults in controlling groundwater flow aquifers connection and their contribution to the landscape evolution in the qatar peninsula 4 results 4 1 groundwater hydraulics in order to assess the connection between the deep brackish aruma aquifer and the overlying main aquifer unit we need to estimate the net deep leakage which represents the difference between upward and downward leakage between the two aquifers the two aquifer units are hydrologically separated by the approximately 100 m thick aruma aquitard unit fig 3 hence the leakages between the two aquifers would be constrained to areas where the aquitard unit is absent or broken up through tectonic deformation deep leakage between the aruma aquifer and the main aquifer unit could be inferred using a hydraulic head difference map between these two units positive values will indicate that leakage is upward into the main aquifer unit upwards hydraulic gradient whereas a negative sign will suggest that leakage is downward into the aruma aquifer downwards hydraulic gradient nativ 1992 raiber et al 2009 potentiometric head data of the deep aruma aquifer of 2012 shamrukh et al 2012 and the overlying main aquifer unit of 1980 al hajari 1990 are implemented into a gis mapping environment where we spatially interpolate them to a common grid and we generate thematic maps of the interpolated head contours fig 4 the negative head values that are contained in the small localized area few kilometers along the western coast are minor anomalies and thus are not considered in our analysis finally the difference in the interpolated heads between the two aquifers is estimated fig 4c we decide to use in our calculations a relatively old head data of the main aquifer i e al hajari 1990 and we neglect more updated head data maps i e schlumberger 2009 to avoid the additional effect of the lowering down of the water table and the consequent disturbance in the potentiometric heads caused by the excessive groundwater withdrawal occurred in the last three decades during this period groundwater abstraction mainly from the main aquifer unit increased from 160 106 m3 in 1993 to 250 106 m3 in 2010 shamrukh et al 2012 we also hypothesize that the water level contours in the two aquifers are vertical to ease the calculation of the net deep leakage additionally the 2009 head data of the main aquifer unit are significantly affected by the injection of recycled water into the main aquifer unit which increased from 0 m3 yr in 2000 to 26 106 m3 yr in 2010 al muraikhi and shamrukh 2016 on the other hand the deep water levels low transmissivity high salinity and elevated h2s content of the aruma aquifer impede the usage of the aquifer water and hence no significant changes of the potentiometric heads of the aquifer between 1990 and 2012 are expected this approach aims to constrain the errors associated to the anthropogenic effects on the groundwater flow and perturbation of the heads hence allowing us to assess the solely effect of the natural controlling factors e g karst fractures etc the head differences between the two aquifers range from 5 to 55 m fig 4c the positive sign refers to a dominant upwards hydraulic gradient and leakage from the deep aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit if a passage exists through the confining aruma aquitard passages through the confining shaly aquitard most likely occur along structural features such as faults folds and domal structures thus detailed mapping of these structural features is essential for the assessment of groundwater dynamics in the qatar peninsula 4 2 mapping of geological structures in the qatar peninsula integration of multispectral polarimetric radar and high resolution remote sensing datasets together with field investigations and results from previous studies enable detailed mapping of both structural and geomorphological features in arid environments and their impacts on groundwater dynamics e g abotalib and mohamed 2013 zaki et al 2014 geological structures in the qatar peninsula are mainly related to the jurassic to miocene salt diapirism of the infracambrian salt of hormuz formation qgpc aqpc et al 1991 these structures include arches and anticlines e g qatar south fars arch and dokhan anticline and fold related faults especially along the crestal areas of these folds fig 2 spatial distribution patterns and kinematic evolution of the arches and anticlines in the qatar peninsula are well understood qgpc aqpc et al 1991 perotti et al 2011 however little consideration has been given to the fold related faults the faults are mapped using characteristics described in singhal and gupta 2010 which include 1 displacement of beds along linear planes 2 subparallel alignment of topography and 3 presence of scarps inspection of the sentinel 2 pca mosaic indicates the presence of a major ene wsw dextral strike slip fault that laterally displaced the miocene pliocene rocks of the dam and the overlying hofuf formations fig 5 along the al wakra road in south central qatar for about 3 km traces of lineaments with approximately the same ene wsw fault are also noted north and south of the main fault fig 5 the ene wsw trend represents one of the two regional tension fracture systems formed during the uplift of qatar arch el kassas and ashour 1990 mechanism of formation of the dextral fault is still not clear however conjugate sets of hinge oblique faults that are associated with fold limbs are commonly reported moustafa 2013 it is worth mentioning that the late pliocene tectonic movement that caused the formation of the salwa syncline and the dokhan anticline also affected the miocene pliocene deposits of the dam and hofuf formations al saad et al 2002 therefore the two stratigraphic units are commonly mapped along the hinge of a synclines or an anticline to the west of qatar arch fig 2 despite of having the same linear pattern and attaining higher altitudes occurrences of the dam and hofuf formations along the eastern side of the qatar arch are not associated with folding in the literature fig 6 shows and example of a resulting radargram acquired orthogonally across the mapped fault location in particular we observe a 6 m wide and 7 m deep oblique fractured area located at the intersection between the orthogonal single directions of the gpr profile and the mapped fault these fractures represent the ene wsw fault plane and damage zones furthermore the areas on the left and right sides of the fracture appear unperturbed both the 150 and 500 mhz radargrams for the profiles acquired in the unperturbed area show limited numbers of small fractures i e cracks associated to the dolomitic limestone erosion in the first few meters for the 150 mhz radargrams the low frequency is less sensitive to scattering and present a better penetration capability hence the low frequency profile shows the shape of the large fracture and their vertical continuity and inclination through the subsurface as seen in fig 6 on the contrary the high frequency and the wide band associated with the 500 mhz profiles improve our capacity to distinguish the major and relatively deep tectonic fractures i e up to 7 m these larger discontinuities are also associated with the occurrence of fragmented rocks in the subsurface that generate hyperbolic reflection around and within the fracture locations as shown in fig 6 inside the highlighted area in the unperturbed area we observe that the mapped fractures are less dense in their spatial occurrence and smaller in size and depth than those observed in the faulted area analysis of the dual polarimetric palsar scenes also indicate the presence of parallel sub parallel elongated belts that appear as dark zones on the dual polarimetric radar images fig 7 on the field these dark zones appear as aligned residual hills with scarps up to 8 m and or as elongated ridges up to 2 m higher than the surroundings that extend for several kilometers fig 7 we interpret these dark zones as faults however more detailed investigations are needed to identify their kinematics and mechanism of formation finally a geocoded map of the groundwater table in the main aquifer unit for the entire qatar peninsula is produced to be correlated with the mapped faults fig 8 4 3 spatial correlation between groundwater heads and faults location recharge of the main aquifer unit umm er radhuma and rus aquifers in the qatar peninsula is believed to largely take place in the central arabian peninsula during the pluvial periods throughout the quaternary this is supported by the old groundwater ages 20 ka in eastern saudi arabia wagner and geyh 1999 the depleted deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 isotopes shampine et al 1979 in addition to the low precipitation less than 100 mm yr over the aquifer outcrops fig 1 and the consequent limited recharge less than 0 5 mm yr engelhardt et al 2013 under the present day arid conditions however bonded runoff within collapse depressions in the qatar peninsula is suggested to contribute to the recharge of the main aquifer unit al hajari 1990 given the remote and local limited recharge of the aquifer and the absence of excessive abstraction of groundwater prior to 1980 we would expect that the potentiometric head data in the main aquifer unit are homogeneous and undisturbed with a smooth hydraulic gradient towards the ultimate discharge in the arabian gulf however inspection of the potentiometric surface map fig 8 indicates that this is not the case alternatively there are two recharge mounds in the water table associated with steeper hydraulic gradient than the surroundings the first mound m1 occurs in central south qatar and occupies an area of about 1000 km2 the water table abruptly increases from 3 m to 10 m amsl at the center of the mound and creates a local groundwater divide within the aquifer the second groundwater mound m2 occurs to the north of m1 and occupies a larger area 1750 km2 but attains only an elevation of 7 m amsl along its central axis superimposing the mapped faults and folds over the potentiometric head data fig 8 shows that the two mounds are located along the axis of qatar arch where faults and fractures intensity typically increases thus these structural features would facilitate either upward or downward recharge to the main aquifer unit as shown in fig 8 mound m1 is spatially correlated with our newly mapped ene wsw dextral fault system in central south qatar whereas mound m2 has little correlation with our mapped faults along the northwestern coast occurrence of mound m2 at northern qatar peninsula particularly underlying the freshwater lenses in the dammam aquifer lloyd et al 1987 fig 3a suggests a downward recharge from the freshwater lenses to the main aquifer unit yet this explanation is not applicable for m1 where recent meteoritic recharge is sparse analysis of the isotopic composition of the groundwater from north and south qatar peninsula from wells tapping the main aquifer unit yurtsever and payne 1979 and the comparison of these values with the isotopic composition of fossil groundwater in the eastern arabian peninsula sharaf 2001 and the modern precipitation could provide more constraints on the recharge sources hussien et al 2017 of the groundwater mounds in the qatar peninsula the long term monitoring system in the bahrain station which involves the isotopic composition oxygen and hydrogen and precipitation amounts for the rainfall events occurred between 1964 and 2013 enables the calculation of a weighted average value of the modern precipitation in the study area δd 7 4 δ18o 0 68 fig 9 isotopic composition of groundwater from north qatar peninsula is enriched δd 23 to 1 δ18o 3 7 to 1 2 compared to groundwater from south qatar peninsula δd 42 5 to 28 δ18o 5 2 to 2 6 fig 9 isotopic values of groundwater in north qatar are located along the global meteoric water line gmwl between the fossil groundwater from eastern saudi arabia and the weighted average of modern precipitation from bahrain station additionally tritium values of groundwater from north qatar show high values up to 20 tu in the approximate location of the groundwater mound m2 and gradual decrease away from the center of the mound to reach 1 tu in central qatar alsharhan et al 2001 these observations support the hypothesis that groundwater mounding in north qatar peninsula m2 is mainly related to downward recharge from the overlying freshwater lens system on the other hand the depleted isotopic values of the groundwater samples in south qatar peninsula even when compared to the average of fossil groundwater from eastern saudi arabia δd 24 4 δ18o 3 73 fig 9 indicate that groundwater mounding in south qatar peninsula is most likely related to artesian upward leakage from the deep fossil waters in aruma aquifer the absence of depleted isotopic composition of groundwater from the main aquifer unit in north qatar peninsula m2 implies a limited artesian recharge from the deep aruma aquifer in the north increasing the thicknesses of the main aquifer unit and the depths to the aruma aquifer toward the north al hajari 1990 could affect the potentiality of artesian vertical flow from the deep aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit moreover the isotopic signature of ascending deep groundwater could be diluted by the modern rainfall recharge to the main aquifer unit in the north up to 10 6 106 m3 yr in 2015 al muraikhi and shamrukh 2016 thus detailed isotopic and hydrochemical analyses of the groundwater in the main aquifer unit in north qatar are necessary to better understand the aquifer recharge dynamics and the effect of groundwater processes on landscape evolution in north qatar peninsula 5 discussion and implications for the development of karst features the demonstrated upward leakage along the geological structures in south qatar peninsula that is associated to the mound m1 could considerably deteriorate the water quality of the main aquifer unit with the upwelling of significant amount of brackish h2s rich water up to 5 mg l shamrukh et al 2012 from the underlying aruma aquifer the ascending groundwater causes anomalous increase in the salinity of the main aquifer unit in areas characterized by dense faulting and groundwater mounding m1 in south qatar peninsula shamrukh et al 2012 for instance in saudi arabia recharge of the umm er radhuma aquifer mainly originates from the vertical upwelling of groundwater from the aruma aquifer and to a lesser extent from the downward leakage of the overlying dammam aquifer estimated to be 1208 106 m3 yr which is greater than the primary annual lateral recharge through the aquifer outcrops 1048 106 m3 yr alsharhan et al 2001 therefore major attention should be devoted to quantifying and better understanding the vertical recharge of the main aquifer unit and the effects of this recharge on groundwater quality in the qatar peninsula moreover the ascending groundwater along faults could potentially contribute to the evolution of the landscape and the development of collapse features particularly in carbonates for example during the quaternary the carbonate plateaus in the sahara have been heavily excavated by the ascending groundwater from the deep co2 rich groundwater of the nubian aquifer system nas into the overlying carbonate post nubian aquifer system pnas leading to the formation of widespread natural depressions and collapse structures abotalib et al 2016 despite of the rapid equilibration between the groundwater and the host carbonates and the consequent saturation of groundwater with respect to dissolved carbonates back et al 1979 the presence of high concentrations of h2s could still affect the calcite solubility and promote the carbonate dissolution assaad and jordan 1994 corbella and ayora 2003 the mixture of reduced groundwater rich in hydrogen sulfide e g aruma aquifer with a more oxidizing one e g the main aquifer unit leads to the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and the production of carbonic acid h 2 s a q 2 o 2 a q c a c o 3 c a s o 4 h 2 c o 3 when this reaction occurs in a carbonate host rock dissolution of carbonates takes place with the production of calcium hydrocarbonate c a c o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a h c o 3 2 the dissolution typically takes place along the vertical sub vertical faults that connect the two aquifer units and the intensity of dissolution would decrease away from the faulted zones if we consider the role of ascending h2s rich groundwater along salt diaperism related faults and folds in the qatar peninsula a conceptual model for the formation of the collapse features on the surface can be developed fig 10 in this model the artesian upward leakage of the deep aruma groundwater along vertical sub vertical faults would lead to the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites of the overlying umm er radhuma rus and dammam formations and the development of hypogenic caves with time the caves bottom will be subjected to partial collapse by downward acting gravitational forces resulting in intensive bending of the overlying stratigraphic units finally sagging subsidence occurs in the surface leading to the formation of multi scale collapse landforms with densely fractured margins this model explains the mechanism of formation of collapse structures in south qatar where ascending gaseous rich groundwater along vertical subvertical faults is demonstrated however collapse structures in north qatar could have been formed by different mechanisms including enhanced dissolution along faults by surface percolation of precipitation water or dissolution under wetter climatic periods where thick soil profiles were abundant regardless of the constrained geographic extension of the qatar peninsula this area represents a unique case study for groundwater dynamics aquifer connections structural control on groundwater flow and groundwater related landscape evolution in fossil fractured carbonate aquifers under arid conditions the complex hydrogeologic settings together with the shallow groundwater levels and the mostly un vegetated lands indicate that the qatar peninsula is among important candidate sites for conducting future large scale geophysical mapping in earth hyper arid environments such as the oasis mission 6 conclusions our integrated approach indicates that groundwater dynamics in arid areas such as the qatar peninsula can be heavily controlled by geological structures the qatar peninsula has diverse aquifer leakage mechanisms that make it an ideal site for investigating structural controls in fossil aquifers connections specifically we suggest that salt diaperism related structures folds and faults have significant control on the groundwater flow in the qatar peninsula artesian upward leakage from the deep h2s rich aruma aquifer to the overlying main aquifer unit is demonstrated in south qatar peninsula and is expressed in a southern recharge mound this groundwater upwelling in addition to deteriorating the groundwater quality plays a key role in the evolution of the landscape and the development of collapse features in the southern part of the qatar peninsula by enhancing the carbonate dissolution oppositely the northern part of the qatar peninsula shows a downward leakage from the fresh water lens to the main aquifer unit creating a northern recharge mound these important variabilities in vertical groundwater dynamics makes the qatar peninsula and ideal candidate site for future testing of large scale subsurface geophysical
