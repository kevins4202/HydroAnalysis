1660,the effect of the pore water composition on the diffusive anion transport was studied for two different argillaceous low permeability sedimentary rocks opalinus clay opa and helvetic marl hm the samples were saturated with different solutions with varying molar concentration and different main cations in the solution nacl based pore solutions and cacl2 based pore solutions the total porosity was measured by through diffusion experiments with the neutral tracer hto experiments performed in nacl solutions resulted in a porosity of 0 12 for opa and 0 03 for hm and are consistent with results of the experiments in cacl2 solutions the total porosity was independent of the molar concentration in contrast to the measured anion porosity which increased with increasing molar concentration it could further be observed that the pore solution based on the bivalent cation calcium shielded the negative surface charge stronger than the monovalent cation sodium resulting in a larger measureable anion accessible porosity in the case of cacl2 solutions the data was modelled based on an adapted donnan approach of birgersson and karnland 2009 the model had to be adjusted with a permanent free uncharged porosity as well as with structural information on the permanent anion exclusion because of so called bottleneck pores both parameters can only be evaluated from experiments nevertheless taking these two adaptions into account the effect of varying pore water compositions on the anion accessible porosity of the investigated argillaceous rocks could be satisfactorily described keywords argillaceous rocks opalinus clay helvetic marl bottleneck pores cation ionic strength 1 introduction argillaceous rocks are foreseen as potential host rocks for radioactive waste repositories in several countries andra 2001 ondraf niras 2001 nagra 2002 nwmo 2015 the main reason for this option is the fact that argillaceous rocks have several advantageous properties such as a strong sorption capacity for radionuclides and a low hydraulic conductivity resulting in a strong retardation of radionuclide transport molecular diffusion is the major migration process for radionuclides released from the waste matrix into the host rock van loon and soler 2004 altmann et al 2012 for neutral and positively charged chemical species the whole pore space of an argillaceous rock is available for transport it is also well known that charged porous media such as argillaceous rocks exhibit strong anion exclusion effects descostes et al 2008 van loon and mibus 2015 wigger and van loon 2017 these effects strongly limit the anion diffusion through such material because only a part of the pore space is available for anion transport i e the anion porosity is lower than the total porosity muurinen 1994 smith et al 2004 leroy et al 2007 among the dose determining radionuclides anionic species such as 129i 36cl and 79seo3 2 are the most important ones because they barely sorb on rock minerals altmann 2008 grambow 2008 tournassat and appelo 2011 understanding the behavior of anions in argillaceous rocks is thus an important item for evaluating repository safety the accessible anion porosity is expected to be a function of the total concentration of dissolved cations and anions in the pore water and of the microstructure of the rock van loon et al 2007 tournassat and appelo 2011 chagneau et al 2015 wigger and van loon 2017 the electrical double layer edl can be used to describe anion exclusion at the molecular scale based on the gouy chapman theory the edl on charged solid surfaces in contact with an aqueous electrolyte solution containing small inorganic ions is known to consist of two kinds of layers the stern layer and the diffuse layer dl the stern layer occurs through the occupation of the charged surface sites by cations and is permanently inaccessible for anions appelo and wersin 2007 bourg and sposito 2011 tournassat and appelo 2011 chagneau et al 2015 the diffuse layer compensates the remaining charge that is not already compensated by the stern layer it contains an excess of cations and a lower concentration of anions the diffuse layer is thus sparsely accessible for anions the concentration of cations and anions in the dl can be related to their concentration in the free pore solution by the poisson boltzmann s equation appelo et al 2010 the extent of the dl depends on the molar concentration because the more cations in a pore solution the stronger is the shielding of the negative mineral surface charge and thus the diffuse layer is more compressed fig 1 additionally besides the amount of cations also the valence of the cation impacts the extent of the dl since the higher a cation is positively charged the better it compensates for the negative mineral surface charge if the extent of the dl is low the uncharged free pore water porosity is large and vice versa there exist several studies investigating the effect of the ionic strength on the anion accessible porosity in clay materials such as bentonite van loon et al 2007 tian et al 2013 single phase clay systems glaus et al 2010 and natural argillaceous rocks van loon et al 2003a van loon et al 2003b moors 2005 descostes et al 2008 appelo et al 2010 cavé et al 2010 wittebroodt et al 2012 van loon 2014 some of these studies show that with increasing ionic strength the anion accessible porosity increases as well in all studies the ionic strength was adapted by mainly nacl how the anion accessible porosity varies with the type of cation in the pore water is largely unknown therefore this study not only focuses on the effect of the molar concentration of main ions on the anion accessible porosity in argillaceous rocks it also investigates the impact of different main cations na vs ca2 in the pore solution on the anion diffusion behavior hence anion diffusion was investigated in two different argillaceous rocks opalinus clay and helvetic marl varying the molar concentration and the chemical composition of the pore water and studying their effect on the anion accessible porosity the results contribute to a better understanding of the migration of anionic radionuclides in argillaceous rocks and provide also better constraints of the geochemical porosity which is important to assure the adequate characterisation of the in situ pore water composition in clay formations 2 materials two natural argillaceous rocks were investigated in this study opalinus clay 172 176 ma and helvetic marl 38 42 ma the opalinus clay sample originates from below the molasse basin at a depth of 936 25 m in the deep borehole from schlattingen nagra 2002 wersin et al 2013 wersin et al 2016 while the helvetic marl sample was taken from a part of the helvetic nappe at a depth of 475 86 m in wellenberg nagra 1994 enachescu et al 1997 nagra 1997 nagra 2008 the opalinus clay sample was taken from a homogeneous clayey facies whereas the helvetic marl sample was a very hard grey sample mainly consisting of calcite and quartz the mineral compositions of the samples and important physical properties have been summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 sample preparation bore cores with a diameter of 0 1 m were sliced perpendicular to the core axis into 0 005 0 007 m thick pieces using a diamond saw without using a coolant the slices were embedded in an epoxy resin epofix struers gmbh after hardening of the resin the cylindrical sample was placed on a lathe and the resin at the planar ends was removed 3 2 pore water chemistry for equilibrating the samples with the respective pore solution the samples were mounted in a diffusion cell as described in detail in van loon and mibus 2015 the diffusion cell consists of two ertalyte plates which is an unreinforced polyester based on polyethylene terephthalate pet p the plates include a sintered titanium filter with a porosity of 0 1 a diameter of 0 065 m a thickness of 0 0012 m and a pore diameter of 1 10 5 m the argillaceous sample was confined between the two plates and was connected by a tubing inner diameter 0 001 m system with external pore water reservoirs a 24 channel peristaltic pump ipc ismatec idex united states circulated the pore solution through the tubing system toward the sample fig 2 in a first step each sample slice was sandwiched into a diffusion cell and connected with two belonging reservoirs filled with a pure nacl solution the same salt concentration was used on each side of the rock but varied for each sample 0 01 m 0 1 m 1 m 2 m 5 m then the circulation started to ensure a uniform and equilibrated nacl pore water concentration for an initial condition of the rock the equilibration process was monitored by analyzing the water every second week by ion chromatography ics5000 thermofischer as soon as a chemical steady state between the pore solution and argillaceous rock was reached the diffusion experiments could be started this equilibration process with the different pore waters lasted four months for both opa and hm samples it cannot be completely excluded that air was trapped in the sample however the samples used for the experiments were fresh samples wrapped in cellophane foil hence no drying effect was expected to happen before the experiment additionally the effect that water loss porosity was similar for each sample gives an indication that there was no air or at least a negligible amount of air trapped in the samples due to the fact that with air trapped inside the sample a lower water amount would be expected which would decrease the water loss porosity based on the data of wigger and van loon 2017 the interlayer water is so low i e opa 0 5 and hm 0 2 that any possible swelling or shrinking effects of smectites may be negligible 3 3 through diffusion experiments all through diffusion experiments were performed perpendicular to the bedding at a constant temperature of 25 1 c the neutral tracer tritiated water hto was used to measure the total transport porosity because it is assumed that neutral species can diffuse through all pore spaces 36cl was used for estimating the anion porosity the diffusion cells were connected to two different reservoirs one filled with 100 ml of the equilibrated pore solution spiked with the tracers hto and 36cl simultaneously 1000 bq ml hto 1000 bq ml 36cl connected to one side of the diffusion cell and the other one filled with 20 ml of the same equilibrated pore solution without any tracer connected to the opposite site of the diffusion cell to keep the tracer gradient high the low respectively non tracer concentration solution was replaced about every second day with a fresh one the accumulated activity in the replaced solutions was measured by liquid scintillation counting tricarb 2250 ca canberra packard details of the data processing are described in van loon et al 2003a from the total diffused activity the porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient were calculated as described in section 3 4 after the through diffusion experiments with the different nacl solutions were finished an out diffusion process of the tracer was initiated followed by a equilibration of the same samples with a cacl2 solution with the respective molar concentration values also in the case of cacl2 solutions the equilibration process was monitored every second week and equilibrium conditions between cacl2 solutions and the rock samples were reached after approximately four months the final chemical compositions of the different pore waters are listed in table 2 3 4 calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity is based on this analytical solution crank

transport porosity data of opalinus clay and helvetic marl measured by through diffusion experiments with varying pore water compositions all results presented in this study are listed with the specific error obtained by fitting the experiments and belong to the specific sample piece the variance respectively the heterogeneity between the different sample pieces is not included in these error values the transport porosity data obtained with nacl based pore solution experiments are already discussed in detail in wigger and van loon 2017 and are given here for comparison reasons the total transport porosity was estimated from through diffusion measurements with the neutral tracer hto the samples saturated with a nacl pore solution show a total average transport porosity of 0 12 for opalinus clay and 0 03 for hm it is interesting to see that the total transport porosity is consistent for the samples saturated with a cacl2 pore water opa 0 12 hm 0 03 as expected the total transport porosity is independent of the molar concentration of the solution owing to the fact that the neutral tracer is not affected by any electric potential note that the porosity calculated from the density is smaller than the porosity measured by hto diffusion wigger and van loon 2017 explained this observation with a swelling of the clay samples during the equilibration process additionally it should be mentioned that the total porosity at high nacl level but only 5 m was substantially higher in opalinus clay the reason why could not fully be clarified based on the fact that both 5 m nacl experiments and 5 m experiments were performed on the exact same sample it could be assumed that it is an outstanding sample and that it is an artefact of heterogeneity between the different samples the anion diffusion data indicate an increase of the anion accessible porosity with an increase of the concentration of ions in the pore water fig 3 this can be explained by the fact that a negatively charged surface attracts positively charged ions and repels negative ones varying molar concentrations cause different concentrations in the so called gouy chapman diffuse layer dl which surrounds the charged surfaces in a solution the electric potential decreases with increasing distance from the interface fig 4 the influence of the molar concentration of a symmetric monovalent electrolyte system on the thickness of the dl can be derived from the expression relating the debye length κ 1 to the ionic strength i of the pore solution appelo and postma 2005 9 κ 1 ε r t 2 n a q e 2 i with the dielectric constant of water ε 6 95 10 10 f m gas constant r 8 314 j k mol temperature t 298 k avogadro constant n a 6 022 1023 mol elementary electric charge q e 1 6 10 19c and the ionic strength i expressed in mol dm3 expression 9 can be written as 10 κ 1 3 06 i where κ 1 is given in ångstrom the ionic strength of the solution is calculated by 11 i 1 2 m i z i 2 where m i is the concentration of ion i and z i is the valence number of the anion it is obvious from eq 10 that an increase of the ionic strength decreases the debye length which means a decrease of the dl a decrease of the dl increases the free uncharged bulk water volume and thus results in increased anion accessible porosity it can be seen from fig 3 that samples saturated with a cacl2 pore water solution show a larger anion accessible porosity than samples saturated with a nacl based pore solution for the same ionic strength value eq 9 is applicable for monovalent 1 1 electrolyte systems but conventionally the equation is also applied for an equivalent ionic strength i for e g 2 1 electrolytes appelo and postma 2005 the extension of the dl in a pure nacl pore solution is 3 06 nm at an ionic strength of 0 01 m and 1 78 nm for a pure cacl2 pore solution with the same molar concentration and an equivalent ionic strength of 0 03 m hence the debye length for the cacl2 solution is smaller than for the nacl solution i e for the same molar concentration the diffuse layer is more compressed if the solution mainly contains calcium or other polyvalent cations this indicates that bivalent cations shield the negative surface charge more effectively than monovalent cations fig 4 an increase of the molar concentration results in a different influence on the anion accessible porosity in the two samples the anion accessible porosity of opalinus clay strongly depends on the molar concentration while helvetic marl shows a much smaller effect of the anion accessible porosity fig 3 the different impact of the molar concentration on the accessible porosity could potentially be explained by the difference in mineralogy as a background one has to know that the main transport takes place in the clay domain of the rock grolimund et al 2016 accordingly the clay minerals will have a dominant effect on the transport properties a fraction of the clay minerals i e illite and illite smectite mixed layers has negatively charged surfaces anions are repulsed by this negative charge and thus partially excluded from the charged pores kaolinite and chlorite are almost uncharged clay minerals and hardly impact anion diffusion a relative comparison of the clay mineralogy shows a slightly larger charged clay mineral amount in helvetic marl 59 than in opalinus clay 48 hence the anion exclusion is expected to be larger in helvetic marl than in opalinus clay nevertheless this small difference in mineralogy does not properly explain the different effect on the anion accessible porosity in the two samples wigger and van loon 2017 explained the large permanent anion exclusion as observed at high ionic strength values by introducing interlayer equivalent ile pores ile pores are small pores accrued by compaction these pores are so small that the diffuse layers overlap resulting in a large exclusion of anions it was assumed that helvetic marl has more such interlayer equivalent pores and therefore a larger permanent anion exclusion than opalinus clay unfortunately recent investigations wigger et al 2018a could not confirm this assumption several pore size distribution measurements indicate smaller pores in opa than in hm this is contradictory to the ile theory for that reason a bottleneck approach was used as alternative explanation in wigger et al 2018b according to this theory pore openings are so narrow that the diffuse layers overlap and limit the anion transport independent of the size of the pore core retention potential measurements indicated that hm has more of these so called bottleneck pores than opa which could explain the difference of the anion exclusion behavior 4 2 modelling the modelling of the data was based on a donnan model approach described in birgersson and karnland 2009 and modified according to wigger and van loon 2017 compared to other models for instance the gouy chapman model no structural information is needed to model the data with the donnan approach this is a key advantage for modelling the anion accessible porosity in natural argillaceous rocks because it is very difficult to provide proper structural information about natural clay systems in particular to distinguish the amount of charged and uncharged surfaces as well as their spatial distribution in the system wigger and van loon 2017 adapted the model of birgerson and karnland by reducing the donnan space by a permanent free uncharged pore space and a permanent charged and inaccessible pore space il and ile pores according to the model of birgersson and karnland almost a complete anion exclusion is expected at an ionic strength of 0 01 m or lower whereas this could be observed for compacted bentonite the data on argillaceous rocks show a different behavior wigger and van loon 2017 it was therefore hypothesized that uncharged pores cause permanent free and accessible pore space for anions however it is difficult to prove this because it seems not to be possible to reduce the ionic strength below 0 01 m due to mineral dissolution processes in argillaceous rock the permanent free pore space thus represents the plateau value observed when the ionic strength reaches a value of 0 01 m the permanent charged and inaccessible pore space was split in a stern layer an interlayer and a bottleneck porosity the stern layer porosity and the interlayer porosity were calculated from the mineralogy wigger and van loon 2017 while the bottleneck porosity was estimated from the experimental data as a fitting parameter the calculation used to model the experimental data of the through diffusion experiments as a function of the molar concentration can be written as 12 η an η tot η free η il η stern η bottleneck ξ η free where η an is the anion accessible porosity η tot is the total transport porosity estimated from hto diffusion η il is the interlayer porosity η stern is the stern layer porosity η bottleneck is the bottleneck porosity η free is the free porosity and ξ is an ion equilibrium coefficient in the case of a 1 1 electrolyte e g nacl the ion equilibrium coefficient ξ1 1 could be derived as described in birgersson and karnland 2009 with this model the nacl based pore water experiments can be modelled as described in wigger and van loon 2017 fig 3 however for 2 1 electrolytes such as cacl2 a more complicated solution is needed to model the anion accessible porosity as a function of the molar concentration the ion equilibrium coefficient ξ2 1 in the case of a 2 1 electrolyte such as cacl2 needs to be calculated based on a cubic equation gimmi and alt epping 2018 13 ξ 2 1 3 ω 2 w c ξ 2 1 2 γ 0 where c is the anion concentration mm γ is an activity coefficient w is the water ratio calculated by the mass of water divided by the mass of solid and ω is determined as 14 ω cec ρ w z where cec is the cation exchange capacity in the donnan space eq kg ρ w is the density of water kg m3 and z is the amount of equivalent per mole eq mol of the anion solving eq 5 results in the data shown in fig 3 the parameters about mineralogy and structure of the individual argillaceous samples are identical independent of the pore solutions when we compare the effect of nacl with that of cacl2 it is clear that cacl2 has a larger effect on the accessible porosity for the same concentration at low concentration 0 01 m and at high concentration 1 m the accessible porosities are identical independent of the composition of the pore water nacl or cacl2 this is clear because at low concentration the accessible porosity represents the uncharged pores and at high concentration the inaccessible porosity represents the permanently charged inaccessible pores sternlayer pore space interlayer pores and bottleneck pores both type of pores are not affected by the background electrolyte the main difference between cacl2 and nacl can thus be observed between 0 01 m and 1 m 4 3 effective diffusion coefficient this study not only investigated the porosity but also the effective diffusivity d e the effective diffusion coefficients for various pore solutions in opalinus clay and helvetic marl are listed in table 5 it is interesting to see that the effective diffusion coefficients of hto tend to show a decrease with increasing molar concentration of nacl or cacl2 as already discussed in detail in the study of wigger and van loon 2017 these decreases can be explained by the increasing viscosity of the pore solution as long as all other parameters namely the transport porosity and the geometric factor remain constant this can be derived from the stokes einstein relation 15 d e i η k b t 6 g π ϑ r i where η is the transport porosity k b is the boltzmann constant j k 1 t is the temperature k g is the geometric factor ϑ is the viscosity of the solution n s m 2 and r i is the hydrodynamic radius of species i m the geometric factor summarizes all parameters that describes the pore space such as the porosity constrictivity and tortuosity for opalinus clay it can be observed that effective diffusion coefficients for a pore solution with low molar concentration of 0 25 m obtained by hto measurements in cacl2 solutions are slightly larger than those in nacl solutions this may be caused by the slightly higher total porosity observed for the cacl2 systems however this effect cannot be observed in hm in helvetic marl the effective diffusion coefficients of different pore solutions are similar and therefore independent of the main cation of the pore solution additionally it is recognizable that the de of hto in a 5 m cacl2 pore solution is much lower than that of nacl at the same molar concentration for both argillaceous rock samples this can be explained by the fact that a 5 m cacl2 solution has a significant higher viscosity of 5 11 mpa s compared to 1 53 mpa s of the nacl solution goncalves and kestin 1979 kestin et al 1981 in contrast to the hto measurements the viscosity is not the only parameter which varies with increasing molar concentration in the case of 36cl diffusion as can be seen from fig 5 the de of 36cl increases with increasing molar concentration until a molarity of 1 m and decreases again for molar concentrations larger than 1 m up to a molarity of 1 m the effect of the increased accessible porosity dominates wigger and van loon 2017 whereas at a higher molarity the increase in viscosity becomes more important than the increase in porosity in both samples the de of 36cl in cacl2 solutions is larger than in nacl solutions 5 m this can be easily explained by the fact that the anion accessible porosity is constantly larger in cacl2 based pore waters than in nacl based pore waters an exception occurs at 1 m due to the fact the anion porosity is not increasing any further the effect of viscosity prevails the de of 36cl in cacl2 decreases more than that in nacl which can be related to the significant higher viscosity of the cacl2 solutions compared to the nacl solutions 5 conclusions the effect of the pore water composition on the diffusive anion transport was studied for two different argillaceous low permeability sedimentary rocks opalinus clay and helvetic marl the samples were saturated with different solutions with varying molar concentration and different main cations in the solution nacl based pore solutions and cacl2 based pore solutions the total porosity was measured by through diffusion experiments with the neutral tracer hto experiments performed in nacl solutions resulted in a porosity of 0 12 for opa and 0 03 for hm and are consistent with results of the experiments in cacl2 solutions the total porosity was independent of the molar concentration in contrast to the measured anion porosity which increased with increasing molar concentration it could further be observed that the pore solution based on the bivalent cation calcium shielded the negative surface charge stronger than the monovalent cation sodium resulting in a larger measureable anion accessible porosity in the case of cacl2 solutions the effect of different molar concentration on the anion transport porosity in these two argillaceous low permeability sedimentary rocks is different opa reacts stronger to the variation than hm which has a large permanent anion exclusion effect one explanation is the different mineralogy hm has relatively more charged clay minerals than opa therefore the repulsion of the anions in hm is larger than in opa an alternative explanation might be the fact that hm has more so called bottleneck pores than opa bottleneck pores limit the anion diffusion through overlapping diffuse layers at the pore opening independent of the pore core size the data was modelled based on an adapted donnan approach of birgersson and karnland 2009 the model had to be adjusted with a permanent free uncharged porosity as well as with structural information on the permanent anion exclusion because of so called bottleneck pores both parameters can only be evaluated from experiments nevertheless taking these two adaptions into account the effect of varying pore water compositions on the anion accessible porosity of the investigated argillaceous rocks could be satisfactorily described moreover also the difference between na based pore water and ca2 based pore water could be described based on this adapted model a better understanding of the anion exclusion behavior in natural argillaceous rocks with various pore solutions is provided which is relevant in the

molasse basin at a depth of 936 25 m in the deep borehole from schlattingen nagra 2002 wersin et al 2013 wersin et al 2016 while the helvetic marl sample was taken from a part of the helvetic nappe at a depth of 475 86 m in wellenberg nagra 1994 enachescu et al 1997 nagra 1997 nagra 2008 the opalinus clay sample was taken from a homogeneous clayey facies whereas the helvetic marl sample was a very hard grey sample mainly consisting of calcite and quartz the mineral compositions of the samples and important physical properties have been summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 sample preparation bore cores with a diameter of 0 1 m were sliced perpendicular to the core axis into 0 005 0 007 m thick pieces using a diamond saw without using a coolant the slices were embedded in an epoxy resin epofix struers gmbh after hardening of the resin the cylindrical sample was placed on a lathe and the resin at the planar ends was removed 3 2 pore water chemistry for equilibrating the samples with the respective pore solution the samples were mounted in a diffusion cell as described in detail in van loon and mibus 2015 the diffusion cell consists of two ertalyte plates which is an unreinforced polyester based on polyethylene terephthalate pet p the plates include a sintered titanium filter with a porosity of 0 1 a diameter of 0 065 m a thickness of 0 0012 m and a pore diameter of 1 10 5 m the argillaceous sample was confined between the two plates and was connected by a tubing inner diameter 0 001 m system with external pore water reservoirs a 24 channel peristaltic pump ipc ismatec idex united states circulated the pore solution through the tubing system toward the sample fig 2 in a first step each sample slice was sandwiched into a diffusion cell and connected with two belonging reservoirs filled with a pure nacl solution the same salt concentration was used on each side of the rock but varied for each sample 0 01 m 0 1 m 1 m 2 m 5 m then the circulation started to ensure a uniform and equilibrated nacl pore water concentration for an initial condition of the rock the equilibration process was monitored by analyzing the water every second week by ion chromatography ics5000 thermofischer as soon as a chemical steady state between the pore solution and argillaceous rock was reached the diffusion experiments could be started this equilibration process with the different pore waters lasted four months for both opa and hm samples it cannot be completely excluded that air was trapped in the sample however the samples used for the experiments were fresh samples wrapped in cellophane foil hence no drying effect was expected to happen before the experiment additionally the effect that water loss porosity was similar for each sample gives an indication that there was no air or at least a negligible amount of air trapped in the samples due to the fact that with air trapped inside the sample a lower water amount would be expected which would decrease the water loss porosity based on the data of wigger and van loon 2017 the interlayer water is so low i e opa 0 5 and hm 0 2 that any possible swelling or shrinking effects of smectites may be negligible 3 3 through diffusion experiments all through diffusion experiments were performed perpendicular to the bedding at a constant temperature of 25 1 c the neutral tracer tritiated water hto was used to measure the total transport porosity because it is assumed that neutral species can diffuse through all pore spaces 36cl was used for estimating the anion porosity the diffusion cells were connected to two different reservoirs one filled with 100 ml of the equilibrated pore solution spiked with the tracers hto and 36cl simultaneously 1000 bq ml hto 1000 bq ml 36cl connected to one side of the diffusion cell and the other one filled with 20 ml of the same equilibrated pore solution without any tracer connected to the opposite site of the diffusion cell to keep the tracer gradient high the low respectively non tracer concentration solution was replaced about every second day with a fresh one the accumulated activity in the replaced solutions was measured by liquid scintillation counting tricarb 2250 ca canberra packard details of the data processing are described in van loon et al 2003a from the total diffused activity the porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient were calculated as described in section 3 4 after the through diffusion experiments with the different nacl solutions were finished an out diffusion process of the tracer was initiated followed by a equilibration of the same samples with a cacl2 solution with the respective molar concentration values also in the case of cacl2 solutions the equilibration process was monitored every second week and equilibrium conditions between cacl2 solutions and the rock samples were reached after approximately four months the final chemical compositions of the different pore waters are listed in table 2 3 4 calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity is based on this analytical solution crank

transport porosity data of opalinus clay and helvetic marl measured by through diffusion experiments with varying pore water compositions all results presented in this study are listed with the specific error obtained by fitting the experiments and belong to the specific sample piece the variance respectively the heterogeneity between the different sample pieces is not included in these error values the transport porosity data obtained with nacl based pore solution experiments are already discussed in detail in wigger and van loon 2017 and are given here for comparison reasons the total transport porosity was estimated from through diffusion measurements with the neutral tracer hto the samples saturated with a nacl pore solution show a total average transport porosity of 0 12 for opalinus clay and 0 03 for hm it is interesting to see that the total transport porosity is consistent for the samples saturated with a cacl2 pore water opa 0 12 hm 0 03 as expected the total transport porosity is independent of the molar concentration of the solution owing to the fact that the neutral tracer is not affected by any electric potential note that the porosity calculated from the density is smaller than the porosity measured by hto diffusion wigger and van loon 2017 explained this observation with a swelling of the clay samples during the equilibration process additionally it should be mentioned that the total porosity at high nacl level but only 5 m was substantially higher in opalinus clay the reason why could not fully be clarified based on the fact that both 5 m nacl experiments and 5 m experiments were performed on the exact same sample it could be assumed that it is an outstanding sample and that it is an artefact of heterogeneity between the different samples the anion diffusion data indicate an increase of the anion accessible porosity with an increase of the concentration of ions in the pore water fig 3 this can be explained by the fact that a negatively charged surface attracts positively charged ions and repels negative ones varying molar concentrations cause different concentrations in the so called gouy chapman diffuse layer dl which surrounds the charged surfaces in a solution the electric potential decreases with increasing distance from the interface fig 4 the influence of the molar concentration of a symmetric monovalent electrolyte system on the thickness of the dl can be derived from the expression relating the debye length κ 1 to the ionic strength i of the pore solution appelo and postma 2005 9 κ 1 ε r t 2 n a q e 2 i with the dielectric constant of water ε 6 95 10 10 f m gas constant r 8 314 j k mol temperature t 298 k avogadro constant n a 6 022 1023 mol elementary electric charge q e 1 6 10 19c and the ionic strength i expressed in mol dm3 expression 9 can be written as 10 κ 1 3 06 i where κ 1 is given in ångstrom the ionic strength of the solution is calculated by 11 i 1 2 m i z i 2 where m i is the concentration of ion i and z i is the valence number of the anion it is obvious from eq 10 that an increase of the ionic strength decreases the debye length which means a decrease of the dl a decrease of the dl increases the free uncharged bulk water volume and thus results in increased anion accessible porosity it can be seen from fig 3 that samples saturated with a cacl2 pore water solution show a larger anion accessible porosity than samples saturated with a nacl based pore solution for the same ionic strength value eq 9 is applicable for monovalent 1 1 electrolyte systems but conventionally the equation is also applied for an equivalent ionic strength i for e g 2 1 electrolytes appelo and postma 2005 the extension of the dl in a pure nacl pore solution is 3 06 nm at an ionic strength of 0 01 m and 1 78 nm for a pure cacl2 pore solution with the same molar concentration and an equivalent ionic strength of 0 03 m hence the debye length for the cacl2 solution is smaller than for the nacl solution i e for the same molar concentration the diffuse layer is more compressed if the solution mainly contains calcium or other polyvalent cations this indicates that bivalent cations shield the negative surface charge more effectively than monovalent cations fig 4 an increase of the molar concentration results in a different influence on the anion accessible porosity in the two samples the anion accessible porosity of opalinus clay strongly depends on the molar concentration while helvetic marl shows a much smaller effect of the anion accessible porosity fig 3 the different impact of the molar concentration on the accessible porosity could potentially be explained by the difference in mineralogy as a background one has to know that the main transport takes place in the clay domain of the rock grolimund et al 2016 accordingly the clay minerals will have a dominant effect on the transport properties a fraction of the clay minerals i e illite and illite smectite mixed layers has negatively charged surfaces anions are repulsed by this negative charge and thus partially excluded from the charged pores kaolinite and chlorite are almost uncharged clay minerals and hardly impact anion diffusion a relative comparison of the clay mineralogy shows a slightly larger charged clay mineral amount in helvetic marl 59 than in opalinus clay 48 hence the anion exclusion is expected to be larger in helvetic marl than in opalinus clay nevertheless this small difference in mineralogy does not properly explain the different effect on the anion accessible porosity in the two samples wigger and van loon 2017 explained the large permanent anion exclusion as observed at high ionic strength values by introducing interlayer equivalent ile pores ile pores are small pores accrued by compaction these pores are so small that the diffuse layers overlap resulting in a large exclusion of anions it was assumed that helvetic marl has more such interlayer equivalent pores and therefore a larger permanent anion exclusion than opalinus clay unfortunately recent investigations wigger et al 2018a could not confirm this assumption several pore size distribution measurements indicate smaller pores in opa than in hm this is contradictory to the ile theory for that reason a bottleneck approach was used as alternative explanation in wigger et al 2018b according to this theory pore openings are so narrow that the diffuse layers overlap and limit the anion transport independent of the size of the pore core retention potential measurements indicated that hm has more of these so called bottleneck pores than opa which could explain the difference of the anion exclusion behavior 4 2 modelling the modelling of the data was based on a donnan model approach described in birgersson and karnland 2009 and modified according to wigger and van loon 2017 compared to other models for instance the gouy chapman model no structural information is needed to model the data with the donnan approach this is a key advantage for modelling the anion accessible porosity in natural argillaceous rocks because it is very difficult to provide proper structural information about natural clay systems in particular to distinguish the amount of charged and uncharged surfaces as well as their spatial distribution in the system wigger and van loon 2017 adapted the model of birgerson and karnland by reducing the donnan space by a permanent free uncharged pore space and a permanent charged and inaccessible pore space il and ile pores according to the model of birgersson and karnland almost a complete anion exclusion is expected at an ionic strength of 0 01 m or lower whereas this could be observed for compacted bentonite the data on argillaceous rocks show a different behavior wigger and van loon 2017 it was therefore hypothesized that uncharged pores cause permanent free and accessible pore space for anions however it is difficult to prove this because it seems not to be possible to reduce the ionic strength below 0 01 m due to mineral dissolution processes in argillaceous rock the permanent free pore space thus represents the plateau value observed when the ionic strength reaches a value of 0 01 m the permanent charged and inaccessible pore space was split in a stern layer an interlayer and a bottleneck porosity the stern layer porosity and the interlayer porosity were calculated from the mineralogy wigger and van loon 2017 while the bottleneck porosity was estimated from the experimental data as a fitting parameter the calculation used to model the experimental data of the through diffusion experiments as a function of the molar concentration can be written as 12 η an η tot η free η il η stern η bottleneck ξ η free where η an is the anion accessible porosity η tot is the total transport porosity estimated from hto diffusion η il is the interlayer porosity η stern is the stern layer porosity η bottleneck is the bottleneck porosity η free is the free porosity and ξ is an ion equilibrium coefficient in the case of a 1 1 electrolyte e g nacl the ion equilibrium coefficient ξ1 1 could be derived as described in birgersson and karnland 2009 with this model the nacl based pore water experiments can be modelled as described in wigger and van loon 2017 fig 3 however for 2 1 electrolytes such as cacl2 a more complicated solution is needed to model the anion accessible porosity as a function of the molar concentration the ion equilibrium coefficient ξ2 1 in the case of a 2 1 electrolyte such as cacl2 needs to be calculated based on a cubic equation gimmi and alt epping 2018 13 ξ 2 1 3 ω 2 w c ξ 2 1 2 γ 0 where c is the anion concentration mm γ is an activity coefficient w is the water ratio calculated by the mass of water divided by the mass of solid and ω is determined as 14 ω cec ρ w z where cec is the cation exchange capacity in the donnan space eq kg ρ w is the density of water kg m3 and z is the amount of equivalent per mole eq mol of the anion solving eq 5 results in the data shown in fig 3 the parameters about mineralogy and structure of the individual argillaceous samples are identical independent of the pore solutions when we compare the effect of nacl with that of cacl2 it is clear that cacl2 has a larger effect on the accessible porosity for the same concentration at low concentration 0 01 m and at high concentration 1 m the accessible porosities are identical independent of the composition of the pore water nacl or cacl2 this is clear because at low concentration the accessible porosity represents the uncharged pores and at high concentration the inaccessible porosity represents the permanently charged inaccessible pores sternlayer pore space interlayer pores and bottleneck pores both type of pores are not affected by the background electrolyte the main difference between cacl2 and nacl can thus be observed between 0 01 m and 1 m 4 3 effective diffusion coefficient this study not only investigated the porosity but also the effective diffusivity d e the effective diffusion coefficients for various pore solutions in opalinus clay and helvetic marl are listed in table 5 it is interesting to see that the effective diffusion coefficients of hto tend to show a decrease with increasing molar concentration of nacl or cacl2 as already discussed in detail in the study of wigger and van loon 2017 these decreases can be explained by the increasing viscosity of the pore solution as long as all other parameters namely the transport porosity and the geometric factor remain constant this can be derived from the stokes einstein relation 15 d e i η k b t 6 g π ϑ r i where η is the transport porosity k b is the boltzmann constant j k 1 t is the temperature k g is the geometric factor ϑ is the viscosity of the solution n s m 2 and r i is the hydrodynamic radius of species i m the geometric factor summarizes all parameters that describes the pore space such as the porosity constrictivity and tortuosity for opalinus clay it can be observed that effective diffusion coefficients for a pore solution with low molar concentration of 0 25 m obtained by hto measurements in cacl2 solutions are slightly larger than those in nacl solutions this may be caused by the slightly higher total porosity observed for the cacl2 systems however this effect cannot be observed in hm in helvetic marl the effective diffusion coefficients of different pore solutions are similar and therefore independent of the main cation of the pore solution additionally it is recognizable that the de of hto in a 5 m cacl2 pore solution is much lower than that of nacl at the same molar concentration for both argillaceous rock samples this can be explained by the fact that a 5 m cacl2 solution has a significant higher viscosity of 5 11 mpa s compared to 1 53 mpa s of the nacl solution goncalves and kestin 1979 kestin et al 1981 in contrast to the hto measurements the viscosity is not the only parameter which varies with increasing molar concentration in the case of 36cl diffusion as can be seen from fig 5 the de of 36cl increases with increasing molar concentration until a molarity of 1 m and decreases again for molar concentrations larger than 1 m up to a molarity of 1 m the effect of the increased accessible porosity dominates wigger and van loon 2017 whereas at a higher molarity the increase in viscosity becomes more important than the increase in porosity in both samples the de of 36cl in cacl2 solutions is larger than in nacl solutions 5 m this can be easily explained by the fact that the anion accessible porosity is constantly larger in cacl2 based pore waters than in nacl based pore waters an exception occurs at 1 m due to the fact the anion porosity is not increasing any further the effect of viscosity prevails the de of 36cl in cacl2 decreases more than that in nacl which can be related to the significant higher viscosity of the cacl2 solutions compared to the nacl solutions 5 conclusions the effect of the pore water composition on the diffusive anion transport was studied for two different argillaceous low permeability sedimentary rocks opalinus clay and helvetic marl the samples were saturated with different solutions with varying molar concentration and different main cations in the solution nacl based pore solutions and cacl2 based pore solutions the total porosity was measured by through diffusion experiments with the neutral tracer hto experiments performed in nacl solutions resulted in a porosity of 0 12 for opa and 0 03 for hm and are consistent with results of the experiments in cacl2 solutions the total porosity was independent of the molar concentration in contrast to the measured anion porosity which increased with increasing molar concentration it could further be observed that the pore solution based on the bivalent cation calcium shielded the negative surface charge stronger than the monovalent cation sodium resulting in a larger measureable anion accessible porosity in the case of cacl2 solutions the effect of different molar concentration on the anion transport porosity in these two argillaceous low permeability sedimentary rocks is different opa reacts stronger to the variation than hm which has a large permanent anion exclusion effect one explanation is the different mineralogy hm has relatively more charged clay minerals than opa therefore the repulsion of the anions in hm is larger than in opa an alternative explanation might be the fact that hm has more so called bottleneck pores than opa bottleneck pores limit the anion diffusion through overlapping diffuse layers at the pore opening independent of the pore core size the data was modelled based on an adapted donnan approach of birgersson and karnland 2009 the model had to be adjusted with a permanent free uncharged porosity as well as with structural information on the permanent anion exclusion because of so called bottleneck pores both parameters can only be evaluated from experiments nevertheless taking these two adaptions into account the effect of varying pore water compositions on the anion accessible porosity of the investigated argillaceous rocks could be satisfactorily described moreover also the difference between na based pore water and ca2 based pore water could be described based on this adapted model a better understanding of the anion exclusion behavior in natural argillaceous rocks with various pore solutions is provided which is relevant in the

1661,we employed the color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model to simulate liquid co2 displacing water documented in experiments in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions the main purpose is to investigate whether lattice boltzmann simulation can reproduce the co2 invasion patterns observed in these experiments for a range of capillary numbers although the viscosity ratio used in the simulation matches the experimental conditions the viscosity of the fluids in the simulation is higher than that of the actual fluids used in the experiments doing so is required to enhance numerical stability and is a common strategy employed in the literature when using the lattice boltzmann method to simulate co2 displacing water the simulations reproduce qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as the capillary number is increased however the development of secondary co2 pathways a key feature of the invasion patterns in the simulations and experiments is found to occur at a much higher capillary number in the simulations compared with the experiments additional numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of the absolute value of viscosity on the invasion patterns while maintaining the viscosity ratio and capillary number fixed these results indicate that the use of a high viscosity which significantly reduces the inertial effect in the simulations suppresses the development of secondary co2 pathways leading to a different fluid distribution compared with corresponding experiments at the same capillary number therefore inertial effects are not negligible in drainage process with liquid co2 and water despite the low reynolds number based on the average velocity as the local velocity can be much higher due to haines jump events these higher velocities coupled with the low viscosity of co2 further amplifies the inertial effect therefore we conclude that caution should be taken when using proxy fluids that only rely on the capillary number and viscosity ratio in both experiment and simulation keywords lattice boltzmann method flow in porous media micromodel experiment co2 sequestration 1 introduction understanding the migration of fluids within pore spaces in subsurface geological formations is critical for addressing important problems such as enhanced oil recovery groundwater pollution from leaking tanks or pipelines geothermal energy production and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide capture and geological storage of co2 provides a means of reducing co2 emissions into the atmosphere by capturing co2 from major stationary sources transporting it usually by pipeline and injecting it into suitable deep rock formations the co2 injected into a deep saline formation is typically in a liquid or liquid like supercritical dense phase meaning that it is significantly less viscous and slightly less dense than water as a result co2 migration is mainly controlled by the contrast in mobility of co2 and water celia et al 2004 metz et al 2005 nordbotten et al 2005 fingering and fluid displacement patterns at the pore scale can have a profound impact upon large scale phenomena such as the relative permeability relationship and residual trapping of fluids for instance viscous fingering can cause co2 to bypass portions of the pore space depending on the heterogeneity and anisotropy of rock permeability which results in low co2 trapping metz et al 2005 therefore it is of great importance to study the detailed pore scale displacement patterns of co2 injection in porous media under reservoir pressure conditions there are many experimental studies of co2 displacing water in real rock samples herring et al 2016 krevor et al 2012 one of the main limitations of rock core flooding experiments is that it is very difficult and expensive to visualize the dynamic displacement process within the rock despite its critical importance for understanding the displacement mechanisms x ray tomographic imaging technique have rapidly advanced and are capable of observing evolving fluid configurations which can lead to new insights into multiphase flow physics armstrong et al 2016 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 however these experimental methods are not able to provide full flow information such as velocity and pressure distribution inside the rock in addition it is very difficult to independently change one of the controlling physical parameters among surface tension viscosity of the different fluids and the contact angle while keeping the others unchanged moreover the rock sample is usually not reusable after one core flooding experiment thus detailed parametric studies of co2 water displacement processes pose a challenge to experimental investigation quasi two dimensional 2d micromodel experiments chalbaud et al 2009 kazemifar et al 2015 2016 lenormand et al 1988 moebius and or 2012 riazi et al 2011 zhang et al 2011a b overcome the visualization challenge in the real rock experiments with the tradeoff that only 2d systems can be studied in addition porosity pore size and connectivity of the micromodel can be readily manipulated during the fabrication process allowing a range of pore structures to be studied thus micromodel experiments have become a powerful tool for studying the fundamental physics of multiphase flow in porous media despite these advantages due to the different topology of 2d and 3d systems we cannot predict the behavior of 3d systems solely based on 2d results pore scale direct numerical simulation dns of multiphase flows in porous media has become increasingly popular owing to the rapid development of x ray tomographic imaging techniques wildenschild and sheppard 2013 that provide detailed geometric reconstructions of the pore structure for the simulation and high performance computing tölke and krafczyk 2008 that enables the simulation on a representative elementary volume of porous media however the effectiveness and accuracy of dns on real rock geometry must be validated by experiment there are several methods for pore scale dns of multiphase flows in porous media including the lattice boltzmann method lbm ahrenholz et al 2008 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2012 tölke 2002 tsuji et al 2016 conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods ferrari et al 2015 huang et al 2005 raeini et al 2015 2012 2014 the dissipative particle dynamics dfd method liu et al 2007 and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method bandara et al 2011 tartakovsky and meakin 2006 direct numerical simulation in real rock samples can provide detailed fluid displacement information including the dynamic invasion patterns as well as bulk properties such as capillary pressure and relative permeability also parametric studies by simulation are much easier to achieve compared to experiments the lbm is among the most popular methods due to its ability to efficiently implement boundary conditions for complex geometries encountered in porous media and to model interfacial dynamics between different fluids aidun and clausen 2010 chen and doolen 1998 liu et al 2016 in addition the rapid development of modern manycore processors such as gpus graphical processing units and intel xeon phi processors significantly boost computing power as evidenced by the top 500 supercomputer list top500 lists of november 2016 where 6 out of the top 10 supercomputers employ manycore processors these processors require a higher degree of explicit parallelism for which lbm is well suited and high performance lbm codes that are capable of simulating flow in porous media with image sizes over 10003 voxels mattila et al 2016 mcclure et al 2014 tsuji et al 2016 have been successfully developed for gpu platforms many lbm studies have used bulk properties such as relative permeability capillary pressure and saturation that are obtained from simulation to compare with experimental data in order to validate the efficacy of the simulation approach and relatively good agreement has been reported ahrenholz et al 2008 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2012 however the capability of lbm simulation to capture more detailed fluid displacement patterns requires further validation therefore 2d micromodel experiments where the displacement patterns can be easily visualized in time have also been employed to validate direct pore scale numerical simulations however comparison studies between lbm simulation and 2d micromodel experiments either show only qualitative agreement based on bulk saturation or use simple micromodels with a homogeneous pore structure such as cylindrical grains gray et al 2015 liu et al 2014 it is typical for experimental or numerical investigations of multiphase flow in porous media to utilize proxy fluids to reduce complexity because the inertial effects in the flow are usually ignored since the bulk reynolds number for in situ conditions is very small with this assumption the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio m become the primary parameters that control fluid invasion processes in this regard many lbm simulations ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 use significantly higher absolute viscosity than the physical viscosity in order to reduce numerical instability particularly for studies of co2 displacement as the viscosity of liquid co2 is quite small compared to that of water however recent studies suggest that inertial effects play a significant role in fluid displacement dynamics and the resulting invasion patters particularly during haines jumps wherein the local velocity of the fluids can be many times larger than the bulk average velocity of the fluids armstrong et al 2014 berg et al 2013 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 moebius and or 2012 zacharoudiou and boek 2016 thus while the bulk reynolds number re ratio of inertial to viscous effects is low and suggests that viscous effects dominate over inertial ones the local re in the pore space can be many times higher during haines jumps which indicates that inertial effects may become a controlling effect in how co2 migrates through the pore space thus how inertial effects influence the resulting invasion patterns in a complex porous system is an open question in this work we employed a variant of the color fluid lbm multiphase model liu et al 2012 tolke et al 2006 and performed simulations of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions visualizations of the co2 invasion patterns in this 2d micromodel were independently documented by experiment for various values of ca for direct comparison to the numerical results the geometry of the heterogeneous micromodel is inspired by a previous study zuo et al 2013 and represents a modification of the pore structure of real sandstone fully 3d simulations were performed to better match the experiment as the depth of the quasi 2d micromodel is comparable to the average pore throat size meaning that the constraint imposed on the flow by the presence of the bottom and top plates in the micromodel must be taken into account ferrari et al 2015 hele shaw 1898 to our knowledge there is no prior study comparing lbm simulations with experiments of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions in addition we performed a parametric study of the inertial effect as the viscosity used in the simulation is 5 3 times the physical viscosity of the experiments we introduce the experimental methods in section 2 and the numerical methods in section 3 we present the comparison between simulation and experiment and our parametric simulation studies in section 4 a discussion and our conclusions are presented in section 5 detailed description of the numerical model and code implementation can be found in appendix a and appendix b respectively validation of the model and code is presented in appendix c 2 experimental methods 2 1 heterogeneous micromodel the micromodel used in this study consists of an inlet and an outlet both connected to a heterogeneous porous section as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the porous section is inspired by a previous study zuo et al 2013 and represents a modification of the pore structure of real sandstone the original binary image provided by zuo et al 2013 was slightly modified to enlarge the throat size and thus reduce the likelihood of flow blockage during experimentation the entire porous section with dimensions of 5 3mm width 7 1mm length 30μm depth and a final porosity of 51 was generated by forming a 3 by 3 matrix of the basic unit pattern average and minimum throat sizes of 48μm and 12μm respectively based on the obtained pattern the porous structures were then created from a silicon wafer using micro fabrication techniques chomsurin and werth 2003 kazemifar et al 2015 including standard photolithography and inductively coupled plasma deep reactive ion etching icp drie two holes were also created in the wafer by through etching by the same method in order to get equal wettability on all surfaces within the micromodel the silicon wafer was oxidized at 1100 c for 60min to get an approximate 100nm layer of sio2 and subsequently cleaned following the same procedures used for cleaning the glass wafer the silicon wafer was then anodically bonded to the glass wafer and diced to form a micromodel li et al 2017 the contact angle of water on the surface was estimated to be 10 within the micromodel using co2 as the non wetting phase under actual experimental conditions two nanoports idex health science were finally attached to the two through holes of the micromodel for fluid delivery 2 2 experimental setup and procedure two high pressure syringe pumps teledyne isco 100dm were employed to accurately control the coupled flow of water and co2 through the micromodel as shown in fig 2 pump 1 which was connected to the inlet i e the left port of the micromodel was used to push the liquid co2 pump 2 which was connected to the outlet i e the right port was used to withdraw water as well as to maintain the back pressure of the entire flow system in order to preserve the micromodel from over pressurization it was placed within an overburden pressure cell whose pressure was controlled by a third high pressure syringe pump pump 3 teledyne isco 500d and always maintained at least 5 bar above the micromodel pressure throughout the experiment a high speed differential pressure transducer validyne p55e 1 n 2 42 s 5 a 0 140kpa 0 1 accuracy was also installed between the inlet and outlet to capture the instantaneous pressure drop across the micromodel prior to each experiment the co2 pump was filled with liquid co2 which was tagged with the fluorescent dye coumarin 153 following the procedures reported in a previous study zhang et al 2011b the co2 pump was then pressurized to 80 bar and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for over 2h meanwhile a new micromodel was mounted properly in the overburden pressure cell which was then filled with glycerol to facilitate pressurization to begin the experiment the micromodel was pre saturated with pure distilled water under ambient conditions through the right port i e the outlet the micromodel and the pressure cell were then pressurized simultaneously to 80 bar and 86 bar respectively after the pressures on the water side and co2 side both reached equilibrium the valve on the co2 line was opened and the co2 and water pumps were simultaneously initiated to run at desired volumetric flowrates each with an accuracy of 0 3 of the set flow rate the instantaneous phase configuration as co2 infiltrates into the water saturated micromodel was imaged using the epi fluorescence microscopy technique as illustrated in fig 3 a led light source thorlabs m385lp1 with a nominal wavelength of 385nm and a full width at half maximum of 12nm filtered by a bandpass filter filter 2 semrock brightline ff01 379 34 25 was used to excite the coumarin 153 dye in the co2 phase the fluorescence emitted from the dye was passed through a dichroic mirror and a λ 445 20nm bandpass filter filter 3 semrock brightline ff01 445 40 25 and focused by a long distance microscope objective infinity photo optical company k2 distamax onto the detector of a 4megapixel 12 bit high speed cmos camera phantom v641 with this imaging setup the resultant magnification and spatial resolution are 2 9 and 3 4μm respectively and the field of view was approximately 8 8mm 5 5mm which is sufficient to cover the entire porous section of the micromodel as indicated by the green region in fig 1 fluorescence images were captured at 500hz or 1000hz depending on the flow speed for each specific experiment additional details of this experimental approach can be found in kazemifar et al 2015 3 numerical methods 3 1 color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model there are essentially four basic lb multiphase models namely the color fluid model gunstensen et al 1991 the shan chen model shan and chen 1993 the free energy model swift et al 1996 and the mean field theory model he et al 1998 readers are referred to huang et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 for extensive reviews of these lbm multiphase models among these models the color fluid model is particularly popular for immiscible fluid flow in porous media with a high viscosity ratio owing to its ability to adjust surface tension and viscosity independently and maintain a relatively sharp interface between multiple fluids in this work we developed a variant of the color fluid model based on the work of tolke et al 2006 2002 the primary variables in lbm are the particle distribution function pdf in this model each fluid component is represented by its own pdf the d3q19 qian et al 1992 multiple relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann equation lbe d humires 2002 lallemand and luo 2000 is used to solve the navier stokes equations for each fluid component the main features of the color fluid model include that the phase separation is accomplished via a recoloring step independent of the surface tension and the surface tension effect is modeled by altering stress related second order equilibrium moments in the mrt operator as suggested in ref tolke et al 2006 a detailed description of the model is given in appendix a as mentioned in section 1 the computational cost for dns of multiphase flow in porous media is very high and requires a high performance parallel code we developed and optimized a portable lbm code which leverages the computing power of conventional cpu clusters as well as new architectures such as gpus and intel xeon phi processors see appendix b a stationary bubble test and a dynamical capillary rise test were performed to validate the model and the code results are in appendix c good agreements are found between the simulation results and the analytical solutions 3 2 simulation setup and procedure 3 2 1 computational domain initial conditions and boundary conditions as mentioned previously the depth of the micromodel used in the experiments is 30μm which is comparable with the average pore diameter of 48μm as well as the minimum throat size of 12μm therefore either 3d simulation or 2d simulation with modifications to account for the finite depth of the micromodel is required ferrari et al 2015 we performed 3d simulations to avoid the approximations inherent to 2d simulations a 3d optical confocal scan of the fabricated micromodel was performed to obtain the real geometry of the micromodel for use in the simulations to ensure that the computational domain reflects the actual pore structure of the experiments including any small irregularities that occur during fabrication particularly the finite resolution of the fabrication process itself the original scan resolution was 0 63μm to reduce computation cost the simulations were performed on a resized image of the original scan with grid resolution of 2 7μm as shown in fig 1 the inlet and outlet consist of two small holes at the two ends of the micromodel with two large triangular buffer zones at the entry and exit the micromodel is initially saturated with water and co2 is injected through the left injection hole and hence the co2 plume front does not necessarily reach the porous part of the micromodel uniformly to simulate the complete injection and outflow zone requires a larger spatial domain and significantly more computation cost moreover uncertainties still exist near the injection and outflow holes in the following simulations we replaced the triangular buffer zones at both ends with a rectangular buffer zone with 15 grids in the flow direction carbon dioxide is then uniformly distributed in the inlet buffer zone and water fills the rest of the void space in the computational domain at the beginning of the simulation the velocity field at the inlet boundary is assigned the analytical solution of single phase flow in a rectangular straight duct at the inlet a velocity boundary condition ladd 1994 is applied to the non wetting phase and a no flow condition bounce back is applied to the wetting phase preventing it from entering or existing the inlet unlike many previous studies for which the simulation ends once the invading fluid breaks through the outlet boundary or the invading fluid is not allowed to exit the outlet boundary ferrari et al 2015 liu et al 2014 we performed full drainage simulations until approximate steady state in the invasion pattern was reached as will be shown later in fig 4 due to the repeating pattern used in the micromodel injected co2 flows in preferential pathways and hence there can be a breakthrough to the outlet when only a small portion of the micromodel is invaded at the outlet a constant pressure boundary condition hecht and harting 2010 zou and he 1997 is applied to both the non wetting and wetting phase fluids and a neumann zero gradient boundary condition is applied to the order parameter to allow the interface to freely exit the outlet for the non slip solid walls the bounceback boundary condition is applied which is one of the main advantages of lbm chen and doolen 1998 as the scheme is extremely efficient for complex geometries the contact angle is modeled by assigning the value of the order parameter on the solid boundary nodes via eq a 15 considering the symmetric nature of the micromodel gravity is not considered only the top half half depth of the domain is simulated to reduce computation cost and a symmetry boundary condition is applied on the bottom of the simulation domain which is the mid plane of the physical domain the final computational grid has 1953 grids in the transverse direction 2604 grids in the flow direction and 7 grids in the half depth which gives a total of 1953 bf 1 2604 bf 2 7 grids where bf 1 18 and bf 2 18 represent the buffer layers at the inlet and outlet respectively the grid number along the depth direction takes account of the halfway bounce back nonslip wall condition on the top nodes where the physical boundary is halfway between the solid nodes and fluid nodes he et al 1997 and the symmetry boundary condition on the bottom nodes where the physical boundary is on the boundary nodes each simulation was executed for at least one pore volume pv injection to ensure that approximate steady state was reached 3 2 2 parameters in order to perform a rigorous comparison between experiment and simulation for multiphase flow in porous media one must match the viscosity ratio and density ratio between the different fluids in addition to the contact angle the reynolds number re and the capillary number ca the capillary and bulk reynolds numbers based on the non wetting phase are defined as 1 c a μ nw v ϕ σ cos θ 2 r e ρ nw v d ϕ μ nw where μ nw is the dynamic viscosity of the non wetting phase σ is the surface tension θ is the contact angle ϕ is the porosity of the micromodel v is the average inlet velocity and d is the average pore diameter by examining eqs 1 and 2 if re phys re lat and ca phys ca lat the fluid properties in the lattice system must obey the following relationship 3 μ n w p h y s 2 ρ n w p h y s σ p h y s d p h y s μ n w l a t 2 ρ n w l a t σ l a t d l a t where subscript lat denotes lattice units and subscript phys denotes physical units the above result is consistent with zacharoudiou and boek 2016 who proposed to use ohnesorge number oh when ca and re both need to be matched 4 o h μ n w ρ n w σ d the fluid properties and the micromodel geometry are fixed while only the flow rate is changed between different experiments therefore oh which is only related to the fluid properties and the geometry is a constant number throughout all the experiments and simulations the fluid properties used in the experiment are presented in table 1 the oh in the experiment is 2 177 10 3 the choice of the parameters used in the lb simulation is restricted by numerical stability and computation cost the density in lb simulation is usually set to unity and one can only adjust surface tension viscosity and the gird resolution which is related to the absolute value of d in the lattice space due to the high computation cost of direct numerical simulation in porous media one must choose a grid resolution that is sufficient high to resolve the interface at pore space while maintaining acceptable computation cost the grid used in this work has a resolution of 2 7 μm and the average pore diameter d in the lattice space is 17 6 which is sufficient to resolve the fluid interface then in order to match the oh in the experiment the value of ν n w l a t σ l a t in lattice space has to be 0 00913 for example if we let σ lat 0 035 then ν nw lat is 0 0017 although the simulation is unstable using this parameter set due to the stability issues with the current formulation of the lb color fluid model there is an upper limit for the surface tension and a lower limit for the viscosity to maintain stable simulations ahrenholz et al 2008 further considering the presence of complex solid surfaces and active driving force applied to the fluids for simulation of fluid displacement in porous media the present model simply cannot match the oh in the experiment and one must significantly increase the viscosity in the lattice space to ensure stable simulation in real world applications of flow in porous media the bulk re is usually very small and the inertial effects can be ignored which is widely accepted in the literature in such case one only needs to match ca viscosity ratio and the contact angle and the above approach i e increasing the absolute value of fluid viscosity is a relatively common practice in lbm simulations of multiphase flow in porous media ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 particularly when the viscosity of one fluid phase is rather small as is the case for co2 it s worth noting that for oil and brine displacement simulation as the viscosity of oil is two orders of magnitude larger than the liquid co2 one can always match the exact oh of experiment in lb simulation if needed the fluid property parameters in the lattice system and its corresponding parameters in the physical system as well as the real experiment parameters are shown in table 1 the viscosities in the simulations are 5 3 times the corresponding viscosities in the experiment and the density ratio is set to be 1 because the present form of the color fluid lb model cannot accurately model density contrasts huang et al 2013 the oh is 2 177 10 3 in the experiment and 1 162 10 2 in the simulation 5 3 times greater than the experiment nevertheless the viscosity ratio and contact angle in the simulations match those of the experiments due to the increased viscosity in the simulation the re in the simulation is 28 times smaller than the experiment at the same ca the injection velocity can be easily derived from ca combined with fluid properties listed in table 1 4 results 4 1 effect of capillary number based on the results from the experiments and simulations at least one pv of injection was required to reach approximately steady state in contrast to real rock samples where the porosity is typically smaller than 30 the porosity of the 2d micromodel is 51 in order to reduce the likelihood of flow blockage in the experiments significantly more iterations were required to inject a unit pv fluid into the micromodel compared with lower porosity porous media furthermore the 5 3 times higher viscosities required to ensure stable simulations further reduces the injection rate at the same ca at low ca the computational cost to inject a unit pv fluid could be prohibitively high because of the small injection rate for instance the simulation at ca 2 6 10 5 required 26 million iterations to inject one pv of co2 which required approximate three days of computing time on 8 of the latest intel xeon phi 7250 processors as a result the lowest ca reached in the simulations was ca 2 6 10 5 before presenting comparison between the experiments and simulations the dynamic co2 invasion patterns obtained from the simulation are used to discuss some of their key distinguishing features of the co2 invasion patterns fig 4 shows the dynamic invasion patterns of two simulations denoted by s1 ca 2 6 10 5 re 0 19 and s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 as mentioned in section 2 the mask used to fabricate the micromodel is produced by stitching together 9 unit heterogeneous porous sections as a result some periodic invasion patterns inevitably exist the simulations show that three primary co2 pathways exist demarcated by ellipses resulting in the early breakthrough of the co2 in s3 the breakthrough occurs after about 0 28pv injection while the breakthrough occurs after 0 27pv injection in s1 furthermore there are secondary streamwise co2 pathways that developed in s3 demarcated by rectangles as injection continues these secondary co2 pathways in s3 invade significant portions of the micromodel and eventually reach the outlet in s1 as ca is lower capillary fingering results in more lateral invasions around the primary co2 pathways and the primary co2 pathways in s1 look slightly wider than the primary co2 pathways in s3 however due to the lack of secondary co2 pathways in s1 the overall co2 saturation in s1 is smaller than s3 during the entire injection process fig 5 compares invasion patterns obtained from simulations with those from experiments at approximately steady state and for a similar ca range e1 ca 0 5 10 5 re 1 0 e2 ca 1 0 10 5 re 2 1 and e3 ca 2 6 10 5 re 5 4 denote the experimental results s1 ca 2 6 10 5 re 0 19 s2 ca 3 6 10 5 re 0 26 and s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 denote the simulation results the experimental and the simulation results show similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as the flow rate increases the secondary co2 pathways have fully developed in both e3 and s3 demarcated by ellipses while they are completely or partially suppressed in e1 e2 s1 and s2 which prevents invasion into significant portions of the micromodel and results in lower co2 saturation compared with e3 and s3 from e2 and s2 a few large uninvaded areas are readily evident and demarcated by rectangles these areas further propagate upstream in e1 and s1 as shown in fig 5 this phenomena is likely due to the fact that the three primary co2 pathways break through early before the fingers surrounding the primary co2 pathways have fully developed the development of these lateral fingers is mainly affected by the local pressure difference between co2 and water in the individual pore throats after breakthrough the pressure within the co2 releases at the outlet which causes significant reduction of the pressure across the micromodel as shown in fig 6 the reduced pressure within co2 may not be sufficient to overcome the capillary pressure required to develop lateral fingers after breakthrough in e1 as the ca is the smallest more capillary fingering patterns are evident compared to the s1 case the main discrepancy found in the comparison between the experimental and simulation results is that the secondary co2 pathways in the simulation developed at a much higher ca s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 compared to the experiments e3 ca 2 6 10 5 re 5 4 of particular importance the use of a 5 3 times increased viscosity in the simulations significantly reduces the inertial effect compared with the experiment at the same ca and is likely responsible for this behavior the bulk average re in s1 s2 and s3 are 0 19 0 26 and 0 76 respectively while the bulk re in e1 e2 and e3 are 1 0 2 1 and 5 4 respectively moreover the local re in certain pore throats in e3 can be much larger than the bulk value 5 4 particularly during haines jump events armstrong et al 2014 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 kazemifar et al 2016 wherein the local re can be 10 50 times larger than the bulk re kazemifar et al 2016 as a result inertial effects are likely significant during such events although the re in s3 is still much smaller than e3 the ca of s3 is four times larger than that of e3 the invasion pattern is determined by the competition among the capillary viscous and inertial forces thus direct comparison between the experiments and simulations is not possible if inertial effects are considered because of the increased absolute viscosity in the simulations parametric study of the viscosity in the simulation however can be used to isolate the importance of inertial effects and study their impact on the development of secondary co2 pathways in the next section the simulation parameters in table 1 are maintained except that the absolute viscosity in the simulations is increased to study the inertial effect at the same ca 4 2 effect of reynolds number based on the results in figs 4 and 5 as discussed above we hypothesize that the secondary co2 pathways in s1 are suppressed due to the use of higher absolute viscosity in the simulations compared to the experiments therefore by increasing the absolute viscosity maintaining the ca surface tension contact angle and m the same which lowers the re and thus increases the effect of viscosity while simultaneously reducing the inertial effect the development of secondary co2 pathways may be suppressed if the above hypothesis is true in the s3 simulation ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 the viscosity is 5 3 times larger than the physical viscosity of the liquid co2 and water in the experiments we further increase the viscosity used in this simulation by 6 times denoted as simulation s3 1 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 021 while all other parameters remain unchanged fig 7 shows the invasion patterns of s3 and s3 1 after 0 09 0 14 and 0 20pv injection these results clearly show that the secondary co2 pathways demarcated with ellipses noted in s3 in this figure are suppressed in s3 1 one may suspect that use of higher viscosity could increase the inlet pressure and thus influence the resulting invasion patterns however as the ca and the surface tension remain unchanged the flow rate decreases proportionally as the viscosity is increased in this regard the pressure drop versus injected co2 volume under increased absolute viscosity s3 1 should be close to the original simulation s3 fig 8 shows that the pressure drop as a function of injected co2 volume of s3 and s3 1 are indeed very close particularly during the early stage when the invasion patterns of the two cases are similar the pressure distribution of the non wetting phase after 0 09 0 14 and 0 20pv injection are plotted in fig 9 the two secondary co2 pathways in the upper domain in s3 developed between 0 09pv injection and 0 14pv injection we do not see significant difference of pressure distribution between s3 and s3 1 at 0 09pv injection in fig 9 thus the main contributor to the development of the secondary co2 pathways is likely inertial effects when the invading fluid has penetrated a pore throat and a new pore body is being invaded the damping of the fluid inertia at different re is different even though the surrounding pressure is the same which could result in the alteration of flow pathways this observation is consistent with ferrari and lunati 2014 who used direct numerical simulation of a network model to demonstrate that increasing inertial effects leads to different fluid distributions by influencing the selection of the next pore to be invaded our simulations reflect the same phenomena but in a more realistic and complex porous system 5 conclusions in this study we developed a high performance lbm code based on a variant of the color fluid multiphase lb model and applied the code to simulate liquid co2 displacing water in a series of experiments in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions our major contributions are summarized as follows 1 lbm simulations and experiments of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel inspired by real rock structures at reservoir pressure conditions were performed and compared for the first time 2 the simulations reproduce qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as ca increases 3 the major discrepancy between experiments and simulations is the development of secondary co2 pathways which occur at a much higher ca in the simulations compared to the experiments 4 further investigation of viscosity effects reveals that the development of the secondary co2 pathways is related to inertial effects which are suppressed in the simulations because numerical stability issues required the fluids in the simulation to have larger absolute viscosity than the fluids used in the experiments of particular importance in the present work inertial effects are usually assumed negligible in multiphase flow through real porous media as the bulk reynolds number re based on the average flow velocity is very small under this assumption the fluid displacement is presumed to be dominated by capillary and viscous forces meaning that the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio m should be the only controlling parameters this presumption is the basis for the use of proxy fluids in both numerical simulations and experiments where ca and m are matched but not re or any of the absolute physical properties of the fluid viscosity and density for example however as pointed out by several recent studies armstrong et al 2014 berg et al 2013 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 moebius and or 2012 zacharoudiou and boek 2016 inertial effects in fluid displacement dynamics particularly during localized haines jump events where the local pore velocity and thus the local re can be 10 50 times larger than the bulk kazemifar et al 2016 can have significant impact on the fluid invasion patterns in porous media therefore the use of proxy fluids solely based on ca and m in numerical simulations and experiments must be done with caution the present experiments employ high pressure to replicate co2 and water properties under the reservoir pressure conditions instead of using proxy fluids as a result these experiments in the 2d heterogeneous micromodel more closely represent the real reservoir situation and can thus be a better benchmark for the validation of numerical methods for such flow scenarios while it is possible to fully match the absolute parameters in the lbm simulation of oil and water ramstad et al 2012 both of which are much more viscous than liquid or supercritical co2 matching the absolute parameters for the co2 and water combination is much more difficult as shown in eqs a 14 a 15 and a 12 in appendix a the color gradient which is used to implement surface tension effects in the color fluid lbm model between the solid boundary nodes and the non wetting phase nodes is very large while it is much smaller between the solid boundary nodes and the wetting phase nodes this causes large spurious velocity in the non wetting phase near non flat solid walls and three phase solid water co2 contact lines where the magnitude of the spurious currents is proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the viscosity connington and lee 2012 in lbm simulation of oil and water these spurious currents are suppressed in the more viscous non wetting oil phase however in the liquid co2 and water flow simulation these spurious currents are amplified in the less viscous non wetting phase of liquid co2 as a result the common practice in lbm simulation of multiphase flow is to significantly increase the absolute viscosity values to reduce spurious velocity and improve numerical stability ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 particularly when the viscosity of one fluid phase co2 herein is very small by increasing the absolute viscosity of the fluids by a factor of 5 3 we achieved stable simulations that reproduced qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns with increasing ca however as demonstrated herein the simulations required a much larger ca to mimic the secondary co2 flow pathways that are a prevalent feature in the experiments as a result the final co2 distribution between the simulations and experiments were quite different at the same ca the parametric study of the absolute viscosity effect at the same ca identified that the development of these secondary co2 pathways is directly related to inertial effects many more advanced and possibly more complex lbm multiphase models have been developed fakhari and bolster 2017 liu et al 2015 that have more favorable stability properties so that lower viscosity fluids can be simulated in the past due to the lack of computing power relatively simple lbm formulations have been favored for pore scale dns however some of these newer lbm models may enable the use of fully matched physical parameters in simulations although they are more computationally demanding finally owing to the improved stability in advanced models larger time steps could be used in simulations which would reduce the overall iterations we are currently working to implement these new models and investigate their ability to more exactly reproduce the experimental results reported herein acknowledgements this work was supported as part of

original color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model gunstensen et al 1991 was introduced in the 1990s we developed a variant of the color fluid lb multiphase model based on the work of tolke et al

15 ϕ cos θ liu et al 2012 proposed a color fluid model based on the continuum surface force csf concept by transforming the perturbation operator ω i 2 in liu s model for the fluid mixture to the moment space in the mrt framework via the transformation matrix m same terms in eq a 12 can be obtained therefore the present model can also be seen as the mrt version of liu s model a higher order isotropic scheme sbragaglia et al 2007 for computing the color gradient instead of eq a 14 is available to improve numerical accuracy and stability at the cost of involving more nearby nodes for flow in porous media we employ eq a 14 considering the computation cost and complexity of the geometry to account for unequal viscosities of the two fluids a harmonic mean is used to determine the viscosity of the bulk fluid mixture liu et al 2014 zu and he 2013 a 16 1 μ 1 ϕ 2 μ r 1 ϕ 2 μ b after the collision step for the bulk fluid mixture in the mrt framework as shown in eq a 5 we obtained the post collision pdfs of the fluid mixture f i p o s t the recoloring operator ω i s 3 redistributes the mass distributions of fluid r and fluid b in a way so that the inner product of the color gradient c and momentum of fluid r is maximized tolke et al 2006 in this work we employ the recoloring scheme given in tolke et al 2002 in summary two separate groups of particle distribution functions represent the binary fluids and follow the traditional collision streaming iteration of lbm the surface tension effects are modeled via adding additional terms in the stress related equilibrium moments in the mrt collision framework which are based on the surface tension and color gradient as shown in eq a 12 after the mrt collision step the recoloring scheme is applied to separate the two fluids the streaming step streams the post collision pdfs to nearby lattice nodes the order parameter ϕ and color gradient c is then updated to be used in the next collision streaming iteration the bulk fluid mixture pdfs f i x t where f i x t f i r x t f i b x t are only used in the collision step and need not to be stored one of the key features of the color fluid model is that phase separation is via a recoloring step independent of the surface tension while in the shan chen lb multiphase model shan and chen 1993 phase separation is via interaction potential proportional to the surface tension to prevent different fluids from mixing with each other as a result the interface thickness in the shan chen model is significantly larger except for very large surface tension and different phases are not strictly immiscible also the surface tension effect in the color fluid model is modeled by altering the stress related second order equilibrium moments as shown in eq a 12 while the zero and first order moments ρ j x j y and j z remain unchanged and conserved in contrast the shan chen model does not locally conserve momentum shan and chen 1993 due to the interaction potential force directly applied to the fluid and significant artificial bulk density pressure fluctuation near the solid fluid interfaces can be observed for non neutral wetting fluids chen et al 2015 appendix b code implementation modern manycore processors such as gpus graphical processing units and intel xeon phi processors are developing rapidly and greatly boost computing power these processors not only provide much higher flops floating point operations per second but also much higher memory bandwidth compared with traditional cpu one of the most attractive features of the lbm is that it is explicit in time has nearest neighbor communication and the computational effort is in the collision step which is localized at a grid node for these reasons the lbm is well suited for manycore processors which require a higher degree of explicit parallelism moreover as shown in eq a 5 the particle distribution functions in the d3q19 lb model have 19 lattice velocities and 18 of them move to adjacent nodes during each iteration as a result the data movement in the lbm is much more intensive than for traditional cfd given the current state of computational hardware in particular the relative speed and capacity of processors and memory the lbm is a memory bound numerical method liu et al 2016 the high memory bandwidth provided by gpus or intel xeon phi processors greatly benefits the lbm for the past decade many lbm codes have been developed to utilize nvidia gpu acceleration jiang and tsuji 2014 mattila et al 2016 mcclure et al 2014 tölke and krafczyk 2008 these codes must rely on the low level cuda programming language in recent years other manycore processors such as the intel xeon phi processors have also been adopted for lbm high performance computing rosales 2013 due to the rapid development of modern processors low level cuda code may not be a good choice for maintaining a portable code as modern compilers become more and more mature a portable code using hybrid mpi openmp or mpi openacc which relies on the compiler for low level implementation could be quite attractive as one may run the same code on different platforms ranging from every day laptops to high end supercomputers equipped with manycore processors we developed and optimized a portable lattice boltzmann code mf lbm for numerical simulation of flow in porous media and microfluidics the code employs a mpi openmp openacc hybrid programming model so that it can run on either intel xeon phi processors or nvidia gpus as mentioned above the lbm is a memory bound numerical method due to the streaming of 18 particle distribution functions pdfs to the adjacent nodes the traditional streaming method requires redundant storage of the pdfs in order to avoid data dependency during the streaming step we adopt the aa pattern streaming method bailey et al 2009 to significantly reduce memory access and memory consumption this method does not need the redundant storage of the pdfs and stores pdfs at opposite directions at different steps based on the access pattern of the streaming step moreover as the pdfs are stored at opposite directions the bounce back nonslip boundary condition which simply reverses the directions of pdfs at solid nodes is carried out by default for all nodes the mrt collision term in eq a 5 is also carried out for all nodes but only the fluid nodes are updated using a fluid node indicator in such case conditional non slip wall boundary treatment can be avoided which significantly increases the performance on manycore processors the structure of arrays soa data format is used to achieve coalesced memory access and maximize vectorization the code achieves up to 492 mlups million lattice update per second by a single intel xeon phi 7250 knl processor towns et al 2014 using double precision for multiphase flow simulation on a 240 240 240 grid appendix c model and code validations one of the features of the present color fluid model is that the surface tension can be determined analytically and can be used as a direct input parameter liu et al 2012 tolke et al 2006 we first validated the code via the test of the laplace law with a stationary bubble to compare the computed surface tension value with the theoretical value a red spherical bubble is initially located at the center of a blue fluid domain with 120 120 120 lattice cells periodic boundary conditions are applied to the domain boundaries the pressure difference δp across the bubble interface can be determined by the young laplace equation c 1 δ p 2 σ r where r is the radius of the bubble the density ratio of the fluids is set to unity for all simulations while the viscosity ratio surface tension value and the radius of the bubble vary the results are presented in table c 2 for simplicity the values presented in this section are all in lattice unit we can see that the relative error of the surface tension increases as the bubble radius decreases or the viscosity ratio m ν b ν r increases which is consistent with results reported in tölke et al 2013 overall the present model recovers the laplace law and the obtained surface tension value is sufficiently accurate compared with theoretical value in order to further validate the code in a more realistic situation we performed three dimensional dynamic capillary rise test a cylindrical tube is initially filled with wetting fluid the outlet of the tube is connected to a wetting fluid reservoir with constant pressure p out while the inlet is connected to a non wetting fluid reservoir with constant pressure p in if the pressure difference δp p in p out is sufficient high the non wetting fluid will overcomes the capillary pressure p c and displace the wetting fluid in the tube as shown in fig c 10 if gravity and inertial effects are neglected the interface position can then be determined via the washburn equation washburn 1921 c 2a z t r 2 δ p p c 8 μ w l t i f

1661,we employed the color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model to simulate liquid co2 displacing water documented in experiments in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions the main purpose is to investigate whether lattice boltzmann simulation can reproduce the co2 invasion patterns observed in these experiments for a range of capillary numbers although the viscosity ratio used in the simulation matches the experimental conditions the viscosity of the fluids in the simulation is higher than that of the actual fluids used in the experiments doing so is required to enhance numerical stability and is a common strategy employed in the literature when using the lattice boltzmann method to simulate co2 displacing water the simulations reproduce qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as the capillary number is increased however the development of secondary co2 pathways a key feature of the invasion patterns in the simulations and experiments is found to occur at a much higher capillary number in the simulations compared with the experiments additional numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of the absolute value of viscosity on the invasion patterns while maintaining the viscosity ratio and capillary number fixed these results indicate that the use of a high viscosity which significantly reduces the inertial effect in the simulations suppresses the development of secondary co2 pathways leading to a different fluid distribution compared with corresponding experiments at the same capillary number therefore inertial effects are not negligible in drainage process with liquid co2 and water despite the low reynolds number based on the average velocity as the local velocity can be much higher due to haines jump events these higher velocities coupled with the low viscosity of co2 further amplifies the inertial effect therefore we conclude that caution should be taken when using proxy fluids that only rely on the capillary number and viscosity ratio in both experiment and simulation keywords lattice boltzmann method flow in porous media micromodel experiment co2 sequestration 1 introduction understanding the migration of fluids within pore spaces in subsurface geological formations is critical for addressing important problems such as enhanced oil recovery groundwater pollution from leaking tanks or pipelines geothermal energy production and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide capture and geological storage of co2 provides a means of reducing co2 emissions into the atmosphere by capturing co2 from major stationary sources transporting it usually by pipeline and injecting it into suitable deep rock formations the co2 injected into a deep saline formation is typically in a liquid or liquid like supercritical dense phase meaning that it is significantly less viscous and slightly less dense than water as a result co2 migration is mainly controlled by the contrast in mobility of co2 and water celia et al 2004 metz et al 2005 nordbotten et al 2005 fingering and fluid displacement patterns at the pore scale can have a profound impact upon large scale phenomena such as the relative permeability relationship and residual trapping of fluids for instance viscous fingering can cause co2 to bypass portions of the pore space depending on the heterogeneity and anisotropy of rock permeability which results in low co2 trapping metz et al 2005 therefore it is of great importance to study the detailed pore scale displacement patterns of co2 injection in porous media under reservoir pressure conditions there are many experimental studies of co2 displacing water in real rock samples herring et al 2016 krevor et al 2012 one of the main limitations of rock core flooding experiments is that it is very difficult and expensive to visualize the dynamic displacement process within the rock despite its critical importance for understanding the displacement mechanisms x ray tomographic imaging technique have rapidly advanced and are capable of observing evolving fluid configurations which can lead to new insights into multiphase flow physics armstrong et al 2016 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 however these experimental methods are not able to provide full flow information such as velocity and pressure distribution inside the rock in addition it is very difficult to independently change one of the controlling physical parameters among surface tension viscosity of the different fluids and the contact angle while keeping the others unchanged moreover the rock sample is usually not reusable after one core flooding experiment thus detailed parametric studies of co2 water displacement processes pose a challenge to experimental investigation quasi two dimensional 2d micromodel experiments chalbaud et al 2009 kazemifar et al 2015 2016 lenormand et al 1988 moebius and or 2012 riazi et al 2011 zhang et al 2011a b overcome the visualization challenge in the real rock experiments with the tradeoff that only 2d systems can be studied in addition porosity pore size and connectivity of the micromodel can be readily manipulated during the fabrication process allowing a range of pore structures to be studied thus micromodel experiments have become a powerful tool for studying the fundamental physics of multiphase flow in porous media despite these advantages due to the different topology of 2d and 3d systems we cannot predict the behavior of 3d systems solely based on 2d results pore scale direct numerical simulation dns of multiphase flows in porous media has become increasingly popular owing to the rapid development of x ray tomographic imaging techniques wildenschild and sheppard 2013 that provide detailed geometric reconstructions of the pore structure for the simulation and high performance computing tölke and krafczyk 2008 that enables the simulation on a representative elementary volume of porous media however the effectiveness and accuracy of dns on real rock geometry must be validated by experiment there are several methods for pore scale dns of multiphase flows in porous media including the lattice boltzmann method lbm ahrenholz et al 2008 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2012 tölke 2002 tsuji et al 2016 conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods ferrari et al 2015 huang et al 2005 raeini et al 2015 2012 2014 the dissipative particle dynamics dfd method liu et al 2007 and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method bandara et al 2011 tartakovsky and meakin 2006 direct numerical simulation in real rock samples can provide detailed fluid displacement information including the dynamic invasion patterns as well as bulk properties such as capillary pressure and relative permeability also parametric studies by simulation are much easier to achieve compared to experiments the lbm is among the most popular methods due to its ability to efficiently implement boundary conditions for complex geometries encountered in porous media and to model interfacial dynamics between different fluids aidun and clausen 2010 chen and doolen 1998 liu et al 2016 in addition the rapid development of modern manycore processors such as gpus graphical processing units and intel xeon phi processors significantly boost computing power as evidenced by the top 500 supercomputer list top500 lists of november 2016 where 6 out of the top 10 supercomputers employ manycore processors these processors require a higher degree of explicit parallelism for which lbm is well suited and high performance lbm codes that are capable of simulating flow in porous media with image sizes over 10003 voxels mattila et al 2016 mcclure et al 2014 tsuji et al 2016 have been successfully developed for gpu platforms many lbm studies have used bulk properties such as relative permeability capillary pressure and saturation that are obtained from simulation to compare with experimental data in order to validate the efficacy of the simulation approach and relatively good agreement has been reported ahrenholz et al 2008 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2012 however the capability of lbm simulation to capture more detailed fluid displacement patterns requires further validation therefore 2d micromodel experiments where the displacement patterns can be easily visualized in time have also been employed to validate direct pore scale numerical simulations however comparison studies between lbm simulation and 2d micromodel experiments either show only qualitative agreement based on bulk saturation or use simple micromodels with a homogeneous pore structure such as cylindrical grains gray et al 2015 liu et al 2014 it is typical for experimental or numerical investigations of multiphase flow in porous media to utilize proxy fluids to reduce complexity because the inertial effects in the flow are usually ignored since the bulk reynolds number for in situ conditions is very small with this assumption the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio m become the primary parameters that control fluid invasion processes in this regard many lbm simulations ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 use significantly higher absolute viscosity than the physical viscosity in order to reduce numerical instability particularly for studies of co2 displacement as the viscosity of liquid co2 is quite small compared to that of water however recent studies suggest that inertial effects play a significant role in fluid displacement dynamics and the resulting invasion patters particularly during haines jumps wherein the local velocity of the fluids can be many times larger than the bulk average velocity of the fluids armstrong et al 2014 berg et al 2013 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 moebius and or 2012 zacharoudiou and boek 2016 thus while the bulk reynolds number re ratio of inertial to viscous effects is low and suggests that viscous effects dominate over inertial ones the local re in the pore space can be many times higher during haines jumps which indicates that inertial effects may become a controlling effect in how co2 migrates through the pore space thus how inertial effects influence the resulting invasion patterns in a complex porous system is an open question in this work we employed a variant of the color fluid lbm multiphase model liu et al 2012 tolke et al 2006 and performed simulations of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions visualizations of the co2 invasion patterns in this 2d micromodel were independently documented by experiment for various values of ca for direct comparison to the numerical results the geometry of the heterogeneous micromodel is inspired by a previous study zuo et al 2013 and represents a modification of the pore structure of real sandstone fully 3d simulations were performed to better match the experiment as the depth of the quasi 2d micromodel is comparable to the average pore throat size meaning that the constraint imposed on the flow by the presence of the bottom and top plates in the micromodel must be taken into account ferrari et al 2015 hele shaw 1898 to our knowledge there is no prior study comparing lbm simulations with experiments of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions in addition we performed a parametric study of the inertial effect as the viscosity used in the simulation is 5 3 times the physical viscosity of the experiments we introduce the experimental methods in section 2 and the numerical methods in section 3 we present the comparison between simulation and experiment and our parametric simulation studies in section 4 a discussion and our conclusions are presented in section 5 detailed description of the numerical model and code implementation can be found in appendix a and appendix b respectively validation of the model and code is presented in appendix c 2 experimental methods 2 1 heterogeneous micromodel the micromodel used in this study consists of an inlet and an outlet both connected to a heterogeneous porous section as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the porous section is inspired by a previous study zuo et al 2013 and represents a modification of the pore structure of real sandstone the original binary image provided by zuo et al 2013 was slightly modified to enlarge the throat size and thus reduce the likelihood of flow blockage during experimentation the entire porous section with dimensions of 5 3mm width 7 1mm length 30μm depth and a final porosity of 51 was generated by forming a 3 by 3 matrix of the basic unit pattern average and minimum throat sizes of 48μm and 12μm respectively based on the obtained pattern the porous structures were then created from a silicon wafer using micro fabrication techniques chomsurin and werth 2003 kazemifar et al 2015 including standard photolithography and inductively coupled plasma deep reactive ion etching icp drie two holes were also created in the wafer by through etching by the same method in order to get equal wettability on all surfaces within the micromodel the silicon wafer was oxidized at 1100 c for 60min to get an approximate 100nm layer of sio2 and subsequently cleaned following the same procedures used for cleaning the glass wafer the silicon wafer was then anodically bonded to the glass wafer and diced to form a micromodel li et al 2017 the contact angle of water on the surface was estimated to be 10 within the micromodel using co2 as the non wetting phase under actual experimental conditions two nanoports idex health science were finally attached to the two through holes of the micromodel for fluid delivery 2 2 experimental setup and procedure two high pressure syringe pumps teledyne isco 100dm were employed to accurately control the coupled flow of water and co2 through the micromodel as shown in fig 2 pump 1 which was connected to the inlet i e the left port of the micromodel was used to push the liquid co2 pump 2 which was connected to the outlet i e the right port was used to withdraw water as well as to maintain the back pressure of the entire flow system in order to preserve the micromodel from over pressurization it was placed within an overburden pressure cell whose pressure was controlled by a third high pressure syringe pump pump 3 teledyne isco 500d and always maintained at least 5 bar above the micromodel pressure throughout the experiment a high speed differential pressure transducer validyne p55e 1 n 2 42 s 5 a 0 140kpa 0 1 accuracy was also installed between the inlet and outlet to capture the instantaneous pressure drop across the micromodel prior to each experiment the co2 pump was filled with liquid co2 which was tagged with the fluorescent dye coumarin 153 following the procedures reported in a previous study zhang et al 2011b the co2 pump was then pressurized to 80 bar and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for over 2h meanwhile a new micromodel was mounted properly in the overburden pressure cell which was then filled with glycerol to facilitate pressurization to begin the experiment the micromodel was pre saturated with pure distilled water under ambient conditions through the right port i e the outlet the micromodel and the pressure cell were then pressurized simultaneously to 80 bar and 86 bar respectively after the pressures on the water side and co2 side both reached equilibrium the valve on the co2 line was opened and the co2 and water pumps were simultaneously initiated to run at desired volumetric flowrates each with an accuracy of 0 3 of the set flow rate the instantaneous phase configuration as co2 infiltrates into the water saturated micromodel was imaged using the epi fluorescence microscopy technique as illustrated in fig 3 a led light source thorlabs m385lp1 with a nominal wavelength of 385nm and a full width at half maximum of 12nm filtered by a bandpass filter filter 2 semrock brightline ff01 379 34 25 was used to excite the coumarin 153 dye in the co2 phase the fluorescence emitted from the dye was passed through a dichroic mirror and a λ 445 20nm bandpass filter filter 3 semrock brightline ff01 445 40 25 and focused by a long distance microscope objective infinity photo optical company k2 distamax onto the detector of a 4megapixel 12 bit high speed cmos camera phantom v641 with this imaging setup the resultant magnification and spatial resolution are 2 9 and 3 4μm respectively and the field of view was approximately 8 8mm 5 5mm which is sufficient to cover the entire porous section of the micromodel as indicated by the green region in fig 1 fluorescence images were captured at 500hz or 1000hz depending on the flow speed for each specific experiment additional details of this experimental approach can be found in kazemifar et al 2015 3 numerical methods 3 1 color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model there are essentially four basic lb multiphase models namely the color fluid model gunstensen et al 1991 the shan chen model shan and chen 1993 the free energy model swift et al 1996 and the mean field theory model he et al 1998 readers are referred to huang et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 for extensive reviews of these lbm multiphase models among these models the color fluid model is particularly popular for immiscible fluid flow in porous media with a high viscosity ratio owing to its ability to adjust surface tension and viscosity independently and maintain a relatively sharp interface between multiple fluids in this work we developed a variant of the color fluid model based on the work of tolke et al 2006 2002 the primary variables in lbm are the particle distribution function pdf in this model each fluid component is represented by its own pdf the d3q19 qian et al 1992 multiple relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann equation lbe d humires 2002 lallemand and luo 2000 is used to solve the navier stokes equations for each fluid component the main features of the color fluid model include that the phase separation is accomplished via a recoloring step independent of the surface tension and the surface tension effect is modeled by altering stress related second order equilibrium moments in the mrt operator as suggested in ref tolke et al 2006 a detailed description of the model is given in appendix a as mentioned in section 1 the computational cost for dns of multiphase flow in porous media is very high and requires a high performance parallel code we developed and optimized a portable lbm code which leverages the computing power of conventional cpu clusters as well as new architectures such as gpus and intel xeon phi processors see appendix b a stationary bubble test and a dynamical capillary rise test were performed to validate the model and the code results are in appendix c good agreements are found between the simulation results and the analytical solutions 3 2 simulation setup and procedure 3 2 1 computational domain initial conditions and boundary conditions as mentioned previously the depth of the micromodel used in the experiments is 30μm which is comparable with the average pore diameter of 48μm as well as the minimum throat size of 12μm therefore either 3d simulation or 2d simulation with modifications to account for the finite depth of the micromodel is required ferrari et al 2015 we performed 3d simulations to avoid the approximations inherent to 2d simulations a 3d optical confocal scan of the fabricated micromodel was performed to obtain the real geometry of the micromodel for use in the simulations to ensure that the computational domain reflects the actual pore structure of the experiments including any small irregularities that occur during fabrication particularly the finite resolution of the fabrication process itself the original scan resolution was 0 63μm to reduce computation cost the simulations were performed on a resized image of the original scan with grid resolution of 2 7μm as shown in fig 1 the inlet and outlet consist of two small holes at the two ends of the micromodel with two large triangular buffer zones at the entry and exit the micromodel is initially saturated with water and co2 is injected through the left injection hole and hence the co2 plume front does not necessarily reach the porous part of the micromodel uniformly to simulate the complete injection and outflow zone requires a larger spatial domain and significantly more computation cost moreover uncertainties still exist near the injection and outflow holes in the following simulations we replaced the triangular buffer zones at both ends with a rectangular buffer zone with 15 grids in the flow direction carbon dioxide is then uniformly distributed in the inlet buffer zone and water fills the rest of the void space in the computational domain at the beginning of the simulation the velocity field at the inlet boundary is assigned the analytical solution of single phase flow in a rectangular straight duct at the inlet a velocity boundary condition ladd 1994 is applied to the non wetting phase and a no flow condition bounce back is applied to the wetting phase preventing it from entering or existing the inlet unlike many previous studies for which the simulation ends once the invading fluid breaks through the outlet boundary or the invading fluid is not allowed to exit the outlet boundary ferrari et al 2015 liu et al 2014 we performed full drainage simulations until approximate steady state in the invasion pattern was reached as will be shown later in fig 4 due to the repeating pattern used in the micromodel injected co2 flows in preferential pathways and hence there can be a breakthrough to the outlet when only a small portion of the micromodel is invaded at the outlet a constant pressure boundary condition hecht and harting 2010 zou and he 1997 is applied to both the non wetting and wetting phase fluids and a neumann zero gradient boundary condition is applied to the order parameter to allow the interface to freely exit the outlet for the non slip solid walls the bounceback boundary condition is applied which is one of the main advantages of lbm chen and doolen 1998 as the scheme is extremely efficient for complex geometries the contact angle is modeled by assigning the value of the order parameter on the solid boundary nodes via eq a 15 considering the symmetric nature of the micromodel gravity is not considered only the top half half depth of the domain is simulated to reduce computation cost and a symmetry boundary condition is applied on the bottom of the simulation domain which is the mid plane of the physical domain the final computational grid has 1953 grids in the transverse direction 2604 grids in the flow direction and 7 grids in the half depth which gives a total of 1953 bf 1 2604 bf 2 7 grids where bf 1 18 and bf 2 18 represent the buffer layers at the inlet and outlet respectively the grid number along the depth direction takes account of the halfway bounce back nonslip wall condition on the top nodes where the physical boundary is halfway between the solid nodes and fluid nodes he et al 1997 and the symmetry boundary condition on the bottom nodes where the physical boundary is on the boundary nodes each simulation was executed for at least one pore volume pv injection to ensure that approximate steady state was reached 3 2 2 parameters in order to perform a rigorous comparison between experiment and simulation for multiphase flow in porous media one must match the viscosity ratio and density ratio between the different fluids in addition to the contact angle the reynolds number re and the capillary number ca the capillary and bulk reynolds numbers based on the non wetting phase are defined as 1 c a μ nw v ϕ σ cos θ 2 r e ρ nw v d ϕ μ nw where μ nw is the dynamic viscosity of the non wetting phase σ is the surface tension θ is the contact angle ϕ is the porosity of the micromodel v is the average inlet velocity and d is the average pore diameter by examining eqs 1 and 2 if re phys re lat and ca phys ca lat the fluid properties in the lattice system must obey the following relationship 3 μ n w p h y s 2 ρ n w p h y s σ p h y s d p h y s μ n w l a t 2 ρ n w l a t σ l a t d l a t where subscript lat denotes lattice units and subscript phys denotes physical units the above result is consistent with zacharoudiou and boek 2016 who proposed to use ohnesorge number oh when ca and re both need to be matched 4 o h μ n w ρ n w σ d the fluid properties and the micromodel geometry are fixed while only the flow rate is changed between different experiments therefore oh which is only related to the fluid properties and the geometry is a constant number throughout all the experiments and simulations the fluid properties used in the experiment are presented in table 1 the oh in the experiment is 2 177 10 3 the choice of the parameters used in the lb simulation is restricted by numerical stability and computation cost the density in lb simulation is usually set to unity and one can only adjust surface tension viscosity and the gird resolution which is related to the absolute value of d in the lattice space due to the high computation cost of direct numerical simulation in porous media one must choose a grid resolution that is sufficient high to resolve the interface at pore space while maintaining acceptable computation cost the grid used in this work has a resolution of 2 7 μm and the average pore diameter d in the lattice space is 17 6 which is sufficient to resolve the fluid interface then in order to match the oh in the experiment the value of ν n w l a t σ l a t in lattice space has to be 0 00913 for example if we let σ lat 0 035 then ν nw lat is 0 0017 although the simulation is unstable using this parameter set due to the stability issues with the current formulation of the lb color fluid model there is an upper limit for the surface tension and a lower limit for the viscosity to maintain stable simulations ahrenholz et al 2008 further considering the presence of complex solid surfaces and active driving force applied to the fluids for simulation of fluid displacement in porous media the present model simply cannot match the oh in the experiment and one must significantly increase the viscosity in the lattice space to ensure stable simulation in real world applications of flow in porous media the bulk re is usually very small and the inertial effects can be ignored which is widely accepted in the literature in such case one only needs to match ca viscosity ratio and the contact angle and the above approach i e increasing the absolute value of fluid viscosity is a relatively common practice in lbm simulations of multiphase flow in porous media ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 particularly when the viscosity of one fluid phase is rather small as is the case for co2 it s worth noting that for oil and brine displacement simulation as the viscosity of oil is two orders of magnitude larger than the liquid co2 one can always match the exact oh of experiment in lb simulation if needed the fluid property parameters in the lattice system and its corresponding parameters in the physical system as well as the real experiment parameters are shown in table 1 the viscosities in the simulations are 5 3 times the corresponding viscosities in the experiment and the density ratio is set to be 1 because the present form of the color fluid lb model cannot accurately model density contrasts huang et al 2013 the oh is 2 177 10 3 in the experiment and 1 162 10 2 in the simulation 5 3 times greater than the experiment nevertheless the viscosity ratio and contact angle in the simulations match those of the experiments due to the increased viscosity in the simulation the re in the simulation is 28 times smaller than the experiment at the same ca the injection velocity can be easily derived from ca combined with fluid properties listed in table 1 4 results 4 1 effect of capillary number based on the results from the experiments and simulations at least one pv of injection was required to reach approximately steady state in contrast to real rock samples where the porosity is typically smaller than 30 the porosity of the 2d micromodel is 51 in order to reduce the likelihood of flow blockage in the experiments significantly more iterations were required to inject a unit pv fluid into the micromodel compared with lower porosity porous media furthermore the 5 3 times higher viscosities required to ensure stable simulations further reduces the injection rate at the same ca at low ca the computational cost to inject a unit pv fluid could be prohibitively high because of the small injection rate for instance the simulation at ca 2 6 10 5 required 26 million iterations to inject one pv of co2 which required approximate three days of computing time on 8 of the latest intel xeon phi 7250 processors as a result the lowest ca reached in the simulations was ca 2 6 10 5 before presenting comparison between the experiments and simulations the dynamic co2 invasion patterns obtained from the simulation are used to discuss some of their key distinguishing features of the co2 invasion patterns fig 4 shows the dynamic invasion patterns of two simulations denoted by s1 ca 2 6 10 5 re 0 19 and s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 as mentioned in section 2 the mask used to fabricate the micromodel is produced by stitching together 9 unit heterogeneous porous sections as a result some periodic invasion patterns inevitably exist the simulations show that three primary co2 pathways exist demarcated by ellipses resulting in the early breakthrough of the co2 in s3 the breakthrough occurs after about 0 28pv injection while the breakthrough occurs after 0 27pv injection in s1 furthermore there are secondary streamwise co2 pathways that developed in s3 demarcated by rectangles as injection continues these secondary co2 pathways in s3 invade significant portions of the micromodel and eventually reach the outlet in s1 as ca is lower capillary fingering results in more lateral invasions around the primary co2 pathways and the primary co2 pathways in s1 look slightly wider than the primary co2 pathways in s3 however due to the lack of secondary co2 pathways in s1 the overall co2 saturation in s1 is smaller than s3 during the entire injection process fig 5 compares invasion patterns obtained from simulations with those from experiments at approximately steady state and for a similar ca range e1 ca 0 5 10 5 re 1 0 e2 ca 1 0 10 5 re 2 1 and e3 ca 2 6 10 5 re 5 4 denote the experimental results s1 ca 2 6 10 5 re 0 19 s2 ca 3 6 10 5 re 0 26 and s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 denote the simulation results the experimental and the simulation results show similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as the flow rate increases the secondary co2 pathways have fully developed in both e3 and s3 demarcated by ellipses while they are completely or partially suppressed in e1 e2 s1 and s2 which prevents invasion into significant portions of the micromodel and results in lower co2 saturation compared with e3 and s3 from e2 and s2 a few large uninvaded areas are readily evident and demarcated by rectangles these areas further propagate upstream in e1 and s1 as shown in fig 5 this phenomena is likely due to the fact that the three primary co2 pathways break through early before the fingers surrounding the primary co2 pathways have fully developed the development of these lateral fingers is mainly affected by the local pressure difference between co2 and water in the individual pore throats after breakthrough the pressure within the co2 releases at the outlet which causes significant reduction of the pressure across the micromodel as shown in fig 6 the reduced pressure within co2 may not be sufficient to overcome the capillary pressure required to develop lateral fingers after breakthrough in e1 as the ca is the smallest more capillary fingering patterns are evident compared to the s1 case the main discrepancy found in the comparison between the experimental and simulation results is that the secondary co2 pathways in the simulation developed at a much higher ca s3 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 compared to the experiments e3 ca 2 6 10 5 re 5 4 of particular importance the use of a 5 3 times increased viscosity in the simulations significantly reduces the inertial effect compared with the experiment at the same ca and is likely responsible for this behavior the bulk average re in s1 s2 and s3 are 0 19 0 26 and 0 76 respectively while the bulk re in e1 e2 and e3 are 1 0 2 1 and 5 4 respectively moreover the local re in certain pore throats in e3 can be much larger than the bulk value 5 4 particularly during haines jump events armstrong et al 2014 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 kazemifar et al 2016 wherein the local re can be 10 50 times larger than the bulk re kazemifar et al 2016 as a result inertial effects are likely significant during such events although the re in s3 is still much smaller than e3 the ca of s3 is four times larger than that of e3 the invasion pattern is determined by the competition among the capillary viscous and inertial forces thus direct comparison between the experiments and simulations is not possible if inertial effects are considered because of the increased absolute viscosity in the simulations parametric study of the viscosity in the simulation however can be used to isolate the importance of inertial effects and study their impact on the development of secondary co2 pathways in the next section the simulation parameters in table 1 are maintained except that the absolute viscosity in the simulations is increased to study the inertial effect at the same ca 4 2 effect of reynolds number based on the results in figs 4 and 5 as discussed above we hypothesize that the secondary co2 pathways in s1 are suppressed due to the use of higher absolute viscosity in the simulations compared to the experiments therefore by increasing the absolute viscosity maintaining the ca surface tension contact angle and m the same which lowers the re and thus increases the effect of viscosity while simultaneously reducing the inertial effect the development of secondary co2 pathways may be suppressed if the above hypothesis is true in the s3 simulation ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 76 the viscosity is 5 3 times larger than the physical viscosity of the liquid co2 and water in the experiments we further increase the viscosity used in this simulation by 6 times denoted as simulation s3 1 ca 10 5 10 5 re 0 021 while all other parameters remain unchanged fig 7 shows the invasion patterns of s3 and s3 1 after 0 09 0 14 and 0 20pv injection these results clearly show that the secondary co2 pathways demarcated with ellipses noted in s3 in this figure are suppressed in s3 1 one may suspect that use of higher viscosity could increase the inlet pressure and thus influence the resulting invasion patterns however as the ca and the surface tension remain unchanged the flow rate decreases proportionally as the viscosity is increased in this regard the pressure drop versus injected co2 volume under increased absolute viscosity s3 1 should be close to the original simulation s3 fig 8 shows that the pressure drop as a function of injected co2 volume of s3 and s3 1 are indeed very close particularly during the early stage when the invasion patterns of the two cases are similar the pressure distribution of the non wetting phase after 0 09 0 14 and 0 20pv injection are plotted in fig 9 the two secondary co2 pathways in the upper domain in s3 developed between 0 09pv injection and 0 14pv injection we do not see significant difference of pressure distribution between s3 and s3 1 at 0 09pv injection in fig 9 thus the main contributor to the development of the secondary co2 pathways is likely inertial effects when the invading fluid has penetrated a pore throat and a new pore body is being invaded the damping of the fluid inertia at different re is different even though the surrounding pressure is the same which could result in the alteration of flow pathways this observation is consistent with ferrari and lunati 2014 who used direct numerical simulation of a network model to demonstrate that increasing inertial effects leads to different fluid distributions by influencing the selection of the next pore to be invaded our simulations reflect the same phenomena but in a more realistic and complex porous system 5 conclusions in this study we developed a high performance lbm code based on a variant of the color fluid multiphase lb model and applied the code to simulate liquid co2 displacing water in a series of experiments in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel at reservoir pressure conditions our major contributions are summarized as follows 1 lbm simulations and experiments of liquid co2 displacing water in a 2d heterogeneous micromodel inspired by real rock structures at reservoir pressure conditions were performed and compared for the first time 2 the simulations reproduce qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns as ca increases 3 the major discrepancy between experiments and simulations is the development of secondary co2 pathways which occur at a much higher ca in the simulations compared to the experiments 4 further investigation of viscosity effects reveals that the development of the secondary co2 pathways is related to inertial effects which are suppressed in the simulations because numerical stability issues required the fluids in the simulation to have larger absolute viscosity than the fluids used in the experiments of particular importance in the present work inertial effects are usually assumed negligible in multiphase flow through real porous media as the bulk reynolds number re based on the average flow velocity is very small under this assumption the fluid displacement is presumed to be dominated by capillary and viscous forces meaning that the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio m should be the only controlling parameters this presumption is the basis for the use of proxy fluids in both numerical simulations and experiments where ca and m are matched but not re or any of the absolute physical properties of the fluid viscosity and density for example however as pointed out by several recent studies armstrong et al 2014 berg et al 2013 ferrari and lunati 2014 haines 1930 moebius and or 2012 zacharoudiou and boek 2016 inertial effects in fluid displacement dynamics particularly during localized haines jump events where the local pore velocity and thus the local re can be 10 50 times larger than the bulk kazemifar et al 2016 can have significant impact on the fluid invasion patterns in porous media therefore the use of proxy fluids solely based on ca and m in numerical simulations and experiments must be done with caution the present experiments employ high pressure to replicate co2 and water properties under the reservoir pressure conditions instead of using proxy fluids as a result these experiments in the 2d heterogeneous micromodel more closely represent the real reservoir situation and can thus be a better benchmark for the validation of numerical methods for such flow scenarios while it is possible to fully match the absolute parameters in the lbm simulation of oil and water ramstad et al 2012 both of which are much more viscous than liquid or supercritical co2 matching the absolute parameters for the co2 and water combination is much more difficult as shown in eqs a 14 a 15 and a 12 in appendix a the color gradient which is used to implement surface tension effects in the color fluid lbm model between the solid boundary nodes and the non wetting phase nodes is very large while it is much smaller between the solid boundary nodes and the wetting phase nodes this causes large spurious velocity in the non wetting phase near non flat solid walls and three phase solid water co2 contact lines where the magnitude of the spurious currents is proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the viscosity connington and lee 2012 in lbm simulation of oil and water these spurious currents are suppressed in the more viscous non wetting oil phase however in the liquid co2 and water flow simulation these spurious currents are amplified in the less viscous non wetting phase of liquid co2 as a result the common practice in lbm simulation of multiphase flow is to significantly increase the absolute viscosity values to reduce spurious velocity and improve numerical stability ahrenholz et al 2008 jiang and tsuji 2014 yamabe et al 2014 particularly when the viscosity of one fluid phase co2 herein is very small by increasing the absolute viscosity of the fluids by a factor of 5 3 we achieved stable simulations that reproduced qualitatively similar trends of changes in invasion patterns with increasing ca however as demonstrated herein the simulations required a much larger ca to mimic the secondary co2 flow pathways that are a prevalent feature in the experiments as a result the final co2 distribution between the simulations and experiments were quite different at the same ca the parametric study of the absolute viscosity effect at the same ca identified that the development of these secondary co2 pathways is directly related to inertial effects many more advanced and possibly more complex lbm multiphase models have been developed fakhari and bolster 2017 liu et al 2015 that have more favorable stability properties so that lower viscosity fluids can be simulated in the past due to the lack of computing power relatively simple lbm formulations have been favored for pore scale dns however some of these newer lbm models may enable the use of fully matched physical parameters in simulations although they are more computationally demanding finally owing to the improved stability in advanced models larger time steps could be used in simulations which would reduce the overall iterations we are currently working to implement these new models and investigate their ability to more exactly reproduce the experimental results reported herein acknowledgements this work was supported as part of

original color fluid lattice boltzmann multiphase model gunstensen et al 1991 was introduced in the 1990s we developed a variant of the color fluid lb multiphase model based on the work of tolke et al

15 ϕ cos θ liu et al 2012 proposed a color fluid model based on the continuum surface force csf concept by transforming the perturbation operator ω i 2 in liu s model for the fluid mixture to the moment space in the mrt framework via the transformation matrix m same terms in eq a 12 can be obtained therefore the present model can also be seen as the mrt version of liu s model a higher order isotropic scheme sbragaglia et al 2007 for computing the color gradient instead of eq a 14 is available to improve numerical accuracy and stability at the cost of involving more nearby nodes for flow in porous media we employ eq a 14 considering the computation cost and complexity of the geometry to account for unequal viscosities of the two fluids a harmonic mean is used to determine the viscosity of the bulk fluid mixture liu et al 2014 zu and he 2013 a 16 1 μ 1 ϕ 2 μ r 1 ϕ 2 μ b after the collision step for the bulk fluid mixture in the mrt framework as shown in eq a 5 we obtained the post collision pdfs of the fluid mixture f i p o s t the recoloring operator ω i s 3 redistributes the mass distributions of fluid r and fluid b in a way so that the inner product of the color gradient c and momentum of fluid r is maximized tolke et al 2006 in this work we employ the recoloring scheme given in tolke et al 2002 in summary two separate groups of particle distribution functions represent the binary fluids and follow the traditional collision streaming iteration of lbm the surface tension effects are modeled via adding additional terms in the stress related equilibrium moments in the mrt collision framework which are based on the surface tension and color gradient as shown in eq a 12 after the mrt collision step the recoloring scheme is applied to separate the two fluids the streaming step streams the post collision pdfs to nearby lattice nodes the order parameter ϕ and color gradient c is then updated to be used in the next collision streaming iteration the bulk fluid mixture pdfs f i x t where f i x t f i r x t f i b x t are only used in the collision step and need not to be stored one of the key features of the color fluid model is that phase separation is via a recoloring step independent of the surface tension while in the shan chen lb multiphase model shan and chen 1993 phase separation is via interaction potential proportional to the surface tension to prevent different fluids from mixing with each other as a result the interface thickness in the shan chen model is significantly larger except for very large surface tension and different phases are not strictly immiscible also the surface tension effect in the color fluid model is modeled by altering the stress related second order equilibrium moments as shown in eq a 12 while the zero and first order moments ρ j x j y and j z remain unchanged and conserved in contrast the shan chen model does not locally conserve momentum shan and chen 1993 due to the interaction potential force directly applied to the fluid and significant artificial bulk density pressure fluctuation near the solid fluid interfaces can be observed for non neutral wetting fluids chen et al 2015 appendix b code implementation modern manycore processors such as gpus graphical processing units and intel xeon phi processors are developing rapidly and greatly boost computing power these processors not only provide much higher flops floating point operations per second but also much higher memory bandwidth compared with traditional cpu one of the most attractive features of the lbm is that it is explicit in time has nearest neighbor communication and the computational effort is in the collision step which is localized at a grid node for these reasons the lbm is well suited for manycore processors which require a higher degree of explicit parallelism moreover as shown in eq a 5 the particle distribution functions in the d3q19 lb model have 19 lattice velocities and 18 of them move to adjacent nodes during each iteration as a result the data movement in the lbm is much more intensive than for traditional cfd given the current state of computational hardware in particular the relative speed and capacity of processors and memory the lbm is a memory bound numerical method liu et al 2016 the high memory bandwidth provided by gpus or intel xeon phi processors greatly benefits the lbm for the past decade many lbm codes have been developed to utilize nvidia gpu acceleration jiang and tsuji 2014 mattila et al 2016 mcclure et al 2014 tölke and krafczyk 2008 these codes must rely on the low level cuda programming language in recent years other manycore processors such as the intel xeon phi processors have also been adopted for lbm high performance computing rosales 2013 due to the rapid development of modern processors low level cuda code may not be a good choice for maintaining a portable code as modern compilers become more and more mature a portable code using hybrid mpi openmp or mpi openacc which relies on the compiler for low level implementation could be quite attractive as one may run the same code on different platforms ranging from every day laptops to high end supercomputers equipped with manycore processors we developed and optimized a portable lattice boltzmann code mf lbm for numerical simulation of flow in porous media and microfluidics the code employs a mpi openmp openacc hybrid programming model so that it can run on either intel xeon phi processors or nvidia gpus as mentioned above the lbm is a memory bound numerical method due to the streaming of 18 particle distribution functions pdfs to the adjacent nodes the traditional streaming method requires redundant storage of the pdfs in order to avoid data dependency during the streaming step we adopt the aa pattern streaming method bailey et al 2009 to significantly reduce memory access and memory consumption this method does not need the redundant storage of the pdfs and stores pdfs at opposite directions at different steps based on the access pattern of the streaming step moreover as the pdfs are stored at opposite directions the bounce back nonslip boundary condition which simply reverses the directions of pdfs at solid nodes is carried out by default for all nodes the mrt collision term in eq a 5 is also carried out for all nodes but only the fluid nodes are updated using a fluid node indicator in such case conditional non slip wall boundary treatment can be avoided which significantly increases the performance on manycore processors the structure of arrays soa data format is used to achieve coalesced memory access and maximize vectorization the code achieves up to 492 mlups million lattice update per second by a single intel xeon phi 7250 knl processor towns et al 2014 using double precision for multiphase flow simulation on a 240 240 240 grid appendix c model and code validations one of the features of the present color fluid model is that the surface tension can be determined analytically and can be used as a direct input parameter liu et al 2012 tolke et al 2006 we first validated the code via the test of the laplace law with a stationary bubble to compare the computed surface tension value with the theoretical value a red spherical bubble is initially located at the center of a blue fluid domain with 120 120 120 lattice cells periodic boundary conditions are applied to the domain boundaries the pressure difference δp across the bubble interface can be determined by the young laplace equation c 1 δ p 2 σ r where r is the radius of the bubble the density ratio of the fluids is set to unity for all simulations while the viscosity ratio surface tension value and the radius of the bubble vary the results are presented in table c 2 for simplicity the values presented in this section are all in lattice unit we can see that the relative error of the surface tension increases as the bubble radius decreases or the viscosity ratio m ν b ν r increases which is consistent with results reported in tölke et al 2013 overall the present model recovers the laplace law and the obtained surface tension value is sufficiently accurate compared with theoretical value in order to further validate the code in a more realistic situation we performed three dimensional dynamic capillary rise test a cylindrical tube is initially filled with wetting fluid the outlet of the tube is connected to a wetting fluid reservoir with constant pressure p out while the inlet is connected to a non wetting fluid reservoir with constant pressure p in if the pressure difference δp p in p out is sufficient high the non wetting fluid will overcomes the capillary pressure p c and displace the wetting fluid in the tube as shown in fig c 10 if gravity and inertial effects are neglected the interface position can then be determined via the washburn equation washburn 1921 c 2a z t r 2 δ p p c 8 μ w l t i f

1662,most recent research on hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media has focused on whole domain dispersion while other research is largely on laboratory scale dispersion this work focuses on the contribution of a single block in a numerical model to dispersion variability of fluid velocity and concentration within a block is not resolved and the combined spreading effect is approximated using resolved quantities and macroscopic parameters this applies whether the formation is modeled as homogeneous or discretized into homogeneous blocks but the emphasis here being on the latter the process of dispersion is typically described through the fickian model i e the dispersive flux is proportional to the gradient of the resolved concentration commonly with the scheidegger parameterization which is a particular way to compute the dispersion coefficients utilizing dispersivity coefficients although such parameterization is by far the most commonly used in solute transport applications its validity has been questioned here our goal is to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and mass transfer limitations on block scale longitudinal dispersion and to evaluate under which conditions the scheidegger parameterization is valid we compute the relaxation time or memory of the system changes in time with periods larger than the relaxation time are gradually leading to a condition of local equilibrium under which dispersion is fickian the method we use requires the solution of a steady state advection dispersion equation and thus is computationally efficient and applicable to any heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k field without requiring statistical or structural assumptions the method was validated by comparing with other approaches such as the moment analysis and the first order perturbation method we investigate the impact of heterogeneity both in degree and structure on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and then discuss the role of local dispersion and mass transfer limitations i e the exchange of mass between the permeable matrix and the low permeability inclusions we illustrate the physical meaning of the method and we show how the block longitudinal dispersivity approaches under certain conditions the scheidegger limit at large péclet numbers lastly we discuss the potential and limitations of the method to accurately describe dispersion in solute transport applications in heterogeneous aquifers keywords longitudinal dispersion numerical models solute transport heterogeneity and scale 1 introduction accurate prediction of solute transport spreading and mixing is crucial for safe and reliable subsurface management applications the fundamental processes that control flow and solute transport in geologic formations have been studied extensively both in the laboratory and through mathematical analysis for example in the transport of a conservative solute subject to advection and molecular diffusion at the pore scale the solute concentration satisfies an advection diffusion equation the velocity satisfies the stokes i e low reynolds number hydrodynamics equation and diffusion follows fick s law the number of pore scale studies of solute transport has dramatically increased in recent years and these investigations have certainly contributed to improve our understanding of solute transport in porous media e g acharya et al 2007 tartakovsky et al 2009 yoon et al 2012 icardi et al 2014 rolle and kitanidis 2014 meyer and bijeljic 2016 however in hydrogeologic applications solute transport is still a formidable challenge because modeling is done at much larger scales since geologic media exhibit heterogeneity at multiple scales the variability of physical and chemical properties results in complex transport behaviors neuman 1990 in current practice flow and transport simulations are generally performed for a homogeneous medium the approach preferred in analytical methods or what effectively is spatially distributed homogeneous blocks the approach followed in finite element and finite volume methods the process of representing quantitatively the effect of unresolved variability in terms of resolved quantities is the problem of parameterization for the flow problem darcy s law is used meaning the velocity is proportional to hydraulic head gradient and its validity is seldom disputed for solute transport the effect of unresolved velocity in combination with unresolved concentration is much more difficult to capture silliman and simpson 1987 neuman and zhang 1990 adams and gelhar 1992 levy and berkowitz 2003 moroni et al 2007 however this effect is quite pronounced when dealing with plumes hundreds of meters long and with grid spacing of the order of meters or more in practice the most widely used dispersion modeling approach is the fickian model with scheidegger parameterization scheidegger 1954 where dispersion coefficients are computed from constant dispersivity coefficients considered medium properties and independent of molecular diffusion and flow velocity the scheidegger parameterization was originally justified based on a random walk model dominated by advection in macroscopically homogeneous media this approach has been the subject of intense scrutiny 2 overview of objectives and approach much work has been done on dispersion in the last thirty years which makes it imperative to explain our perspective and our approach before we embark on the analysis or show any results consider a geologic formation that is heterogeneous at all scales this is modeled using a numerical model that subdivides the domain under study on the basis of a numerical grid to fix ideas consider that we divide the domain into blocks each of which is modeled as a continuum with appropriate properties for example a block consisting of potentially different sedimentary facies is modeled as a uniform block subject to darcy s law with certain conductivity parameters in principle there is a fine scale description represented by a velocity that varies at the scale of micrometers and a coarse scale description represented by a specific discharge that varies at the scale of the grid which may be of the order of meters the objective is that the two descriptions should yield the same results at the scale of variability captured by the grid in other words whether one resolves the fine scale variability and solves the navier stokes and advection diffusion equations or one solves the much simpler groundwater flow and transport problems with a homogeneous block one would obtain the same results after averaging the fine scale result to the scale of the grid what we just described is the basic idea underlying the continuum approach this approach works well in making the transition from the molecular scale to the fluid mechanical scale where for example the fine scale may represent a very large number of interacting water molecules shifting position and the macroscopic scale is a uniform fluid with given density and viscosity in hydrogeology we are faced with a similar problem but we must deal with heterogeneity at many scales from the scale of a pore to that of a formation the practical solution already mentioned is to resolve larger scale variability through a grid and apply the continuum approach to each block but there are persistent challenges is there a manageable coarse scale model under what conditions is this model appropriate and what error is to be expected from its application the problem we will address is that of dispersion of conservative nonreactive solutes and how to parameterize it in the context of a numerical model the majority of papers on dispersion have examined the problem of whole domain dispersion in formations with some regularity such as random media gelhar 1993 dagan 1989 rubin 2003 as it would apply in the transport of a large plume only a few works dagan 1994 rubin et al 1999 wang and kitanidis 1999 rubin et al 2003 dentz and de barros 2013 de barros and dentz 2016 have studied the problem of what dispersion coefficients to assign to blocks in a numerical model and notable examples that have dealt with such problem include the approach developed by rubin et al 1999 as well as the recent work by de barros and dentz 2016 the problem of block scale dispersion is also the main focus of this study which has the specific objectives of i explaining and visualizing how block scale longitudinal dispersion originates from the velocity and concentration fluctuations within the block ii investigating the interplay between advection and diffusive mass transfer rate for a range of flow velocities and permeability contrasts common in hydrogeologic applications iii analyzing under what conditions the common scheidegger method of describing dispersion is valid and iv perform error quantification for this parameterization while previous studies have made assumptions regarding the structure such as periodic or stationary we present a method of analysis that does not require a specific structure for the formation as a whole or even for the individual block and while much of recently published work deals with non equilibrium conditions and non fickian transport dentz et al 2011 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 this work focuses on the fickian model when we say fickian we mean at the scale of a block and we do not imply macroscopically homogeneous media like stationary conductivity or gaussian shaped plumes one can actually model irregular plumes by resolving heterogeneity at the scale of a grid chosen for the needs of a particular application the proposed approach is in the spirit of the times which is to recognize the importance of heterogeneity and the ability to better resolve heterogeneity thanks to technological trends like faster computations better sensing technologies and the ability to invert data to estimate parameters e g dogan et al 2014 hochstetler et al 2016 lee et al 2016 we will argue that as we can deal with increasingly finer grid the fickian model becomes a more accurate representation of transport because the key requirement that of local equilibrium is better met local equilibrium implies conditions sufficiently independent from an external perturbation with gradual changes and a dynamic balance between velocity variability causing concentration fluctuations and the opposing effect of diffusion there have been many computational studies on dispersion e g scheibe and cole 1994 fernàndez garcia and gómez hernández 2007 bijeljic et al 2013a the majority of them particularly the most recent and most elaborate and comprehensive of them have been performed in a lagrangian framework and with purpose of describing the early and late behavior of dispersion in large statistically homogeneous formations the lagrangian perspective focuses on following particles or the statistics of particles as they move in time and space landmarks in the development of this approach to study dispersion include taylor 1922 scheidegger 1954 and dagan 1984 it appears that most informed hydrogeologists consider the lagrangian perspective as the most natural and useful approach for conceptualization and analysis of dispersion by contrast this is a computational study based on a theory developed in an eulerian framework which focuses on computing the contribution of a block to dispersive transport important steps in the development of this approach were bensoussan et al 1978 and brenner 1980 who considered transport in an idealized periodic medium and evaluated dispersion coefficients that are properties of the formation however all computations boil down to solving a boundary value problem in one block because of their emphasis on an idealized case and their heavily mathematical treatment these works did not attract much attention in the hydrogeologic literature with a few notable exceptions bourgeat et al 1988 plumb and whitaker 1988 kitanidis 1992 the approach of gelhar and axness 1982 who focused on unbounded domains stationary media and analytic methods is also related to the same general methodology in this study we adopt an eulerian approach which is intuitively appealing and easy to explain at least with respect to the basic ideas instead of following particles which enter and exit the block of interest we focus on the velocity inside the block the velocity consists of the mean plus fluctuations about the mean the effect of the mean velocity is captured by advective transport the fluctuations have zero mean but if there is a concentration gradient these zero mean velocity fluctuations will have a net effect they will transport mass downgradient in what is known as dispersive transport furthermore this transport is proportional to the concentration gradient which is the essence of fickian transport this is the essence of the analysis we carry out in the next section the analysis is along lines similar to those of previous eulerian theories but with some important differences we focus on a single block and make no assumptions about structure of heterogeneity outside of the block this means that there is an indeterminacy from unknown boundary conditions or the interaction with surrounding blocks that in previous studies was assumed to vanish under restrictive conditions about structure our approach is not to make such assumptions but instead to perform uncertainty quantification we show that the effect is minor for large velocity cases for which dispersion is important one computational advantage of the eulerian approach for the study of dispersion is that its application requires the solution of steady transport problems unlike the lagrangian approach the results do not depend on initial concentration but the velocity field and the local diffusion dispersion coefficients however the theory assumes that conditions approach a state of local equilibrium and in this paper we discuss what local equilibrium means and examine the question of how rapidly local equilibrium can be achieved 3 method a method to compute dispersion coefficients for a heterogeneous block starting from three dimensional pore scale stokes flow and advection diffusion has been presented in kitanidis 2017 however solving this problem in a block of the order of 1m3 would require a tremendous computational effort and exorbitant amounts of information on the geometry of pore space for example existing works such as bijeljic et al 2013b are limited to a block of the order of 1cm3 so direct numerical simulation is postponed for future investigation here we will derive the same result starting from the continuum scale models of darcy flow and advection dispersion with local coefficients under the continuity condition q 0 the advection dispersion equation that is commonly used to model transport in porous media is 1 θ c t q c θ d local c 0 where c is the point concentration in the continuum scale θ is the porosity q is the darcy velocity i e specific discharge l t and d local is the local dispersion tensor l 2 t let ω be the heterogeneous block for which we want to compute the effective value of hydrodynamic dispersion to keep the analysis simple we will consider that θ is constant over this block focusing on variability of specific discharge caused by variability in hydraulic conductivity starting from eq 1 the objective is to show that as assumed in numerical models the equation of mass conservation over the block ω is given by 2 ω c t u c d ω c d v 0 where c u and d ω are the resolved large scale concentration linear velocity l t and block effective dispersion tensor l 2 t respectively the finer the volume ω is the better the fickian model in eq 2 predicts using reynolds decomposition e g beckie 1998 kapoor and gelhar 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1997 the actual concentration c t x y z that satisfies the fine scale transport equation eq 1 can be modeled as consisting of two components 3 c t x y z c t x y z c t x y z where c is the resolved concentration at the scale of ω and c is the fluctuation around c so that ω c d v 0 the concentration c represents the unresolved or subgrid variability under gradually varying conditions in space and time c varies gradually at the scale of ω while most of the variability of c is at scales smaller than the scale of the support volume so that any average of related quantities to c over ω is negligible similarly we represent u as 4 u t x y z u t x y z u t x y z where u is the average velocity at the scale ω and u is the velocity fluctuation about u as for the concentration fluctuation also the volume average of u is zero by substituting eqs 3 and 4 into the fine scale transport equation eq 1 we obtain 5 c t c t u c u c u c u c d local c d local c 0 integrating eq 5 over the block ω and considering that u and c are averaged out to be zero ω c t u c u c d local c θ d v can be neglected with a small loss of accuracy we eventually have 6 ω c t u c u c d local c d v 0 we will focus on how to represent the nonzero term u c which represents dispersive transport due to subgrid variability in terms of resolved variability and constituent parameters under the condition of gradual concentration changes the resolved concentration c within the block can be approximated as kitanidis 2017 7 c t x y z a a 1 x ū 1 t a 2 y ū 2 t a 3 z ū 3 t where a a 1 a 2 a 3 are constants this simplification reflects that the concentration c is varying in space in the smoothest fashion which is linear and satisfies the grid scale transport equation the slopes of the macroscopic concentration c are then the coefficients a 8 c c x c y c z a 1 a 2 a 3 considering the fine scale mass conservation eq 5 and substituting the approximate solution for c eq 7 we find that c satisfies 9 c t u c d local c a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 a 3 u 3 since slow changes are assumed we neglect c t focusing on the quasi steady condition we will discuss this issue in the next section because of the linearity of this equation the superposition principle holds meaning that the solution to eq 9 is given by 10 c f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 where each of the f terms satisfies 11 u f i d local f i u i for i 1 2 and 3 note that if f i satisfies this equation so does f i const but the solution must have zero mean since c has zero spatial average to finalize the solution appropriate boundary conditions must be used and this issue will be discussed in the next section the dispersive flux term u c in eq 6 is now written as 12 u c u 1 u 2 u 3 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 13 u 1 f 1 u 1 f 2 u 1 f 3 u 2 f 1 u 2 f 2 u 2 f 3 u 3 f 1 u 3 f 2 u 3 f 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 as a result the dispersion is fickian i e the dispersive flux is expressed as the product of second order tensor and the concentration gradient eq 8 cf bensoussan et al 1978 brenner 1980 plumb and whitaker 1988 kitanidis 1992 amaral souto and moyne 1997 thus fickian behavior follows from the state of local equilibrium which is the assumption we made in eq 7 upscaled effective dispersion coefficient over the block is given by 14 ω u c d v ω d ω c d v where the block scale dispersion tensor d ω is expressed as 15 d ω i j ω u i f j d v v ω the approach allows one to quantitatively assess the role of 1 structure of heterogeneity 2 degree of heterogeneity and 3 advection and local diffusion dispersion processes on block dispersion note that the proposed approach is applicable to any heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and only requires the steady state equations in eq 11 instead of solving the entire ade at the local scale if more than a single dispersion coefficient for grid blocks of a large model are considered the steady state equations are simply repeated efficiently for each individual grid block which can be accelerated further by using parallel programming and reusing preconditioner matrix though the approach can be used to compute all components of the tensor we will focus exclusively on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l the term also commonly denoted as d 11 or d xx requiring the computed f 1 from the solution of eq 11 4 computational experiments consider a block with intermixed regions of coarse and fine sand similar to the systems investigated previously in flow through laboratory experiments silliman and simpson 1987 silliman and caswell 1998 levy and berkowitz 2003 this is a quasi 2 d flow through chamber with dimensions of 0 86m 0 45m in the x and z directions respectively four different heterogeneity structures for conductivity k shown in fig 1 are considered to study the effect of spatial heterogeneity structure on the block effective dispersion over the entire flow through chamber each configuration fig 1 a d is filled with a homogeneous coarse sand with k 5 10 3 m s and several homogeneous low k rectangular inclusions with different lengths designed to occupy 16 of the domain while a sand with k 1 4 10 4 m s was used for the low permeability inclusions in the original experiment in the present work we computed results for four different k values 1 4 10 3 1 4 10 4 1 4 10 5 and 1 4 10 6 m s for the low permeability material to study the effect of the magnitude of heterogeneity the porosity θ of the medium is assumed to be 0 4 ideally one should perform direct numerical simulation of pore scale three dimensional flow and transport however such a simulation would involve a tremendous number of grains for a block of this size instead in this work an almost direct numerical simulation will be performed in which microscopic processes are modeled at the continuum i e darcy flow and ade transport with a fine grid of 0 001m in both x and z local hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients were described according to parameterizations developed from detailed experimental investigation of dispersion in flow through porous media delgado 2006 chiogna et al 2010 16 d l local d p 1 2 u d 17 d t local d p u d p e 123 where d p m2 s is the pore diffusion coefficient i e the aqueous diffusion coefficient d aq corrected by the tortuosity of the porous medium d m is the grain size diameter that is consistent with the conductivity u is the mean linear velocity and pe ud d aq is the grain péclet number these parameterizations of local dispersion coefficients were selected because of their simplicity and capability to capture the longitudinal and lateral dispersion behavior observed in a large number of flow through experiments in unconsolidated porous media for instance in longitudinal direction linear eq 16 or weakly nonlinear d l pe 1 1 1 2 equations for d l have shown good agreement with solute breakthrough data obtained in a range of flow conditions relevant for groundwater flow e g delgado 2006 2007 muniruzzaman and rolle 2017 in the lateral direction local d t is important for the exchange of mass in heterogeneous media the nonlinear compound specific description eq 17 has been tested in a large number of experiments in quasi 2 d and fully 3 d setups using different tracers and porous media e g chiogna et al 2010 haberer et al 2011 rolle et al 2013b ye et al 2015 and has been supported by pore scale numerical simulations rolle et al 2012 hochstetler et al 2013 an important feature of eqs 16 and 17 is that they allow a spatially variable representation of local hydrodynamic dispersion that can be directly linked to the spatially variable conductivity of heterogeneous porous media different empirical correlations have been proposed to relate the hydraulic conductivity to the grain size of unconsolidated materials in this study we use the approximation of hazen 1892 which was adopted in previous simulations of solute transport in heterogeneous media e g cirpka et al 2011 eckert et al 2012 and suggests a simple square root relation 18 d c k where c is an empirical constant of proportionality l 1 2 t 1 2 the exact value of c varies from study to study but we determined c 0 015 from the actual sand properties used in levy and berkowitz 2003 in order to find the grain sizes for various k values used in this study here k is in m s and d is in m table 1 lists the values of the grain sizes for the permeable matrix and for the low permeability inclusions with different hydraulic conductivity considered in our computational experiments a mixed finite element method is implemented to obtain the local velocity u and a streamline based transport simulator cirpka et al 1999 is used to minimize numerical dispersion the first step is to solve eq 11 subject to boundary conditions to compute f 1 the value of f 1 depends primarily on the velocity fluctuations u 1 inside the block and to a lesser extent on conditions in surrounding blocks through the boundary conditions for simplicity we will consider as basic case for boundary conditions f 1 constant after the solution is obtained the spatial average of the solution f 1 is subtracted from the values of f 1 obtained by eq 11 and we will be using the zero mean f 1 to plot results and compute the dispersion coefficient in equation eq 15 the results are identical for any value of the constant we choose for the boundary condition we will perform sensitivity analysis on the effect of different boundary conditions on the computed block effective dispersion later for an initial confirmation that the results are reasonable we compared the longitudinal dispersion coefficient determined from second central moment of a tracer plume using numerical simulations with the one computed from our method for case 1 with low permeable inclusions of k 1 4 10 4 m s var lnk 1 69 following an experiment setup of levy and berkowitz 2003 spike dye injection at five locations cf figure 8 in levy and berkowitz 2003 were simulated with a constant flow rate of 6 5ml min ū 6 10 6 m s as in fig 2 based on the relationship between the spatial moments of a plume and the transport parameters aris 1956 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for a medium with constant porosity is computed as 19 d l 1 2 d m 2 t d t 20 m 2 t 0 0 x μ t 2 c x y t d x d y 0 0 c x y t d x d y 21 μ t 0 0 x c x y t d x d y 0 0 c x y t d x d y where m 2 is the normalized second central moment in x direction and c x t is the concentration at the location x and time t in fig 3 we plot the second central spatial moment of the plumes and display the dispersion coefficient d l from two methods are 1 46 10 7 m2 s from eq 15 and 1 60 10 7 m2 s from eq 19 respectively the relative difference of about 8 in these two values for the effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient is surprisingly small considering that our methodology computes the dispersion coefficient for the whole block while the result from the moments analysis are from mini plumes that depend on initial conditions the path they follow and are limited to be inside the block fig 2 shows the origins of the process of dispersion at the front of the plume where the concentration is increasing there is more mass in the higher conductivity background sand in the back the opposite is true as the concentration is higher in the low conductivity inclusions and gradually bleeds out into the high conductivity background the instantaneous rate of increase of the second moment in the direction of flow depends on the distribution of mass and the velocities where there is mass let us consider the computation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient we know that f 1 must satisfy eq 11 and that if f 1 satisfies this equation so does f 1 that is obtained after subtracting its mean by the way it was introduced c has zero average over a numerical block ω and that is why we want f i to be zero on the average so our approach is to find any f 1 solution and then subtract the mean let us investigate the effect of boundary conditions in general f 1 at the boundaries cannot be specified precisely with only grid scale information if advection dominates the effect of the source terms overshadows the effects of the boundary conditions the fluctuations f i are expected to be primarily determined by the fluctuations of velocity when the problem is advection dominated large péclet number thus solving with the simplest boundary condition dirichlet with constant value should be adequate for such cases to test the robustness of this approximation we systematically investigate the influence of the boundary conditions we considered all possible combinations of first type and second type boundary conditions the model was run with either zero concentration or no dispersive flux boundary conditions d l o c a l f 1 n 0 imposed on the left right top and bottom boundaries separately resulting in 24 1 15 combinations here we will present results for case 1 and case 4 boxplots of computed dispersion values with these 15 boundary conditions at different velocities are displayed in fig 4 showing that only when groundwater is almost stagnant the boundary conditions affect the computed longitudinal dispersion values this is expected when we consider a large block for dispersion coefficients in eq 15 the covariation term u c at the boundaries would not affect the entire dispersion next we perform additional tests to investigate whether the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as computed by our method depends on the flow direction previously tested flow direction is reversed while other parameters are kept same then the longitudinal dispersion coefficients are computed for case 1 and case 4 as shown in fig 5 the effect of the flow direction is from the assumed boundary condition for an asymmetric block the direction of flow has a small effect due to the imposition of zero advective flux on the boundary the results show that this is small with relative difference no more than 5 satisfying the condition that the assignment of dispersion coefficient in the numerical model should be independent of the flow direction we do not mean to underestimate the importance of the role of boundary conditions on computed dispersion but at least for now we have demonstrated that in the case of longitudinal dispersion and large péclet number the effect of the boundary condition is minor we have also compared our method with classical first order analysis based on perturbation theory dagan 1984 details about such comparison can be found in appendix a and show an excellent agreement between the values of d l computed with the two methods for the cases examined i e mildly heterogeneous stationary conductivity fields with small correlation length compared to the size of the block lastly we investigate what is the relaxation time which strictly speaking means the time for initial conditions to be forgotten and practically steady state to be achieved as assumed in eq 11 but what is an even more important and relevant feature of relaxation time is that changes in ambient conditions with periods much larger than the relaxation time are gradual and the time derivative can be neglected with the numerical setup investigated earlier i e case 1 and case 4 with ū 6 1 0 6 m s we perform a transient simulation with initial condition f 0 which is considerably different from the final solution over the domain and compare transient solutions with the steady state solution fig 6 a shows a relative difference between transient and steady state solutions indicating that at about 70 case 1 and 150 case 4 hours their relative difference becomes smaller than 1 the time to reach the steady state is roughly equal to travel time in the entire domain plus diffusion time into the stagnant zones from the matrix the travel time is l x ū where l x is the length of the block and ū is mean velocity diffusion time is d l o w k 2 d l o c a l l o w k where d lowk is thickness of inclusion and d local lowk is local dispersion diffusion coefficient more importantly as shown in fig 6 b the block effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient becomes practically the same as the one obtained from the steady state equation after around only 20 and 100h for case 1 and case 4 respectively this indicates that the value of the dispersion coefficient is not very sensitive to the assumption that the time derivative can be neglected this is an important point because changes in most of the domain are bound to be gradual with periods much large than these times only near injection points may the conditions change rapidly and thus not conform with the assumption of local equilibrium it is important to clarify that local equilibrium does not mean that conditions do not change but only that the conditions change slowly enough using a smaller block as a consequence of using a finer grid reduces the relaxation time and thus makes the local equilibrium condition easier to achieve also local equilibrium does not mean that the concentration in low conductivity zones is the same as the concentration in high conductivity ones rather the opposite is true since dispersion originates from the fact that mass is distributed between high and low conductivity areas 5 results of numerical simulations in this section we apply the proposed approach to investigate the block effective longitudinal dispersion for different geometry of the inclusions permeability contrast flow velocity and local diffusion dispersion coefficients for illustration fig 7 shows the velocity fluctuation u 1 normalized concentration fluctuation f 1 and their product u 1 f 1 for case 1 with var lnk 1 69 what determines the magnitude of dispersion is the degree that velocity fluctuations correlate with higher concentrations fluctuations the fluctuations are similar in appearance to what one sees at the front of a plume as in fig 2 higher values in the high velocity parts and low velocity in the low permeability inclusions it is also the negative of what one sees at the back of the plume that s where the similarity stops however because for an individual plume the mean transport velocity at the front is higher than at the back hence the fast breakthrough and long tail in our analysis there is no front and back because only captures a part of a larger plume one can see that the locations responsible for the generation of dispersion are the low conductivity inclusions because that is where both velocity and concentration fluctuations are the largest and are the most correlated the image of normalized concentration fluctuation f 1 reveals the micro structure of velocity fluctuations one can see that these fluctuations are determined mainly by the fluctuations in velocity and one can see how local dispersion though it is small may have some effect because it acts over steep slopes and over the whole domain one can also see why higher local dispersion coefficients suppress f 1 and thus lower the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient for the block the covariation term u 1 f 1 is plotted for the four cases investigated in figs 8 and 9 considering mild and high heterogeneity these maps are illustrative since they allow visualizing where the dispersion originates from as well as the distinct features and spatial distribution of the covariation term in the domains with different geometry of the low permeability inclusions positive values add to dispersive mixing and negative values subtract all figures show that the low permeability inclusions are closely associated with the generation of dispersive fluxes this of course is because most mass moves with about the same velocity in the permeable background sand whereas the mass in inclusions moves more slowly the geometry of inclusions plays an important role and higher values of the covariation term are computed for the elongated structures if there were no local mixing mass entering inclusions would travel the whole length through advection alone and would be more delayed compared to mass in the permeable background matrix which would result in higher dispersion rates at the other extreme large transverse local dispersion would allow mass to escape from the slow flow zones reducing dispersion rates the pictures we see are the result of interplay between advection and diffusive mass transfer in the heterogeneous block at the fine scale cf guswa and freyberg 2000 in fact in the cases with elongated inclusions case 3 and case 4 mass transfer limitations between the permeable matrix and the low k zones have a significant effect the less the local mass transfer rates the higher the hydrodynamic dispersion at the block scale the patterns of u 1 f 1 is similar for the mild and high heterogeneity setups but the magnitude is different and with high contrast structures more dispersion is generated due to the stronger effect of low velocity and limited mass transfer in the slow zones fig 10 shows the computed block effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient normalized by molecular diffusion for the four heterogeneous domains fig 1 considering a range of grid péclet numbers p e ū l d a q where l 0 001m is the grid size including groundwater flow velocities characteristic of most hydrogeologic applications in each case three low k values of 1 4 10 4 blue 1 4 10 5 red and 1 4 10 6 m s black were considered to investigate the effect of permeability contrast on the upscaled dispersion coefficients for the mildly heterogeneous var lnk 1 k fields with small inclusions case 1 and case 2 blue circles effective longitudinal dispersion scales linearly with velocity almost throughout the entire range of péclet numbers pe 10 1 103 showing that the scheidegger parameterization for the upscaled effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient is valid in this velocity regime the results of the numerical experiments can be also clearly visualized by plotting the normalized block effective dispersivity as d l ul as function of péclet number which becomes constant for the advective regime pe 5 10 fig 11 a and b note that in the low péclet number regime 10 1 where the block effective dispersivity has not yet reached a constant value molecular diffusion is the main mechanism contributing to dispersion for the k fields with longitudinally elongated inclusions case 3 and case 4 blue circles normalized dispersion does not become constant until pe 100 because of the effect of diffusion and mass transfer limitations however in these mildly heterogeneous domains the scheidegger parameterization is likely to work well in practice because the change in actual dispersion coefficient is small thus the assumption may not change significantly the results of transport simulations for mid to highly heterogeneous var lnk 1 configurations red and black markers in figs 10 and 11 the values of block scale longitudinal dispersion are considerably higher the trend of d l still shows the almost linear relationship to pe for the cases with small low permeability inclusions a and b in fact in these setups the stagnant flow zones are relatively small compared to the entire block length and advection is more important than diffusion thus suggesting that the scheidegger parameterization is still valid for these cases the normalized longitudinal dispersivities in fig 11 a and b are shown to be constant for pe 50 and for 1 pe 50 the transitional or power law regime fried and combarnous 1971 bijeljic et al 2004 is observed where both advection and diffusion affect the effective dispersion dispersivity for case 2 is less variable over the entire range of pe compared to one for case 1 because the length of the vertical low permeability inclusions along the flow direction is shorter so that diffusion affects the dispersion less significantly the observed behavior is different for the last two heterogeneous configurations panels c and d in figs 10 and 11 the elongated shape of the low k inclusions and their small permeability results in higher effective longitudinal dispersion and cause a deviation from the linear relationship between the computed d l and the péclet number in these setups high dispersion values originate from mass transfer limitation between the flowing fluid in the high permeable area and immobile pore volume in the low permeable lenses in fact the elongated geometry of the inclusions along the main flow direction results in diffusive mass transfer limitation over larger interfaces between the permeable matrix and the low permeable material within the inclusions solute in low permeability zones is forced to move slowly unless diffusion allows it to escape sideways thus diffusion plays an important role in how much dispersion will actually take place slow mass transfer causes considerable variability in the velocity and concentration fluctuations which results in larger dispersion for these configurations the effective dispersivity can approach a constant values only at very large péclet numbers the outcomes of the numerical experiments in the different setups clearly shows that effective dispersion is sensitive to the permeability contrast and to the structure of k we have also performed multitracer computational experiments to evaluate the influence of compound specific aqueous diffusion coefficients on the upscaled effective longitudinal dispersion we consider a multispecies solute transport problem with four tracers with different aqueous diffusion coefficients d aq 10 10 5 10 10 10 9 2 10 9 m2 s simultaneously transported in the heterogeneous domains such variability of aqueous diffusion coefficients covers a representative range of aqueous solute diffusivities in groundwater transport problems rolle et al 2013a the outcomes of the multitracer simulations are reported in fig 12 as upscaled block effective longitudinal dispersivity α l as a function of the seepage velocity for the four configurations of heterogeneous porous media considering small var lnk 0 2 and large var lnk 4 6 conductivity contrasts the results show different effective dispersivity under diffusion dominated conditions and very low flow velocity with larger values of α l for the solutes with lower aqueous diffusion particularly when a large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and the inclusions is considered such behavior shows the importance of compound specific mass transfer limitations in which solutes with lower aqueous diffusivity undergo a more pronounced longitudinal spreading in the heterogeneous domain when the flow regime becomes advection dominated i e higher values of seepage velocity the outcomes are different for the distinct cases with small distributed inclusions case 1 and case 2 the effective dispersivity converges to a unique value independent of the diffusion coefficient of the transported species with elongated low permeability inclusions case 3 and case 4 the results show a distinct value of effective α l for the different solutes particularly when a large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and the inclusions is considered finally at very large velocities the effective α l for the different solutes converges to a constant value as observed for the cases with small inclusions fig 12a and b 6 discussion opinions diverge in hydrogeology regarding the topic of hydrodynamic dispersion in geologic formations some apparently do not even consider dispersion as a process of fundamental physical significance but rather an artifact of how velocity is resolved however unless one can resolve velocity variability at the scale of millimeters or less the effects of unresolved variability are real and indeed prominent the heterogeneity encountered in geologic formations is both pronounced and highly structured and has major effects on the way solute plumes are conveyed and dispersed numerical models are increasingly used to solve flow and transport problems in such heterogeneous formations this work has dealt with the persistent practical question then is how to capture the effects of velocity variability at scales smaller than those resolved by the grid used in the numerical method it has re examined the validity of the fickian model and the scheidegger parameterization of dispersion coefficients which are widely used and yet widely disputed plumes exhibit scale dependent rates of spreading irregular shapes fast breakthrough and long tails gelhar et al 1992 carrera 1993 all of which seem to invalidate the fickian model however whether dispersive transport at the scale of a block in a numerical model is fickian or non fickian is a completely different issue fiori et al 2013 the reason is simply that dispersion of plumes and dispersion in a single block are processes evolving at different scales it is important to appreciate that the grid should be fine enough to resolve the variability of concentration at the desired level and thus the grid size should be one tenth or even less than the smallest wavelengths of the concentration variability that must be represented this is the case for all numerical models even flow models like modflow e g lal 2000 otherwise there is significant error in representing a function by discrete values independently of the model and parameters used to solve the flow or transport problem associated with this requirement is that changes are not rapid because rapid changes create spatial fluctuations like advancing fronts at scales smaller than those that the model can resolve these issues are known and are the reason why the grid size must be chosen carefully reilly and harbaugh 2004 and variable grid size must often be employed if a coarse grid is selected important features of heterogeneity but also variability in the concentration may be left out in any case one cannot hope that the model can predict at scales not resolved by the model the method of analysis in this work defines the problem as how to capture the effects of unresolved small scale heterogeneity on the resolved grid scale variability of concentration we show that under certain conditions these effects are captured by the fickian model the conditions are pretty much the same as the requirements that the proper grid has been selected i e gradually varying concentration in many applications concentration varies gradually in space and time as plumes transport and evolve over decades for such problems the fickian model for block dispersion is appropriate in some other applications like field experiments or at site remediation near injection points the concentration function may change rapidly thus the condition of local equilibrium conditions in a block are not met and the fickian model may be inaccurate in such a case one can either select to refine the grid or to adopt a non equilibrium model like dual domain dual porosity dddp it is important to recognize though that the issue is not whether an equilibrium or a non equilibrium model is right for a certain formation but how fast the changes are in relation to the relaxation time of a block for example even if we consider that a medium conforms to the ideal dddp model but the imposed changes are slow in relation to the characteristic time for the two domains to equilibrate then effectively the dddp medium acts as a single domain medium with a certain dispersion coefficient liu and kitanidis 2012 parker and van genuchten 1984 parker and valocchi 1986 the next issue we examine is whether the dispersion coefficient is a characteristic of the block and the solute and can be parameterized by using resolved quantities of velocity and concentration the answer is mostly yes but there is a small effect from unresolved velocity and concentration fluctuations in neighboring blocks as shown in figs 4 and 5 the uncertainty from these effects is negligible under ideal conditions like stationary variability with correlation length small in relation to the size of the block even for more unfavorable cases the uncertainty is small particularly for large velocity cases for which dispersion matters most in this work we chose to keep it simple and just quantify the uncertainty rather than seek better methods to account for the effects from fluctuations in neighboring blocks next we consider the validity of the standard scheidegger parameterization expressed through dispersivity coefficients we study through computational experiments longitudinal dispersion in a certain direction the results indicate that the scheidegger parameterization is a good approximation for stationary media such as those with multiple small inclusions of low permeability in a higher conductivity background as shown by the simulation of case 1 and case 2 panels a and b in figs 10 and 11 however geologic heterogeneity is structured for example clay laminae with preferential orientation are much more likely than clay lumps randomly distributed for such cases e g case 3 and case 4 the scheidegger limit is reached only for large pe see panels c and d in figs 10 and 11 for velocity values in the commonly encountered range the effective dispersivity gradually increases over two orders of magnitude and at high velocity values can have a much larger value than the ones used in practice equaling or even potentially exceeding the dimension of the block interestingly two different solutes with distinct molecular diffusion coefficients experience different rates of hydrodynamic dispersion and in fact the one with lower molecular diffusion coefficient experiencing a higher dispersion rate as shown in fig 12 these are features that are usually not included in modeling studies the analysis carried out in this work allowed us to investigate block scale longitudinal dispersion in heterogeneous domains with different permeability contrast and geometry of low permeability inclusions particular attention has been dedicated to explain and visualize the origin of block dispersion from velocity and concentration fluctuations to analyze the interplay between the fundamental processes of advection and diffusion and to investigate the important role of mass transfer limitations in determining the values of effective dispersion the method is rigorous but at the same time simple enough to be appealing for both researchers and practitioners interested in modeling groundwater transport problems as we discussed above the method is not unconditionally valid since it is subject to the requirements of gradual changes leading to a condition of physical equilibrium however as we have shown in our analysis these conditions are not particularly restrictive and apply to many situations typically encountered for transport of contaminant plumes in the subsurface therefore we believe that the proposed approach can represent a significant step forward to improve our capability to accurately describe solute transport in heterogeneous formations we also hope that the method could contribute to shorten the distance between academia and practice in a field of hydrogeology that is inherently complex and rich of future challenges in terms of process understanding methods development and

summarizes results of numerical experiments for the case of stationary conductivity with correlation length that is small compared to the size of the block for small variance the classical first order analysis based on perturbation theory e g dagan 1984 1994 predicts that the whole domain or large block dispersivity in the longitudinal direction is a 1 α l σ ln k 2 i ln k x where σ ln k 2 is the variance of the log k field and i ln k x is the integral scale in the x direction which concurs with the length parameter for the isotropic exponential covariance function we will use it to compute the block coefficient and compare with our results first we consider the longitudinal dispersivity using the small perturbation method for 2 d log normal random fields whose geometric mean is 10 3 m s and covariance function is exponential σ ln k 2 exp r l where r is the distance between two spatial points with scale parameter l 0 01m and σ ln k 2 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 from theory their whole domain dispersivity is l σ ln k 2 0 001 0 025 and 0 005 respectively due to the equivalence between the integral scale and the scale parameter l for the exponential covariance kernel then we generate 100 realizations for each log random k field and compute the block effective dispersivity α l d l ū the size of the domain we consider here is 1m 1m and discretized with dx dy 0 001m a realization of lnk field is shown in fig a 13 a constant head boundaries of 0 05 and 0m are imposed at x 0 and 1m respectively with no flux at y 0 and 1m that creates mean flow velocity in x direction of around 1 0 10 4

s in table a 2 the block effective dispersivity values are computed from 100 realizations for three different variance cases and compared with dispersivity obtained from the perturbation method the results show that the proposed method yields consistent dispersivity values to the one obtained from the perturbation method 
1662,most recent research on hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media has focused on whole domain dispersion while other research is largely on laboratory scale dispersion this work focuses on the contribution of a single block in a numerical model to dispersion variability of fluid velocity and concentration within a block is not resolved and the combined spreading effect is approximated using resolved quantities and macroscopic parameters this applies whether the formation is modeled as homogeneous or discretized into homogeneous blocks but the emphasis here being on the latter the process of dispersion is typically described through the fickian model i e the dispersive flux is proportional to the gradient of the resolved concentration commonly with the scheidegger parameterization which is a particular way to compute the dispersion coefficients utilizing dispersivity coefficients although such parameterization is by far the most commonly used in solute transport applications its validity has been questioned here our goal is to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and mass transfer limitations on block scale longitudinal dispersion and to evaluate under which conditions the scheidegger parameterization is valid we compute the relaxation time or memory of the system changes in time with periods larger than the relaxation time are gradually leading to a condition of local equilibrium under which dispersion is fickian the method we use requires the solution of a steady state advection dispersion equation and thus is computationally efficient and applicable to any heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k field without requiring statistical or structural assumptions the method was validated by comparing with other approaches such as the moment analysis and the first order perturbation method we investigate the impact of heterogeneity both in degree and structure on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and then discuss the role of local dispersion and mass transfer limitations i e the exchange of mass between the permeable matrix and the low permeability inclusions we illustrate the physical meaning of the method and we show how the block longitudinal dispersivity approaches under certain conditions the scheidegger limit at large péclet numbers lastly we discuss the potential and limitations of the method to accurately describe dispersion in solute transport applications in heterogeneous aquifers keywords longitudinal dispersion numerical models solute transport heterogeneity and scale 1 introduction accurate prediction of solute transport spreading and mixing is crucial for safe and reliable subsurface management applications the fundamental processes that control flow and solute transport in geologic formations have been studied extensively both in the laboratory and through mathematical analysis for example in the transport of a conservative solute subject to advection and molecular diffusion at the pore scale the solute concentration satisfies an advection diffusion equation the velocity satisfies the stokes i e low reynolds number hydrodynamics equation and diffusion follows fick s law the number of pore scale studies of solute transport has dramatically increased in recent years and these investigations have certainly contributed to improve our understanding of solute transport in porous media e g acharya et al 2007 tartakovsky et al 2009 yoon et al 2012 icardi et al 2014 rolle and kitanidis 2014 meyer and bijeljic 2016 however in hydrogeologic applications solute transport is still a formidable challenge because modeling is done at much larger scales since geologic media exhibit heterogeneity at multiple scales the variability of physical and chemical properties results in complex transport behaviors neuman 1990 in current practice flow and transport simulations are generally performed for a homogeneous medium the approach preferred in analytical methods or what effectively is spatially distributed homogeneous blocks the approach followed in finite element and finite volume methods the process of representing quantitatively the effect of unresolved variability in terms of resolved quantities is the problem of parameterization for the flow problem darcy s law is used meaning the velocity is proportional to hydraulic head gradient and its validity is seldom disputed for solute transport the effect of unresolved velocity in combination with unresolved concentration is much more difficult to capture silliman and simpson 1987 neuman and zhang 1990 adams and gelhar 1992 levy and berkowitz 2003 moroni et al 2007 however this effect is quite pronounced when dealing with plumes hundreds of meters long and with grid spacing of the order of meters or more in practice the most widely used dispersion modeling approach is the fickian model with scheidegger parameterization scheidegger 1954 where dispersion coefficients are computed from constant dispersivity coefficients considered medium properties and independent of molecular diffusion and flow velocity the scheidegger parameterization was originally justified based on a random walk model dominated by advection in macroscopically homogeneous media this approach has been the subject of intense scrutiny 2 overview of objectives and approach much work has been done on dispersion in the last thirty years which makes it imperative to explain our perspective and our approach before we embark on the analysis or show any results consider a geologic formation that is heterogeneous at all scales this is modeled using a numerical model that subdivides the domain under study on the basis of a numerical grid to fix ideas consider that we divide the domain into blocks each of which is modeled as a continuum with appropriate properties for example a block consisting of potentially different sedimentary facies is modeled as a uniform block subject to darcy s law with certain conductivity parameters in principle there is a fine scale description represented by a velocity that varies at the scale of micrometers and a coarse scale description represented by a specific discharge that varies at the scale of the grid which may be of the order of meters the objective is that the two descriptions should yield the same results at the scale of variability captured by the grid in other words whether one resolves the fine scale variability and solves the navier stokes and advection diffusion equations or one solves the much simpler groundwater flow and transport problems with a homogeneous block one would obtain the same results after averaging the fine scale result to the scale of the grid what we just described is the basic idea underlying the continuum approach this approach works well in making the transition from the molecular scale to the fluid mechanical scale where for example the fine scale may represent a very large number of interacting water molecules shifting position and the macroscopic scale is a uniform fluid with given density and viscosity in hydrogeology we are faced with a similar problem but we must deal with heterogeneity at many scales from the scale of a pore to that of a formation the practical solution already mentioned is to resolve larger scale variability through a grid and apply the continuum approach to each block but there are persistent challenges is there a manageable coarse scale model under what conditions is this model appropriate and what error is to be expected from its application the problem we will address is that of dispersion of conservative nonreactive solutes and how to parameterize it in the context of a numerical model the majority of papers on dispersion have examined the problem of whole domain dispersion in formations with some regularity such as random media gelhar 1993 dagan 1989 rubin 2003 as it would apply in the transport of a large plume only a few works dagan 1994 rubin et al 1999 wang and kitanidis 1999 rubin et al 2003 dentz and de barros 2013 de barros and dentz 2016 have studied the problem of what dispersion coefficients to assign to blocks in a numerical model and notable examples that have dealt with such problem include the approach developed by rubin et al 1999 as well as the recent work by de barros and dentz 2016 the problem of block scale dispersion is also the main focus of this study which has the specific objectives of i explaining and visualizing how block scale longitudinal dispersion originates from the velocity and concentration fluctuations within the block ii investigating the interplay between advection and diffusive mass transfer rate for a range of flow velocities and permeability contrasts common in hydrogeologic applications iii analyzing under what conditions the common scheidegger method of describing dispersion is valid and iv perform error quantification for this parameterization while previous studies have made assumptions regarding the structure such as periodic or stationary we present a method of analysis that does not require a specific structure for the formation as a whole or even for the individual block and while much of recently published work deals with non equilibrium conditions and non fickian transport dentz et al 2011 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 this work focuses on the fickian model when we say fickian we mean at the scale of a block and we do not imply macroscopically homogeneous media like stationary conductivity or gaussian shaped plumes one can actually model irregular plumes by resolving heterogeneity at the scale of a grid chosen for the needs of a particular application the proposed approach is in the spirit of the times which is to recognize the importance of heterogeneity and the ability to better resolve heterogeneity thanks to technological trends like faster computations better sensing technologies and the ability to invert data to estimate parameters e g dogan et al 2014 hochstetler et al 2016 lee et al 2016 we will argue that as we can deal with increasingly finer grid the fickian model becomes a more accurate representation of transport because the key requirement that of local equilibrium is better met local equilibrium implies conditions sufficiently independent from an external perturbation with gradual changes and a dynamic balance between velocity variability causing concentration fluctuations and the opposing effect of diffusion there have been many computational studies on dispersion e g scheibe and cole 1994 fernàndez garcia and gómez hernández 2007 bijeljic et al 2013a the majority of them particularly the most recent and most elaborate and comprehensive of them have been performed in a lagrangian framework and with purpose of describing the early and late behavior of dispersion in large statistically homogeneous formations the lagrangian perspective focuses on following particles or the statistics of particles as they move in time and space landmarks in the development of this approach to study dispersion include taylor 1922 scheidegger 1954 and dagan 1984 it appears that most informed hydrogeologists consider the lagrangian perspective as the most natural and useful approach for conceptualization and analysis of dispersion by contrast this is a computational study based on a theory developed in an eulerian framework which focuses on computing the contribution of a block to dispersive transport important steps in the development of this approach were bensoussan et al 1978 and brenner 1980 who considered transport in an idealized periodic medium and evaluated dispersion coefficients that are properties of the formation however all computations boil down to solving a boundary value problem in one block because of their emphasis on an idealized case and their heavily mathematical treatment these works did not attract much attention in the hydrogeologic literature with a few notable exceptions bourgeat et al 1988 plumb and whitaker 1988 kitanidis 1992 the approach of gelhar and axness 1982 who focused on unbounded domains stationary media and analytic methods is also related to the same general methodology in this study we adopt an eulerian approach which is intuitively appealing and easy to explain at least with respect to the basic ideas instead of following particles which enter and exit the block of interest we focus on the velocity inside the block the velocity consists of the mean plus fluctuations about the mean the effect of the mean velocity is captured by advective transport the fluctuations have zero mean but if there is a concentration gradient these zero mean velocity fluctuations will have a net effect they will transport mass downgradient in what is known as dispersive transport furthermore this transport is proportional to the concentration gradient which is the essence of fickian transport this is the essence of the analysis we carry out in the next section the analysis is along lines similar to those of previous eulerian theories but with some important differences we focus on a single block and make no assumptions about structure of heterogeneity outside of the block this means that there is an indeterminacy from unknown boundary conditions or the interaction with surrounding blocks that in previous studies was assumed to vanish under restrictive conditions about structure our approach is not to make such assumptions but instead to perform uncertainty quantification we show that the effect is minor for large velocity cases for which dispersion is important one computational advantage of the eulerian approach for the study of dispersion is that its application requires the solution of steady transport problems unlike the lagrangian approach the results do not depend on initial concentration but the velocity field and the local diffusion dispersion coefficients however the theory assumes that conditions approach a state of local equilibrium and in this paper we discuss what local equilibrium means and examine the question of how rapidly local equilibrium can be achieved 3 method a method to compute dispersion coefficients for a heterogeneous block starting from three dimensional pore scale stokes flow and advection diffusion has been presented in kitanidis 2017 however solving this problem in a block of the order of 1m3 would require a tremendous computational effort and exorbitant amounts of information on the geometry of pore space for example existing works such as bijeljic et al 2013b are limited to a block of the order of 1cm3 so direct numerical simulation is postponed for future investigation here we will derive the same result starting from the continuum scale models of darcy flow and advection dispersion with local coefficients under the continuity condition q 0 the advection dispersion equation that is commonly used to model transport in porous media is 1 θ c t q c θ d local c 0 where c is the point concentration in the continuum scale θ is the porosity q is the darcy velocity i e specific discharge l t and d local is the local dispersion tensor l 2 t let ω be the heterogeneous block for which we want to compute the effective value of hydrodynamic dispersion to keep the analysis simple we will consider that θ is constant over this block focusing on variability of specific discharge caused by variability in hydraulic conductivity starting from eq 1 the objective is to show that as assumed in numerical models the equation of mass conservation over the block ω is given by 2 ω c t u c d ω c d v 0 where c u and d ω are the resolved large scale concentration linear velocity l t and block effective dispersion tensor l 2 t respectively the finer the volume ω is the better the fickian model in eq 2 predicts using reynolds decomposition e g beckie 1998 kapoor and gelhar 1994 kapoor and kitanidis 1997 the actual concentration c t x y z that satisfies the fine scale transport equation eq 1 can be modeled as consisting of two components 3 c t x y z c t x y z c t x y z where c is the resolved concentration at the scale of ω and c is the fluctuation around c so that ω c d v 0 the concentration c represents the unresolved or subgrid variability under gradually varying conditions in space and time c varies gradually at the scale of ω while most of the variability of c is at scales smaller than the scale of the support volume so that any average of related quantities to c over ω is negligible similarly we represent u as 4 u t x y z u t x y z u t x y z where u is the average velocity at the scale ω and u is the velocity fluctuation about u as for the concentration fluctuation also the volume average of u is zero by substituting eqs 3 and 4 into the fine scale transport equation eq 1 we obtain 5 c t c t u c u c u c u c d local c d local c 0 integrating eq 5 over the block ω and considering that u and c are averaged out to be zero ω c t u c u c d local c θ d v can be neglected with a small loss of accuracy we eventually have 6 ω c t u c u c d local c d v 0 we will focus on how to represent the nonzero term u c which represents dispersive transport due to subgrid variability in terms of resolved variability and constituent parameters under the condition of gradual concentration changes the resolved concentration c within the block can be approximated as kitanidis 2017 7 c t x y z a a 1 x ū 1 t a 2 y ū 2 t a 3 z ū 3 t where a a 1 a 2 a 3 are constants this simplification reflects that the concentration c is varying in space in the smoothest fashion which is linear and satisfies the grid scale transport equation the slopes of the macroscopic concentration c are then the coefficients a 8 c c x c y c z a 1 a 2 a 3 considering the fine scale mass conservation eq 5 and substituting the approximate solution for c eq 7 we find that c satisfies 9 c t u c d local c a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 a 3 u 3 since slow changes are assumed we neglect c t focusing on the quasi steady condition we will discuss this issue in the next section because of the linearity of this equation the superposition principle holds meaning that the solution to eq 9 is given by 10 c f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 where each of the f terms satisfies 11 u f i d local f i u i for i 1 2 and 3 note that if f i satisfies this equation so does f i const but the solution must have zero mean since c has zero spatial average to finalize the solution appropriate boundary conditions must be used and this issue will be discussed in the next section the dispersive flux term u c in eq 6 is now written as 12 u c u 1 u 2 u 3 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 13 u 1 f 1 u 1 f 2 u 1 f 3 u 2 f 1 u 2 f 2 u 2 f 3 u 3 f 1 u 3 f 2 u 3 f 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 as a result the dispersion is fickian i e the dispersive flux is expressed as the product of second order tensor and the concentration gradient eq 8 cf bensoussan et al 1978 brenner 1980 plumb and whitaker 1988 kitanidis 1992 amaral souto and moyne 1997 thus fickian behavior follows from the state of local equilibrium which is the assumption we made in eq 7 upscaled effective dispersion coefficient over the block is given by 14 ω u c d v ω d ω c d v where the block scale dispersion tensor d ω is expressed as 15 d ω i j ω u i f j d v v ω the approach allows one to quantitatively assess the role of 1 structure of heterogeneity 2 degree of heterogeneity and 3 advection and local diffusion dispersion processes on block dispersion note that the proposed approach is applicable to any heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and only requires the steady state equations in eq 11 instead of solving the entire ade at the local scale if more than a single dispersion coefficient for grid blocks of a large model are considered the steady state equations are simply repeated efficiently for each individual grid block which can be accelerated further by using parallel programming and reusing preconditioner matrix though the approach can be used to compute all components of the tensor we will focus exclusively on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l the term also commonly denoted as d 11 or d xx requiring the computed f 1 from the solution of eq 11 4 computational experiments consider a block with intermixed regions of coarse and fine sand similar to the systems investigated previously in flow through laboratory experiments silliman and simpson 1987 silliman and caswell 1998 levy and berkowitz 2003 this is a quasi 2 d flow through chamber with dimensions of 0 86m 0 45m in the x and z directions respectively four different heterogeneity structures for conductivity k shown in fig 1 are considered to study the effect of spatial heterogeneity structure on the block effective dispersion over the entire flow through chamber each configuration fig 1 a d is filled with a homogeneous coarse sand with k 5 10 3 m s and several homogeneous low k rectangular inclusions with different lengths designed to occupy 16 of the domain while a sand with k 1 4 10 4 m s was used for the low permeability inclusions in the original experiment in the present work we computed results for four different k values 1 4 10 3 1 4 10 4 1 4 10 5 and 1 4 10 6 m s for the low permeability material to study the effect of the magnitude of heterogeneity the porosity θ of the medium is assumed to be 0 4 ideally one should perform direct numerical simulation of pore scale three dimensional flow and transport however such a simulation would involve a tremendous number of grains for a block of this size instead in this work an almost direct numerical simulation will be performed in which microscopic processes are modeled at the continuum i e darcy flow and ade transport with a fine grid of 0 001m in both x and z local hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients were described according to parameterizations developed from detailed experimental investigation of dispersion in flow through porous media delgado 2006 chiogna et al 2010 16 d l local d p 1 2 u d 17 d t local d p u d p e 123 where d p m2 s is the pore diffusion coefficient i e the aqueous diffusion coefficient d aq corrected by the tortuosity of the porous medium d m is the grain size diameter that is consistent with the conductivity u is the mean linear velocity and pe ud d aq is the grain péclet number these parameterizations of local dispersion coefficients were selected because of their simplicity and capability to capture the longitudinal and lateral dispersion behavior observed in a large number of flow through experiments in unconsolidated porous media for instance in longitudinal direction linear eq 16 or weakly nonlinear d l pe 1 1 1 2 equations for d l have shown good agreement with solute breakthrough data obtained in a range of flow conditions relevant for groundwater flow e g delgado 2006 2007 muniruzzaman and rolle 2017 in the lateral direction local d t is important for the exchange of mass in heterogeneous media the nonlinear compound specific description eq 17 has been tested in a large number of experiments in quasi 2 d and fully 3 d setups using different tracers and porous media e g chiogna et al 2010 haberer et al 2011 rolle et al 2013b ye et al 2015 and has been supported by pore scale numerical simulations rolle et al 2012 hochstetler et al 2013 an important feature of eqs 16 and 17 is that they allow a spatially variable representation of local hydrodynamic dispersion that can be directly linked to the spatially variable conductivity of heterogeneous porous media different empirical correlations have been proposed to relate the hydraulic conductivity to the grain size of unconsolidated materials in this study we use the approximation of hazen 1892 which was adopted in previous simulations of solute transport in heterogeneous media e g cirpka et al 2011 eckert et al 2012 and suggests a simple square root relation 18 d c k where c is an empirical constant of proportionality l 1 2 t 1 2 the exact value of c varies from study to study but we determined c 0 015 from the actual sand properties used in levy and berkowitz 2003 in order to find the grain sizes for various k values used in this study here k is in m s and d is in m table 1 lists the values of the grain sizes for the permeable matrix and for the low permeability inclusions with different hydraulic conductivity considered in our computational experiments a mixed finite element method is implemented to obtain the local velocity u and a streamline based transport simulator cirpka et al 1999 is used to minimize numerical dispersion the first step is to solve eq 11 subject to boundary conditions to compute f 1 the value of f 1 depends primarily on the velocity fluctuations u 1 inside the block and to a lesser extent on conditions in surrounding blocks through the boundary conditions for simplicity we will consider as basic case for boundary conditions f 1 constant after the solution is obtained the spatial average of the solution f 1 is subtracted from the values of f 1 obtained by eq 11 and we will be using the zero mean f 1 to plot results and compute the dispersion coefficient in equation eq 15 the results are identical for any value of the constant we choose for the boundary condition we will perform sensitivity analysis on the effect of different boundary conditions on the computed block effective dispersion later for an initial confirmation that the results are reasonable we compared the longitudinal dispersion coefficient determined from second central moment of a tracer plume using numerical simulations with the one computed from our method for case 1 with low permeable inclusions of k 1 4 10 4 m s var lnk 1 69 following an experiment setup of levy and berkowitz 2003 spike dye injection at five locations cf figure 8 in levy and berkowitz 2003 were simulated with a constant flow rate of 6 5ml min ū 6 10 6 m s as in fig 2 based on the relationship between the spatial moments of a plume and the transport parameters aris 1956 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for a medium with constant porosity is computed as 19 d l 1 2 d m 2 t d t 20 m 2 t 0 0 x μ t 2 c x y t d x d y 0 0 c x y t d x d y 21 μ t 0 0 x c x y t d x d y 0 0 c x y t d x d y where m 2 is the normalized second central moment in x direction and c x t is the concentration at the location x and time t in fig 3 we plot the second central spatial moment of the plumes and display the dispersion coefficient d l from two methods are 1 46 10 7 m2 s from eq 15 and 1 60 10 7 m2 s from eq 19 respectively the relative difference of about 8 in these two values for the effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient is surprisingly small considering that our methodology computes the dispersion coefficient for the whole block while the result from the moments analysis are from mini plumes that depend on initial conditions the path they follow and are limited to be inside the block fig 2 shows the origins of the process of dispersion at the front of the plume where the concentration is increasing there is more mass in the higher conductivity background sand in the back the opposite is true as the concentration is higher in the low conductivity inclusions and gradually bleeds out into the high conductivity background the instantaneous rate of increase of the second moment in the direction of flow depends on the distribution of mass and the velocities where there is mass let us consider the computation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient we know that f 1 must satisfy eq 11 and that if f 1 satisfies this equation so does f 1 that is obtained after subtracting its mean by the way it was introduced c has zero average over a numerical block ω and that is why we want f i to be zero on the average so our approach is to find any f 1 solution and then subtract the mean let us investigate the effect of boundary conditions in general f 1 at the boundaries cannot be specified precisely with only grid scale information if advection dominates the effect of the source terms overshadows the effects of the boundary conditions the fluctuations f i are expected to be primarily determined by the fluctuations of velocity when the problem is advection dominated large péclet number thus solving with the simplest boundary condition dirichlet with constant value should be adequate for such cases to test the robustness of this approximation we systematically investigate the influence of the boundary conditions we considered all possible combinations of first type and second type boundary conditions the model was run with either zero concentration or no dispersive flux boundary conditions d l o c a l f 1 n 0 imposed on the left right top and bottom boundaries separately resulting in 24 1 15 combinations here we will present results for case 1 and case 4 boxplots of computed dispersion values with these 15 boundary conditions at different velocities are displayed in fig 4 showing that only when groundwater is almost stagnant the boundary conditions affect the computed longitudinal dispersion values this is expected when we consider a large block for dispersion coefficients in eq 15 the covariation term u c at the boundaries would not affect the entire dispersion next we perform additional tests to investigate whether the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as computed by our method depends on the flow direction previously tested flow direction is reversed while other parameters are kept same then the longitudinal dispersion coefficients are computed for case 1 and case 4 as shown in fig 5 the effect of the flow direction is from the assumed boundary condition for an asymmetric block the direction of flow has a small effect due to the imposition of zero advective flux on the boundary the results show that this is small with relative difference no more than 5 satisfying the condition that the assignment of dispersion coefficient in the numerical model should be independent of the flow direction we do not mean to underestimate the importance of the role of boundary conditions on computed dispersion but at least for now we have demonstrated that in the case of longitudinal dispersion and large péclet number the effect of the boundary condition is minor we have also compared our method with classical first order analysis based on perturbation theory dagan 1984 details about such comparison can be found in appendix a and show an excellent agreement between the values of d l computed with the two methods for the cases examined i e mildly heterogeneous stationary conductivity fields with small correlation length compared to the size of the block lastly we investigate what is the relaxation time which strictly speaking means the time for initial conditions to be forgotten and practically steady state to be achieved as assumed in eq 11 but what is an even more important and relevant feature of relaxation time is that changes in ambient conditions with periods much larger than the relaxation time are gradual and the time derivative can be neglected with the numerical setup investigated earlier i e case 1 and case 4 with ū 6 1 0 6 m s we perform a transient simulation with initial condition f 0 which is considerably different from the final solution over the domain and compare transient solutions with the steady state solution fig 6 a shows a relative difference between transient and steady state solutions indicating that at about 70 case 1 and 150 case 4 hours their relative difference becomes smaller than 1 the time to reach the steady state is roughly equal to travel time in the entire domain plus diffusion time into the stagnant zones from the matrix the travel time is l x ū where l x is the length of the block and ū is mean velocity diffusion time is d l o w k 2 d l o c a l l o w k where d lowk is thickness of inclusion and d local lowk is local dispersion diffusion coefficient more importantly as shown in fig 6 b the block effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient becomes practically the same as the one obtained from the steady state equation after around only 20 and 100h for case 1 and case 4 respectively this indicates that the value of the dispersion coefficient is not very sensitive to the assumption that the time derivative can be neglected this is an important point because changes in most of the domain are bound to be gradual with periods much large than these times only near injection points may the conditions change rapidly and thus not conform with the assumption of local equilibrium it is important to clarify that local equilibrium does not mean that conditions do not change but only that the conditions change slowly enough using a smaller block as a consequence of using a finer grid reduces the relaxation time and thus makes the local equilibrium condition easier to achieve also local equilibrium does not mean that the concentration in low conductivity zones is the same as the concentration in high conductivity ones rather the opposite is true since dispersion originates from the fact that mass is distributed between high and low conductivity areas 5 results of numerical simulations in this section we apply the proposed approach to investigate the block effective longitudinal dispersion for different geometry of the inclusions permeability contrast flow velocity and local diffusion dispersion coefficients for illustration fig 7 shows the velocity fluctuation u 1 normalized concentration fluctuation f 1 and their product u 1 f 1 for case 1 with var lnk 1 69 what determines the magnitude of dispersion is the degree that velocity fluctuations correlate with higher concentrations fluctuations the fluctuations are similar in appearance to what one sees at the front of a plume as in fig 2 higher values in the high velocity parts and low velocity in the low permeability inclusions it is also the negative of what one sees at the back of the plume that s where the similarity stops however because for an individual plume the mean transport velocity at the front is higher than at the back hence the fast breakthrough and long tail in our analysis there is no front and back because only captures a part of a larger plume one can see that the locations responsible for the generation of dispersion are the low conductivity inclusions because that is where both velocity and concentration fluctuations are the largest and are the most correlated the image of normalized concentration fluctuation f 1 reveals the micro structure of velocity fluctuations one can see that these fluctuations are determined mainly by the fluctuations in velocity and one can see how local dispersion though it is small may have some effect because it acts over steep slopes and over the whole domain one can also see why higher local dispersion coefficients suppress f 1 and thus lower the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient for the block the covariation term u 1 f 1 is plotted for the four cases investigated in figs 8 and 9 considering mild and high heterogeneity these maps are illustrative since they allow visualizing where the dispersion originates from as well as the distinct features and spatial distribution of the covariation term in the domains with different geometry of the low permeability inclusions positive values add to dispersive mixing and negative values subtract all figures show that the low permeability inclusions are closely associated with the generation of dispersive fluxes this of course is because most mass moves with about the same velocity in the permeable background sand whereas the mass in inclusions moves more slowly the geometry of inclusions plays an important role and higher values of the covariation term are computed for the elongated structures if there were no local mixing mass entering inclusions would travel the whole length through advection alone and would be more delayed compared to mass in the permeable background matrix which would result in higher dispersion rates at the other extreme large transverse local dispersion would allow mass to escape from the slow flow zones reducing dispersion rates the pictures we see are the result of interplay between advection and diffusive mass transfer in the heterogeneous block at the fine scale cf guswa and freyberg 2000 in fact in the cases with elongated inclusions case 3 and case 4 mass transfer limitations between the permeable matrix and the low k zones have a significant effect the less the local mass transfer rates the higher the hydrodynamic dispersion at the block scale the patterns of u 1 f 1 is similar for the mild and high heterogeneity setups but the magnitude is different and with high contrast structures more dispersion is generated due to the stronger effect of low velocity and limited mass transfer in the slow zones fig 10 shows the computed block effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient normalized by molecular diffusion for the four heterogeneous domains fig 1 considering a range of grid péclet numbers p e ū l d a q where l 0 001m is the grid size including groundwater flow velocities characteristic of most hydrogeologic applications in each case three low k values of 1 4 10 4 blue 1 4 10 5 red and 1 4 10 6 m s black were considered to investigate the effect of permeability contrast on the upscaled dispersion coefficients for the mildly heterogeneous var lnk 1 k fields with small inclusions case 1 and case 2 blue circles effective longitudinal dispersion scales linearly with velocity almost throughout the entire range of péclet numbers pe 10 1 103 showing that the scheidegger parameterization for the upscaled effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient is valid in this velocity regime the results of the numerical experiments can be also clearly visualized by plotting the normalized block effective dispersivity as d l ul as function of péclet number which becomes constant for the advective regime pe 5 10 fig 11 a and b note that in the low péclet number regime 10 1 where the block effective dispersivity has not yet reached a constant value molecular diffusion is the main mechanism contributing to dispersion for the k fields with longitudinally elongated inclusions case 3 and case 4 blue circles normalized dispersion does not become constant until pe 100 because of the effect of diffusion and mass transfer limitations however in these mildly heterogeneous domains the scheidegger parameterization is likely to work well in practice because the change in actual dispersion coefficient is small thus the assumption may not change significantly the results of transport simulations for mid to highly heterogeneous var lnk 1 configurations red and black markers in figs 10 and 11 the values of block scale longitudinal dispersion are considerably higher the trend of d l still shows the almost linear relationship to pe for the cases with small low permeability inclusions a and b in fact in these setups the stagnant flow zones are relatively small compared to the entire block length and advection is more important than diffusion thus suggesting that the scheidegger parameterization is still valid for these cases the normalized longitudinal dispersivities in fig 11 a and b are shown to be constant for pe 50 and for 1 pe 50 the transitional or power law regime fried and combarnous 1971 bijeljic et al 2004 is observed where both advection and diffusion affect the effective dispersion dispersivity for case 2 is less variable over the entire range of pe compared to one for case 1 because the length of the vertical low permeability inclusions along the flow direction is shorter so that diffusion affects the dispersion less significantly the observed behavior is different for the last two heterogeneous configurations panels c and d in figs 10 and 11 the elongated shape of the low k inclusions and their small permeability results in higher effective longitudinal dispersion and cause a deviation from the linear relationship between the computed d l and the péclet number in these setups high dispersion values originate from mass transfer limitation between the flowing fluid in the high permeable area and immobile pore volume in the low permeable lenses in fact the elongated geometry of the inclusions along the main flow direction results in diffusive mass transfer limitation over larger interfaces between the permeable matrix and the low permeable material within the inclusions solute in low permeability zones is forced to move slowly unless diffusion allows it to escape sideways thus diffusion plays an important role in how much dispersion will actually take place slow mass transfer causes considerable variability in the velocity and concentration fluctuations which results in larger dispersion for these configurations the effective dispersivity can approach a constant values only at very large péclet numbers the outcomes of the numerical experiments in the different setups clearly shows that effective dispersion is sensitive to the permeability contrast and to the structure of k we have also performed multitracer computational experiments to evaluate the influence of compound specific aqueous diffusion coefficients on the upscaled effective longitudinal dispersion we consider a multispecies solute transport problem with four tracers with different aqueous diffusion coefficients d aq 10 10 5 10 10 10 9 2 10 9 m2 s simultaneously transported in the heterogeneous domains such variability of aqueous diffusion coefficients covers a representative range of aqueous solute diffusivities in groundwater transport problems rolle et al 2013a the outcomes of the multitracer simulations are reported in fig 12 as upscaled block effective longitudinal dispersivity α l as a function of the seepage velocity for the four configurations of heterogeneous porous media considering small var lnk 0 2 and large var lnk 4 6 conductivity contrasts the results show different effective dispersivity under diffusion dominated conditions and very low flow velocity with larger values of α l for the solutes with lower aqueous diffusion particularly when a large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and the inclusions is considered such behavior shows the importance of compound specific mass transfer limitations in which solutes with lower aqueous diffusivity undergo a more pronounced longitudinal spreading in the heterogeneous domain when the flow regime becomes advection dominated i e higher values of seepage velocity the outcomes are different for the distinct cases with small distributed inclusions case 1 and case 2 the effective dispersivity converges to a unique value independent of the diffusion coefficient of the transported species with elongated low permeability inclusions case 3 and case 4 the results show a distinct value of effective α l for the different solutes particularly when a large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the matrix and the inclusions is considered finally at very large velocities the effective α l for the different solutes converges to a constant value as observed for the cases with small inclusions fig 12a and b 6 discussion opinions diverge in hydrogeology regarding the topic of hydrodynamic dispersion in geologic formations some apparently do not even consider dispersion as a process of fundamental physical significance but rather an artifact of how velocity is resolved however unless one can resolve velocity variability at the scale of millimeters or less the effects of unresolved variability are real and indeed prominent the heterogeneity encountered in geologic formations is both pronounced and highly structured and has major effects on the way solute plumes are conveyed and dispersed numerical models are increasingly used to solve flow and transport problems in such heterogeneous formations this work has dealt with the persistent practical question then is how to capture the effects of velocity variability at scales smaller than those resolved by the grid used in the numerical method it has re examined the validity of the fickian model and the scheidegger parameterization of dispersion coefficients which are widely used and yet widely disputed plumes exhibit scale dependent rates of spreading irregular shapes fast breakthrough and long tails gelhar et al 1992 carrera 1993 all of which seem to invalidate the fickian model however whether dispersive transport at the scale of a block in a numerical model is fickian or non fickian is a completely different issue fiori et al 2013 the reason is simply that dispersion of plumes and dispersion in a single block are processes evolving at different scales it is important to appreciate that the grid should be fine enough to resolve the variability of concentration at the desired level and thus the grid size should be one tenth or even less than the smallest wavelengths of the concentration variability that must be represented this is the case for all numerical models even flow models like modflow e g lal 2000 otherwise there is significant error in representing a function by discrete values independently of the model and parameters used to solve the flow or transport problem associated with this requirement is that changes are not rapid because rapid changes create spatial fluctuations like advancing fronts at scales smaller than those that the model can resolve these issues are known and are the reason why the grid size must be chosen carefully reilly and harbaugh 2004 and variable grid size must often be employed if a coarse grid is selected important features of heterogeneity but also variability in the concentration may be left out in any case one cannot hope that the model can predict at scales not resolved by the model the method of analysis in this work defines the problem as how to capture the effects of unresolved small scale heterogeneity on the resolved grid scale variability of concentration we show that under certain conditions these effects are captured by the fickian model the conditions are pretty much the same as the requirements that the proper grid has been selected i e gradually varying concentration in many applications concentration varies gradually in space and time as plumes transport and evolve over decades for such problems the fickian model for block dispersion is appropriate in some other applications like field experiments or at site remediation near injection points the concentration function may change rapidly thus the condition of local equilibrium conditions in a block are not met and the fickian model may be inaccurate in such a case one can either select to refine the grid or to adopt a non equilibrium model like dual domain dual porosity dddp it is important to recognize though that the issue is not whether an equilibrium or a non equilibrium model is right for a certain formation but how fast the changes are in relation to the relaxation time of a block for example even if we consider that a medium conforms to the ideal dddp model but the imposed changes are slow in relation to the characteristic time for the two domains to equilibrate then effectively the dddp medium acts as a single domain medium with a certain dispersion coefficient liu and kitanidis 2012 parker and van genuchten 1984 parker and valocchi 1986 the next issue we examine is whether the dispersion coefficient is a characteristic of the block and the solute and can be parameterized by using resolved quantities of velocity and concentration the answer is mostly yes but there is a small effect from unresolved velocity and concentration fluctuations in neighboring blocks as shown in figs 4 and 5 the uncertainty from these effects is negligible under ideal conditions like stationary variability with correlation length small in relation to the size of the block even for more unfavorable cases the uncertainty is small particularly for large velocity cases for which dispersion matters most in this work we chose to keep it simple and just quantify the uncertainty rather than seek better methods to account for the effects from fluctuations in neighboring blocks next we consider the validity of the standard scheidegger parameterization expressed through dispersivity coefficients we study through computational experiments longitudinal dispersion in a certain direction the results indicate that the scheidegger parameterization is a good approximation for stationary media such as those with multiple small inclusions of low permeability in a higher conductivity background as shown by the simulation of case 1 and case 2 panels a and b in figs 10 and 11 however geologic heterogeneity is structured for example clay laminae with preferential orientation are much more likely than clay lumps randomly distributed for such cases e g case 3 and case 4 the scheidegger limit is reached only for large pe see panels c and d in figs 10 and 11 for velocity values in the commonly encountered range the effective dispersivity gradually increases over two orders of magnitude and at high velocity values can have a much larger value than the ones used in practice equaling or even potentially exceeding the dimension of the block interestingly two different solutes with distinct molecular diffusion coefficients experience different rates of hydrodynamic dispersion and in fact the one with lower molecular diffusion coefficient experiencing a higher dispersion rate as shown in fig 12 these are features that are usually not included in modeling studies the analysis carried out in this work allowed us to investigate block scale longitudinal dispersion in heterogeneous domains with different permeability contrast and geometry of low permeability inclusions particular attention has been dedicated to explain and visualize the origin of block dispersion from velocity and concentration fluctuations to analyze the interplay between the fundamental processes of advection and diffusion and to investigate the important role of mass transfer limitations in determining the values of effective dispersion the method is rigorous but at the same time simple enough to be appealing for both researchers and practitioners interested in modeling groundwater transport problems as we discussed above the method is not unconditionally valid since it is subject to the requirements of gradual changes leading to a condition of physical equilibrium however as we have shown in our analysis these conditions are not particularly restrictive and apply to many situations typically encountered for transport of contaminant plumes in the subsurface therefore we believe that the proposed approach can represent a significant step forward to improve our capability to accurately describe solute transport in heterogeneous formations we also hope that the method could contribute to shorten the distance between academia and practice in a field of hydrogeology that is inherently complex and rich of future challenges in terms of process understanding methods development and

summarizes results of numerical experiments for the case of stationary conductivity with correlation length that is small compared to the size of the block for small variance the classical first order analysis based on perturbation theory e g dagan 1984 1994 predicts that the whole domain or large block dispersivity in the longitudinal direction is a 1 α l σ ln k 2 i ln k x where σ ln k 2 is the variance of the log k field and i ln k x is the integral scale in the x direction which concurs with the length parameter for the isotropic exponential covariance function we will use it to compute the block coefficient and compare with our results first we consider the longitudinal dispersivity using the small perturbation method for 2 d log normal random fields whose geometric mean is 10 3 m s and covariance function is exponential σ ln k 2 exp r l where r is the distance between two spatial points with scale parameter l 0 01m and σ ln k 2 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 from theory their whole domain dispersivity is l σ ln k 2 0 001 0 025 and 0 005 respectively due to the equivalence between the integral scale and the scale parameter l for the exponential covariance kernel then we generate 100 realizations for each log random k field and compute the block effective dispersivity α l d l ū the size of the domain we consider here is 1m 1m and discretized with dx dy 0 001m a realization of lnk

results show that the proposed method yields consistent dispersivity values to the one obtained from the perturbation method 
1663,this study presents a set of laboratory scale transport experiments and numerical simulations evaluating carboxymethyl cellulose cmc polymer stabilized nano scale zero valent iron nzvi transport the experiments performed in a glass walled two dimensional 2d porous medium system were conducted to identify the effects of water specific discharge and cmc concentration on nzvi transport and to produce data for model validation the transport and movement of a tracer lissamine green b lgb dye cmc and cmc nzvi were evaluated through analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs at the outlets the time lapsed images of the plume and retained nzvi in the sandbox the cmc mass recovery was 95 when injected alone and about 65 when the cmc nzvi mixture was used however the mean residence time of cmc was significantly higher than that of lgb of significance for field implementation viscous fingering was observed in water displacement of previously injected cmc and cmc nzvi the mass recovery of nzvi was lower 50 than cmc recovery due to attachment onto sand grain surfaces consecutive cmc nzvi injections showed higher nzvi recovery in the second injection a factor to be considered in field trials with successive cmc nzvi injections transport of lgb cmc and nzvi were modeled using a flow and transport model considering lgb and cmc as solutes and nzvi as a colloid with variable solution viscosity due to changes in cmc concentrations the simulation results matched the experimental observations and provided estimates of transport parameters including attachment efficiency that can be used to predict cmc stabilized nzvi transport in similar porous media although the extent of viscous fingering may be underpredicted the experimental and simulation results indicated that increasing specific discharge had a greater effect on decreasing cmc nzvi attachment efficiency corresponding to greater possible travel distances in the field than increasing cmc concentration keywords nanoscale zero valent iron solute and colloid transport viscous fingering 1 introduction groundwater resources are threatened by a large number of contaminated sites worldwide in the usa alone the office of solid waste and emergency response oswer tracks over 530 000 contaminated sites that occupy almost 23 million acres land epa 2013 an earlier report showed that clean up of about 355 000 contaminated sites in the usa would require between 174 and 253 billion epa 2005 across europe 340 000 sites have been detected as contaminated jrc 2014 cost efficient and reliable techniques are required to remediate these sites in situ methods of remediation particularly passive systems may help fulfill this demand one of the earliest passive in situ methods was the zero valent iron zvi permeable reactive barrier mueller et al 2012 zvi is capable of treating chlorinated compounds through reductive dichlorination and metal removal through surface mediated mechanisms barnes et al 2010 gillham and o hannesin 1994 liu et al 2005 o carroll et al 2013 sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 zhan et al 2008 zhou et al 2011 this has generated a widespread interest in the use of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi as a direct improvement of the technique through the application of nanotechnology the specific surface area of an nzvi particle can be 30 times greater than a micron scale zvi particle increasing the rate of contaminant removal by one to two orders of magnitude wang and zhang 1997 furthermore nzvi particles can be directly injected into the subsurface and are small enough to migrate through many porous matrices however the particles rapidly aggregate due to magnetic and van der waals inter particle forces reducing the advantages of a nanoscale particle and resulting in deposition and filtration farrell et al 2000 phenrat et al 2007 the aggregation tendency of nzvi particles has been counteracted through the use of polymers polyelectrolytes or surfactants that provide electro static and steric repulsion fatisson et al 2010 he and zhao 2007 2008 johnson et al 2009 laumann et al 2014 phenrat et al 2008 2009 wang et al 2013 stabilization can be conducted pre or post nzvi synthesis generally pre stabilization includes the stabilizing agent in the synthesis reaction to immediately control particle aggregation whereas post stabilization disaggregates nzvi while introducing the stabilizer post synthesis stabilization has been found to be more cost effective but also more laborious and produces less stable particles o carroll et al 2013 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc is a water soluble organic polymer which interacts strongly with nzvi particles and has been widely studied for use as a stabilizer cmc consists of a cellulose molecule modified by the replacement of the ch2oh group with a carboxymethyl group as cmc is a polyelectrolyte that contains both carboxylate and hydroxyl groups cmc can strongly interact with and stabilize nzvi particles in addition cmc is low cost and environmentally friendly making it attractive for use in remediation applications he et al 2007 cmc stabilized nzvi particles cmc nzvi are most commonly prepared through the reduction of aqueous fe ii or fe iii using sodium borohydride he et al 2007 with cmc added to interact with the nanoparticles as they are formed fatisson et al 2010 cmc nzvi particles show promise for use in groundwater remediation applications but require further investigation to fully understand transport behavior in porous media the transport behavior of polymer nzvi and cmc nzvi in one dimensional flow columns has been well studied he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 li et al 2015 mystrioti et al 2015 raychoudhury et al 2010 2012 2014 saleh et al 2008 tiraferri and sethi 2009 tosco and sethi 2010 colloid filtration theory cft has been applied to model cmc nzvi transport behavior however work in this area has suggested that cft requires coupling with straining aggregation and settling mechanisms for better model results he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 o carroll et al 2013 raychoudhury et al 2012 2014 furthermore one dimensional column studies do not provide the level of detail required to assess the transport performance of nzvi at site conditions as flow is limited to a single direction and porewater velocities are typically far higher than those encountered in typical field applications o carroll et al 2013 bennett et al 2010 studied cmc stabilized nzvi mobility and reactivity in shallow aquifer at field scale for treatment of chlorinated ethenes their results indicated that nzvi particles were mobile in the aquifer however due to interactions between the particles and aquifer sediments the mobility declined significantly in a short time in 13h krol et al 2013 studied nzvi mobility at the field scale using a 3d compositional simulator with cft to model cmc nzvi transport in the field studies of bennett et al 2010 their findings showed that the increase in viscosity due to the cmc solution affected mobility by altering the hydraulic properties of the system and by decreasing nvzi attachment these effects were especially noticeable during push pull tests suggesting the need to further investigate cmc nzvi transport behavior across varying porewater velocities at conditions comparable to those in the field recent work has attempted to more closely mimic field conditions at the lab scale through the use of two dimensional experiments kanel et al 2008 investigated poly acrylic acid stabilized nzvi in a 2d system presenting transport visualization and demonstrating that a density coupled groundwater flow model may be used to simulate density effects in the two dimensional system phenrat et al 2010 studied the effects of nzvi particle concentrations on the transport of polymer modified fe0 nanoparticles in a lab scale 2d heterogeneous porous media system they demonstrated that heterogeneity significantly impacted the nzvi deposition pattern where polymer modified nzvi movement followed the preferential flow pathways and the particle transported better at lower particle concentration chowdhury et al 2012 studied cmc nzvi transport in a lab scale 2d system in low permeability porous media enhanced by electrokinetics busch et al 2014 studied the transport of carbon colloid supported nzvi in a 2d system presenting a visualization and transport behavior of the particles li et al 2016 studied cmc nzvi transport behavior in a 2d environment varying the injection solution cmc concentration injection velocity and media grain size to observe the effects on transport their results indicated that nzvi retention in the sandbox was not influenced by straining and change in nzvi recovery and reduction in media hydraulic conductivity depended on the cmc concentration and solution injection velocity the work done to date on cmc nzvi transport in 2d experimental systems has not yet combined the transport visualization experiments with the cft based numerical simulation and showed the effects of specific discharge and cmc concentration on nzvi transport the objective of this study was to address this need and to improve the understanding of the transport behavior of cmc stabilized nzvi in porous media through laboratory scale 2d experiments and cft based numerical modeling the effects of solution viscosity due to change in polymer concentration and effects of specific discharge on the transport of cmc and cmc nzvi were identified as these are key control variables in field applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 glass walled sandbox a laboratory scale two dimensional 2d glass walled sandbox was used for the transport experiments shown in fig s1 and described in section s1 1 in supplementary information si this sandbox was also used in the studies of o carroll and sleep 2007 and ye et al 2009 two glass plates 0 019m thick were sealed to a 0 013m thick rectangular aluminum frame with viton rubber gaskets and silicone glue the inside dimensions of the space created for porous media were 0 55m in length and 0 45m in height the distance between two glass plates was 0 014m there was a clear well at the left end of the box with volume of 20ml that acted as a continuous inlet for the injected fluid in addition there was a well 3mm od ss tube installed from the top of the box for point injections the location of the point injection was at 0 05m from the left end and 0 23m from the top of the box on the outlet end of the box there were three clear wells each with 2ml volume and 0 02m length centered at distances of 0 035m 0 23m and 0 435m from the top of the box the sandbox was wet packed as uniformly as possible in layers with silica sand of grain size ranging from 425 to 600μm each layer of sand packing was 0 01m thick the sand was acid washed with 5 hno3 and rinsed with distilled water several times the packed sand bulk density was 1710kg m3 and the porosity was 0 35 the sand was saturated with de aired distilled water hydraulic tests resulted an average permeability of the sand of 1 01 10 12 m2 2 2 experimental set up a schematic diagram of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the experimental system included a the glass walled sandbox b a dual head peristaltic pump masterflex l s with easy load ii pump heads 77201 60 to feed the system

containers 500ml and 2l g nitrogen gas n2 tank with regulator h a light source i a computer controlled digital camera canon eos on a tripod support and j a dark box enclosure 0 7m 0 6m 2m to house the digital camera for image collection the pyrex feed bottles 500ml for injection of test solutions lgb cmc and nzvi solutions and 2l for injection of flushing distilled water dw were connected to a n2 gas tank keeping them under positive pressure 1psi to maintain anaerobic conditions in the bottles the peristaltic pump injected either the test solution or dw into the sandbox a 3 way valve valve 1 was used to control the switching from test solution to the flushing dw another 3 way valve valve 2 was used to direct the test solution either to the continuous inlet clear well or to the point injection well depending on the test condition a piezometer and a pressure transducer both connected to the inlet manifold were used to monitor the pressure at the inlet side of the sandbox the pressure transducer connected to the sandbox was used to monitor the sandbox internal pressure as a safety measure the piezometer connected to the combined outlet manifold was used to determine the water pressure head at the outlet end of the sandbox the outlet samples were collected at the combined outlet for determination of the lgb cmc and nzvi breakthrough curves in some experiments the outlets were kept separate in that case the three outlet tubes top middle and bottom were connected to three separate piezometers and separate samples were collected at any time step from these outlets for top mid and bottom outlet btcs the sandbox was placed at one end of an enclosure and backlit with a light source consisting of 4 fluorescence tube lamps and a 5 mm thick white polypropylene light diffuser plate a digital camera controlled with a computer was used to automatically capture images with pixel resolution of 3888 2592 during the experiments at a specified frequency the camera was placed in the enclosure at the end opposite of the sandbox these images captured the light transmitted through the sandbox 1 4cm thick and showed the cumulative effect of lgb or nzvi concentration at any location in the 2d sandbox 2 3 preparation of tracer cmc and nzvi cmc solutions lissamine green b lgb c27h25n2nao7s2 mw 572 62g mol from sigma andrich was used as a conservative tracer to characterize the sand dispersivity and homogeneity a stock lgb solution of 2000mg l was prepared in distilled milli q mq water and stored in refrigerator at 4 c the final lgb concentration in the test solution was 20mg l which was prepared by adding 5ml of lgb stock solution 2000mg l in 495ml of de aired distilled mq water on the day of the transport experiment carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt cmc na c6h7o2 oh x och2coona y n where x 2 21 y 0 79 and n 400 with molecular weight of 90kda from sigma aldrich was used to prepare the polymer solution the polymer solution was prepared in mq water at two different concentrations 2000mg l 0 2 w v and 8000mg l 0 8 w v the desired amount of cmc na powder was dissolved in the required volume of de aired mq water by stirring the mixture with magnetic stir bar and stir plate for 4 to 12h until the solution homogeneity was achieved the viscosities of these solutions were measured using the falling ball method and the viscosities were found to be 1 8cp and 3 9cp respectively the viscosity of the cmc na solution varied linearly for the concentration range of 0 2 to 1 data shown in fig s2 in si the solutions were stored in refrigerator at 4 c before use the nzvi was synthesized in cmc na polymer solution in an anaerobic glovebox using the sodium borohydride nabh4 titration method for a final nzvi concentration of 1000mg l to start 1 145g of feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 30ml of de aired dw for 1g l nzvi in 0 8 cmc na solution 54ml of cmc na 3 stock solution were added to the 30ml of de aired feso4 7h2o solution 0 312g of nabh4 dissolved in 30ml of de aired dw were added drop wise to a continuously stirred 54ml ferrous sulphate cmc na solution finally the volume was brought to 200ml by adding an additional 86ml of de aired dw to the nzvi cmc solution after an additional 20min of stirring the solution container was capped to prevent nzvi oxidation by air after being removed from the anaerobic chamber for all transport experiments the nzvi cmc solutions were prepared on the day of experiment except for cmc na solutions that were prepared the day before and left stirring until the injection time when cmc na and lgb were mixed to prepare the test solutions the cmc na solution was prepared as described above and lgb stock solution was added to the solution on the day of experiment to achieve the desired lgb concentration 2 4 experiment procedures hydraulic tests hydraulic tests were performed prior to and after each experiment to determine average permeability from measurements of flow rate and the water head differences between the inlet manifold piezometer or transducer and the outlet manifold piezometer average permeability k and specific discharge v were determined using the following equations 1 v q a k μ p f p i l where q is the discharge rate m3 s k is the permeability m2 a is the cross sectional area m2 μ is water viscosity pa s p f is the outlet pressure pa p i is the inlet pressure pa l is the length m and v is the specific discharge m s some representative specific discharge vs head loss data in sandbox pack 1 are presented in fig s5 in si transport tests the sandbox was flushed with 10 to 20 pv of de aired dw for 5 to 10days with approximately 8h per day flushing before any transport experiment flow measurements and hydraulic tests were performed and background samples were collected from the sandbox outlet prior to the test solution injection the transport experiments were conducted at two different pump settings which provided the average flow rates of 7 8 0 3ml min and 5 6 0 1ml min the corresponding specific discharges were 1 8m d and 1 3m d the test solution was injected either through the point injection well from the top or through the continuous inlet clear well from the lateral the outflow samples were collected either from separated outlets or combined outlets the containers with solution and water were closed tight to avoid air contact and kept under positive pressure with nitrogen gas as a guarantee of anaerobic conditions the test solution injection time for all experiments varied between 5min to 51min 0 023 to 0 26 pv depending on the test condition the test solution injection was followed by de aired dw deoxygenated de aired dw flush for 300 to 600min 2 to 3 pv depending on the test condition samples during the experiment were collected every 2 to 30min 0 013 to 0 19 pv depending on the test solution injection and flushing progress similarly images were taken using the digital camera in the dark enclosure every 1 to 30min thirty three transport experiments were performed using three different packings pack 1 pack 2 and pack 3 table 1 efforts were made to pack the sandbox similarly for these three packings in each packing several transport tests were conducted by varying the specific discharge cmc na concentration test solution injection configuration continuous inlet clear well pulse injection and point injection and outlet configuration separate outlets and combined outlet one cmc nzvi transport test was performed for each packing as a final test except for pack 2 where an additional cmc nzvi transport test was conducted keeping all the conditions same to determine the effects of multiple injections table 1 presents the experiment conditions for all the tests in the three packings 2 5 sample analyses lgb the concentration of lgb in the samples was measured from the light absorbance using an uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 set at a wavelength of 630nm a calibration curve was prepared for known standard concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 50mg l three ml of sample was transferred to a quartz cuvette with 1cm of light path and the absorbance was measured cmc na cmc na in samples was analyzed using a total organic carbon toc analyzer o i corporation aurora model 1030 following the standard method for toc method 5310 d apha 2005 the samples were diluted with mq water as required to bring the concentration within the linear range of calibration curve 0 1 to 0 5ml sample was added to 40ml of mq water in a glass vial and mixed the samples were acidified with 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 to a ph2 or less nzvi analysis for nzvi content in the effluent samples could not be performed as the samples came in contact with air during the discharge from the sandbox and nzvi was oxidized to some extent to determine the normalized nzvi breakthrough curve nzvi in the cmc nzvi influent solution and effluent samples was oxidized nzviox by slowly purging compressed air through the solutions for 5min the nzviox was measured using a colorimetric method developed by johnson et al 2013 light absorbance of the oxidized sample in quartz cuvettes with 1cm of light path was measured at 360nm wavelength using an uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 since the concentration was normalized by the influent solution nzviox for each batch of cmc nzvi test solution a series of dilutions 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 times were prepared from the oxidized influent solution and a calibration curve was prepared to confirm the validity of the normalized btc of nzviox the influent cmc nzvi solution sample and several outflow samples were analyzed for total iron using the acid digestion and o phenanthroline colorimetric method standard methods for total iron analysis 3500 fe phenanthroline method apha 2005 the normalized total iron concentration c c0 of the selected samples were compared to the normalized nzviox concentrations and the values were found to be similar attached iron the collected sand samples from the sandbox after cmc nzvi transport tests were analyzed for total iron by digesting 1g of sand in 50ml of mq water in 125ml erlenmeyer flask with 2ml of concentrated hcl and 2ml of hydroxylamine solution 100g l several ptfe chips were added into the flask to avoid rigorous boiling and splashing of solution the digested solution 10 to 15ml was used for total iron analysis standard methods 3500 fe apha 2005 this provided the attached iron to the sand in the sandbox expressed as g of attached iron per kg of sand 2 6 nzvi characterization the synthesized nzvi in cmc na solution was characterized for particle size by dynamic light scattering dls and transmission electron microscopy tem methods and stability of the nzvi particle by measuring light absorbance with uv vis spectrophotometer with time the detailed procedures of these analyses are presented in the supplementary information section s1 3 in si the stability analysis by uv vis spectrophotometer at 590nm showed fig s3a in si that settling of particle occurred relatively quickly until approximately 300min in which time absorbance decreased by 15 after this period the settling curve showed a slow and linear decline in absorbance decreasing a further 8 over 1100min there was no change in spectra pattern over the measurement period indicating that the observed data was not due to oxidation extrapolating the linear portion of the curve from 400min yielded a stability time of the nzvi of 98 9h r2 0 988 this result confirms that nzvi was stable during the span of the experiment without forming large aggregates the variation of particle size and size distribution were observed using a dls analyzer nano particle analyzer sz100 horiba scientific over the same duration as of the transport experiment period and no significant change was observed the z average size of the particle was 633 30nm after 9h of synthesis fig s3b in si which was higher than the expected value the dls measured particle size near the base of the cuvette and therefore might only be measuring the size of the larger particles the size of the synthesized nzvi in cmc na solution was also measured by using tem hitachi ht7700 the tem images fig s3c in si indicated formation of aggregate size 500nm 2 7 moment analysis of btc the concentrations of lgb cmc and nzvi in the effluent samples at any time c t were normalized by the injection concentration c 0 and the normalized breakthrough curves btcs were plotted for each experiment temporal moment analysis of the output breakthrough data was performed to determine the mean residence time in the sandbox and mass recovery in the effluent mean residence time t m was determined from the difference between centroids of the output btcs and input pulse the equations are provided in the si section s1 4 2 8 modeling lgb cmc and nzvi transport transport of lgb cmc nzvi particle was modeled using the 3d multiphase flow and transport model compsim sleep and sykes 1993 lgb was considered as conservative solute though nzvi was coated with cmc na they were considered as separate species with cmc na being a solute and nzvi being a colloid the cmc nzvi solution viscosity due to mixing with the water in the sandbox for any time and space was calculated using the grunberg and nissan equation poling et al 2001 2 log μ sol x poly log μ poly x nzvi log μ nzvi log μ water where x nzvi and x poly are the mole fractions of nzvi and polymer in suspension respectively while μ poly μ water and μ nzvi are the polymer water and nzvi viscosities respectively water viscosity is known the polymer viscosity was measured for different concentrations and nzvi viscosity was assumed to have negligible effect on solution viscosity compared to the effect of cmc colloid filtration theory cft based equations were incorporated into the model for nzvi transport krol et al 2013 where the single collector efficiency η 0 was calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and the attachment efficiency α was used as a fitting parameter using these two parameters and other system and operation parameters the attachment rate coefficient k att s 1 which serves as a first order removal term in the transport equation and describes the process of colloid filtration was calculated using the following equation 3 k att 3 1 n 2 d c α η 0 v p where d c is the collector grain size sand particle diameter m v p is the pore water velocity m s 1 α is the attachment or sticking efficiency n is the sand porosity η 0 is the theoretical collision efficiency or the single collector contact efficiency the inlet end of the sandbox inlet clear well was set as constant flux boundary and the outlet clear wells on the right end were set as constant head boundaries the top and bottom of the sandbox were no flow boundaries the 2d sandbox space was discretized with 2 5mm by 2 5mm grid blocks due to the unavoidable non uniformity in sand packing the velocity of the lgb dye plume front for a continuous inlet pulse injection was varied across the sand layers to incorporate the layer wise media heterogeneity into the modeling the sandbox space was divided into 45 layers as the height of each layer placed during packing was 0 01m from the collected images of lgb dye in the sandbox at different times for a continuous inlet pulse injection the average velocity of lgb dye plume front in each layer was calculated these dye plume front velocities were assumed to be equal to the pore water velocity at each layer a grid of 45 by 55 blocks each with 0 01m 0 01m was superimposed on the collected images at different time steps and the front location was identified fig s4 in si knowing the time step gap and dye plume front location the average velocity in each layer was calculated with the given boundary conditions of the system solution flow rate inlet and outlet piezometer readings for hydraulic heads sand media porosity assumed constant for the entire sandbox dimensions of the sandbox and calculated pore water velocity the permeability of the sand in each layer was calculated these permeability values were utilized in the model to capture media heterogeneity the permeabilities ranged from 8 58 10 13 m2 to 1 37 10 12 m2 between layers and the average permeability was determined to be 1 01 10 12 m2 table s1 in si presents the values for all the parameters used in the modeling of cmc nzvi transport 3 results and discussion 3 1 btc analysis from all the analyzed results the average recoveries were 97 9 n 17 101 6 n 9 and 40 11 n 4 for lgb cmc and nzvi respectively lgb and cmc both behaved as conservative solute whereas the nzvi was attached in significant amounts the average cmc recovery was lower 66 7 n 2 when cmc nzvi mixture was injected as nzvi was stabilized with cmc polymer during the synthesis higher retention of nzvi in the sandbox also caused a significant amount cmc retention table 2 presents the average values of the initial breakthrough time mean residence time and peak normalized concentration of lgb cmc and nzvi for all the transport experiments conducted with point injection at specific discharge of 1 8m d and 1 3m d the injection time for the test solutions was 5 5min the results in table 2 show that at 1 3 and 1 8m d specific discharge the initial breakthrough time ibt measured based on the first concentration above the method detection limit was greater for lgb cmc mixtures than for lgb alone due to the effect of the high viscosity of cmc and possibly some sorption of cmc to the sand in the box increasing the cmc concentration from 0 2 to 0 8 also increased the breakthrough time due to the higher viscosity of the higher cmc concentration solution injected both cmc and lgb came out of the system at similar time in the lgb cmc experiments the mean residence time mrt of lgb and cmc increased with increased cmc concentration for both specific discharges however for the lgb cmc mixture the mrt of cmc was significantly higher than that of lgb the peak c c0 of both lgb and cmc decreased for increased cmc concentration and decreased specific discharge the lower specific discharge or higher cmc concentration caused longer residence times in the sandbox and allowed more time for diffusion to dilute concentrations 3 2 visualization of transport experiments 3 2 1 lgb cmc injections fig 2 presents a visual comparison of lgb plume green in the images movements in the sandbox for three experiments with i lgb only injected through the clear well ii lgb cmc mixture solution injected through the clear well and iii lgb solution flushing a point injection of cmc solution variations in the front and trailing edge of the lgb plume fig 2a are evident due to the variation in sand permeability across layers in the case of transport of the lgb cmc mixture fig 2b the plume front as indicated by the lgb dye was smoother compared to the lgb only solution case due to the higher viscosity of the mixture solution compared to lgb solution the trailing edge of the lgb cmc plume where water was displacing more viscous cmc showed significant fingering of the water into the lgb cmc plume nicolaides et al 2015 the non uniform distribution of the fingers across the height of the sandbox was due to the differences in sand permeability and probably due to the difference in solution density the lgb cmc mixture density was determined to be 1 005kg m3 and 1 008kg m3 for 0 2 and 0 8 cmc solution respectively these viscous fingers caused higher spreading of the lgb cmc plume and longer residence time in the sandbox these also caused more variation in concentration in the btc and contributed to longer tail due to the higher viscosity of lgb cmc solution higher pressure difference across the sandbox was required to maintain same specific discharge this pressure difference was increased with time initially during the lgb cmc injection fig s6 in si li et al 2016 also found significant loss in hydraulic conductivity in sand media in a 2d sandbox 70cm long with the injection of cmc solution for the point injection of cmc solution 0 8 the high viscosity of the solution changed the hydraulics of the sandbox as shown by the lgb movement fig 2c the lgb migrated around the cmc plume and moved at a faster velocity as compared to the cmc the lower viscosity lgb solution also caused viscous fingers to penetrate into the cmc plume the impact of permeability variations associated with the sand layers on lgb transport are also evident fig 2a fig 3 shows the btcs of lgb at three different outlets top middle and bottom for the lgb pulse injection from the clear well and the cmc pulse injection from the point source followed by lgb solution flush from the clear well followed by dw flush from the clear well in pack 1 in the lgb only pulse injection experiment the btcs of lgb at all three outlets were similar with similar peak c c0 values fig 3a in contrast the three separate outlet btcs of lgb were significantly different from each other for a point source cmc solution injection followed by lgb solution flush fig 3b lgb breakthrough was earlier at the top and bottom outlets and delayed in the middle outlet due to impact of the cmc plume on lgb transport in the middle of the sandbox in addition the middle outlet lgb btc showed some variation of concentration with time due to the viscous fingering of the lgb solution into the cmc plume while the total flow remained same in an experiment the distribution of flow among three outlets changed when the cmc plume arrived at the middle outlet for a point source injection representative results of change in flow among three outlets and variation of head loss across the sandbox with time for a point source injection of lgb cmc mixture are presented in si fig s7 the cmc btc corresponding to the lgb btc in fig 3b are shown in fig s8 in si most of the cmc came from the middle outlet due to the location of cmc solution plume injection the bottom outlet btc had an earlier arrival of cmc than the top outlet perhaps due to the density of the cmc solution in all of the lgb cmc tests the lgb and cmc recovery was 97 the viscous fingering evident in displacement of cmc implies that in field the injection of cmc solution followed by flushing water or groundwater flow could lead to bypassing of the cmc plume and viscous fingering of flushing water through the cmc plume predictions of cmc transport used in design of cmc emplacement in the subsurface should therefore take viscous effects into account 3 2 2 lgb cmc nzvi point source injections fig 4 presents point source injection results for different solutions at specific discharge of 1 8m d in pack 2 a lgb only b lgb cmc mixture and c cmc nzvi the last set of images fig 4d are for a second cmc nzvi test where the second transport experiment was conducted one day after the first cmc nzvi experiment the sandbox was not flushed with dw between these two tests this second cmc nzvi transport test was conducted to determine the effects of repeated cmc nzvi injections the cmc concentration was 0 8 in all of these cases fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves at the combined outlet for the first three experiments shown in fig 4a c the lgb plume moved along the mid level of the sandbox and exited through the middle outlet with little vertical diffusion dispersion fig 4a the front and back of the injected circular plume gradually became irregular due to the slight sand heterogeneity the btc for the lgb point injection is smooth and symmetrical about the btc center fig 5a the normalized peak concentration peak c c0 for this case was low 0 18 primarily due to the dilution associated with the combined outlets in the case of the lgb cmc mixture injection the flushing dw fingered into the cmc plume and caused breaking of the plume fig 4b the lower part of the plume separated and moved faster toward the outlet than the rest of the lgb cmc plume consequently the corresponding btc had several local peaks fig 5b the cmc plume movement was also delayed due to the viscous effect the mean residence time was 316 27min n 4 and 333 33min n 4 for lgb and cmc respectively as opposed to 136 12min n 4 when lgb only solution was injected table 2 between cmc and lgb the lgb peak c c0 was lower 0 03 0 011 n 3 than cmc peak c c0 0 039 0 015 n 3 which could be due to higher diffusion of lgb into the surrounding solution table 2 in the case of cmc nzvi injection fig 4c the initial movement of the cmc nzvi plume was similar to the lgb cmc mixture plume but the later stage plume movements were significantly different there was greater downward movement of the cmc nzvi plume and more spreading in the vertical direction kanel et al 2008 also observed density driven flow of cmc nzvi plume in a 2d sandbox however the downward movement extent in this study was not as prominent as in kanel et al 2008 they used 4g l of nzvi concentration in the solution as opposed to 1g l used in this study a significant amount of nzvi was retained in the sandbox fig 4c and the nzvi mass recovery was only 43 while the cmc recovery was 62 table 3 other studies in 2d boxes columns and field sites have found various recoveries depending on the test conditions li et al 2016 observed nzvi recovery from 16 to 36 for different grain sizes of sand in a 70cm long sandbox when tested with similar cmc nzvi injection concentration as in the current study hydutsky et al 2007 found up to 40 recovery in 71cm column tests jiemvarangkul et al 2011 found 40 recovery in a column bennett et al 2010 reported up to 37 recovery in a field study the lower cmc recovery in the cmc nzvi injection compared to cmc only injections is attributed to retention of cmc with the deposited nzvi a summary of key btc characteristics of selected experiments table 3 show that as cmc was added the maximum outlet concentration of lgb decreased to one fifth breakthrough was delayed and the btc stretched over a longer period addition of nzvi to the cmc caused no change in initial breakthrough and peak c c0 of cmc however reduced the mean residence time and mass recovery the reason for lower mean residence time could be the lower spreading of the btc due to attachment to the sand particle along with the nzvi particle the transport of nzvi in the repeat cmc nzvi test fig 4d was not similar to the first cmc nzvi injection fig 4c the plume showed slight downward movement during the early stages but less downward movement at later times compared to the first cmc nzvi injection and the entire plume exited the system at the middle outlet the viscous fingering effects appeared to be less prominent the btcs of nzvi fig 6 of the two tests showed that nzvi initial breakthrough was earlier in the second test 158min than the first test 175min though the peak c c0 was lower 0 018 vs 0 025 the mass recovery was higher 54 vs 43 for the second test compared to the first test table 3 the repeat injection of nzvi also reduced mean residence time of nzvi 273min vs 290min this change in transport behavior was likely due to the impact on sand surface properties of cmc nzvi retained from the first test these results suggest that multiple injections can promote cmc nzvi transport with less spreading of the plume kim et al 2012 showed in a column experiment that using excess polymer enhanced the transportof nzvi in porous media the images from the cmc nzvi experiment fig 4c and d show the retention of cmc nzvi gas bubbles were also evident in observations in the lab slight oxidation occurred around the injection site and near the boundary of the cmc nzvi plume path as found in the images yellowish iron oxidation stain fig s9 in si this was possibly due to the presence of very low oxygen levels in the water in sandbox that was not entirely removed by the oxygen free water flushing overnight oxidation of nzvi downstream from the injection point was not visible eliminating the possibility of that the bubbles were air these bubbles were also evenly distributed across the entire plume path and therefore could not be due to the accidental injection of air or nitrogen gas consequently it can be assumed that these bubbles were formed from the reaction between the excess sodium borohydride used in nzvi synthesis and water these gas bubbles may have affected the transport cmc nzvi in the sandbox by reducing the relative permeability of the media for the injected solution dohnal et al 2013 johnson et al 2013 as well as providing attachment sites at the gas bubble and liquid interface for the nzvi particles 3 3 effects of cmc concentration and specific discharge on transport to determine the effects of cmc concentration i e solution viscosity and specific discharge transport experiments were conducted using point source lgb cmc mixture injections at two cmc concentrations 0 2 and 0 8 and two flow rates 5 6 and 7 8ml min corresponding specific discharges were 1 3 and 1 8m d in pack 3 table 4 the results in table 4 showed that increased cmc concentration from 0 2 to 0 8 increased the initial breakthrough time by a factor of 1 2 and mean residence time by a factor of 1 5 and decreased peak c c0 by a factor of 1 8 for both cmc and lgb increasing specific discharge from 1 3m d to 1 8m d 1 4 times decreased the initial breakthrough time by a factor of 1 8 decreased mean residence time by a factor of 2 3 and increased peak c c0 by a factor of 2 4 these results were aligned with expectations as the cmc concentration increased the solution viscosity also increased which affected the transport in this study within the tested ranges the change in flow rate 1 4 times was found to have more impact on the transport of cmc and lgb than the change in cmc concentration 4 times fig 7 shows that with increased specific discharge from 1 3 to 1 8m d the mean residence time of nzvi decreased and the mass recovery of nzvi increased almost proportionally the peak c c0 increased by a factor of 1 8 this implies that increasing specific discharge will help in transporting cmc nzvi at higher concentrations with lower deposition of cmc nzvi along the transport path on the way to a target treatment zone in a 2d sandbox experiment li et al 2016 reported significant increase in nzvi transport with increased flow rate 10 times mass recovery for 2 5 times flow rate increase bennett et al 2010 also reported that high porewater velocities would be required to move cmc nzvi a significant distance in the field li et al 2016 also demonstrated in both column and 2d sandbox experiments that increasing viscosity with higher cmc concentrations enhanced the nzvi transport in contrast phenrat et al 2010 showed that excess polymer reduced the nzvi transport in heterogeneous media in a 2d sandbox 3 4 attachment of nzvi fig 8 and fig s10 in si show the distribution of attached total iron in the sandbox after cmc nzvi transport experiments in pack 1 and pack 3 the specific discharges were 1 8m d and 1 3m d in the tests with pack 1 and pack 3 respectively injection time was 10 and 5 5min in pack 1 and pack 3 respectively therefore the total amount of injected iron in nzvi form was 75 5mg and 30 8mg in pack 1 and pack 3 respectively though the test in pack 1 was performed at higher flow rate the attached total iron was higher in pack 1 due to higher amount of total iron injection the distribution of the attached iron in both packs followed the general cmc nzvi plume movement pathways with the highest attached concentration near the injection area however the attached total iron from the analysis was found to be spread more than the visible plume movement paths this could be due to the dissolution of nzvi particles in water and diffusion to the surrounding areas during the time between end of experiment and sampling of sand samples due to larger size of the injected plume 10min of cmc nzvi injection the vertical spreading of the plume fig 8a was higher in pack 1 the lower flow rate specific discharge of 1 3m d in the pack 3 experiment allowed cmc nzvi plume to sink more due to the density effect near the right end of the sandbox total iron was detected across the entire height of the sandbox as the cmc nzvi plume diverged and moved to all three outlets 3 5 modeling results the 2d model simulated the lgb dye cmc polymer and nzvi particle movement in the sandbox with time and the breakthrough curves at three outlets for different flow rate and cmc concentration conditions from model calibration to the lgb only transport experiment the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were determined to be 0 005 and 0 002m respectively these values were used to model cmc and cmc nzvi transport experiments although it is likely that the lower molecular diffusion coefficients for cmc nzvi compared to lgb would have resulted in lower dispersivities for cmc nzvi a visual comparison of images of plumes in experimental observations and model simulations shows good agreement fig 9 inclusion of the heterogeneous permeability in different sand produced variation in the predicted lgb distribution across the depth of the box similar to the variations observed in the lgb only experiments fig 9a however the magnitude of the viscous fingering of lgb solution into the cmc plume fig 9b was greater in the experiment than in the model simulation the model is a continuum model and cannot directly simulate viscous fingering caused by interface instabilities the viscous fingering or channeling shown in the model results in fig 9b is a result of the effect of the variation in permeability coupled with the spatial variation in viscosity with spatial variation in cmc concentration although our measurement of cmc solution viscosity for the range of concentrations used showed linearity with cmc concentration a shear thinning dependent viscosity calculation may improve the viscous fingering modeling results the predicted and measured btcs for lgb fig 10 matched quite well except for the earlier observed arrival of lgb at the middle outlet in the cmc transport case figs 9b and 10c this earlier arrival of lgb in middle outlet compared to the model result was due to significant fingering of flushing lgb solution into the higher viscosity cmc plume and was not completely captured in the model prediction the transport model incorporating cmc nzvi concentration dependent viscosity and colloid filtration theory with a sticking efficiency for cmc nzvi α as the fitting parameter was capable of simulating the cmc nzvi plume movement well fig 9c the α was estimated to be 0 03 for the cmc nzvi transport test in pack 2 at the specific discharge of 1 8m d and cmc concentration of 0 8 other studies in column 2d sandbox and field found nzvi attachment efficiency to sand of 0 005 to 0 02 hydutsky et al 2007 0 006 to 0 01 krol et al 2013 0 0002 to 0 12 raychoudhury et al 2012 0 0003 to 0 006 he et al 2009 and 0 01 to 0 06 kocur et al 2013 sensitivity analysis with the calibrated model for cmc nzvi solution viscosity flushing dw pore water velocity and nzvi attachment efficiency showed that lower viscosity higher pore water velocity and lower attachment efficiency contributed to higher normalized peak c c0 of nzvi fig s11 in si the results also show that attachment efficiency has a relatively greater impact on the peak c c0 and lower impact on mean residence time pore water velocity has a greater impact on the mean residence time and smaller impact on the peak c c0 and solution viscosity has a moderate impact on both peak c c0 and residence time therefore keeping the solution viscosity relatively low increased pore water velocity or specific discharge can achieve higher peak c c0 and transport nzvi to a longer distance moreover lower viscosity may help in reducing the viscous fingering and corresponding flow channeling in field applications it is important to note that clean silica sand was used in this study whereas in the field the soil could be more reactive to both the cmc and nzvi and there could be higher permeability variations that would affect the transport 4 summary and conclusions the combination of media heterogeneity and viscosity contrast between flushing water and injected cmc and cmc nzvi contributed to viscous fingering into the lgb cmc and cmc nzvi plumes with water flushing this indicates that viscous fingering could have a significant effect on the injection of cmc nzvi in the field when cmc nzvi injection is followed up with water injection while both the tested cmc concentrations 0 2 and 0 8 helped to stabilize the nzvi in the suspension the higher cmc concentration impacted the hydraulics and caused higher pressure drop across the sandbox increasing the specific discharge produced higher mass recovery indicating that increasing specific discharge can move nzvi to greater distances consecutive cmc nzvi transport experiment results showed that the first injection of cmc nvzi can help the nzvi transport in the following injection with earlier breakthrough and higher mass recovery a factor to consider in the design of field trials that involve successive injections of cmc nzvi in case of field applications the higher variations in permeabilities and reactivity of soil particles to nzvi could contribute to greater viscous fingering and slower nzvi transport however the effects could be confounding and experiments with field soil could help identify the importance of these factors the modeling of the transport experiments showed a good match between the experimental and numerical observations although fingering of water into viscous cmc solution was underpredicted the results indicate that cmc nzvi transport could be modeled with nzvi treated as a colloid with cft consideration of viscosity variations with cmc nzvi concentrations and incorporation of soil heterogeneity acknowledgements this study was funded by the ontario

1663,this study presents a set of laboratory scale transport experiments and numerical simulations evaluating carboxymethyl cellulose cmc polymer stabilized nano scale zero valent iron nzvi transport the experiments performed in a glass walled two dimensional 2d porous medium system were conducted to identify the effects of water specific discharge and cmc concentration on nzvi transport and to produce data for model validation the transport and movement of a tracer lissamine green b lgb dye cmc and cmc nzvi were evaluated through analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs at the outlets the time lapsed images of the plume and retained nzvi in the sandbox the cmc mass recovery was 95 when injected alone and about 65 when the cmc nzvi mixture was used however the mean residence time of cmc was significantly higher than that of lgb of significance for field implementation viscous fingering was observed in water displacement of previously injected cmc and cmc nzvi the mass recovery of nzvi was lower 50 than cmc recovery due to attachment onto sand grain surfaces consecutive cmc nzvi injections showed higher nzvi recovery in the second injection a factor to be considered in field trials with successive cmc nzvi injections transport of lgb cmc and nzvi were modeled using a flow and transport model considering lgb and cmc as solutes and nzvi as a colloid with variable solution viscosity due to changes in cmc concentrations the simulation results matched the experimental observations and provided estimates of transport parameters including attachment efficiency that can be used to predict cmc stabilized nzvi transport in similar porous media although the extent of viscous fingering may be underpredicted the experimental and simulation results indicated that increasing specific discharge had a greater effect on decreasing cmc nzvi attachment efficiency corresponding to greater possible travel distances in the field than increasing cmc concentration keywords nanoscale zero valent iron solute and colloid transport viscous fingering 1 introduction groundwater resources are threatened by a large number of contaminated sites worldwide in the usa alone the office of solid waste and emergency response oswer tracks over 530 000 contaminated sites that occupy almost 23 million acres land epa 2013 an earlier report showed that clean up of about 355 000 contaminated sites in the usa would require between 174 and 253 billion epa 2005 across europe 340 000 sites have been detected as contaminated jrc 2014 cost efficient and reliable techniques are required to remediate these sites in situ methods of remediation particularly passive systems may help fulfill this demand one of the earliest passive in situ methods was the zero valent iron zvi permeable reactive barrier mueller et al 2012 zvi is capable of treating chlorinated compounds through reductive dichlorination and metal removal through surface mediated mechanisms barnes et al 2010 gillham and o hannesin 1994 liu et al 2005 o carroll et al 2013 sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 zhan et al 2008 zhou et al 2011 this has generated a widespread interest in the use of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi as a direct improvement of the technique through the application of nanotechnology the specific surface area of an nzvi particle can be 30 times greater than a micron scale zvi particle increasing the rate of contaminant removal by one to two orders of magnitude wang and zhang 1997 furthermore nzvi particles can be directly injected into the subsurface and are small enough to migrate through many porous matrices however the particles rapidly aggregate due to magnetic and van der waals inter particle forces reducing the advantages of a nanoscale particle and resulting in deposition and filtration farrell et al 2000 phenrat et al 2007 the aggregation tendency of nzvi particles has been counteracted through the use of polymers polyelectrolytes or surfactants that provide electro static and steric repulsion fatisson et al 2010 he and zhao 2007 2008 johnson et al 2009 laumann et al 2014 phenrat et al 2008 2009 wang et al 2013 stabilization can be conducted pre or post nzvi synthesis generally pre stabilization includes the stabilizing agent in the synthesis reaction to immediately control particle aggregation whereas post stabilization disaggregates nzvi while introducing the stabilizer post synthesis stabilization has been found to be more cost effective but also more laborious and produces less stable particles o carroll et al 2013 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc is a water soluble organic polymer which interacts strongly with nzvi particles and has been widely studied for use as a stabilizer cmc consists of a cellulose molecule modified by the replacement of the ch2oh group with a carboxymethyl group as cmc is a polyelectrolyte that contains both carboxylate and hydroxyl groups cmc can strongly interact with and stabilize nzvi particles in addition cmc is low cost and environmentally friendly making it attractive for use in remediation applications he et al 2007 cmc stabilized nzvi particles cmc nzvi are most commonly prepared through the reduction of aqueous fe ii or fe iii using sodium borohydride he et al 2007 with cmc added to interact with the nanoparticles as they are formed fatisson et al 2010 cmc nzvi particles show promise for use in groundwater remediation applications but require further investigation to fully understand transport behavior in porous media the transport behavior of polymer nzvi and cmc nzvi in one dimensional flow columns has been well studied he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 li et al 2015 mystrioti et al 2015 raychoudhury et al 2010 2012 2014 saleh et al 2008 tiraferri and sethi 2009 tosco and sethi 2010 colloid filtration theory cft has been applied to model cmc nzvi transport behavior however work in this area has suggested that cft requires coupling with straining aggregation and settling mechanisms for better model results he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 o carroll et al 2013 raychoudhury et al 2012 2014 furthermore one dimensional column studies do not provide the level of detail required to assess the transport performance of nzvi at site conditions as flow is limited to a single direction and porewater velocities are typically far higher than those encountered in typical field applications o carroll et al 2013 bennett et al 2010 studied cmc stabilized nzvi mobility and reactivity in shallow aquifer at field scale for treatment of chlorinated ethenes their results indicated that nzvi particles were mobile in the aquifer however due to interactions between the particles and aquifer sediments the mobility declined significantly in a short time in 13h krol et al 2013 studied nzvi mobility at the field scale using a 3d compositional simulator with cft to model cmc nzvi transport in the field studies of bennett et al 2010 their findings showed that the increase in viscosity due to the cmc solution affected mobility by altering the hydraulic properties of the system and by decreasing nvzi attachment these effects were especially noticeable during push pull tests suggesting the need to further investigate cmc nzvi transport behavior across varying porewater velocities at conditions comparable to those in the field recent work has attempted to more closely mimic field conditions at the lab scale through the use of two dimensional experiments kanel et al 2008 investigated poly acrylic acid stabilized nzvi in a 2d system presenting transport visualization and demonstrating that a density coupled groundwater flow model may be used to simulate density effects in the two dimensional system phenrat et al 2010 studied the effects of nzvi particle concentrations on the transport of polymer modified fe0 nanoparticles in a lab scale 2d heterogeneous porous media system they demonstrated that heterogeneity significantly impacted the nzvi deposition pattern where polymer modified nzvi movement followed the preferential flow pathways and the particle transported better at lower particle concentration chowdhury et al 2012 studied cmc nzvi transport in a lab scale 2d system in low permeability porous media enhanced by electrokinetics busch et al 2014 studied the transport of carbon colloid supported nzvi in a 2d system presenting a visualization and transport behavior of the particles li et al 2016 studied cmc nzvi transport behavior in a 2d environment varying the injection solution cmc concentration injection velocity and media grain size to observe the effects on transport their results indicated that nzvi retention in the sandbox was not influenced by straining and change in nzvi recovery and reduction in media hydraulic conductivity depended on the cmc concentration and solution injection velocity the work done to date on cmc nzvi transport in 2d experimental systems has not yet combined the transport visualization experiments with the cft based numerical simulation and showed the effects of specific discharge and cmc concentration on nzvi transport the objective of this study was to address this need and to improve the understanding of the transport behavior of cmc stabilized nzvi in porous media through laboratory scale 2d experiments and cft based numerical modeling the effects of solution viscosity due to change in polymer concentration and effects of specific discharge on the transport of cmc and cmc nzvi were identified as these are key control variables in field applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 glass walled sandbox a laboratory scale two dimensional 2d glass walled sandbox was used for the transport experiments shown in fig s1 and described in section s1 1 in supplementary information si this sandbox was also used in the studies of o carroll and sleep 2007 and ye et al 2009 two glass plates 0 019m thick were sealed to a 0 013m thick rectangular aluminum frame with viton rubber gaskets and silicone glue the inside dimensions of the space created for porous media were 0 55m in length and 0 45m in height the distance between two glass plates was 0 014m there was a clear well at the left end of the box with volume of 20ml that acted as a continuous inlet for the injected fluid in addition there was a well 3mm od ss tube installed from the top of the box for point injections the location of the point injection was at 0 05m from the left end and 0 23m from the top of the box on the outlet end of the box there were three clear wells each with 2ml

manifold and one connected to the sandbox at the top near inlet clear well e ptfe tube piezometers 2mm id connected to the inlet and outlet manifolds for water head measurement f pyrex glass feed containers 500ml and 2l g nitrogen gas n2 tank with regulator h a light source i a computer controlled digital camera canon eos on a tripod support and j a dark box enclosure 0 7m 0 6m 2m to house the digital camera for image collection the pyrex feed bottles 500ml for injection of test solutions lgb cmc and nzvi solutions and 2l for injection of flushing distilled water dw were connected to a n2 gas tank keeping them under positive pressure 1psi to maintain anaerobic conditions in the bottles the peristaltic pump injected either the test solution or dw into the sandbox a 3 way valve valve 1 was used to control the switching from test solution to the flushing dw another 3 way valve valve 2 was used to direct the test solution either to the continuous inlet clear well or to the point injection well depending on the test condition a piezometer and a pressure transducer both connected to the inlet manifold were used to monitor the pressure at the inlet side of the sandbox the pressure transducer connected to the sandbox was used to monitor the sandbox internal pressure as a safety measure the piezometer connected to the combined outlet manifold was used to determine the water pressure head at the outlet end of the sandbox the outlet samples were collected at the combined outlet for determination of the lgb cmc and nzvi breakthrough curves in some experiments the outlets were kept separate in that case the three outlet tubes top middle and bottom were connected to three separate piezometers and separate samples were collected at any time step from these outlets for top mid and bottom outlet btcs the sandbox was placed at one end of an enclosure and backlit with a light source consisting of 4 fluorescence tube lamps and a 5 mm thick white polypropylene light diffuser plate a digital camera controlled with a computer was used to automatically capture images with pixel resolution of 3888 2592 during the experiments at a specified frequency the camera was placed in the enclosure at the end opposite of the sandbox these images captured the light transmitted through the sandbox 1 4cm thick and showed the cumulative effect of lgb or nzvi concentration at any location in the 2d sandbox 2 3 preparation of tracer cmc and nzvi cmc solutions lissamine green b lgb c27h25n2nao7s2 mw 572 62g mol from sigma andrich was used as a conservative tracer to characterize the sand dispersivity and homogeneity a stock lgb solution of 2000mg l was prepared in distilled milli q mq water and stored in refrigerator at 4 c the final lgb concentration in the test solution was 20mg l which was prepared by adding 5ml of lgb stock solution 2000mg l in 495ml of de aired distilled mq water on the day of the transport experiment carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt cmc na c6h7o2 oh x och2coona y n where x 2 21 y 0 79 and n 400 with molecular weight of 90kda from sigma aldrich was used to prepare the polymer solution the polymer solution was prepared in mq water at two different concentrations 2000mg l 0 2 w v and 8000mg l 0 8 w v the desired amount of cmc na powder was dissolved in the required volume of de aired mq water by stirring the mixture with magnetic stir bar and stir plate for 4 to 12h until the solution homogeneity was achieved the viscosities of these solutions were measured using the falling ball method and the viscosities were found to be 1 8cp and 3 9cp respectively the viscosity of the cmc na solution varied linearly for the concentration range of 0 2 to 1 data shown in fig s2 in si the solutions were stored in refrigerator at 4 c before use the nzvi was synthesized in cmc na polymer solution in an anaerobic glovebox using the sodium borohydride nabh4 titration method for a final nzvi concentration of 1000mg l to start 1 145g of feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 30ml of de aired dw for 1g l nzvi in 0 8 cmc na solution 54ml of cmc na 3 stock solution were added to the 30ml of de aired feso4 7h2o solution 0 312g of nabh4 dissolved in 30ml of de aired dw were added drop wise to a continuously stirred 54ml ferrous sulphate cmc na solution finally the volume was brought to 200ml by adding an additional 86ml of de aired dw to the nzvi cmc solution after an additional 20min of stirring the solution container was capped to prevent nzvi oxidation by air after being removed from the anaerobic chamber for all transport experiments the nzvi cmc solutions were prepared on the day of experiment except for cmc na solutions that were prepared the day before and left stirring until the injection time when cmc na and lgb were mixed to prepare the test solutions the cmc na solution was prepared as described above and lgb stock solution was added to the solution on the day of experiment to achieve the desired lgb concentration 2 4 experiment procedures hydraulic tests hydraulic tests were performed prior to and after each experiment to determine average permeability from measurements of flow rate and the water head differences between the inlet manifold piezometer or transducer and the outlet manifold piezometer average permeability k and specific discharge v were determined using the following equations 1 v q a k μ p f p i l where q is the discharge rate m3 s k is the permeability m2 a is the cross sectional area m2 μ is water viscosity pa s p f is the outlet pressure pa p i is the inlet pressure pa l is the length m and v is the specific discharge m s some representative specific discharge vs head loss data in sandbox pack 1 are presented in fig s5 in si transport tests the sandbox was flushed with 10 to 20 pv of de aired dw for 5 to 10days with approximately 8h per day flushing before any transport experiment flow measurements and hydraulic tests were performed and background samples were collected from the sandbox outlet prior to the test solution injection the transport experiments were conducted at two different pump settings which provided the average flow rates of 7 8 0 3ml min and 5 6 0 1ml min the corresponding specific discharges were 1 8m d and 1 3m d the test solution was injected either through the point injection well from the top or through the continuous inlet clear well from the lateral the outflow samples were collected either from separated outlets or combined outlets the containers with solution and water were closed tight to avoid air contact and kept under positive pressure with nitrogen gas as a guarantee of anaerobic conditions the test solution injection time for all experiments varied between 5min to 51min 0 023 to 0 26 pv depending on the test condition the test solution injection was followed by de aired dw deoxygenated de aired dw flush for 300 to 600min 2 to 3 pv depending on the test condition samples during the experiment were collected every 2 to 30min 0 013 to 0 19 pv depending on the test solution injection and flushing progress similarly images were taken using the digital camera in the dark enclosure every 1 to 30min thirty three transport experiments were performed using three different packings pack 1 pack 2 and pack 3 table 1 efforts were made to pack the sandbox similarly for these three packings in each packing several transport tests were conducted by varying the specific discharge cmc na concentration test solution injection configuration continuous inlet clear well pulse injection and point injection and outlet configuration separate outlets and combined outlet one cmc nzvi transport test was performed for each packing as a final test except for pack 2 where an additional cmc nzvi transport test was conducted keeping all the conditions same to determine the effects of multiple injections table 1 presents the experiment conditions for all the tests in the three packings 2 5 sample analyses lgb the concentration of lgb in the samples was measured from the light absorbance using an uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 set at a wavelength of 630nm a calibration curve was prepared for known standard concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 50mg l three ml of sample was transferred to a quartz cuvette with 1cm of light path and the absorbance was measured cmc na cmc na in samples was analyzed using a total organic carbon toc analyzer o i corporation aurora model 1030 following the standard method for toc method 5310 d apha 2005 the samples were diluted with mq water as required to bring the concentration within the linear range of calibration curve 0 1 to 0 5ml sample was added to 40ml of mq water in a glass vial and mixed the samples were acidified with 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 to a ph2 or less nzvi analysis for nzvi content in the effluent samples could not be performed as the samples came in contact with air during the discharge from the sandbox and nzvi was oxidized to some extent to determine the normalized nzvi breakthrough curve nzvi in the cmc nzvi influent solution and effluent samples was oxidized nzviox by slowly purging compressed air through the solutions for 5min the nzviox was measured using a colorimetric method developed by johnson et al 2013 light absorbance of the oxidized sample in quartz cuvettes with 1cm of light path was measured at 360nm wavelength using an uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 since the concentration was normalized by the influent solution nzviox for each batch of cmc nzvi test solution a series of dilutions 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 times were prepared from the oxidized influent solution and a calibration curve was prepared to confirm the validity of the normalized btc of nzviox the influent cmc nzvi solution sample and several outflow samples were analyzed for total iron using the acid digestion and o phenanthroline colorimetric method standard methods for total iron analysis 3500 fe phenanthroline method apha 2005 the normalized total iron concentration c c0 of the selected samples were compared to the normalized nzviox concentrations and the values were found to be similar attached iron the collected sand samples from the sandbox after cmc nzvi transport tests were analyzed for total iron by digesting 1g of sand in 50ml of mq water in 125ml erlenmeyer flask with 2ml of concentrated hcl and 2ml of hydroxylamine solution 100g l several ptfe chips were added into the flask to avoid rigorous boiling and splashing of solution the digested solution 10 to 15ml was used for total iron analysis standard methods 3500 fe apha 2005 this provided the attached iron to the sand in the sandbox expressed as g of attached iron per kg of sand 2 6 nzvi characterization the synthesized nzvi in cmc na solution was characterized for particle size by dynamic light scattering dls and transmission electron microscopy tem methods and stability of the nzvi particle by measuring light absorbance with uv vis spectrophotometer with time the detailed procedures of these analyses are presented in the supplementary information section s1 3 in si the stability analysis by uv vis spectrophotometer at 590nm showed fig s3a in si that settling of particle occurred relatively quickly until approximately 300min in which time absorbance decreased by 15 after this period the settling curve showed a slow and linear decline in absorbance decreasing a further 8 over 1100min there was no change in spectra pattern over the measurement period indicating that the observed data was not due to oxidation extrapolating the linear portion of the curve from 400min yielded a stability time of the nzvi of 98 9h r2 0 988 this result confirms that nzvi was stable during the span of the experiment without forming large aggregates the variation of particle size and size distribution were observed using a dls analyzer nano particle analyzer sz100 horiba scientific over the same duration as of the transport experiment period and no significant change was observed the z average size of the particle was 633 30nm after 9h of synthesis fig s3b in si which was higher than the expected value the dls measured particle size near the base of the cuvette and therefore might only be measuring the size of the larger particles the size of the synthesized nzvi in cmc na solution was also measured by using tem hitachi ht7700 the tem images fig s3c in si indicated formation of aggregate size 500nm 2 7 moment analysis of btc the concentrations of lgb cmc and nzvi in the effluent samples at any time c t were normalized by the injection concentration c 0 and the normalized breakthrough curves btcs were plotted for each experiment temporal moment analysis of the output breakthrough data was performed to determine the mean residence time in the sandbox and mass recovery in the effluent mean residence time t m was determined from the difference between centroids of the output btcs and input pulse the equations are provided in the si section s1 4 2 8 modeling lgb cmc and nzvi transport transport of lgb cmc nzvi particle was modeled using the 3d multiphase flow and transport model compsim sleep and sykes 1993 lgb was considered as conservative solute though nzvi was coated with cmc na they were considered as separate species with cmc na being a solute and nzvi being a colloid the cmc nzvi solution viscosity due to mixing with the water in the sandbox for any time and space was calculated using the grunberg and nissan equation poling et al 2001 2 log μ sol x poly log μ poly x nzvi log μ nzvi log μ water where x nzvi and x poly are the mole fractions of nzvi and polymer in suspension respectively while μ poly μ water and μ nzvi are the polymer water and nzvi viscosities respectively water viscosity is known the polymer viscosity was measured for different concentrations and nzvi viscosity was assumed to have negligible effect on solution viscosity compared to the effect of cmc colloid filtration theory cft based equations were incorporated into the model for nzvi transport krol et al 2013 where the single collector efficiency η 0 was calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and the attachment efficiency α was used as a fitting parameter using these two parameters and other system and operation parameters the attachment rate coefficient k att s 1 which serves as a first order removal term in the transport equation and describes the process of colloid filtration was calculated using the following equation 3 k att 3 1 n 2 d c α η 0 v p where d c is the collector grain size sand particle diameter m v p is the pore water velocity m s 1 α is the attachment or sticking efficiency n is the sand porosity η 0 is the theoretical collision efficiency or the single collector contact efficiency the inlet end of the sandbox inlet clear well was set as constant flux boundary and the outlet clear wells on the right end were set as constant head boundaries the top and bottom of the sandbox were no flow boundaries the 2d sandbox space was discretized with 2 5mm by 2 5mm grid blocks due to the unavoidable non uniformity in sand packing the velocity of the lgb dye plume front for a continuous inlet pulse injection was varied across the sand layers to incorporate the layer wise media heterogeneity into the modeling the sandbox space was divided into 45 layers as the height of each layer placed during packing was 0 01m from the collected images of lgb dye in the sandbox at different times for a continuous inlet pulse injection the average velocity of lgb dye plume front in each layer was calculated these dye plume front velocities were assumed to be equal to the pore water velocity at each layer a grid of 45 by 55 blocks each with 0 01m 0 01m was superimposed on the collected images at different time steps and the front location was identified fig s4 in si knowing the time step gap and dye plume front location the average velocity in each layer was calculated with the given boundary conditions of the system solution flow rate inlet and outlet piezometer readings for hydraulic heads sand media porosity assumed constant for the entire sandbox dimensions of the sandbox and calculated pore water velocity the permeability of the sand in each layer was calculated these permeability values were utilized in the model to capture media heterogeneity the permeabilities ranged from 8 58 10 13 m2 to 1 37 10 12 m2 between layers and the average permeability was determined to be 1 01 10 12 m2 table s1 in si presents the values for all the parameters used in the modeling of cmc nzvi transport 3 results and discussion 3 1 btc analysis from all the analyzed results the average recoveries were 97 9 n 17 101 6 n 9 and 40 11 n 4 for lgb cmc and nzvi respectively lgb and cmc both behaved as conservative solute whereas the nzvi was attached in significant amounts the average cmc recovery was lower 66 7 n 2 when cmc nzvi mixture was injected as nzvi was stabilized with cmc polymer during the synthesis higher retention of nzvi in the sandbox also caused a significant amount cmc retention table 2 presents the average values of the initial breakthrough time mean residence time and peak normalized concentration of lgb cmc and nzvi for all the transport experiments conducted with point injection at specific discharge of 1 8m d and 1 3m d the injection time for the test solutions was 5 5min the results in table 2 show that at 1 3 and 1 8m d specific discharge the initial breakthrough time ibt measured based on the first concentration above the method detection limit was greater for lgb cmc mixtures than for lgb alone due to the effect of the high viscosity of cmc and possibly some sorption of cmc to the sand in the box increasing the cmc concentration from 0 2 to 0 8 also increased the breakthrough time due to the higher viscosity of the higher cmc concentration solution injected both cmc and lgb came out of the system at similar time in the lgb cmc experiments the mean residence time mrt of lgb and cmc increased with increased cmc concentration for both specific discharges however for the lgb cmc mixture the mrt of cmc was significantly higher than that of lgb the peak c c0 of both lgb and cmc decreased for increased cmc concentration and decreased specific discharge the lower specific discharge or higher cmc concentration caused longer residence times in the sandbox and allowed more time for diffusion to dilute concentrations 3 2 visualization of transport experiments 3 2 1 lgb cmc injections fig 2 presents a visual comparison of lgb plume green in the images movements in the sandbox for three experiments with i lgb only injected through the clear well ii lgb cmc mixture solution injected through the clear well and iii lgb solution flushing a point injection of cmc solution variations in the front and trailing edge of the lgb plume fig 2a are evident due to the variation in sand permeability across layers in the case of transport of the lgb cmc mixture fig 2b the plume front as indicated by the lgb dye was smoother compared to the lgb only solution case due to the higher viscosity of the mixture solution compared to lgb solution the trailing edge of the lgb cmc plume where water was displacing more viscous cmc showed significant fingering of the water into the lgb cmc plume nicolaides et al 2015 the non uniform distribution of the fingers across the height of the sandbox was due to the differences in sand permeability and probably due to the difference in solution density the lgb cmc mixture density was determined to be 1 005kg m3 and 1 008kg m3 for 0 2 and 0 8 cmc solution respectively these viscous fingers caused higher spreading of the lgb cmc plume and longer residence time in the sandbox these also caused more variation in concentration in the btc and contributed to longer tail due to the higher viscosity of lgb cmc solution higher pressure difference across the sandbox was required to maintain same specific discharge this pressure difference was increased with time initially during the lgb cmc injection fig s6 in si li et al 2016 also found significant loss in hydraulic conductivity in sand media in a 2d sandbox 70cm long with the injection of cmc solution for the point injection of cmc solution 0 8 the high viscosity of the solution changed the hydraulics of the sandbox as shown by the lgb movement fig 2c the lgb migrated around the cmc plume and moved at a faster velocity as compared to the cmc the lower viscosity lgb solution also caused viscous fingers to penetrate into the cmc plume the impact of permeability variations associated with the sand layers on lgb transport are also evident fig 2a fig 3 shows the btcs of lgb at three different outlets top middle and bottom for the lgb pulse injection from the clear well and the cmc pulse injection from the point source followed by lgb solution flush from the clear well followed by dw flush from the clear well in pack 1 in the lgb only pulse injection experiment the btcs of lgb at all three outlets were similar with similar peak c c0 values fig 3a in contrast the three separate outlet btcs of lgb were significantly different from each other for a point source cmc solution injection followed by lgb solution flush fig 3b lgb breakthrough was earlier at the top and bottom outlets and delayed in the middle outlet due to impact of the cmc plume on lgb transport in the middle of the sandbox in addition the middle outlet lgb btc showed some variation of concentration with time due to the viscous fingering of the lgb solution into the cmc plume while the total flow remained same in an experiment the distribution of flow among three outlets changed when the cmc plume arrived at the middle outlet for a point source injection representative results of change in flow among three outlets and variation of head loss across the sandbox with time for a point source injection of lgb cmc mixture are presented in si fig s7 the cmc btc corresponding to the lgb btc in fig 3b are shown in fig s8 in si most of the cmc came from the middle outlet due to the location of cmc solution plume injection the bottom outlet btc had an earlier arrival of cmc than the top outlet perhaps due to the density of the cmc solution in all of the lgb cmc tests the lgb and cmc recovery was 97 the viscous fingering evident in displacement of cmc implies that in field the injection of cmc solution followed by flushing water or groundwater flow could lead to bypassing of the cmc plume and viscous fingering of flushing water through the cmc plume predictions of cmc transport used in design of cmc emplacement in the subsurface should therefore take viscous effects into account 3 2 2 lgb cmc nzvi point source injections fig 4 presents point source injection results for different solutions at specific discharge of 1 8m d in pack 2 a lgb only b lgb cmc mixture and c cmc nzvi the last set of images fig 4d are for a second cmc nzvi test where the second transport experiment was conducted one day after the first cmc nzvi experiment the sandbox was not flushed with dw between these two tests this second cmc nzvi transport test was conducted to determine the effects of repeated cmc nzvi injections the cmc concentration was 0 8 in all of these cases fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves at the combined outlet for the first three experiments shown in fig 4a c the lgb plume moved along the mid level of the sandbox and exited through the middle outlet with little vertical diffusion dispersion fig 4a the front and back of the injected circular plume gradually became irregular due to the slight sand heterogeneity the btc for the lgb point injection is smooth and symmetrical about the btc center fig 5a the normalized peak concentration peak c c0 for this case was low 0 18 primarily due to the dilution associated with the combined outlets in the case of the lgb cmc mixture injection the flushing dw fingered into the cmc plume and caused breaking of the plume fig 4b the lower part of the plume separated and moved faster toward the outlet than the rest of the lgb cmc plume consequently the corresponding btc had several local peaks fig 5b the cmc plume movement was also delayed due to the viscous effect the mean residence time was 316 27min n 4 and 333 33min n 4 for lgb and cmc respectively as opposed to 136 12min n 4 when lgb only solution was injected table 2 between cmc and lgb the lgb peak c c0 was lower 0 03 0 011 n 3 than cmc peak c c0 0 039 0 015 n 3 which could be due to higher diffusion of lgb into the surrounding solution table 2 in the case of cmc nzvi injection fig 4c the initial movement of the cmc nzvi plume was similar to the lgb cmc mixture plume but the later stage plume movements were significantly different there was greater downward movement of the cmc nzvi plume and more spreading in the vertical direction kanel et al 2008 also observed density driven flow of cmc nzvi plume in a 2d sandbox however the downward movement extent in this study was not as prominent as in kanel et al 2008 they used 4g l of nzvi concentration in the solution as opposed to 1g l used in this study a significant amount of nzvi was retained in the sandbox fig 4c and the nzvi mass recovery was only 43 while the cmc recovery was 62 table 3 other studies in 2d boxes columns and field sites have found various recoveries depending on the test conditions li et al 2016 observed nzvi recovery from 16 to 36 for different grain sizes of sand in a 70cm long sandbox when tested with similar cmc nzvi injection concentration as in the current study hydutsky et al 2007 found up to 40 recovery in 71cm column tests jiemvarangkul et al 2011 found 40 recovery in a column bennett et al 2010 reported up to 37 recovery in a field study the lower cmc recovery in the cmc nzvi injection compared to cmc only injections is attributed to retention of cmc with the deposited nzvi a summary of key btc characteristics of selected experiments table 3 show that as cmc was added the maximum outlet concentration of lgb decreased to one fifth breakthrough was delayed and the btc stretched over a longer period addition of nzvi to the cmc caused no change in initial breakthrough and peak c c0 of cmc however reduced the mean residence time and mass recovery the reason for lower mean residence time could be the lower spreading of the btc due to attachment to the sand particle along with the nzvi particle the transport of nzvi in the repeat cmc nzvi test fig 4d was not similar to the first cmc nzvi injection fig 4c the plume showed slight downward movement during the early stages but less downward movement at later times compared to the first cmc nzvi injection and the entire plume exited the system at the middle outlet the viscous fingering effects appeared to be less prominent the btcs of nzvi fig 6 of the two tests showed that nzvi initial breakthrough was earlier in the second test 158min than the first test 175min though the peak c c0 was lower 0 018 vs 0 025 the mass recovery was higher 54 vs 43 for the second test compared to the first test table 3 the repeat injection of nzvi also reduced mean residence time of nzvi 273min vs 290min this change in transport behavior was likely due to the impact on sand surface properties of cmc nzvi retained from the first test these results suggest that multiple injections can promote cmc nzvi transport with less spreading of the plume kim et al 2012 showed in a column experiment that using excess polymer enhanced the transportof nzvi in porous media the images from the cmc nzvi experiment fig 4c and d show the retention of cmc nzvi gas bubbles were also evident in observations in the lab slight oxidation occurred around the injection site and near the boundary of the cmc nzvi plume path as found in the images yellowish iron oxidation stain fig s9 in si this was possibly due to the presence of very low oxygen levels in the water in sandbox that was not entirely removed by the oxygen free water flushing overnight oxidation of nzvi downstream from the injection point was not visible eliminating the possibility of that the bubbles were air these bubbles were also evenly distributed across the entire plume path and therefore could not be due to the accidental injection of air or nitrogen gas consequently it can be assumed that these bubbles were formed from the reaction between the excess sodium borohydride used in nzvi synthesis and water these gas bubbles may have affected the transport cmc nzvi in the sandbox by reducing the relative permeability of the media for the injected solution dohnal et al 2013 johnson et al 2013 as well as providing attachment sites at the gas bubble and liquid interface for the nzvi particles 3 3 effects of cmc concentration and specific discharge on transport to determine the effects of cmc concentration i e solution viscosity and specific discharge transport experiments were conducted using point source lgb cmc mixture injections at two cmc concentrations 0 2 and 0 8 and two flow rates 5 6 and 7 8ml min corresponding specific discharges were 1 3 and 1 8m d in pack 3 table 4 the results in table 4 showed that increased cmc concentration from 0 2 to 0 8 increased the initial breakthrough time by a factor of 1 2 and mean residence time by a factor of 1 5 and decreased peak c c0 by a factor of 1 8 for both cmc and lgb increasing specific discharge from 1 3m d to 1 8m d 1 4 times decreased the initial breakthrough time by a factor of 1 8 decreased mean residence time by a factor of 2 3 and increased peak c c0 by a factor of 2 4 these results were aligned with expectations as the cmc concentration increased the solution viscosity also increased which affected the transport in this study within the tested ranges the change in flow rate 1 4 times was found to have more impact on the transport of cmc and lgb than the change in cmc concentration 4 times fig 7 shows that with increased specific discharge from 1 3 to 1 8m d the mean residence time of nzvi decreased and the mass recovery of nzvi increased almost proportionally the peak c c0 increased by a factor of 1 8 this implies that increasing specific discharge will help in transporting cmc nzvi at higher concentrations with lower deposition of cmc nzvi along the transport path on the way to a target treatment zone in a 2d sandbox experiment li et al 2016 reported significant increase in nzvi transport with increased flow rate 10 times mass recovery for 2 5 times flow rate increase bennett et al 2010 also reported that high porewater velocities would be required to move cmc nzvi a significant distance in the field li et al 2016 also demonstrated in both column and 2d sandbox experiments that increasing viscosity with higher cmc concentrations enhanced the nzvi transport in contrast phenrat et al 2010 showed that excess polymer reduced the nzvi transport in heterogeneous media in a 2d sandbox 3 4 attachment of nzvi fig 8 and fig s10 in si show the distribution of attached total iron in the sandbox after cmc nzvi transport experiments in pack 1 and pack 3 the specific discharges were 1 8m d and 1 3m d in the tests with pack 1 and pack 3 respectively injection time was 10 and 5 5min in pack 1 and pack 3 respectively therefore the total amount of injected iron in nzvi form was 75 5mg and 30 8mg in pack 1 and pack 3 respectively though the test in pack 1 was performed at higher flow rate the attached total iron was higher in pack 1 due to higher amount of total iron injection the distribution of the attached iron in both packs followed the general cmc nzvi plume movement pathways with the highest attached concentration near the injection area however the attached total iron from the analysis was found to be spread more than the visible plume movement paths this could be due to the dissolution of nzvi particles in water and diffusion to the surrounding areas during the time between end of experiment and sampling of sand samples due to larger size of the injected plume 10min of cmc nzvi injection the vertical spreading of the plume fig 8a was higher in pack 1 the lower flow rate specific discharge of 1 3m d in the pack 3 experiment allowed cmc nzvi plume to sink more due to the density effect near the right end of the sandbox total iron was detected across the entire height of the sandbox as the cmc nzvi plume diverged and moved to all three outlets 3 5 modeling results the 2d model simulated the lgb dye cmc polymer and nzvi particle movement in the sandbox with time and the breakthrough curves at three outlets for different flow rate and cmc concentration conditions from model calibration to the lgb only transport experiment the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were determined to be 0 005 and 0 002m respectively these values were used to model cmc and cmc nzvi transport experiments although it is likely that the lower molecular diffusion coefficients for cmc nzvi compared to lgb would have resulted in lower dispersivities for cmc nzvi a visual comparison of images of plumes in experimental observations and model simulations shows good agreement fig 9 inclusion of the heterogeneous permeability in different sand produced variation in the predicted lgb distribution across the depth of the box similar to the variations observed in the lgb only experiments fig 9a however the magnitude of the viscous fingering of lgb solution into the cmc plume fig 9b was greater in the experiment than in the model simulation the model is a continuum model and cannot directly simulate viscous fingering caused by interface instabilities the viscous fingering or channeling shown in the model results in fig 9b is a result of the effect of the variation in permeability coupled with the spatial variation in viscosity with spatial variation in cmc concentration although our measurement of cmc solution viscosity for the range of concentrations used showed linearity with cmc concentration a shear thinning dependent viscosity calculation may improve the viscous fingering modeling results the predicted and measured btcs for lgb fig 10 matched quite well except for the earlier observed arrival of lgb at the middle outlet in the cmc transport case figs 9b and 10c this earlier arrival of lgb in middle outlet compared to the model result was due to significant fingering of flushing lgb solution into the higher viscosity cmc plume and was not completely captured in the model prediction the transport model incorporating cmc nzvi concentration dependent viscosity and colloid filtration theory with a sticking efficiency for cmc nzvi α as the fitting parameter was capable of simulating the cmc nzvi plume movement well fig 9c the α was estimated to be 0 03 for the cmc nzvi transport test in pack 2 at the specific discharge of 1 8m d and cmc concentration of 0 8 other studies in column 2d sandbox and field found nzvi attachment efficiency to sand of 0 005 to 0 02 hydutsky et al 2007 0 006 to 0 01 krol et al 2013 0 0002 to 0 12 raychoudhury et al 2012 0 0003 to 0 006 he et al 2009 and 0 01 to 0 06 kocur et al 2013 sensitivity analysis with the calibrated model for cmc nzvi solution viscosity flushing dw pore water velocity and nzvi attachment efficiency showed that lower viscosity higher pore water velocity and lower attachment efficiency contributed to higher normalized peak c c0 of nzvi fig s11 in si the results also show that attachment efficiency has a relatively greater impact on the peak c c0 and lower impact on mean residence time pore water velocity has a greater impact on the mean residence time and smaller impact on the peak c c0 and solution viscosity has a moderate impact on both peak c c0 and residence time therefore keeping the solution viscosity relatively low increased pore water velocity or specific discharge can achieve higher peak c c0 and transport nzvi to a longer distance moreover lower viscosity may help in reducing the viscous fingering and corresponding flow channeling in field applications it is important to note that clean silica sand was used in this study whereas in the field the soil could be more reactive to both the cmc and nzvi and there could be higher permeability variations that would affect the transport 4 summary and conclusions the combination of media heterogeneity and viscosity contrast between flushing water and injected cmc and cmc nzvi contributed to viscous fingering into the lgb cmc and cmc nzvi plumes with water flushing this indicates that viscous fingering could have a significant effect on the injection of cmc nzvi in the field when cmc nzvi injection is followed up with water injection while both the tested cmc concentrations 0 2 and 0 8 helped to stabilize the nzvi in the suspension the higher cmc concentration impacted the hydraulics and caused higher pressure drop across the sandbox increasing the specific discharge produced higher mass recovery indicating that increasing specific discharge can move nzvi to greater distances consecutive cmc nzvi transport experiment results showed that the first injection of cmc nvzi can help the nzvi transport in the following injection with earlier breakthrough and higher mass recovery a factor to consider in the design of field trials that involve successive injections of cmc nzvi in case of field applications the higher variations in permeabilities and reactivity of soil particles to nzvi could contribute to greater viscous fingering and slower nzvi transport however the effects could be confounding and experiments with field soil could help identify the importance of these factors the modeling of the transport experiments showed a good match between the experimental and numerical observations although fingering of water into viscous cmc solution was underpredicted the results indicate that cmc nzvi transport could be modeled with nzvi treated as a colloid with cft consideration of viscosity variations with cmc nzvi concentrations and incorporation of soil heterogeneity acknowledgements this study was funded by the ontario

1664,magnetic resonance imaging is used to observe solute transport in a 40cm long 26cm diameter sand column that contained a central core of low permeability silica surrounded by higher permeability well sorted sand low concentrations 2 9g l of magnevist a gadolinium based contrast agent produce density driven convection within the column when it starts in an unstable state the unstable state for this experiment exists when higher density contrast agent is present above the lower density water we implement a numerical model in openfoam to reproduce the observed fluid flow and transport from a density difference of 0 3 the experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in observing three dimensional gravity driven convective dispersive transport behaviors in medium scale experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic resonance imaging porous media numerical modeling density driven convection 1 introduction small differences in fluid density create complex fluid flow paths these complex flow paths enhance fluid mixing and therefore dispersive transport we visualize the concentration resulting from these complex flow paths using magnetic resonance imaging mri 1 1 density driven convection in carbon capture and storage an important problem wherein density driven convection plays a role is carbon capture and storage ccs this is because convection decreases the dissolution time of co2 in deep saline aquifers supercritical co2 injected into saline aquifers will rise to the top from the positive buoyancy of co2 over time co2 slowly dissolves into the top layers of brine increasing its density ipcc 2005 the density increase in the top layer relative to the brine below gives rise to unstable gravity driven flow fingering develops as local convection moves denser co2 saturated brine downward and replaces it with the less dense brine this phenomenon has been observed at laboratory scales in two dimensional hele shaw cells faisal et al 2013 kneafsey and pruess 2009 kneafsey and pruess 2009 used a hele shaw cell and the tracer bromocresol green to show experimentally that density driven convection was occurring with fluid density differences ranging between 0 1 and 1 faisal et al 2013 expanded upon this work by varying the permeability of the hele shaw cell by changing the width of the gap between the two glass plates the variation in permeability showed that small changes greatly affected the time for fingering to reach the bottom of the cell 1 2 nmr measurements in porous media nuclear magnetic resonance nmr has been used for non invasive imaging of the structure of porous media issa and mansfield 1994 used t 1 weighted images to estimate permeability in sandstones using the relationship between the t 1 of porous media and the t 1 of water komlosh et al 2011 determined the average porosity of glass capillary tubes on the voxel scale three dimensional volume over which measurements are averaged using double pulsed field gradient diffusion weighted mri saturation curves for various porous materials as was calculated by muir et al 2014 using t2 mapping spin echo single point imaging as water was displaced by heavy water nmr has also been used to measure flow through porous media in small scale experiments shattuck et al 1995 measured thermal convection patterns using a spin echo technique in a small cylinder packed with monodisperse plastic beads kimmich et al 2001 used nmr to map fluid velocities in percolation clusters created with a circuit board plotter khrapitchev et al 2002 tracked the locations of particles in a small porous media column using velocity exchange spectroscopy to examine the dispersive flow within a column this nmr method allowed them to track molecules by applying a spin and observing their displacement after a small delay in a 10mm diameter column seymour and callaghan 1997 provide a good overview of the nmr methods used to image fluid flow in porous media in addition to mapping physical properties of porous media the concentrations of magnetic tracers such as gd diethylenetriaminepentaacetate gd dtpa2 can be tracked through time haber pohlmeier et al 2010 demonstrated that gd dtpa2 can be tracked within a sand column in a mri scanner to determine flow and transport behaviors in three dimensions contrast agents are required to be compounds that change the relaxivity of the solution in which they are dissolved alternative contrast agents include nicl2 pearl et al 1993 and cuso4 greiner et al 1997 greiner et al 1997 packed two small columns with glass beads and calculated the concentration of copper sulfate at the outlet with both mri and atomic absorption spectroscopy the results for both homogeneous and heterogeneous bead packing showed that mri was able to accurately measure outflow breakthrough curves with the added benefit of quantifying the concentration within the column 2 materials and methods this work extends that of earlier research by focusing on the impact of low dye concentrations on gravity driven convective dispersive transport more specifically we use an intermediate scale physical model in conjunction with mri and numerical modeling to visualize and evaluate the impact of gravity on porous medium transport 2 1 experimental set up the sand column employed in this work is designed to evaluate the impact of sharp interfaces on solute transport in porous media the dimensions of the column are designed specifically to make use of the maximum field of view of the mri center for biomedical imaging s philips 3t achieva tx scanner located in the university of vermont medical center the scanner has a bore size of 60cm and a usable volume diameter of 50cm whole body scanners are desirable for this study because they allow macroscopic flow to be captured over a large volume fukushima 1999 larger experiments also facilitate observation of scale dependent behavior and limits the impact of column wall boundary interactions on the experiment a smaller magnet in either a horizontal or vertical configuration would allow for higher resolution concentration maps but would suffer from limiting the size of soil strata used the column is packed with a centrally located cylinder of ground silica with a mean grain diameter of 10μm this cylinder is surrounded by clean ottawa sand with a mean grain diameter of 200μm to realize this arrangement the ground silica is first placed in a cylindrical sleeve saturated and frozen a shelby tube is used as the sleeve to freeze the silica for this experiment this allows for easy extraction using a shelby tube extractor the fine silica cylinder is then cut to length and placed into the center of the large column the annulus between the frozen silica is then filled with the clean ottawa sand after thawing a sharp interface exists between the silica and the sand the basic schematic of the column is shown in fig 1 the column is built entirely out of plastic to allow safe imaging by the scanner the presence of metallic objects or particles disrupts the magnetic field resulting in signal loss because mri relies on a highly homogeneous magnetic field both macroscopically and microscopically consequently considerable effort has been taken to reduce the number of magnetic particles within our porous media by screening the sand with a strong neodymium magnet 2 2 mri scans mri uses the nuclear magnetic resonance signal from protons hydrogen nuclei in this case in water the characteristic magnetic relaxation time of the longitudinal magnetization t 1 depends on the intrinsic relaxation time of water in the medium t 10 and the concentration of magnetic materials including the gadolinium based contrast agent used in this study the relaxation time is related to the contrast concentration by eq 1 1 c m 1 t 1 1 t 1 back r i where c is the concentration of contrast agent in g l in the saturated porous media m is the molecular weight of the contrast in g mmol the variable t 1back is the background t 1 value of the porous media with distilled water in s 1 and must be subtracted from the measured t 1 to remove the effects of different media on the measured signal the variable r i is the relaxivity of the contrast agent for the case of magnevist r i is 4 1l mmol s based on empirical results tofts 2010 the spatial distribution of t 1 values can be calculated using various techniques the spin echo inversion recovery technique was used for this study the recovery of longitudinal magnetization following inversion using a 180 degree rf pulse is described as an exponential function of the time between the inversion and the data acquisition the inversion time ti it is given by eq 2 2 m z m 0 1 2 e ti t 1 where m z is the longitudinal magnetization m 0 is the maximum magnetization ti is the inversion time and t 1 is the unique value that describes the magnetic properties of each voxel following the inversion time ti imaging data is acquired using a spin echo acquisition resulting in an image in which the signal at each voxel is directly proportional to m z ti note that this equation is based on the assumption of full recovery of magnetization between measurements such that the repetition time tr ti this assumption may not be justified for zero or very low concentrations of contrast agent thus introducing a small bias in these cases images are acquired with different values of inversion time ti inversion times were 50 100 200 300 400 600 and 800ms all other parameters are held constant including the acquisition matrix 200 200 field of view 400 400mm2 slice thickness 10mm echo time 6 3ms and repetition time 1000ms the acquisition duration for each inversion time takes 3min 23s at each volume element voxel the signal as a function of ti is fit to the exponential function given in eq 2 to develop t 1 maps at each time point it should be noted that the range of concentrations that the mri is sensitive to is small and consequently the density difference that can be studied is small concentrations of a gadolinium based contrast agent in the form of magnevist ranged between 0 and 2 9g l concentrations of magnevist exceeding 7 g l cause fitting eq 2 to become difficult since at this concentration the t 1 value is smaller than the minimum inversion time of 35ms that we can measure with this technique 2 3 experimental procedure we initially fill the column with distilled water and scan it to get a baseline t 1 value for the sand and silica gadolinium contrast agent in the form of magnevist is then pumped into the column for 2h and 10min at a concentration of 2 9g l and flow rate of 100ml min until the coarse outer sand is fully saturated with contrast agent this process is monitored using quick t 1 weighted scans in the sagittal plane y axis in fig 1 along which gravity acts the fine grained material remains free of contrast agent throughout pumping after 2h and 10min pumping is stopped and the valves at either end of the column are closed the column is then imaged using quantitative t 1 maps while not being imaged the column is stored horizontally in the same position this is done to ensure that gravity is always acting along a single axis the column is periodically imaged to observe the movement of contrast agent into the fine grained material after 40days the concentration of contrast agent equalizes throughout the column the column is then flushed with distilled water until the contrast agent is only present in the fine silica fig 2 shows the column before and after flushing with distilled water the column continues to be imaged periodically for two months to show the effects of both diffusion and gravity on the concentration of magnevist within the column 2 4 numerical model the concentration data collected from the mri are used to develop a three dimensional flow and transport model at the same resolution as the images produced by the scanner openfoam is used to model the observed physics by implementing a modified version of pisofoam that includes mass transport and density driven convection the model solves the navier stokes equations with porous resistance in an iterative piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator loop coupled to a convection dispersion equation for mass transport that includes a time dependent langmuir isotherm to partition mass between the fluid and solid phases the transport equation is given in eq 3 3 c f t d c f u c f c s t in eq 3 the concentration is partitioned between the fluid phase c f and the solid phase c s the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the dispersion term where d is the dispersion tensor it includes the effect of molecular diffusion and longitudinal and transverse dispersion components pinder 2002 the second term on the right hand side is the convection term where u is the velocity vector the change in the solid phase concentration is described by eq 4 4 dc s dt 1 c s c max s c max s a a d here c max s is the maximum concentration that can be in the solid phase as given by a langmuir partitioning coefficient provided in eq 5 the adsorption speed of concentration moving from the fluid phase to the solid phase is a a and the desorption speed of concentration moving from the solid phase to the fluid phase is a d the adsorption desorption speeds do not have to be the same and are in units of 1 t having differing coefficients a a and a d represents cases in which a particle adsorbs quickly to a particle and forms a strong bond 5 c max s k la bc f 1 k la c f eq 5 is the langmuir isotherm k la is the langmuir coefficient and b is the maximum adsorption capacity eqs 4 and 5 together create a time dependent transfer of mass between the solid and liquid phases that asymptotically reaches the langmuir partitioning between the two phases the speed at which the asymptote is approached depends on the magnitude of a a d openfoam was chosen for this work because it is an open source software that allows easy manipulation and addition to the included solvers weller et al 1998 the code is robust and able handle basic geometries such as our column with ease additionally openfoam s piso solver conserves mass and explicitly conserves momentum by correct the velocity equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 mri images mri scans were taken regularly in the sagittal and transverse planes each sequence is processed first into a t 1 map and then into a concentration image concentration images were made using eq 2 and then filtered to reduce noise within the image the contrast agent was observed being transported out of the fine grained material gravity driven convection was evident and was observed to reduce the time required for the contrast to move out of the fine grained material fig 3 shows the progression of the contrast agent over time fig 3a shows the contrast after initial flushing of the contrast agent resident in the coarse grained sand with distilled water from the left side of the image the low concentration tail to the right of the fine silica cylinder in 3a occurs when flow paths around the fine silica cylinder converge during pumping to create an area of stagnation the following panels in fig 3 show the contrast agent moving out of the fine silica under the effect of gravitational convection and dispersion the gravity vector is from top to bottom in all panels of fig 3 fig 3b shows the downward movement of the contrast agent after 16days it appears as the light blue to white area below the fine silica cylinder in fig 3c the leading edge of the contrast agent plume has reached the bottom of the column and begun to spread horizontally along the column the final panel fig 3d shows that the concentration in the fine silica cylinder has been reduced to 1g l from 3g l and that the concentration of contrast agent moving out of the fine silica has also been reduced due to the smaller concentration gradient between the course sand and fine silica the flow paths that the concentration takes in each panel of fig 3 as simulated by the calibrated model is shown in fig 4 the closed system causes circulation to occur initiated by the unstable initial conditions of the fluid densities the evolving pattern can be seen as the concentration moves out of the fine silica core and the difference in density is reduced from fig 4a to d the peak velocity decreases by an order of magnitude indicating that the density is beginning to equilibrate throughout the column the measured t 1 value depends on the concentration of magnevist as well as the surrounding material we found that the scaling factor of 4 1 found by tofts 2010 is accurate for converting t 1 values to concentration when magnevist is in either pure water or the course sand however when the magnevist is in the fine silica porous media the concentration calculated from the t 1 values requires a different scaling factor we find that a scaling factor of 5 3 is appropriate for magnevist in the fine silica when comparing samples of known concentration the concentration calculated from t 1 values provides the total concentration that is both contrast agent that is in solution and contrast agent that has adsorbed onto the particles mri signals are formed by volume averaging over voxels meaning that each voxel will be influenced by the contrast agent that is in the solid phase and fluid phase 3 2 comparison of simulations and experiment the numerical model was run with a three dimensional mesh to simulate the impact of gravity fig 5 shows the line scan comparison for the images shown in fig 3 and the numerical model at the same point in time gravity is again acting from left to right in each panel of fig 5 the model is able to capture both the peak in the fine silica and the lower concentration on the right side of each panel of fig 5 the peak concentration in the fine silica slopes in the direction of gravity because convection helps to move the concentration out of the fine silica the model and experimental results have a root mean square error of 0 19 when comparing the experimental results to the modeled results at 16 26 and 50days some model parameters are known ahead of time and other parameters are determined by optimization table 1 shows the parameters used for modeling the highlighted values are parameters found during initial optimization of the numerical model optimization is done using pysot an optimization algorithm designed to quickly and efficiently search through parameter space when each computation is an expensive black box function eriksson et al 2015 the optimization is done over two regions the course sand and the fine silica the longitudinal dispersivity was set to the mean grain size and the transverse dispersivity was set to 1 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity haber pohlmeier et al 2010 molecular diffusion for magnevist in water is reported to be approximately 4e 11m2 s by osuga and han 2004 the tortuosity of the porous media influences the diffusion of the magnevist by increasing the number of obstructions with which molecules collide and bounce off this has the effect of reducing the effective diffusion below the diffusion coefficient calculated in water magnevist is reported to be a conservative tracer meaning that adsorption should not occur haber pohlmeier et al 2010 we however found that the model was unable to fit the observed results when adsorption coefficients were forced to 0 furthermore icp ms analysis of a batch adsorption test using the fine silica indicated that adsorption was not occurring when compared against the control we suspect that there is an interaction within the fine silica that is retarding the movement of magnevist in a way that mimics adsorption and desorption 3 3 model sensitivity the sensitivity of the model is evaluated by perturbing each parameter with a normal distribution defined by a coefficient of variation of 0 1 where the coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean the resulting coefficient of variation of the model output compared to the input variation gives a measure of how sensitive each parameter is to small perturbations fig 6 shows the average model coefficient of variation for each parameter compared to the input variation for all variables the resulting variation is less than the input variation indicating that the model is not sensitive to small perturbations to the inputs fig 7 shows the coefficient of variation for each voxel along the column s cross section from the center of the fine grained silica to the edge of the course sand in the direction of gravity the location of the line is shown in the inset of fig 7 each point along the black line represents the coefficient of variation between model runs where the variable along the x axis is perturbed using a normal distribution defined by a coefficient of variation of 0 1 the 50 perturbed samples are generated using latin hypercube sampling to efficiently generate an accurate representation of the normal distribution stein 1987 3 4 discussion mri is a useful tool for measuring concentration change within a medium sand column non invasive imaging in three dimensions allows for the movement of concentration across a sharp material interface to be observed and modeled using mri we are able to show that small differences in density 0 3 create flow fields that enhance the movement of concentration from small layers of low permeability material a density difference of 0 3 produces velocities out of the fine silica on the order of 10 6 m s as seen in fig 4 the flow moves through the fine silica at a slow speed causing the contrast agent to be transported in the direction of gravity the speed of the circulating fluid is larger in regions where a large density gradient is present the model was rerun with density driven convection removed the time required to reduce the concentration in the fine grained material to 2 5g l is 14days when density driven convection is included and 149days when density effects are not included it is evident that small density differences between fluids reduce the time required for mixing to occur in reservoirs where fluid movement is naturally low by creating density driven convection currents while the density of layered fluids remain in an unstable arrangement funding sources this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no

1664,magnetic resonance imaging is used to observe solute transport in a 40cm long 26cm diameter sand column that contained a central core of low permeability silica surrounded by higher permeability well sorted sand low concentrations 2 9g l of magnevist a gadolinium based contrast agent produce density driven convection within the column when it starts in an unstable state the unstable state for this experiment exists when higher density contrast agent is present above the lower density water we implement a numerical model in openfoam to reproduce the observed fluid flow and transport from a density difference of 0 3 the experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in observing three dimensional gravity driven convective dispersive transport behaviors in medium scale experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic resonance imaging porous media numerical modeling density driven convection 1 introduction small differences in fluid density create complex fluid flow paths these complex flow paths enhance fluid mixing and therefore dispersive transport we visualize the concentration resulting from these complex flow paths using magnetic resonance imaging mri 1 1 density driven convection in carbon capture and storage an important problem wherein density driven convection plays a role is carbon capture and storage ccs this is because convection decreases the dissolution time of co2 in deep saline aquifers supercritical co2 injected into saline aquifers will rise to the top from the positive buoyancy of co2 over time co2 slowly dissolves into the top layers of brine increasing its density ipcc 2005 the density increase in the top layer relative to the brine below gives rise to unstable gravity driven flow fingering develops as local convection moves denser co2 saturated brine downward and replaces it with the less dense brine this phenomenon has been observed at laboratory scales in two dimensional hele shaw cells faisal et al 2013 kneafsey and pruess 2009 kneafsey and pruess 2009 used a hele shaw cell and the tracer bromocresol green to show experimentally that density driven convection was occurring with fluid density differences ranging between 0 1 and 1 faisal et al 2013 expanded upon this work by varying the permeability of the hele shaw cell by changing the width of the gap between the two glass plates the variation in permeability showed that small changes greatly affected the time for fingering to reach the bottom of the cell 1 2 nmr measurements in porous media nuclear magnetic resonance nmr has been used for non invasive imaging of the structure of porous media issa and mansfield 1994 used t 1 weighted images to estimate permeability in sandstones using the relationship between the t 1 of porous media and the t 1 of water komlosh et al 2011 determined the average porosity of glass capillary tubes on the voxel scale three dimensional volume over which measurements are averaged using double pulsed field gradient diffusion weighted mri saturation curves for various porous materials as was calculated by muir et al 2014 using t2 mapping spin echo single point imaging as water was displaced by heavy water nmr has also been used to measure flow through porous media in small scale experiments shattuck et al 1995 measured thermal convection patterns using a spin echo technique in a small cylinder packed with monodisperse plastic beads kimmich et al 2001 used nmr to map fluid velocities in percolation clusters created with a circuit board plotter khrapitchev et al 2002 tracked the locations of particles in a small porous media column using velocity exchange spectroscopy to examine the dispersive flow within a column this nmr method allowed them to track molecules by applying a spin and observing their displacement after a small delay in a 10mm diameter column seymour and callaghan 1997 provide a good overview of the nmr methods used to image fluid flow in porous media in addition to mapping physical properties of porous media the concentrations of magnetic tracers such as gd diethylenetriaminepentaacetate gd dtpa2 can be tracked through time haber pohlmeier et al 2010 demonstrated that gd dtpa2 can be tracked within a sand column in a mri scanner to determine flow and transport behaviors in three dimensions contrast agents are required to be compounds that change the relaxivity of the solution in which they are dissolved alternative contrast agents include nicl2 pearl et al 1993 and cuso4 greiner et al 1997 greiner et al 1997 packed two small columns with glass beads and calculated the concentration of copper sulfate at the outlet with both mri and atomic absorption spectroscopy the results for both homogeneous and heterogeneous bead packing showed that mri was able to accurately measure outflow breakthrough curves with the added benefit of quantifying the concentration within the column 2 materials and methods this work extends that of earlier research by focusing on the impact of low dye concentrations on gravity driven convective dispersive transport more specifically we use an intermediate scale physical model in conjunction with mri and numerical modeling to visualize and evaluate the impact of gravity on porous medium transport 2 1 experimental set up the sand column employed in this work is designed to evaluate the impact of sharp interfaces on solute transport in porous media the dimensions of the column are designed specifically to make use of the maximum field of view of the mri center for biomedical imaging s philips 3t achieva tx scanner located in the university of vermont medical center the scanner has a bore size of 60cm and a usable volume diameter of 50cm whole body scanners are desirable for this study because they allow macroscopic flow to be captured over a large volume fukushima 1999 larger experiments also facilitate observation of scale dependent behavior and limits the impact of column wall boundary interactions on the experiment a smaller magnet in either a horizontal or vertical configuration would allow for higher resolution concentration maps but would suffer from limiting the size of soil strata used the column is packed with a centrally located cylinder of ground silica with a mean grain diameter of 10μm this cylinder is surrounded by clean ottawa sand with a mean grain diameter of 200μm to realize this arrangement the ground silica is first placed in a cylindrical sleeve saturated and frozen a shelby tube is used as the sleeve to freeze the silica for this experiment this allows for easy extraction using a shelby tube extractor the fine silica cylinder is then cut to length and placed into the center of the large column the annulus between the frozen silica is then filled with the clean ottawa sand after thawing a sharp interface exists between the silica and the sand the basic schematic of the column is shown in fig 1 the column is built entirely out of plastic to allow safe imaging by the scanner the presence of metallic objects or particles disrupts the magnetic field resulting in signal loss because mri relies on a highly homogeneous magnetic field both macroscopically and microscopically consequently considerable effort has been taken to reduce the number of magnetic particles within our porous media by screening the sand with a strong neodymium magnet 2 2 mri scans mri uses the nuclear magnetic resonance signal from protons hydrogen nuclei in this case in water the characteristic magnetic relaxation time of the longitudinal magnetization t 1 depends on the intrinsic relaxation time of water in the medium t 10 and the concentration of magnetic materials including the gadolinium based contrast agent used in this study the relaxation time is related to the contrast concentration by eq 1 1 c m 1 t 1 1 t 1 back r i where c is the concentration of contrast agent in g l in the saturated porous media m is the molecular weight of the contrast in g mmol the variable t 1back is the background t 1 value of the porous media with distilled water in s 1 and must be subtracted from the measured t 1 to remove the effects of different media on the measured signal the variable r i is the relaxivity of the contrast agent for the case of magnevist r i is 4 1l mmol s based on empirical results tofts 2010 the spatial distribution of t 1 values can be calculated using various techniques the spin echo inversion recovery technique was used for this study the recovery of longitudinal magnetization following inversion using a 180 degree rf pulse is described as an exponential function of the time between the inversion and the data acquisition the inversion time ti it is given by eq 2 2 m z m 0 1 2 e ti t 1 where m z is the longitudinal magnetization m 0 is the maximum magnetization ti is the inversion time and t 1 is the unique value that describes the magnetic properties of each voxel following the inversion time ti imaging data is acquired using a spin echo acquisition resulting in an image in which the signal at each voxel is directly proportional to m z ti note that this equation is based on the assumption of full recovery of magnetization between measurements such that the repetition time tr ti this assumption may not be justified for zero or very low concentrations of contrast agent thus introducing a small bias in these cases images are acquired with different values of inversion time ti inversion times were 50 100 200 300 400 600 and 800ms all other parameters are held constant including the acquisition matrix 200 200 field of view 400 400mm2 slice thickness 10mm echo time 6 3ms and repetition time 1000ms the acquisition duration for each inversion time takes 3min 23s at each volume element voxel the signal as a function of ti is fit to the exponential function given in eq 2 to develop t 1 maps at each time point it should be noted that the range of concentrations that the mri is sensitive to is small and consequently the density difference that can be studied is small concentrations of a gadolinium based contrast agent in the form of magnevist ranged between 0 and 2 9g l concentrations of magnevist exceeding 7 g l cause fitting eq 2 to become difficult since at this concentration the t 1 value is smaller than the minimum inversion time of 35ms that we can measure with this technique 2 3 experimental procedure we initially fill the column with distilled water and scan it to get a baseline t 1 value for the sand and silica gadolinium contrast agent in the form of magnevist is then pumped into the column for 2h and 10min at a concentration of 2 9g l and flow rate of 100ml min until the coarse outer sand is fully saturated with contrast agent this process is monitored using quick t 1 weighted scans in the sagittal plane y axis in fig 1 along which gravity acts the fine grained material remains free of contrast agent throughout pumping after 2h and 10min pumping is stopped and the valves at either end of the column are closed the column is then imaged using quantitative t 1 maps while not being imaged the column is stored horizontally in the same position this is done to ensure that gravity is always acting along a single axis the column is periodically imaged to observe the movement of contrast agent into the fine grained material after 40days the concentration of contrast agent equalizes throughout the column the column is then flushed with distilled water until the contrast agent is only present in the fine silica fig 2 shows the column before and after flushing with distilled water the column continues to be imaged periodically for two months to show the effects of both diffusion and gravity on the concentration of magnevist within the column 2 4 numerical model the concentration data collected from the mri are used to develop a three dimensional flow and transport model at the same resolution as the images produced by the scanner openfoam is used to model the observed physics by implementing a modified version of pisofoam that includes mass transport and density driven convection the model solves the navier stokes equations with porous resistance in an iterative piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator loop coupled to a convection dispersion equation for mass transport that includes a time dependent langmuir isotherm to partition mass between the fluid and solid phases the transport equation is given in eq 3 3 c f t d c f u c f c s t in eq 3 the concentration is partitioned between the fluid phase c f and the solid phase c s the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 is the dispersion term where d is the dispersion tensor it includes the effect of molecular diffusion and longitudinal and transverse dispersion components pinder 2002 the second term on the right hand side is the convection term where u is the velocity vector the change in the solid phase concentration is described by eq 4 4 dc s dt 1 c s c max s c max s a a d here c max s is the maximum concentration that can be in the solid phase as given by a langmuir partitioning coefficient provided in eq 5 the adsorption speed of concentration moving from the fluid phase to the solid phase is a a and the desorption speed of concentration moving from the solid phase to the fluid phase is a d the adsorption desorption speeds do not have to be the same and are in units of 1 t having differing coefficients a a and a d represents cases in which a particle adsorbs quickly to a particle and forms a strong bond 5 c max s k la bc f 1 k la c f eq 5 is the langmuir isotherm k la is the langmuir coefficient and b is the maximum adsorption capacity eqs 4 and 5 together create a time dependent transfer of mass between the solid and liquid phases that asymptotically reaches the langmuir partitioning between the two phases the speed at which the asymptote is approached depends on the magnitude of a a d openfoam was chosen for this work because it is an open source software that allows easy manipulation and addition to the included solvers weller et al 1998 the code is robust and able handle basic geometries such as our column with ease additionally openfoam s piso solver conserves mass and explicitly conserves momentum by correct the velocity equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 mri images mri scans were taken regularly in the sagittal and transverse planes each sequence is processed first into a t 1 map and then into a concentration image concentration images were made using eq 2 and then filtered to reduce noise within the image the contrast agent was observed being transported out of the fine grained material gravity driven convection was evident and was observed to reduce the time required for the contrast to move out of the fine grained material fig 3 shows the progression of the contrast agent over time fig 3a shows the contrast after initial flushing of the contrast agent resident in the coarse grained sand with distilled water from the left side of the image the low concentration tail to the right of the fine silica cylinder in 3a occurs when flow paths around the fine silica cylinder converge during pumping to create an area of stagnation the following panels in fig 3 show the contrast agent moving out of the fine silica under the effect of gravitational convection and dispersion the gravity vector is from top to bottom in all panels of fig 3 fig 3b shows the downward movement of the contrast agent after 16days it appears as the light blue to white area below the fine silica cylinder in fig 3c the leading edge of the contrast agent plume has reached the bottom of the column and begun to spread horizontally along the column the final panel fig 3d shows that the concentration in the fine silica cylinder has been reduced to 1g l from 3g l and that the concentration of contrast agent moving out of the fine silica has also been reduced due to the smaller concentration gradient between the course sand and fine silica the flow paths that the concentration takes in each panel of fig 3 as simulated by the calibrated model is shown in fig 4 the closed
