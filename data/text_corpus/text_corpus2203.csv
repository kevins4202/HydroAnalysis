11015,land and water are the most basic resources for the food production systems however the looming water scarcity is threatening the sustainability of food production systems and is causing the food security challenges crop production on marginal and degraded lands using non conventional water resources may help achieve the food security for the future generations non conventional water resources ncw viz saline water wastewater and greywater can be used for food production systems after proper treatment for the rehabilitation of marginal and degraded lands in this review experiences and perspectives of use of ncw in the middle east and north africa mena region are discussed the availability of ncw their quantity and potential utilization in agriculture landscaping and forestry have been highlighted apart from saudi arabia oman united arab emirates uae kuwait qatar and jordan wastewater treatment facilities are limited in the mena region however consumption is increasing due to population increase the changes in soil physical chemical and biological characteristics with the use of untreated wastewater are also elaborated the pragmatic strategies for ncw treatments including desalination wastewater treatment reuse of agricultural drainage water groundwater extraction and rainwater collection have also been described here we reviewed that i legislation should be done to encourage farmers to use ncw and to grow crop species safflower sorghum millet carrots radish cucumber tomatoes eggplant lettuce which accumulate relatively very low amounts of metals in their edible parts especially in pre urban areas ii water treatment technologies should be advocated and implemented for the use of ncw iii the ncw reuse should be promoted as an integral component in every country s national development strategic plan safe reuse of ncw has great potential however that can be effectively used through wise resource planning and environmental management and financing arrangements keywords water scarcity non conventional water treated wastewater greywater land degradation mena region 1 introduction land and water are essential resources to produce food and constitute two of the most fundamental resources for mankind despite the importance of water for agriculture it is essential for industrial and tourism sectors human life and nature conservation however global water scarcity is causing serious threats to further undermine the development progress rosegrant 2016 agriculture is the major consumer 80 90 of water while global water demand has tripled together with substantial decline in fresh water resources since 1950s gleick 2003 current agricultural production systems will be unable to feed world growing population that is projected to increase from 6 7 billion 2005 to over 9 0 billion by 2050 un 2015 this scenario demands expansion of agriculture toward marginal and degraded lands that could help increase food supply avoiding the environmental and land degradation fargione et al 2008 however water scarcity remains the major bottlelink in arid and semi arid regions especially middle east and north africa mena alcamo et al 2007 abs 2008 fedoroff et al 2010 where continued water demand is threatening the food production food security and forestry sectors undp 2007 most of the arabian peninsula is classified as hyper arid with aridity index 0 03 unccd 2004 in this regard oman is the driest country with average rainfall of 62 mm year fao 2010 2011 2017 the pro capita renewable water resources have decreased from 1250 m3 1950 to 100 m3 2007 and 76 2 m3 2014 the world bank 2017 appearing the lowest in the world since agriculture depends mainly on irrigation the agricultural water demand is estimated to be 28 2 billion m3 against the ground water availability of 18030 million m3 in the peninsula the world bank 2017 for these reasons non conventional water resources could be used as an alternate option to partially meet the water demands with positive environmental effects on hydrological cycle water reserves green coverage and climate in the region al haddad et al 2015 however non conventional water may require treatment before its field use a range of treatment options is available for the wastewater and agricultural drainage water other sources of non conventional water include groundwater extraction and rainwater harvesting qadir et al 2010 researches combining the socio economic physical and chemical impact of non conventional water technical biophysical and safe and economical viable methodologies may help develop an integrated water management system that integrated water management system may help rehabilitate marginal lands in arid and semiarid regions non conventional water saline water treated wastewater and greywater has been successfully used in agriculture cereals oil seed crops date palm perennial forage grasses vegetables forestry and aquaculture suggesting that if properly treated this water can help rehabilitate the marginal and degraded lands for meeting the food feed and forage demands in the mena hussain et al 2016 al dakheel and hussain 2016 qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 gatta et al 2015 a previous review by qadir et al 2009 reported that both conventional and non conventional water resources are frequently used in mena region for agriculture and to meet the food demand they highlighted the critical role of virtual water and physical transportation of water in relatively large bags across borders for food security some other reports are available from individual countries for instance kajenthira et al 2012 described the use of wastewater fossil groundwater desalination and water energy nexus from saudi arabian context to advance the understanding of safe use of non conventional water resources in middle east and north africa mena region this study reviews 124 recent publications on the multiple aspects of safe use of treated wastewater tww for agriculture landscape and forestry and for non conventional water resources management and motivations to public for safe reuse of tww this study then links tww impacts on soil physical biochemical attributes and quality traits to develop a possible future adaptation strategy for food security in the mena region it aims at provide better understanding of the potential implications of tww in mena countries and assist the policy makers to take up the challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to water scarcity with the aim of providing support for non conventional water resources management planning two questions are particularly relevant viz i what are different non conventional water resources in view of future water scarcity due to climate change ii how successful are the proposed non conventional water resources in overcoming the risk posed by future water scarcity the above questions have been addressed by evaluating the safe and potential use of different non conventional water resources for agriculture forestry and landscaping and then the same have been linked to the potential risks involved this information will help policy makers develop guidelines for wider application of tww in irrigation program to rehabilitate marginal lands in mena where water scarcity represents a growing real problem 2 greywater rainfall water and cloud seeding as alternative water resources alternate water resources are a valuable asset in arid and semi arid arabian peninsula which can be used for irrigating the salt and drought tolerant food forage and oilseed crops and halophytes hussain and al dakheel 2015 hussain et al 2016 greywater is a valuable promising alternative resource its use is increasing worldwide to compensate lack of freshwater resources greywater comes from domestic use like bathing and washing clothes except toilets eriksson et al 2002 in general the volume of greywater accounts from 50 to 80 of the domestic household water uses eriksson et al 2002 redwood 2008 burnat and eshtayah 2010 the amount of greywater generation per capita in gulf states is different based on several factors including lifestyles age gender and water availability for instance in oman greywater originated from sinks showers and kitchen account for 82 of fresh water consumption jamrah et al 2008 however the volume of domestic generated greywater is much higher in jordan i e approximately estimated about 50 liters per capita per day faruqui and al jayyousi 2002 saving fresh water and using greywater for agriculture and landscaping has received much attention in north africa for example according to ghisi and ferreira 2007 greywater can save up to 35 consumption of fresh water even if required precautions are taken to avoid health risks associated with bacteria and microbes in the greywater widiastuti et al 2008 the composition of greywater may vary with sources the mixed greywater contains 10 8000 and 90 350 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod respectively however it contains low concentrations of contaminants compared to those in raw sewage water and black water who 2006 however laundry greywater often has high ph eriksson et al 2002 in agreement with united states environmental protection agency usepa regulation misra and sivongxay 2009 li et al 2009 greywater can be used only after filtration disinfection and biological treatment to avoid ecosystem contamination based on the international plumbing code ipc 2000 greywater can be reused for toilet flushing gwpp 2005 if no detectable coliforms appear in 100 ml of the effluent bod is less than 10 mg l 1 and the residual chlorine is more than 1 mg l 1 ph ranges from 6 to 9 and turbidity 2 ntu li et al 2009 al jayyousi 2003 greywater use therefore is of interest to water management agencies and researchers therefore different treatment techniques have been developed and installed these include natural zeolites widiastuti et al 2008 mulch tower mulch coarse sand fine and coarse gravel zuma et al 2009 bio reactor eriksson et al 2002 aerobic and anaerobic bio filters bio rotors submerged aerated filters bio rolls allen et al 2010 friedler and gilboa 2010 chemical treatment through coagulants and ion exchange and artificial wetlands pidou et al 2008 the implementation of greywater system management may help reuse a portion of the effluents for irrigation among the non conventional water resources rainwater is another option widely used to alleviate the water scarcity cheng and liao 2009 the methodology involves collection storage and safe use of this water for agriculture landscaping and forestry purposes several arab countries with highly variable rainfall and trans boundary waters have invested heavily in water storage and conveyance networks these networks preserve water sustainability ensure water availability despite erratic rainfall and reduce the risk of water related disasters kfouri et al 2009 water harvesting techniques can be broadly classified into 1 macro collection floodwater harvesting and diversion methods and 2 micro collections methods where the catchment area and the cropped area are distinct but adjacent to each other micro collection is the system with collection area of less than 100 m in length boers et al 1986 conversely macro collection techniques capture runoff water from hillsides or small arid watersheds rainwater can also be collected from rooftops or from sloping rocky or crusting lands in cisterns these types of systems are often used for domestic requirements and or irrigation purposes for instance in sweden brazil and uk the harvested rainwater is contributing as a good fraction of potable water ghisi and ferreira 2007 in jordan about 15 5 million m3 year water is collected through roof harvesting abdulla and al shareef 2009 in villages and rural environments harvested rainwater is considered clean rainwater can also be harvested in field by directing the surface runoff toward a rainwater reservoir or to the agricultural fields specifically designed water reservoirs rainwater collecting ponds can be used in certain locations depending upon geographic information system and topographical maps however large semi circular bunds should be developed in areas receiving annual rainfall 100 mm to reduce the erosion alkouri 2011 the success of this non conventional water depends on soil type slope rainfall amount of runoff socio economic situation production methodology and water harvesting techniques cloud seeding is a process of weather modification to change type of precipitation to attain cloud condensation the latter has the advantage of altering the microphysical processes within the cloud cloud seeding also occurs through the procedure of ice nucleate in nature most of which are bacterial in origin it necessitates presence of water vapor in the atmosphere moseman 2009 recently cloud seeding was carried out in uae and stake holders from all the sectors agriculture industry tourism appreciated that cloud seeding involves flying light aircraft into the base of five or six clouds and releasing flares containing potassium chloride sodium chloride and magnesium chloride the salt mixture encourages water vapor in the clouds to form droplets heavy enough to fall as rain in uae with a growing population 10 4 million by 2020 there is huge pressure to search alternate sources of fresh water instead of relying on the desalinated water due to cloud seeding uae was successful to receive 287 mm rainfall in dubai that was the highest since 1977 where it had never exceeded 120 mm according to the studies conducted by the national centre for meteorology and seismology ncms uae cloud seeding is more cost effective than the desalination method 3 wastewater from refuse to resource 3 1 characteristics of wastewaters wastewater refers to all effluents from household commercial establishments and institutions hospitals industries etc it also includes storm water urban runoff and water effluents from agriculture horticulture aquaculture and livestock breeding various pollutants like pathogens heavy metals residual drugs organic compounds pharmaceuticals and health care products are present in the different types of wastewaters the use of wastewaters for irrigation might cause several health consequences table 1 however the social cultural economic and environmental circumstances must be considered to meet quality parameters who 2006 epa 2012 the reduction of microbes and chemicals and public exposure are the key points to reduce the risks linked with public health ecosystem and environment epa 2012 nrc 2012 it is therefore imperative to treat the wastewater before use different techniques methodologies and procedures of wastewater treatments for utilization in agriculture forestry and landscaping are summarized in table 4 smart wastewater management is a sustainable way to produce food in a safe way assuring human health and ecosystem services with economic benefit tww has been used in the developed part of world for agricultural industrial urban and recreational purposes bixio et al 2006 however the rate of wastewater treatment is still low in the most countries of mena region lack of information on the impacts of water reuse on environment and human health and the perception of high cost benefit ratio are the major reasons for low use of wastewater treatments keraita et al 2008 2010 carr and potter 2013 in the region wastewater use in agriculture is a common practice with approximately 20 million hectares of arable land worldwide irrigated with wastewater mateo sagasta et al 2013 therefore this is required to disseminate the knowledge and experiences regarding potential of wastewaters use in agriculture 3 2 wastewater effects on soil characteristics 3 2 1 municipal wastewater the treatment and reuse of treated municipal water mw for rehabilitation of marginal lands have become popular in arid and semi arid regions bixio et al 2006 xanthoulis 2010 this has occurred as result of increasing fresh water scarcity high cost of chemical fertilizers availability of mw rich in nutrients vicinity of agricultural lands and high cost of advanced treatments a central theme in the planning and practice of wastewater reuse in agriculture has been assessing the associated risks to humans but less attention has been paid on the impact of mw reuse on soil ecosystem functioning which in turn govern the environmental equilibrium the soil chemical characteristics are the first to be affected by municipal wastewater application singh and agrawal 2008 among which ph is the most important effluent irrigation changes the electrical conductivity ec through addition of significant quantities of different salts sulphates phosphates bicarbonates chlorides of the cations sodium calcium potassium and magnesium to the rhizosphere soil and causes consistent increase in soil salinity unless leached by rainfall clean water or excessive irrigation the wastewater application results in sodium increment that leads to deterioration of soil structure with serious consequence on soil porosity water holding capacity and soil microbial biodiversity nutrient balance within soil is very important for biodiversity and activity of soil microorganisms which are directly responsible for soil quality and ecosystem functioning therefore nutrients wastewater should to be analyzed and maintained and or corrected to keep the balance of carbon nitrogen sulpher potash as 100 10 1 1 and calcium magnesium ratios of 4 before irrigation the mw also contains organic matter macro and micronutrients that may be useful for increasing soil fertility but the indiscriminate addition can accumulate heavy metals toxic components and pathogens however the effects depend on the period of effluent application short and long term concentration of toxic compounds amount of heavy metals and pathogens but mainly on soil chemical and biochemical characteristics table 5 testing short term effects of municipal wastewater treated with biological stabilization by pond treatment tmw indicated that total coliforms fecal coliforms escherichia coli and salmonella spp detected in tmw and soils were below the threshold recommended by world health organization who and salmonella was never found in tmw and in soil irrigated with tmw ines et al 2016 2017 the absence of pathogens suggested that the pond treatments anaerobic aerobic facultative and mature ponds were effective low cost methods to reclaim wastewater lowering bod cod and pathogens epa 2012 in a long term experiment with clay loam soils ganjegunte et al 2012 reported that tmw improved soil fertility by increasing the concentrations of nitrogen and potassium however soil salinity increased with time no detectable amount of heavy metals as cr cd hg se pb was present in the tmw samples and the pathogen load was within the threshold as recommended by the environment quality standard commission epwu 2011 recommended maximum concentrations rmcs of selected metals and metalloids in irrigation water are reported in table 3 in another long term experiment 10 years of treated wastewater drip irrigation on sandy soil hidri et al 2013 reported that irrigation with treated wastewater aeration system mechanical screen grit removal tanks and sedimentation tanks did not have any negative effect on the soil ph soil organic matter and soil cation exchange capacity adhikari et al 2014 found that physical properties of sandy soils remained unaltered after irrigation with tww except saturated hydraulic conductivity which was significantly increased and sodium absorption ratio sar and na contents which were 11 folds higher than control while evaluating the impact of tmw irrigation on the soils vegetables and human consuming the vegetables qureshi et al 2016 reported that microbes specifically total coliforms and escherichia coli were below the threshold in the tmw and soil they opined that the risk of human exposure to metal contamination can be significantly reduced by selecting appropriate crop species qureshi et al 2016 in this regard selection of plant species forage grasses oil seed crops legumes cereals is very important crops such as sunflower helianthus annuus ibbini et al 2009 alyssum species barzanti et al 2011 buttonwood hashemi and chenani 2011 phragmites cummunis typha angustifolia chandra and yadav 2011 may be considered when planning to use tww different plant species that can grow and tolerate in the soils contaminated with heavy metals are demonstrated in table 2 even after conventional treatments mww can be successfully reused for agricultural purpose to irrigate clay more than sandy soils considering that in sandy and marginal soils specifically in arid and semiarid regions wastewater irrigation may increase the percentage of organic matter total nitrogen potassium phosphorus calcium magnesium and sodium but mostly ec and sar with the probability of increase in soil salinity and structure degradation therefore fresh and wastewater should be used alternately the irrigation could be done first with wastewater so that organic matter and nutrients could be used by soil microorganisms and plants and later by fresh water so that salinity and nitrate accumulation in the soil would be lessened potential benefits and disadvantage of tmw use are illustrated in fig 1 3 3 agricultural wastewater among the agricultural wastewaters winery wastewater wastewater from livestock feedlots and dairies olive mill wastewater oww and slaughter house wastewater shw pose severe environmental problems owing to their high pollution load the problem is significant in the mediterranean areas where these waters are generated in huge quantities and requires sustainable disposal ways in dakhli et al 2013 dakhli and lamouri 2013 oww is characterized by large volumes salinity low ph phytotoxic compounds chaari et al 2015 and high organic load cod 40 200 g l mahmoud et al 2012 dakhli 2015 moreover resistance to biodegradation due to the presence of polyphenol and recalcitrant organic substances 10 12 g has also been observed mekki et al 2007 sidari et al 2010 however oww is xenobiotic free vegetative effluent rich in water organic substances and in mineral nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorous potassium iron and magnesium mekki et al 2006 taamallah 2007 several studies evidenced that oww application caused a temporary decrease in ph and hydraulic conductivity with a concomitant increase in salinity and bulk density however the degree of influence varied with the soil type and oww composition saadi et al 2007 sidari et al 2010 kapellakis et al 2015 rusan et al 2016 the irrigation of clay soils with oww induced accumulation of salts which caused disintegration of soil structure tamimi et al 2016 however application of oww to sandy soils resulted in a significant improvement of soil fertility due to its richness in organic matter and nutrients dakhli 2016 but also caused an increase in soil ec chaari et al 2015 confirmed these results showing that annual application of three oww doses 50 100 and 200 m3 ha 1 for nine successive years improved the fertility of tunisian sandy soils for the excessive amounts of organic matter and macronutrients present therefore oww may be considered as an attractive alternative in semi arid areas for the rehabilitation of sandy and sandy loam soils characterized by scarcity of organic matter and water ammar et al 2005 mechri et al 2008 soil fertigation through wastewater could be beneficial if the simple and complex phenolic are under the threshold generating antimicrobial effects hachicha et al 2009 karpouzas et al 2010 in this regard siles et al 2014 reported that oww amendment decreased the functional diversity and altered the microbial functional structures depending on its chemical composition oww can develop microflora by adding organic carbon to the soil and or inhibit microorganisms and phytopathogenic agents by adding antimicrobial substances to the soil highlighting the importance of a balance between toxic and beneficial compounds in oww in concomitance with the composition of oww environmental conditions must be a key factor on the effects of oww on soils the application of larger oww volumes 160 or 320 m3 ha 1 significantly increased the ec values sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 proportionally to the supplied volume in any case to improve the effectiveness the irrigation amount and frequency with oww should be based on soil textural class the beneficial and harmful effects of owws on soils with different chemical characteristics and textures are summarized as fig 2 recommended microbiological guidelines for tww use in agriculture are given in table 6 apart from the importance of dose and composition of raw sw moretti et al 2017 after successive applications of swine wastewater demonstrated that soil texture affected the availability of the added organic materials for soil microorganisms clay in soils formed complex with organic matter when amended with diluted sw effluent maintaining long term fertility and microbial stability in a two year study aparecida de oliveira et al 2016 demonstrated that the applications of pig liquid waste changed the nutrients and soil microbiota contributing to improve the chemical and microbiological properties of sandy soils even if the sw contains nutrients and organic materials important for the maintenance and growth of microbial population the prolonged use of sw especially in sandy soil and at high doses induced lesser diversity of microorganism groups consolidated the permanence of certain groups of the bacterial community reducing soil biodiversity at the expense of soil ecosystem functioning but it also depends on soil ph and texture fongaro et al 2017 evaluated the survival percolation and leaching of model enteric pathogens in clay and sandy soils after bio fertilization with swine digestate they reported that the survival of pathogens was significantly lower in clay than sandy soils highlighting that om content soil texture and rainfall are the principal factors that affected the survival and leaching of microbial pathogens and should to be considered prior to swine wastewater application in agriculture 3 4 indicators of soil quality in wastewater amended soil considering the contemporarily presence of valuable and detrimental organic and inorganic compounds in municipal and agricultural wastewaters dindar et al 2015 it is a good practice to monitor the soil quality after the addition of wastewaters with respect to sustainable soil management soil enzyme activities are early and sensitive indicators of changes in soil ecosystem functioning in both natural and anthropized environments muscolo et al 2015 and can be used to determine soil alteration caused from pollution in a short and long term in this regard chen et al 2008 reported an increase in the activities of the enzymes involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulpher cycling after soil irrigation with reclaimed municipal wastewater they concluded that enzyme concentration catalase alkaline phosphatase acid phosphatase dehydrogenase and urease were good indices to explore the reclaimed mw impact on soil quality application of mww to soil increased the soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities acid and alkaline phosphatases mostly urease activities armenta et al 2012 regarding agricultural wastewaters gamba et al 2005 demonstrated that oww had no toxic effects on soil microflora and stimulated their metabolic activity sidari et al 2010 3 5 soil as biotechnological plant an option for wastewater treatment the major goals in any wastewater treatment system are the removal of pollutants that may cause disease s before contaminating groundwater the ability of a soil to purify wastewater is well recognized kadam et al 2008 2009 aguilar et al 2011 the soil is a biotechnological tool due to their chemical features and have varying capacity to act as pollutant cleaner in an effective wastewater treatment system the important soil properties include unsaturated soils to promote aerobic conditions soil deep enough to remove all the pollutants and soil permeability to air and water filtering is a physical treatment process in this regard soil depth is important in removal of different pollutants present in diverse wastewaters as water moves through the small soil pores wastewater particles are removed for instance mahmoo et al 2013 reported that after passing through 30 cm of soil wastewater was very clear and ammonia was transformed into nitrate however bad odor could only be removed when the wastewater was filtered through a 60 cm soil layer mahmoo et al 2013 most of the pollutants like phosphorus and bacteria adhere to soil particles and thus can be removed from wastewater only if passed through soil layer of 50 120 cm al haddad et al 2015 the above mentioned reasons indicate that soil can be considered as the best treatment plant which may help to protect the environment and human health 4 sustainable use of wastewater in mena marginal environment arid and semi arid mena regions where the fresh water resources are extremely scarce and under serious threat have recently started to use treated municipal wastewater for irrigation the different countries in mena region are using different wastewaters that are differently treated based on the kind of wastewater produced table 7 4 1 tunisia tunisia has recently started using tww for irrigation purposes bahri 2008a stated that olives and citrus orchards in tunisia are being irrigated with low quality of brackish water and tww since 1965 covering an area of 600 ha in 2008 tww plant facility in tunisia became 61 about 0 24 billion km3 of wastewater is collected and utilized for irrigating forage industrial cereal and fruit crops chenini 2008 most of the farmers use tww for cultivation and pay subsidized prices because other fresh water sources are not available bahri 2008a b mahjoub et al 2018 discussed the status of the agricultural use of tww in tunisia they concluded that the success of its use was mainly based on the perception of the financial benefit and on the lack of fresh water resources mahjoub et al 2018 acceptance of farmers was high however the reluctance of consumers was still impeding market share in this regard relaxed regulations and good practices have been suggested to improve the situation mahjoub et al 2018 the wastewater is distributed to farmers by the local agricultural development authorities under the umbrella of ministry of agriculture and the same body also collects revenues of the sale of the wastewaters the farmers are responsible for on farm distribution and the cost to the farmer is 0 031 m 3 of wastewater supplied 4 2 jordan in jordan a rapid development in the agriculture and industrial sector with a subsequent increase in the demand of fresh water has been noted in recent years considering the water scarcity situation jordanian government has given top priority to the use of tww hussein et al 2002 the main water resources in jordan are surface and ground water currently jordan operates 28 wastewater treatment plants all over the country among these as samra wastewater treatment plant is modern and represent the core of jordan water management strategy in zarqa and amman regions the as samra plant was processing 367 000 m3 per day to fulfill water shortage during 2010 however the plant has been expanded and modernized to treat up to 530 000 m3 wastewater per day and provide sanitation services to about two million individuals of capital amman and governorate of zarqa whom are considered as the first and third most populated cities in jordan respectively hussein 2018 maldonado 2017 the as samra wastewater treatment plant is considered as the largest treatment plant in jordan that treats about 77 of total reclaimed wastewater the as samra wastewater treatment plant is considered one of the largest plants in the region that uses the modern technology to ensure the highest purifications there are around 3 000 donums of 20 30 farmers adjacent to the as samra plant cultivated forage mainly clover and sorghum irrigated with this tww hussein 2018 maldonado 2017 4 3 lebanon the majority of wastewater is being used for irrigation in different parts of lebanon the remaining part is discharged in the lakes rivers and small streams and later used in akkar and bekaa region a study conducted by fao fao aquastat 2009 indicated that domestic and industrial sectors in lebanon produce about 310 million m3 of wastewater and about 4 million m3 was treated during 2006 and used for irrigation the agriculture fields however use of untreated wastewater is very much common in lebanon for instance in many agricultural areas in lebanon sewage water is used to irrigate vegetables which are normally eaten raw without any control and any national legislation dib and issa 2003 the untreated wastewater for agricultural purpose is causing allergies dermatological gastrointestinal illness and other serious health consequences for human health risk management and precautionary solutions are urgently needed to prevent the adverse environmental and health impacts coming from inappropriate wastewater irrigation practices who 2006 4 4 kuwait the rapid increase in kuwaiti population coupled with fast industrialization and water demand for the agriculture sector is causing rapid decline in fresh water the water that the authorities are now supplying to the population is those obtained by desalination and groundwater resources ardiya jahra and riqqa are three wastewater treatment plants in kuwait presently these three plants produce 76 4 million gallons of treated effluents per day with biochemical oxygen demand bod of 10 mg l 1 sulaibiya is another wastewater treatment plant producing 375 000 m3 that contribute to 26 of the country s overall demand in kuwait the amount of treated effluent used for afforesting ration and alfalfa production not exceeded 15 of the total effluent kuwait oil company koc recognized three sewage treatment plants at burgan south kuwait magwa east kuwait and umm al aish oasis north kuwait to produce tww that will be transported through water tankers to kuwait oasis subaiya oasis spirit of the desert umm al aish oases and used as source for irrigation yousef et al 2015 4 5 syria the damascus and the homs wastewater treatment plants account for more than 98 of all tww with capacities of 177 million m3 year and 49 million m3 year respectively there were also plans to construction new tww plants at different spots in the country especially at latakia and allepo according to an estimate about 9000 hectares in damascus are being irrigation with tww 177 million cubic meters who 2005 treated wastewater is available in some syrian cities including damascus aleppo homs hama and salamiyeh where it is applied for irrigation purposes using improved surface irrigation methods through different irrigation projects a wastewater treatment plant has been established to test the modern irrigation techniques on forage crops and other high value crops and to evaluate the economic production salinity tolerant crops such as barley soybean and oil rape were also cultivated at famers sites in three villages in cooperation with directorate of extension the field work and demonstration had a significant impact on the farmers adoption of these new crops using treated wastewater the success of using treated wastewater in forage production especially in salamiyeh has led to wider interest and demands there are several advantages of rainwater harvesting in syria that have been achieved through micro catchment these catchments are equally good for both slopy and plain areas several authors demonstrated the success of micro catchment and example of mehasseh steppe in syria is one of them the semicircular bunds are an example of micro catchments that is successfully implemented in different agro ecological zones of syria oweis and hachum 2003 4 6 palestinian territories wastewater management needs significant investment for collection treatment and disposal of treated effluent however collection system of effluent is highly disturbing and lacks management practices due to limited sewage networks meanwhile only few regions have the facility of wastewater treatment during 2015 the total wastewater generated was estimated at 114 36 mcm from which 65 82 mcm are generated in the west bank and 48 54 mcm are generated in the gaza strip arij 2015a b c meanwhile the capacity building and financial and technical training is lacking to handle the water scarcity situation and to develop and manage the non conventional water resources the palestinian authority has adopted different policies for water resources management national water action plan and water law facilitate the use of tww and to conserve fresh water there are seven main wastewater treatment facilities in the palestinian territories three are in gaza strip while the rest in the west bank in the palestine rural areas several ngo s also run small scale water treatment plants in the unsewerd rural areas of the west bank however several of these tww facilities lack the trickling filters and natural treatment plants preceded by septic tanks in these small treatment units the organic matter and suspended solids were removed but other matters like nitrogen removal was limited mustafa 1996 the results of a small scale survey indicated local habitants were ready for purchasing and consuming the crops and vegetables irrigated with tww if these are hygienically free of contaminants 4 7 saudi arabia previously the wastewater and effluent were being disposed off in rural areas wadis and small towns and the arabian sea abu rizaiza 1999 however newly established national water company has invested 23 billion for sewage collection and treatment infrastructure this has facilitated the wastewater network coverage and made a partnership between public private now saudi arabia has emerged third largest water reuse market at the global map following usa and china abu rizaiza 1999 about 672 million m3 of wastewater per day was collected in the country while its consumption was less than 20 at the end al musallam 2006 there were 30 major wastewater plants for treatment at different levels in 1999 and they were treating approx 1 426 000 m3 day wastewater jimenez and asano 2008 the agriculture sector in saudi arabia offers a great scope of tww consumption while treatment plants had insufficient capacity to handle and treat effectively large quantity of waste water that might cause potential health risks to the public due to the presence of bacteria virus and microbes in the wastewater if not treated at the appropriate level qadir et al 2010 hamoda 2004 4 8 oman in the sultanate of oman wastewater treatment has been evolving over the years currently there are more than 400 wastewater treatment in the country khaliq et al 2017 most of the tww is being used in landscape irrigation by the municipalities baawain et al 2012 oman is putting serious efforts on the treatment and use of wastewater and effluent water an investment of us 2 8 billion has been made to develop manage operate and maintain all wastewater networks and treatment plants throughout the country 4 9 egypt egypt is also suffering from the shortage of fresh water resources about 3 5 billion m3 year of municipal wastewater has been produced however there was only treatment facility for 1 6 billion m3 year and additional facilities should be planned for treatment of remaining wastewater tawfic 2008 the cairo and alexandria both generated approx 2 billion m3 year that belong to the delta region while treatment plants in these regions serve 55 of the total population tawfic 2008 egypt has started to use tww in agriculture to irrigate industrial oil seed forage fuel crops including recently established agroforestry and green belts along roads and for landscaping purposes the methods of irrigation soil type and specific crops that should be irrigated with tww are regulated through egypt decree 44 2000 that recommend the irrigation of non edible crops under controlled management that complies with appropriate water quality standards because of the content of pathogens and toxic chemicals that represent the main drawbacks of wastewater reuse in agriculture elbana et al 2014 monitoring the impact of reusing tww will reduce health risks and environmental hazards while egypt s total water supply for 2015 was 76 4 109 m3 the total refined drinking health use water was 8 9 109 m3 which generated wastewater of around 5 109 m3 the primary secondary and tertiary treatments provided total tww of 3 7 109 m3 with respective percentages of 16 8 81 4 and 1 8 several organizations in egypt are tasked with wastewater management and reuse in addition to the egyptian laws legislation and regulations enacted to protect the environment and water resources from pollution the egyptian code for reusing tww classifies wastewater into four grades a b c and d depending on the level of treatment elbana et al 2017 there are four key challenges to reusing tww social public acceptance of wastewater reuse management crop selection irrigation and soil based practices human health risk and environmental threats there are significant opportunities to maximize the benefits of tww reuse in egypt as less than 75 of collected wastewater is currently being treated elbana et al 2019 finally reusing tww in agriculture could be the most reliable solution to overcome water scarcity and help to sustain water resources in egypt elbana et al 2017 5 advantages and disadvantages of using non conventional water the prospective of narrowing the gap between fresh water availability and demand in water scarce countries is the major advantages of using non conventional water the local use of non conventional water resources can meet the localized rural water need with minimum costs however the safe use of low quality saline water and tww for irrigation in non food crops landscape and gardening agroforestry vegetable production and oilseed crop as well as food crops may significantly contribute to reduce drought stress and water scarcity in marginal environments qadir and oster 2004 qadir et al 2007 al dakheel et al 2015 hussain and al dakheel 2015 qureshi et al 2016 a higher benefit cost ratio irrespective of the negative externalities associated with it is another advantage of using wastewater the net benefit from the crop production per us invested for waste water irrigation returned us 5 56 on an average baig et al 2011 depicting maximum net benefit of 12 97 in wheat crop the economic impacts of reusing wastewater depend on the degree of treatment and the nature of the reuse the costs and benefits should be considered in the context of the specific reuse approach for instance in kuwait central and western regions possess brackish ground water mostly agriculture and farming areas are located in abdally and wafra areas where farmers need significant amount of water for irrigation these regions are totally dependent on desalinated sea or brackish water that use independently of treatment costs desalination cost about 1 5 3 per m3 is quite high and not practicable forever al rashed et al 1998 therefore the government agencies should have to expore and use alternate water resources as ncw to meet irrigation demands the disadvantages of using non treated brackish water are mainly related to the impacts on agricultural production system in terms of decelerated yield table 8 decrease in soil fertility soil dispersion and compaction due to high sar and rsc qadir et al 2007 murtaza et al 2010 murtaza and zia 2011 the disadvantages of using non conventional water can be summarized as i expensive water treatments ii construction of expensive dams iii flooding of land for reservoirs iv requirement of sufficient rainfall and large river catchment areas v insufficient knowledge about the technical and management options available for reducing the environmental and health risks associated with wastewater use and vi continued and uncontrolled use of untreated wastewater as an irrigation source 6 policy issues and institutional support the countries in mena region have limited knowledge shared from regional and international experiences for the future of waste water reuse until now policy makers are unable to adapt the waste water management agenda for their respective country s economic context multiple constraints have been highlighted to promote more widespread reuse however insufficient economic analysis of reuse and treatment options is reflected from the literature studies undertaken in the mena numerous studies underpin high costs and negative or low rates of return associated with waste water treatment and in promoting its widespread use almost in all countries relatively more preference for the use of freshwater is found in addition lack of effective price signals difficulties in structuring financial deals and inherent limitations are the most common findings chesrown 2004 agannathan et al 2009 in uae oman and other gulf countries usually desalinated water is being used the relative cost of future water delivery will increase due to urbanization processes governance and political changes the commitment from the allied departments in vital to formulate policy and implement 6 1 health concerns many negative consequences are concomitant with the use of waste water these include salt loads various toxic elements heavy metals and organic pollutants and pathogens virus helminthes protozoa and bacteria due to the contaminations and hazardous materials waste water affects the soil environment and has bad impacts on human health in contrast total health benefits of us 5 500 per year were noticed from a waste water treatment system for 1 500 people agglomeration elsewhere unep 2015 water contamination induced infections account for 70 of all common diseases and directly affect human health thus the effects of untreated or poorly treated waste water can potentially have deleterious effects on public health environment and economy the poorly treated waste water could be harmful to living beings and irrigated soils when implemented under uncontrolled or unregulated circumstances adewumi et al 2010 in this regard edokpayi et al 2017 showed that wastewater effluents are the major contributors to a variety of water pollution problems the poor quality of wastewater effluents is responsible for the degradation of the receiving surface water body lands and human health wastewater effluent should be treated efficiently to avoid the negative effects based on enforcement of water and environmental laws to protect the health of inhabitants of both rural and urban communities 6 2 heavy metals in the food chain guidelines for safe limits in different commodities are available especially those developed by unep who fda etc the main source of accumulation of some metals into the food chain is water and further regulated by the soil characteristics there is a growing body of evidence to show that the levels of arsenic in rice could pose a threat for rice loving people however arsenic toxic levels could be found under special soil conditions an action level of 100 parts per billion ppb has recently been proposed for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal fda 2016 for infants and pregnant women fda s has provided certain health care precautions and advices to avoid the arsenic toxicity the framework consisting of nine indicators for ensuring environmental social and economic sustainability may be implemented for measuring performance of reliability resilience and vulnerability 7 conclusion the use of wastewater greywater rainwater and sowing of clouds as alternative to fresh water represents a valid strategy in mena for the recovery of marginal and saline degraded lands the use of wastewater may be a good opportunity for agriculture if the treatment and use are regulated by laws formulated on scientific basis and should be transversally adopted within the mena countries in several countries of mena region the wastewater treatment plants are limited except for saudi arabia oman the united arab emirates kuwait qatar and jordan while their agricultural production is increasing due to the use of ncw however water reuse has still to overcome several challenges such as a better planning and management of reusing operations based on a real water demand this means a better institutional regulatory and organizational setting additionally economic and financial practicability of water reuse need to be better considered training of farmers of economically poor countries of mena that use untreated wastewater for irrigation with substantial documented risks to the soil ecosystem environment and public health is necessary this necessitates implementing the treatment technologies and making them mandatory considering the reuse of wastewater as an integral component in the strategic national development plans it is thus important to invest in decontamination and treatment plants to allow their sustainable use planning and the sustainable use of different sources of ncw can be an economical and environmental investment for the agricultural development of respective countries 
11015,land and water are the most basic resources for the food production systems however the looming water scarcity is threatening the sustainability of food production systems and is causing the food security challenges crop production on marginal and degraded lands using non conventional water resources may help achieve the food security for the future generations non conventional water resources ncw viz saline water wastewater and greywater can be used for food production systems after proper treatment for the rehabilitation of marginal and degraded lands in this review experiences and perspectives of use of ncw in the middle east and north africa mena region are discussed the availability of ncw their quantity and potential utilization in agriculture landscaping and forestry have been highlighted apart from saudi arabia oman united arab emirates uae kuwait qatar and jordan wastewater treatment facilities are limited in the mena region however consumption is increasing due to population increase the changes in soil physical chemical and biological characteristics with the use of untreated wastewater are also elaborated the pragmatic strategies for ncw treatments including desalination wastewater treatment reuse of agricultural drainage water groundwater extraction and rainwater collection have also been described here we reviewed that i legislation should be done to encourage farmers to use ncw and to grow crop species safflower sorghum millet carrots radish cucumber tomatoes eggplant lettuce which accumulate relatively very low amounts of metals in their edible parts especially in pre urban areas ii water treatment technologies should be advocated and implemented for the use of ncw iii the ncw reuse should be promoted as an integral component in every country s national development strategic plan safe reuse of ncw has great potential however that can be effectively used through wise resource planning and environmental management and financing arrangements keywords water scarcity non conventional water treated wastewater greywater land degradation mena region 1 introduction land and water are essential resources to produce food and constitute two of the most fundamental resources for mankind despite the importance of water for agriculture it is essential for industrial and tourism sectors human life and nature conservation however global water scarcity is causing serious threats to further undermine the development progress rosegrant 2016 agriculture is the major consumer 80 90 of water while global water demand has tripled together with substantial decline in fresh water resources since 1950s gleick 2003 current agricultural production systems will be unable to feed world growing population that is projected to increase from 6 7 billion 2005 to over 9 0 billion by 2050 un 2015 this scenario demands expansion of agriculture toward marginal and degraded lands that could help increase food supply avoiding the environmental and land degradation fargione et al 2008 however water scarcity remains the major bottlelink in arid and semi arid regions especially middle east and north africa mena alcamo et al 2007 abs 2008 fedoroff et al 2010 where continued water demand is threatening the food production food security and forestry sectors undp 2007 most of the arabian peninsula is classified as hyper arid with aridity index 0 03 unccd 2004 in this regard oman is the driest country with average rainfall of 62 mm year fao 2010 2011 2017 the pro capita renewable water resources have decreased from 1250 m3 1950 to 100 m3 2007 and 76 2 m3 2014 the world bank 2017 appearing the lowest in the world since agriculture depends mainly on irrigation the agricultural water demand is estimated to be 28 2 billion m3 against the ground water availability of 18030 million m3 in the peninsula the world bank 2017 for these reasons non conventional water resources could be used as an alternate option to partially meet the water demands with positive environmental effects on hydrological cycle water reserves green coverage and climate in the region al haddad et al 2015 however non conventional water may require treatment before its field use a range of treatment options is available for the wastewater and agricultural drainage water other sources of non conventional water include groundwater extraction and rainwater harvesting qadir et al 2010 researches combining the socio economic physical and chemical impact of non conventional water technical biophysical and safe and economical viable methodologies may help develop an integrated water management system that integrated water management system may help rehabilitate marginal lands in arid and semiarid regions non conventional water saline water treated wastewater and greywater has been successfully used in agriculture cereals oil seed crops date palm perennial forage grasses vegetables forestry and aquaculture suggesting that if properly treated this water can help rehabilitate the marginal and degraded lands for meeting the food feed and forage demands in the mena hussain et al 2016 al dakheel and hussain 2016 qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 gatta et al 2015 a previous review by qadir et al 2009 reported that both conventional and non conventional water resources are frequently used in mena region for agriculture and to meet the food demand they highlighted the critical role of virtual water and physical transportation of water in relatively large bags across borders for food security some other reports are available from individual countries for instance kajenthira et al 2012 described the use of wastewater fossil groundwater desalination and water energy nexus from saudi arabian context to advance the understanding of safe use of non conventional water resources in middle east and north africa mena region this study reviews 124 recent publications on the multiple aspects of safe use of treated wastewater tww for agriculture landscape and forestry and for non conventional water resources management and motivations to public for safe reuse of tww this study then links tww impacts on soil physical biochemical attributes and quality traits to develop a possible future adaptation strategy for food security in the mena region it aims at provide better understanding of the potential implications of tww in mena countries and assist the policy makers to take up the challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to water scarcity with the aim of providing support for non conventional water resources management planning two questions are particularly relevant viz i what are different non conventional water resources in view of future water scarcity due to climate change ii how successful are the proposed non conventional water resources in overcoming the risk posed by future water scarcity the above questions have been addressed by evaluating the safe and potential use of different non conventional water resources for agriculture forestry and landscaping and then the same have been linked to the potential risks involved this information will help policy makers develop guidelines for wider application of tww in irrigation program to rehabilitate marginal lands in mena where water scarcity represents a growing real problem 2 greywater rainfall water and cloud seeding as alternative water resources alternate water resources are a valuable asset in arid and semi arid arabian peninsula which can be used for irrigating the salt and drought tolerant food forage and oilseed crops and halophytes hussain and al dakheel 2015 hussain et al 2016 greywater is a valuable promising alternative resource its use is increasing worldwide to compensate lack of freshwater resources greywater comes from domestic use like bathing and washing clothes except toilets eriksson et al 2002 in general the volume of greywater accounts from 50 to 80 of the domestic household water uses eriksson et al 2002 redwood 2008 burnat and eshtayah 2010 the amount of greywater generation per capita in gulf states is different based on several factors including lifestyles age gender and water availability for instance in oman greywater originated from sinks showers and kitchen account for 82 of fresh water consumption jamrah et al 2008 however the volume of domestic generated greywater is much higher in jordan i e approximately estimated about 50 liters per capita per day faruqui and al jayyousi 2002 saving fresh water and using greywater for agriculture and landscaping has received much attention in north africa for example according to ghisi and ferreira 2007 greywater can save up to 35 consumption of fresh water even if required precautions are taken to avoid health risks associated with bacteria and microbes in the greywater widiastuti et al 2008 the composition of greywater may vary with sources the mixed greywater contains 10 8000 and 90 350 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod respectively however it contains low concentrations of contaminants compared to those in raw sewage water and black water who 2006 however laundry greywater often has high ph eriksson et al 2002 in agreement with united states environmental protection agency usepa regulation misra and sivongxay 2009 li et al 2009 greywater can be used only after filtration disinfection and biological treatment to avoid ecosystem contamination based on the international plumbing code ipc 2000 greywater can be reused for toilet flushing gwpp 2005 if no detectable coliforms appear in 100 ml of the effluent bod is less than 10 mg l 1 and the residual chlorine is more than 1 mg l 1 ph ranges from 6 to 9 and turbidity 2 ntu li et al 2009 al jayyousi 2003 greywater use therefore is of interest to water management agencies and researchers therefore different treatment techniques have been developed and installed these include natural zeolites widiastuti et al 2008 mulch tower mulch coarse sand fine and coarse gravel zuma et al 2009 bio reactor eriksson et al 2002 aerobic and anaerobic bio filters bio rotors submerged aerated filters bio rolls allen et al 2010 friedler and gilboa 2010 chemical treatment through coagulants and ion exchange and artificial wetlands pidou et al 2008 the implementation of greywater system management may help reuse a portion of the effluents for irrigation among the non conventional water resources rainwater is another option widely used to alleviate the water scarcity cheng and liao 2009 the methodology involves collection storage and safe use of this water for agriculture landscaping and forestry purposes several arab countries with highly variable rainfall and trans boundary waters have invested heavily in water storage and conveyance networks these networks preserve water sustainability ensure water availability despite erratic rainfall and reduce the risk of water related disasters kfouri et al 2009 water harvesting techniques can be broadly classified into 1 macro collection floodwater harvesting and diversion methods and 2 micro collections methods where the catchment area and the cropped area are distinct but adjacent to each other micro collection is the system with collection area of less than 100 m in length boers et al 1986 conversely macro collection techniques capture runoff water from hillsides or small arid watersheds rainwater can also be collected from rooftops or from sloping rocky or crusting lands in cisterns these types of systems are often used for domestic requirements and or irrigation purposes for instance in sweden brazil and uk the harvested rainwater is contributing as a good fraction of potable water ghisi and ferreira 2007 in jordan about 15 5 million m3 year water is collected through roof harvesting abdulla and al shareef 2009 in villages and rural environments harvested rainwater is considered clean rainwater can also be harvested in field by directing the surface runoff toward a rainwater reservoir or to the agricultural fields specifically designed water reservoirs rainwater collecting ponds can be used in certain locations depending upon geographic information system and topographical maps however large semi circular bunds should be developed in areas receiving annual rainfall 100 mm to reduce the erosion alkouri 2011 the success of this non conventional water depends on soil type slope rainfall amount of runoff socio economic situation production methodology and water harvesting techniques cloud seeding is a process of weather modification to change type of precipitation to attain cloud condensation the latter has the advantage of altering the microphysical processes within the cloud cloud seeding also occurs through the procedure of ice nucleate in nature most of which are bacterial in origin it necessitates presence of water vapor in the atmosphere moseman 2009 recently cloud seeding was carried out in uae and stake holders from all the sectors agriculture industry tourism appreciated that cloud seeding involves flying light aircraft into the base of five or six clouds and releasing flares containing potassium chloride sodium chloride and magnesium chloride the salt mixture encourages water vapor in the clouds to form droplets heavy enough to fall as rain in uae with a growing population 10 4 million by 2020 there is huge pressure to search alternate sources of fresh water instead of relying on the desalinated water due to cloud seeding uae was successful to receive 287 mm rainfall in dubai that was the highest since 1977 where it had never exceeded 120 mm according to the studies conducted by the national centre for meteorology and seismology ncms uae cloud seeding is more cost effective than the desalination method 3 wastewater from refuse to resource 3 1 characteristics of wastewaters wastewater refers to all effluents from household commercial establishments and institutions hospitals industries etc it also includes storm water urban runoff and water effluents from agriculture horticulture aquaculture and livestock breeding various pollutants like pathogens heavy metals residual drugs organic compounds pharmaceuticals and health care products are present in the different types of wastewaters the use of wastewaters for irrigation might cause several health consequences table 1 however the social cultural economic and environmental circumstances must be considered to meet quality parameters who 2006 epa 2012 the reduction of microbes and chemicals and public exposure are the key points to reduce the risks linked with public health ecosystem and environment epa 2012 nrc 2012 it is therefore imperative to treat the wastewater before use different techniques methodologies and procedures of wastewater treatments for utilization in agriculture forestry and landscaping are summarized in table 4 smart wastewater management is a sustainable way to produce food in a safe way assuring human health and ecosystem services with economic benefit tww has been used in the developed part of world for agricultural industrial urban and recreational purposes bixio et al 2006 however the rate of wastewater treatment is still low in the most countries of mena region lack of information on the impacts of water reuse on environment and human health and the perception of high cost benefit ratio are the major reasons for low use of wastewater treatments keraita et al 2008 2010 carr and potter 2013 in the region wastewater use in agriculture is a common practice with approximately 20 million hectares of arable land worldwide irrigated with wastewater mateo sagasta et al 2013 therefore this is required to disseminate the knowledge and experiences regarding potential of wastewaters use in agriculture 3 2 wastewater effects on soil characteristics 3 2 1 municipal wastewater the treatment and reuse of treated municipal water mw for rehabilitation of marginal lands have become popular in arid and semi arid regions bixio et al 2006 xanthoulis 2010 this has occurred as result of increasing fresh water scarcity high cost of chemical fertilizers availability of mw rich in nutrients vicinity of agricultural lands and high cost of advanced treatments a central theme in the planning and practice of wastewater reuse in agriculture has been assessing the associated risks to humans but less attention has been paid on the impact of mw reuse on soil ecosystem functioning which in turn govern the environmental equilibrium the soil chemical characteristics are the first to be affected by municipal wastewater application singh and agrawal 2008 among which ph is the most important effluent irrigation changes the electrical conductivity ec through addition of significant quantities of different salts sulphates phosphates bicarbonates chlorides of the cations sodium calcium potassium and magnesium to the rhizosphere soil and causes consistent increase in soil salinity unless leached by rainfall clean water or excessive irrigation the wastewater application results in sodium increment that leads to deterioration of soil structure with serious consequence on soil porosity water holding capacity and soil microbial biodiversity nutrient balance within soil is very important for biodiversity and activity of soil microorganisms which are directly responsible for soil quality and ecosystem functioning therefore nutrients wastewater should to be analyzed and maintained and or corrected to keep the balance of carbon nitrogen sulpher potash as 100 10 1 1 and calcium magnesium ratios of 4 before irrigation the mw also contains organic matter macro and micronutrients that may be useful for increasing soil fertility but the indiscriminate addition can accumulate heavy metals toxic components and pathogens however the effects depend on the period of effluent application short and long term concentration of toxic compounds amount of heavy metals and pathogens but mainly on soil chemical and biochemical characteristics table 5 testing short term effects of municipal wastewater treated with biological stabilization by pond treatment tmw indicated that total coliforms fecal coliforms escherichia coli and salmonella spp detected in tmw and soils were below the threshold recommended by world health organization who and salmonella was never found in tmw and in soil irrigated with tmw ines et al 2016 2017 the absence of pathogens suggested that the pond treatments anaerobic aerobic facultative and mature ponds were effective low cost methods to reclaim wastewater lowering bod cod and pathogens epa 2012 in a long term experiment with clay loam soils ganjegunte et al 2012 reported that tmw improved soil fertility by increasing the concentrations of nitrogen and potassium however soil salinity increased with time no detectable amount of heavy metals as cr cd hg se pb was present in the tmw samples and the pathogen load was within the threshold as recommended by the environment quality standard commission epwu 2011 recommended maximum concentrations rmcs of selected metals and metalloids in irrigation water are reported in table 3 in another long term experiment 10 years of treated wastewater drip irrigation on sandy soil hidri et al 2013 reported that irrigation with treated wastewater aeration system mechanical screen grit removal tanks and sedimentation tanks did not have any negative effect on the soil ph soil organic matter and soil cation exchange capacity adhikari et al 2014 found that physical properties of sandy soils remained unaltered after irrigation with tww except saturated hydraulic conductivity which was significantly increased and sodium absorption ratio sar and na contents which were 11 folds higher than control while evaluating the impact of tmw irrigation on the soils vegetables and human consuming the vegetables qureshi et al 2016 reported that microbes specifically total coliforms and escherichia coli were below the threshold in the tmw and soil they opined that the risk of human exposure to metal contamination can be significantly reduced by selecting appropriate crop species qureshi et al 2016 in this regard selection of plant species forage grasses oil seed crops legumes cereals is very important crops such as sunflower helianthus annuus ibbini et al 2009 alyssum species barzanti et al 2011 buttonwood hashemi and chenani 2011 phragmites cummunis typha angustifolia chandra and yadav 2011 may be considered when planning to use tww different plant species that can grow and tolerate in the soils contaminated with heavy metals are demonstrated in table 2 even after conventional treatments mww can be successfully reused for agricultural purpose to irrigate clay more than sandy soils considering that in sandy and marginal soils specifically in arid and semiarid regions wastewater irrigation may increase the percentage of organic matter total nitrogen potassium phosphorus calcium magnesium and sodium but mostly ec and sar with the probability of increase in soil salinity and structure degradation therefore fresh and wastewater should be used alternately the irrigation could be done first with wastewater so that organic matter and nutrients could be used by soil microorganisms and plants and later by fresh water so that salinity and nitrate accumulation in the soil would be lessened potential benefits and disadvantage of tmw use are illustrated in fig 1 3 3 agricultural wastewater among the agricultural wastewaters winery wastewater wastewater from livestock feedlots and dairies olive mill wastewater oww and slaughter house wastewater shw pose severe environmental problems owing to their high pollution load the problem is significant in the mediterranean areas where these waters are generated in huge quantities and requires sustainable disposal ways in dakhli et al 2013 dakhli and lamouri 2013 oww is characterized by large volumes salinity low ph phytotoxic compounds chaari et al 2015 and high organic load cod 40 200 g l mahmoud et al 2012 dakhli 2015 moreover resistance to biodegradation due to the presence of polyphenol and recalcitrant organic substances 10 12 g has also been observed mekki et al 2007 sidari et al 2010 however oww is xenobiotic free vegetative effluent rich in water organic substances and in mineral nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorous potassium iron and magnesium mekki et al 2006 taamallah 2007 several studies evidenced that oww application caused a temporary decrease in ph and hydraulic conductivity with a concomitant increase in salinity and bulk density however the degree of influence varied with the soil type and oww composition saadi et al 2007 sidari et al 2010 kapellakis et al 2015 rusan et al 2016 the irrigation of clay soils with oww induced accumulation of salts which caused disintegration of soil structure tamimi et al 2016 however application of oww to sandy soils resulted in a significant improvement of soil fertility due to its richness in organic matter and nutrients dakhli 2016 but also caused an increase in soil ec chaari et al 2015 confirmed these results showing that annual application of three oww doses 50 100 and 200 m3 ha 1 for nine successive years improved the fertility of tunisian sandy soils for the excessive amounts of organic matter and macronutrients present therefore oww may be considered as an attractive alternative in semi arid areas for the rehabilitation of sandy and sandy loam soils characterized by scarcity of organic matter and water ammar et al 2005 mechri et al 2008 soil fertigation through wastewater could be beneficial if the simple and complex phenolic are under the threshold generating antimicrobial effects hachicha et al 2009 karpouzas et al 2010 in this regard siles et al 2014 reported that oww amendment decreased the functional diversity and altered the microbial functional structures depending on its chemical composition oww can develop microflora by adding organic carbon to the soil and or inhibit microorganisms and phytopathogenic agents by adding antimicrobial substances to the soil highlighting the importance of a balance between toxic and beneficial compounds in oww in concomitance with the composition of oww environmental conditions must be a key factor on the effects of oww on soils the application of larger oww volumes 160 or 320 m3 ha 1 significantly increased the ec values sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 proportionally to the supplied volume in any case to improve the effectiveness the irrigation amount and frequency with oww should be based on soil textural class the beneficial and harmful effects of owws on soils with different chemical characteristics and textures are summarized as fig 2 recommended microbiological guidelines for tww use in agriculture are given in table 6 apart from the importance of dose and composition of raw sw moretti et al 2017 after successive applications of swine wastewater demonstrated that soil texture affected the availability of the added organic materials for soil microorganisms clay in soils formed complex with organic matter when amended with diluted sw effluent maintaining long term fertility and microbial stability in a two year study aparecida de oliveira et al 2016 demonstrated that the applications of pig liquid waste changed the nutrients and soil microbiota contributing to improve the chemical and microbiological properties of sandy soils even if the sw contains nutrients and organic materials important for the maintenance and growth of microbial population the prolonged use of sw especially in sandy soil and at high doses induced lesser diversity of microorganism groups consolidated the permanence of certain groups of the bacterial community reducing soil biodiversity at the expense of soil ecosystem functioning but it also depends on soil ph and texture fongaro et al 2017 evaluated the survival percolation and leaching of model enteric pathogens in clay and sandy soils after bio fertilization with swine digestate they reported that the survival of pathogens was significantly lower in clay than sandy soils highlighting that om content soil texture and rainfall are the principal factors that affected the survival and leaching of microbial pathogens and should to be considered prior to swine wastewater application in agriculture 3 4 indicators of soil quality in wastewater amended soil considering the contemporarily presence of valuable and detrimental organic and inorganic compounds in municipal and agricultural wastewaters dindar et al 2015 it is a good practice to monitor the soil quality after the addition of wastewaters with respect to sustainable soil management soil enzyme activities are early and sensitive indicators of changes in soil ecosystem functioning in both natural and anthropized environments muscolo et al 2015 and can be used to determine soil alteration caused from pollution in a short and long term in this regard chen et al 2008 reported an increase in the activities of the enzymes involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulpher cycling after soil irrigation with reclaimed municipal wastewater they concluded that enzyme concentration catalase alkaline phosphatase acid phosphatase dehydrogenase and urease were good indices to explore the reclaimed mw impact on soil quality application of mww to soil increased the soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities acid and alkaline phosphatases mostly urease activities armenta et al 2012 regarding agricultural wastewaters gamba et al 2005 demonstrated that oww had no toxic effects on soil microflora and stimulated their metabolic activity sidari et al 2010 3 5 soil as biotechnological plant an option for wastewater treatment the major goals in any wastewater treatment system are the removal of pollutants that may cause disease s before contaminating groundwater the ability of a soil to purify wastewater is well recognized kadam et al 2008 2009 aguilar et al 2011 the soil is a biotechnological tool due to their chemical features and have varying capacity to act as pollutant cleaner in an effective wastewater treatment system the important soil properties include unsaturated soils to promote aerobic conditions soil deep enough to remove all the pollutants and soil permeability to air and water filtering is a physical treatment process in this regard soil depth is important in removal of different pollutants present in diverse wastewaters as water moves through the small soil pores wastewater particles are removed for instance mahmoo et al 2013 reported that after passing through 30 cm of soil wastewater was very clear and ammonia was transformed into nitrate however bad odor could only be removed when the wastewater was filtered through a 60 cm soil layer mahmoo et al 2013 most of the pollutants like phosphorus and bacteria adhere to soil particles and thus can be removed from wastewater only if passed through soil layer of 50 120 cm al haddad et al 2015 the above mentioned reasons indicate that soil can be considered as the best treatment plant which may help to protect the environment and human health 4 sustainable use of wastewater in mena marginal environment arid and semi arid mena regions where the fresh water resources are extremely scarce and under serious threat have recently started to use treated municipal wastewater for irrigation the different countries in mena region are using different wastewaters that are differently treated based on the kind of wastewater produced table 7 4 1 tunisia tunisia has recently started using tww for irrigation purposes bahri 2008a stated that olives and citrus orchards in tunisia are being irrigated with low quality of brackish water and tww since 1965 covering an area of 600 ha in 2008 tww plant facility in tunisia became 61 about 0 24 billion km3 of wastewater is collected and utilized for irrigating forage industrial cereal and fruit crops chenini 2008 most of the farmers use tww for cultivation and pay subsidized prices because other fresh water sources are not available bahri 2008a b mahjoub et al 2018 discussed the status of the agricultural use of tww in tunisia they concluded that the success of its use was mainly based on the perception of the financial benefit and on the lack of fresh water resources mahjoub et al 2018 acceptance of farmers was high however the reluctance of consumers was still impeding market share in this regard relaxed regulations and good practices have been suggested to improve the situation mahjoub et al 2018 the wastewater is distributed to farmers by the local agricultural development authorities under the umbrella of ministry of agriculture and the same body also collects revenues of the sale of the wastewaters the farmers are responsible for on farm distribution and the cost to the farmer is 0 031 m 3 of wastewater supplied 4 2 jordan in jordan a rapid development in the agriculture and industrial sector with a subsequent increase in the demand of fresh water has been noted in recent years considering the water scarcity situation jordanian government has given top priority to the use of tww hussein et al 2002 the main water resources in jordan are surface and ground water currently jordan operates 28 wastewater treatment plants all over the country among these as samra wastewater treatment plant is modern and represent the core of jordan water management strategy in zarqa and amman regions the as samra plant was processing 367 000 m3 per day to fulfill water shortage during 2010 however the plant has been expanded and modernized to treat up to 530 000 m3 wastewater per day and provide sanitation services to about two million individuals of capital amman and governorate of zarqa whom are considered as the first and third most populated cities in jordan respectively hussein 2018 maldonado 2017 the as samra wastewater treatment plant is considered as the largest treatment plant in jordan that treats about 77 of total reclaimed wastewater the as samra wastewater treatment plant is considered one of the largest plants in the region that uses the modern technology to ensure the highest purifications there are around 3 000 donums of 20 30 farmers adjacent to the as samra plant cultivated forage mainly clover and sorghum irrigated with this tww hussein 2018 maldonado 2017 4 3 lebanon the majority of wastewater is being used for irrigation in different parts of lebanon the remaining part is discharged in the lakes rivers and small streams and later used in akkar and bekaa region a study conducted by fao fao aquastat 2009 indicated that domestic and industrial sectors in lebanon produce about 310 million m3 of wastewater and about 4 million m3 was treated during 2006 and used for irrigation the agriculture fields however use of untreated wastewater is very much common in lebanon for instance in many agricultural areas in lebanon sewage water is used to irrigate vegetables which are normally eaten raw without any control and any national legislation dib and issa 2003 the untreated wastewater for agricultural purpose is causing allergies dermatological gastrointestinal illness and other serious health consequences for human health risk management and precautionary solutions are urgently needed to prevent the adverse environmental and health impacts coming from inappropriate wastewater irrigation practices who 2006 4 4 kuwait the rapid increase in kuwaiti population coupled with fast industrialization and water demand for the agriculture sector is causing rapid decline in fresh water the water that the authorities are now supplying to the population is those obtained by desalination and groundwater resources ardiya jahra and riqqa are three wastewater treatment plants in kuwait presently these three plants produce 76 4 million gallons of treated effluents per day with biochemical oxygen demand bod of 10 mg l 1 sulaibiya is another wastewater treatment plant producing 375 000 m3 that contribute to 26 of the country s overall demand in kuwait the amount of treated effluent used for afforesting ration and alfalfa production not exceeded 15 of the total effluent kuwait oil company koc recognized three sewage treatment plants at burgan south kuwait magwa east kuwait and umm al aish oasis north kuwait to produce tww that will be transported through water tankers to kuwait oasis subaiya oasis spirit of the desert umm al aish oases and used as source for irrigation yousef et al 2015 4 5 syria the damascus and the homs wastewater treatment plants account for more than 98 of all tww with capacities of 177 million m3 year and 49 million m3 year respectively there were also plans to construction new tww plants at different spots in the country especially at latakia and allepo according to an estimate about 9000 hectares in damascus are being irrigation with tww 177 million cubic meters who 2005 treated wastewater is available in some syrian cities including damascus aleppo homs hama and salamiyeh where it is applied for irrigation purposes using improved surface irrigation methods through different irrigation projects a wastewater treatment plant has been established to test the modern irrigation techniques on forage crops and other high value crops and to evaluate the economic production salinity tolerant crops such as barley soybean and oil rape were also cultivated at famers sites in three villages in cooperation with directorate of extension the field work and demonstration had a significant impact on the farmers adoption of these new crops using treated wastewater the success of using treated wastewater in forage production especially in salamiyeh has led to wider interest and demands there are several advantages of rainwater harvesting in syria that have been achieved through micro catchment these catchments are equally good for both slopy and plain areas several authors demonstrated the success of micro catchment and example of mehasseh steppe in syria is one of them the semicircular bunds are an example of micro catchments that is successfully implemented in different agro ecological zones of syria oweis and hachum 2003 4 6 palestinian territories wastewater management needs significant investment for collection treatment and disposal of treated effluent however collection system of effluent is highly disturbing and lacks management practices due to limited sewage networks meanwhile only few regions have the facility of wastewater treatment during 2015 the total wastewater generated was estimated at 114 36 mcm from which 65 82 mcm are generated in the west bank and 48 54 mcm are generated in the gaza strip arij 2015a b c meanwhile the capacity building and financial and technical training is lacking to handle the water scarcity situation and to develop and manage the non conventional water resources the palestinian authority has adopted different policies for water resources management national water action plan and water law facilitate the use of tww and to conserve fresh water there are seven main wastewater treatment facilities in the palestinian territories three are in gaza strip while the rest in the west bank in the palestine rural areas several ngo s also run small scale water treatment plants in the unsewerd rural areas of the west bank however several of these tww facilities lack the trickling filters and natural treatment plants preceded by septic tanks in these small treatment units the organic matter and suspended solids were removed but other matters like nitrogen removal was limited mustafa 1996 the results of a small scale survey indicated local habitants were ready for purchasing and consuming the crops and vegetables irrigated with tww if these are hygienically free of contaminants 4 7 saudi arabia previously the wastewater and effluent were being disposed off in rural areas wadis and small towns and the arabian sea abu rizaiza 1999 however newly established national water company has invested 23 billion for sewage collection and treatment infrastructure this has facilitated the wastewater network coverage and made a partnership between public private now saudi arabia has emerged third largest water reuse market at the global map following usa and china abu rizaiza 1999 about 672 million m3 of wastewater per day was collected in the country while its consumption was less than 20 at the end al musallam 2006 there were 30 major wastewater plants for treatment at different levels in 1999 and they were treating approx 1 426 000 m3 day wastewater jimenez and asano 2008 the agriculture sector in saudi arabia offers a great scope of tww consumption while treatment plants had insufficient capacity to handle and treat effectively large quantity of waste water that might cause potential health risks to the public due to the presence of bacteria virus and microbes in the wastewater if not treated at the appropriate level qadir et al 2010 hamoda 2004 4 8 oman in the sultanate of oman wastewater treatment has been evolving over the years currently there are more than 400 wastewater treatment in the country khaliq et al 2017 most of the tww is being used in landscape irrigation by the municipalities baawain et al 2012 oman is putting serious efforts on the treatment and use of wastewater and effluent water an investment of us 2 8 billion has been made to develop manage operate and maintain all wastewater networks and treatment plants throughout the country 4 9 egypt egypt is also suffering from the shortage of fresh water resources about 3 5 billion m3 year of municipal wastewater has been produced however there was only treatment facility for 1 6 billion m3 year and additional facilities should be planned for treatment of remaining wastewater tawfic 2008 the cairo and alexandria both generated approx 2 billion m3 year that belong to the delta region while treatment plants in these regions serve 55 of the total population tawfic 2008 egypt has started to use tww in agriculture to irrigate industrial oil seed forage fuel crops including recently established agroforestry and green belts along roads and for landscaping purposes the methods of irrigation soil type and specific crops that should be irrigated with tww are regulated through egypt decree 44 2000 that recommend the irrigation of non edible crops under controlled management that complies with appropriate water quality standards because of the content of pathogens and toxic chemicals that represent the main drawbacks of wastewater reuse in agriculture elbana et al 2014 monitoring the impact of reusing tww will reduce health risks and environmental hazards while egypt s total water supply for 2015 was 76 4 109 m3 the total refined drinking health use water was 8 9 109 m3 which generated wastewater of around 5 109 m3 the primary secondary and tertiary treatments provided total tww of 3 7 109 m3 with respective percentages of 16 8 81 4 and 1 8 several organizations in egypt are tasked with wastewater management and reuse in addition to the egyptian laws legislation and regulations enacted to protect the environment and water resources from pollution the egyptian code for reusing tww classifies wastewater into four grades a b c and d depending on the level of treatment elbana et al 2017 there are four key challenges to reusing tww social public acceptance of wastewater reuse management crop selection irrigation and soil based practices human health risk and environmental threats there are significant opportunities to maximize the benefits of tww reuse in egypt as less than 75 of collected wastewater is currently being treated elbana et al 2019 finally reusing tww in agriculture could be the most reliable solution to overcome water scarcity and help to sustain water resources in egypt elbana et al 2017 5 advantages and disadvantages of using non conventional water the prospective of narrowing the gap between fresh water availability and demand in water scarce countries is the major advantages of using non conventional water the local use of non conventional water resources can meet the localized rural water need with minimum costs however the safe use of low quality saline water and tww for irrigation in non food crops landscape and gardening agroforestry vegetable production and oilseed crop as well as food crops may significantly contribute to reduce drought stress and water scarcity in marginal environments qadir and oster 2004 qadir et al 2007 al dakheel et al 2015 hussain and al dakheel 2015 qureshi et al 2016 a higher benefit cost ratio irrespective of the negative externalities associated with it is another advantage of using wastewater the net benefit from the crop production per us invested for waste water irrigation returned us 5 56 on an average baig et al 2011 depicting maximum net benefit of 12 97 in wheat crop the economic impacts of reusing wastewater depend on the degree of treatment and the nature of the reuse the costs and benefits should be considered in the context of the specific reuse approach for instance in kuwait central and western regions possess brackish ground water mostly agriculture and farming areas are located in abdally and wafra areas where farmers need significant amount of water for irrigation these regions are totally dependent on desalinated sea or brackish water that use independently of treatment costs desalination cost about 1 5 3 per m3 is quite high and not practicable forever al rashed et al 1998 therefore the government agencies should have to expore and use alternate water resources as ncw to meet irrigation demands the disadvantages of using non treated brackish water are mainly related to the impacts on agricultural production system in terms of decelerated yield table 8 decrease in soil fertility soil dispersion and compaction due to high sar and rsc qadir et al 2007 murtaza et al 2010 murtaza and zia 2011 the disadvantages of using non conventional water can be summarized as i expensive water treatments ii construction of expensive dams iii flooding of land for reservoirs iv requirement of sufficient rainfall and large river catchment areas v insufficient knowledge about the technical and management options available for reducing the environmental and health risks associated with wastewater use and vi continued and uncontrolled use of untreated wastewater as an irrigation source 6 policy issues and institutional support the countries in mena region have limited knowledge shared from regional and international experiences for the future of waste water reuse until now policy makers are unable to adapt the waste water management agenda for their respective country s economic context multiple constraints have been highlighted to promote more widespread reuse however insufficient economic analysis of reuse and treatment options is reflected from the literature studies undertaken in the mena numerous studies underpin high costs and negative or low rates of return associated with waste water treatment and in promoting its widespread use almost in all countries relatively more preference for the use of freshwater is found in addition lack of effective price signals difficulties in structuring financial deals and inherent limitations are the most common findings chesrown 2004 agannathan et al 2009 in uae oman and other gulf countries usually desalinated water is being used the relative cost of future water delivery will increase due to urbanization processes governance and political changes the commitment from the allied departments in vital to formulate policy and implement 6 1 health concerns many negative consequences are concomitant with the use of waste water these include salt loads various toxic elements heavy metals and organic pollutants and pathogens virus helminthes protozoa and bacteria due to the contaminations and hazardous materials waste water affects the soil environment and has bad impacts on human health in contrast total health benefits of us 5 500 per year were noticed from a waste water treatment system for 1 500 people agglomeration elsewhere unep 2015 water contamination induced infections account for 70 of all common diseases and directly affect human health thus the effects of untreated or poorly treated waste water can potentially have deleterious effects on public health environment and economy the poorly treated waste water could be harmful to living beings and irrigated soils when implemented under uncontrolled or unregulated circumstances adewumi et al 2010 in this regard edokpayi et al 2017 showed that wastewater effluents are the major contributors to a variety of water pollution problems the poor quality of wastewater effluents is responsible for the degradation of the receiving surface water body lands and human health wastewater effluent should be treated efficiently to avoid the negative effects based on enforcement of water and environmental laws to protect the health of inhabitants of both rural and urban communities 6 2 heavy metals in the food chain guidelines for safe limits in different commodities are available especially those developed by unep who fda etc the main source of accumulation of some metals into the food chain is water and further regulated by the soil characteristics there is a growing body of evidence to show that the levels of arsenic in rice could pose a threat for rice loving people however arsenic toxic levels could be found under special soil conditions an action level of 100 parts per billion ppb has recently been proposed for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal fda 2016 for infants and pregnant women fda s has provided certain health care precautions and advices to avoid the arsenic toxicity the framework consisting of nine indicators for ensuring environmental social and economic sustainability may be implemented for measuring performance of reliability resilience and vulnerability 7 conclusion the use of wastewater greywater rainwater and sowing of clouds as alternative to fresh water represents a valid strategy in mena for the recovery of marginal and saline degraded lands the use of wastewater may be a good opportunity for agriculture if the treatment and use are regulated by laws formulated on scientific basis and should be transversally adopted within the mena countries in several countries of mena region the wastewater treatment plants are limited except for saudi arabia oman the united arab emirates kuwait qatar and jordan while their agricultural production is increasing due to the use of ncw however water reuse has still to overcome several challenges such as a better planning and management of reusing operations based on a real water demand this means a better institutional regulatory and organizational setting additionally economic and financial practicability of water reuse need to be better considered training of farmers of economically poor countries of mena that use untreated wastewater for irrigation with substantial documented risks to the soil ecosystem environment and public health is necessary this necessitates implementing the treatment technologies and making them mandatory considering the reuse of wastewater as an integral component in the strategic national development plans it is thus important to invest in decontamination and treatment plants to allow their sustainable use planning and the sustainable use of different sources of ncw can be an economical and environmental investment for the agricultural development of respective countries 
11016,the agricultural policy environmental extender apex is a complex mechanistic simulation model designed to evaluate agricultural management strategies and their effects on yields water and soil quality and resource use it is one of the main models used in the conservation effects assessment project ceap assessment program and has been employed to evaluate the effects of conservation practices in the chesapeake bay watershed cbw calibration of model parameters is an important process in order to apply a simulation model to a particular area the apex model is normally parameterized for each application using selected datasets from the region however the apex application area is usually very large and all areas may not be well represented by the calibration thus additional tests of apex without site specific calibration for crop yield and soil water content can provide information on the stability of the parameters related to these variables in the cbw the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of apex for corn yields and water balance in a new location using parameters previously developed for the cbw this study used observations from the ope3 site optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement located at the us department of agriculture henry a wallace agricultural research center beltsville maryland usa data from the ope3 site consists of water content at various layers corn yields and et covering the period from 1998 to 2013 the results for total water in the soil profile up to 100 cm deep showed that the simulated water amounts were about 4 4 cm higher than the observed values but the trends were very similar to the observed trends the statistical error analysis of r square rsq nash sutcliffe ens efficiency coefficient and root mean square error rmse are 0 59 0 51 and 0 21 cm day 1 respectively the average simulated yields were 0 3 t ha 1 4 lower than observed yields with an average absolute deviation between apex and ope3 of 1 3 t ha1 where the average observed yields over the period was 5 18 t ha 1 the year to year trends were very similar to the measured trends the monthly evapotranspiration data also showed reasonable trends between observed data and model results with the model rsq ens and rmse being 0 56 0 41 and 4 49 mm month 1 respectively these results suggest that apex parameters for yield and water use simulations calibrated for the cbw can be considered applicable to other areas of the cbw where calibration data are not available keywords apex ceap cbw ope3 soil water content corn yields 1 introduction an important source of funding for soil conservation programs in the united states is the u s government the u s congress requested greater accountability for these funds when they were significantly increased in the 2002 farm bill the requirement for accountability resulted in a need to better quantify the benefits of conservation practices such that a monetary amount could be associated with them the conservation effects assessment project ceap is a multi agency effort to address the needs to quantify the effectiveness conservation practices johnson et al 2015 an important component of ceap includes computational approaches to assess the effects of land use climate soils and crop management practices on environmental processes and agricultural production one of the main models used in the ceap cropland assessment program is the agricultural policy environmental extender model apex the apex model has been developed by extending the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to field scale small watershed level williams et al 1984 williams and izaurralde 2006 the apex model simulates interactions between management practices and ecosystem processes that are important to conservation efforts including nutrient and soil transport at the edge of field or bottom of root zone soil water balances pesticide transport and crop growth in addition apex has been used for investigating the impacts of different nutrient management practices tillage operations conservation practices double cropping systems and other practices on surface runoff infiltration percolation nutrient pollutant and losses of sediment and nutrient from field to watershed scales gassman et al 2010 gassman et al 2010 provided an overview of all the major components for the national pilot project for livestock and the environment npp assessments using apex simulations they indicated that the apex model has much more detailed components than the soil water assessment tool swat in field scale cropping systems field operations conservation practices and silvicultural practices this level of detail allows apex to simulate complex and detailed management practices the management datasets used in apex are derived from the national resource inventory nri carried out by the natural resources conservation service an agency of the u s dept of agriculture usda nrcs natural resources conservation service 2015 apex has been an effective tool to assess the effects of soil conservation practices in the ohio river valley santhi et al 2014 to simulate hydrology and pesticide losses in rotational cotton and peanut fields under southern atlantic coastal plain conditions plotkin et al 2013 and was used in field scale monitoring to compare the effect of no till and reduced till management practices on water quality in northeast indiana francesconi et al 2014 the water budget simulation in apex is a crucial process among the model components first rainfall interception is estimated by plant canopies next apex partitions rainfall into surface runoff and subsurface flow saleh et al 2000 subsurface flow in apex is composed of horizontal and vertical flows saleh and gallego 2007 surface runoff simulation in apex estimates daily runoff volume and maximum daily runoff rate as a function of daily rainfall the scs soil conservation service curve number method and the green ampt green and ampt 1911 approach are used for estimating infiltration and surface runoff volume this study is used scs curve number method to estimate water flux wang et al 2006 selected random representative sets of apex model data to investigate the sensitivity analysis of model performance they reported that runoff and water related outputs are very sensitive to the nrcs curve number index calibration is an important process to increase confidence that apex accurately simulates system processes for a location santhi et al 2014 carried out a ceap cropland regional assessment with apex and swat in the ohio river basin they performed a systematic calibration scheme for stream flow upland erosion channel erosion and nutrients transported to capture the spatial variation in annual water yield they concluded that the calibration parameters in the apex were not adequate to get the water yield within a 20 error wang et al 2011 described an upgraded apex model for data inputs and parameter settings in ceap cropland they recommended apex model parameter settings must be adjusted depending on the management strategies applied to crop pasture and grazing within the ceap study area baffaut et al 2017 showed that using best professional judgement to calibrate apex rather than a systematic calibration with observed data resulted in poor performance of the model for water quality simulations they did not address yield and water content but did have comparisons for runoff and nutrient movement nelson et al 2017 developed regional calibrations for water quality simulations with apex moriasi et al 2016 presented a framework for parameterizing apex for nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus transport they simulated water yield from tile drainage but did not discuss sensitivity of soil water contents and only addressed simulated long term averages of crop yields the apex model has been applied to a range of scenarios to simulate crop yields and soil water content in the cbw where calibration and parameterization have been carried out in only a few localized areas wang et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2014 also used the apex model to investigate a total maximum daily load tmdl from agriculture source in the cbw the apex model was recently used to assess the effects of crop management practices on nitrogen phosphorus and sediment loading of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw by the usda natural resources and conservation service usda nrcs usda nrcs 2015 addressed that the apex model was calibrated for the cbw by running against several sets of observed data and adjusting the parameters to obtain reasonably consistent and realistic results however the cbw is large and contains a diverse array of soils climates management scenarios and ecosystem types consequently even though apex has been calibrated to simulate water balances and yield based responses for specific locations within the cbw it is not practical to obtain data for all areas where the model is going to be applied there is a need to understand the ranges of error for simulated soil water content and crop yield that can be expected when the model is used to assess management practices for growing crop in the cbw and calibration data are not available the goal of this study is to investigate the performance of the apex model for simulating soil water content runoff corn yields and et in an instrumented field in the cbw where a detailed site specific calibration has not been carried out the motivation to address this question is that using default apex model parameters for the cbw may contribute to inaccurate results in a specific study area where a calibration is not available the specific objective is to evaluate the apex model performance for prediction of water content water balance scs curve number method 1972 et and maize yields using default parameters for the cbw by comparing simulations

bay is an estuary lying inland from the atlantic ocean and surrounded by the north american mainland to the west and the delmarva peninsula to the east it is the largest such body in u s the northern bay is within maryland the southern portion is within virginia and is a very important feature for the ecology of those two states more than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay s 1 6 105 km2 drainage basin fig 1 a the study site is located at the usda henry a wallace beltsville agriculture research center barc the research center comprises an area of approximately 3500 ha and is the largest green space in the metropolitan washington d c area it is in the patuxent river watershed that drains into the chesapeake bay much of the area is forested though significant areas are planted to grain and forage crops for both research and animal support observations on corn yield soil water content evapotranspiration and management are from a long term study of management effects on crop yields and environmental impact carried out at the ope3 site optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement fig 1b gish et al 2005 the ope3 site has four adjacent small watersheds with similar surface and sub surface soil and water flow characteristics the site consists of four surface hydrologically bounded sub watersheds about four ha each that are contained within a 25 ha field with no till management the sub watersheds feed a wooded riparian wetland and first order stream each of the four watersheds was formed from sandy fluvial deposits and has a varying slope ranging from 1 to 4 the research site is about 40 m above sea level and the site representative soil taxonomy includes coarse loamy siliceous mesic typic or aquic hapludults gish et al 2005 the

points 10 30 50 80 120 and 180 cm with 10 min time intervals the observed data were taken from sub basin b because a uniform application of n was applied as opposed to the variable rate applied to others table 1 presents a summary of ope3 operation schedules yield data were excluded from three years because of extensive damage from hurricane isabel 2003 and delayed harvests due to weather 2010 and 2012 which resulted in loss of the crop table 1 daily weather data were obtained from a nearby weather station at the research center located close to the site these weather data station 1 are also available from national climate data center ncdc the daily weather data obtained from barc had 57 missing records over the 16 year period the weather generator wxgn 3020 distributed by texas a m agrilife research was used to estimate these missing weather data precipitation is generated in the wxgn model based on a first order markov chain model developed by nicks 1974 which is also used in the cligen weather generator nicks et al 1995 air temperature and solar radiation generation is described by richardson 1981 wind generation in apex is based on the wind erosion continuous simulation

and discussion apex model simulation results for water content corn yields and et in an instrumented field at beltsville md in the cbw using default parameters from previous calibrations are presented in this study overall observed grain yields were 5 higher than simulated where the rsq was 0 54 figs 2 a and b the simulations captured the mean and trends well but yields were over predicted at low yields and under predicted at high yields simulated water stress and biomass described in fig 3 a and b show the correlation of a high number of water stress days in a season with low observed yields 36 days for 1998 40 days for 1999 and 34 days for 2002 but the overall correlation is low 0 09 there is one year with low yield 2011 and a low number of water stress days that pulls the correlation down fig 3b it is possible that a factor other than water stress caused the low yield that year the predicted and observed yields for this year were 5 7 and 2 8 t ha 1 respectively indicating the model did not capture the reason for the low yield the correlation of 0 54 for yield prediction shown in fig 2b and the water stress day scatter plot in fig 3b indicate that for many of the other years the model does capture the effects of water stress on yields fig 4 shows weekly averaged soil water content variation with apex simulations at sub basin b the initial results for total soil water content in the soil profile to 100 cm showed that simulated water amounts were about 4 4 cm 28 higher than observed but the trends followed the observed ones there may be several reasons for the consistently higher simulated water contents the higher simulated water contents could be due to higher infiltration amounts relative to actual or higher actual rates of drainage below 100 cm the ratio of precipitation that resulted in streamflow was 0 7 the ratio of evapotranspiration et to precipitation was 0 14 and the ratio of surface runoff to all components contributing to runoff e g surface flow return flow and subsurface flow returning to the surface was 0 74 the surface runoff ratio is slightly less than what is normally seen in related water flow 0 8 usgs 2004 this suggests that the higher than observed soil water contents in the simulations may be related to underestimation of surface runoff using the same soil water content measurements guber et al 2011 estimated that 65 83 of the rainfall events resulted in runoff or surface ponding the ratio of 0 74 reported above is in this range but at the low end suggesting that simulation of runoff was only slightly under predicted if at all water contents could also be higher if the parameters for the hydraulic properties result in higher water contents at a particular soil matric potential simulated water contents are higher than observed could lead to underestimation of nutrient movement from the profile via drainage seasonal based soil water content error analysis corresponding to fig 4 is given in table 4 planting and harvest dates are shown in the operation schedule in table 1 the r square and ns values for soil water content simulations had higher values for most cases in the planting season than in the growing and harvesting seasons the mean ns value for the harvest period was near 0 indicating the individual predictions were not good but the model matched the mean of the observed data well the average error statistics for soil water content to 100 cm depth in the planting period for rsq ens and root mean square error rmse are 0 51 0 42 and 0 33 cm respectively likewise the average error of soil water content for the growing period rsq ens and rmse is 0 48 0 38 and 0 12 cm respectively however rsq ens and rmse for soil water content for the harvest period indicates the high simulation errors for soil water content are related to the greater precipitation amounts during the planting period which corresponds to the spring season fig 5 high water uptake by the plants during the growing period may also buffer errors in water content simulations guber et al 2011 reported that the range of water content in this field tended to be higher around planting june than later in july 0 22 cm cm 3 vs 0 02 cm cm 3 the variation of rsq values within a season was high the values ranged from 0 8 to 0 02 in 2011 where observed yield was low and overpredicted by the model the rsq for water contents was 0 64 the observed yield was high in 2006 and under predicted by the model 7 6 vs 5 4 t ha 1 but the rsq for water content was 0 02 the average rmse for water contents was smallest in the growing period probably because active plant water uptake will limit the variability of water contents plant uptake dominates the hydraulic processes during the growing season relative to infiltration and drainage overall it seems that correct prediction of water content is not critical for accurate yield predictions especially if there is minimal water stress the choice of a value for curve number cn can have a large effect on simulated water contents this value determines how rainfall is partitioned between infiltration and runoff curve number was varied to investigate the effect on simulated water contents fig 6 we used five different cn approaches table 3 the use of a variable daily cn simulation cn 5 in fig 6 is the most robust and reliable because cn can be updated by the daily soil moisture index usgs 2004 for example field capacity fc was updated from 0 09 default value to 0 26 with soil moisture conditions in cn 5 option since fc has strong influence on soil water dynamics soil water content simulation with cn 5 also showed good results when fc is updated since the apex model consists of interconnected mechanisms among parameters individual parameter calibration may affect other parameters which can increase error for example once we select cn 5 for runoff calculation the retention parameter s will be changed by cn similarly cn will be changed by fc and fc is influenced by the soil moisture condition even though we calibrated one parameter cn it influences other model mechanisms apex simulations with cn 1 and cn 2 table 3 are not presented in fig 6 due to the similarity of these results to soil water content patterns in the cn 3 option the apex estimation of et using the penman monteith approach largely follows the trends of the observed values in the ope3 watershed fig 7 the statistical error analysis of rsq ens and rmse are 0 58 0 54 and 5 35 mm month 1 of et in growing period respectively table 5 unlike et simulations in the growing period results aggregated over all other periods show better simulation performance with 0 74 rsq 0 72 ens and 4 03 mm month 1 rmse overall the simulation of et had higher rsq values than those of the simulated water contents tables 4 and 5 and less year to year variation in the rsq values this suggests that et calculations are fairly robust and do not contribute a large component to the errors in water content simulations 4 summary and conclusions the apex model is used in a wide range of locations to evaluate conservation practices on farm land it is not practical to calibrate the model for all locations where it is used to assess management practices the objective of this paper was to assess the performance of apex for calculation of soil water content et and corn yield for a field in the chesapeake bay watershed cbw where no site specific calibration was done only default parameters from calibrations with other sites in the cbw were used we compared apex simulations to 15 years of observed data 1998 2013 from an instrumented field at the ope3 site in the chesapeake bay watershed five different approaches to calculate curve numbers cn were compared to investigate the effect on the water balance model comparisons with observed data indicated that simulated soil water amounts in the soil profile to 100 cm were about 4 4 cm 28 higher compared to observed soil water in the soil profile to 100 cm but the trends were very similar to observed when using the cn 5 option variable daily cn with soil moisture index we found the highest simulation errors in soil water content occurred in most years during the late summer and fall harvesting period the largest errors in et prediction however occurred during the growing season the greater precipitation amounts and greater variation in soil water content in harvesting period fig 5 compared to the planting period fig 5 may have contributed to higher soil water content errors in the apex simulations table 4 the apex estimation of et also showed reasonable trends with observed et the model rsq ens and rmse were 0 56 0 41 and 4 49 mm month 1 respectively even though the resulting et in the growing period had slightly higher simulation errors than all other periods overall average simulation errors in et were in agreement with the observed data overall errors in et calculations during the growing season did not appear to be a large component of errors in predicting water content during this time this study also investigated several approaches to the curve number cn method to estimate runoff in the cn method the runoff retention parameter s and cn can be varied to allow for differences in soils land use slope soil water content and hydrologic soil group we used five cn and soil water options and found that the variable daily cn with soil moisture index cn 5 that is updated with soil moisture was the most robust and reliable the cn 5 option however may not always provide robust simulations in apex because each study area has unique topographic characteristics that is why such a numerical based computation model should provide several options which would be optimal for different areas thus further investigation of the apex cn simulation with different study areas is needed to improve accuracy and provide the best cn and soil water option depending on study area soil types the results of this study concluded that apex performance in the ope3 site varied by season pre plant growing and post plant prediction of et was least accurate for the growing season and most accurate for the other two seasons combined water content predictions were most accurate for the growing season pre plant and post plant seasons in that order year to year variance in simulated water contents was higher than that for et this suggests other sources of errors in predicting water contents than et alone apex predicted mean crop yield with an average error of 0 3 t ha 1 where mean observed yield was 5 18 t ha 1 apex slightly overpredicted low yields and underpredicted high yields water content predictions were worse in the post growing season where there was more rainfall and less plant water uptake the apex model is a useful and accurate tool to assess water conservation issues on agricultural cropland in the chesapeake bay watershed however these simulation results may vary for different areas and other output variables therefore additional studies with the wide array of sub basins would help to evaluate the apex approach in the chesapeake bay watershed especially with respect to phosphorus

11016,the agricultural policy environmental extender apex is a complex mechanistic simulation model designed to evaluate agricultural management strategies and their effects on yields water and soil quality and resource use it is one of the main models used in the conservation effects assessment project ceap assessment program and has been employed to evaluate the effects of conservation practices in the chesapeake bay watershed cbw calibration of model parameters is an important process in order to apply a simulation model to a particular area the apex model is normally parameterized for each application using selected datasets from the region however the apex application area is usually very large and all areas may not be well represented by the calibration thus additional tests of apex without site specific calibration for crop yield and soil water content can provide information on the stability of the parameters related to these variables in the cbw the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of apex for corn yields and water balance in a new location using parameters previously developed for the cbw this study used observations from the ope3 site optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement located at the us department of agriculture henry a wallace agricultural research center beltsville maryland usa data from the ope3 site consists of water content at various layers corn yields and et covering the period from 1998 to 2013 the results for total water in the soil profile up to 100 cm deep showed that the simulated water amounts were about 4 4 cm higher than the observed values but the trends were very similar to the observed trends the statistical error analysis of r square rsq nash sutcliffe ens efficiency coefficient and root mean square error rmse are 0 59 0 51 and 0 21 cm day 1 respectively the average simulated yields were 0 3 t ha 1 4 lower than observed yields with an average absolute deviation between apex and ope3 of 1 3 t ha1 where the average observed yields over the period was 5 18 t ha 1 the year to year trends were very similar to the measured trends the monthly evapotranspiration data also showed reasonable trends between observed data and model results with the model rsq ens and rmse being 0 56 0 41 and 4 49 mm month 1 respectively these results suggest that apex parameters for yield and water use simulations calibrated for the cbw can be considered applicable to other areas of the cbw where calibration data are not available keywords apex ceap cbw ope3 soil water content corn yields 1 introduction an important source of funding for soil conservation programs in the united states is the u s government the u s congress requested greater accountability for these funds when they were significantly increased in the 2002 farm bill the requirement for accountability resulted in a need to better quantify the benefits of conservation practices such that a monetary amount could be associated with them the conservation effects assessment project ceap is a multi agency effort to address the needs to quantify the effectiveness conservation practices johnson et al 2015 an important component of ceap includes computational approaches to assess the effects of land use climate soils and crop management practices on environmental processes and agricultural production one of the main models used in the ceap cropland assessment program is the agricultural policy environmental extender model apex the apex model has been developed by extending the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to field scale small watershed level williams et al 1984 williams and izaurralde 2006 the apex model simulates interactions between management practices and ecosystem processes that are important to conservation efforts including nutrient and soil transport at the edge of field or bottom of root zone soil water balances pesticide transport and crop growth in addition apex has been used for investigating the impacts of different nutrient management practices tillage operations conservation practices double cropping systems and other practices on surface runoff infiltration percolation nutrient pollutant and losses of sediment and nutrient from field to watershed scales gassman et al 2010 gassman et al 2010 provided an overview of all the major components for the national pilot project for livestock and the environment npp assessments using apex simulations they indicated that the apex model has much more detailed components than the soil water assessment tool swat in field scale cropping systems field operations conservation practices and silvicultural practices this level of detail allows apex to simulate complex and detailed management practices the management datasets used in apex are derived from the national resource inventory nri carried out by the natural resources conservation service an agency of the u s dept of agriculture usda nrcs natural resources conservation service 2015 apex has been an effective tool to assess the effects of soil conservation practices in the ohio river valley santhi et al 2014 to simulate hydrology and pesticide losses in rotational cotton and peanut fields under southern atlantic coastal plain conditions plotkin et al 2013 and was used in field scale monitoring to compare the effect of no till and reduced till management practices on water quality in northeast indiana francesconi et al 2014 the water budget simulation in apex is a crucial process among the model components first rainfall interception is estimated by plant canopies next apex partitions rainfall into surface runoff and subsurface flow saleh et al 2000 subsurface flow in apex is composed of horizontal and vertical flows saleh and gallego 2007 surface runoff simulation in apex estimates daily runoff volume and maximum daily runoff rate as a function of daily rainfall the scs soil conservation service curve number method and the green ampt green and ampt 1911 approach are used for estimating infiltration and surface runoff volume this study is used scs curve number method to estimate water flux wang et al 2006 selected random representative sets of apex model data to investigate the sensitivity analysis of model performance they reported that runoff and water related outputs are very sensitive to the nrcs curve number index calibration is an important process to increase confidence that apex accurately simulates system processes for a location santhi et al 2014 carried out a ceap cropland regional assessment with apex and swat in the ohio river basin they performed a systematic calibration scheme for stream flow upland erosion channel erosion and nutrients transported to capture the spatial variation in annual water yield they concluded that the calibration parameters in the apex were not adequate to get the water yield within a 20 error wang et al 2011 described an upgraded apex model for data inputs and parameter settings in ceap cropland they recommended apex model parameter settings must be adjusted depending on the management strategies applied to crop pasture and grazing within the ceap study area baffaut et al 2017 showed that using best professional judgement to calibrate apex rather than a systematic calibration with observed data resulted in poor performance of the model for water quality simulations they did not address yield and water content but did have comparisons for runoff and nutrient movement nelson et al 2017 developed regional calibrations for water quality simulations with apex moriasi et al 2016 presented a framework for parameterizing apex for nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus transport they simulated water yield from tile drainage but did not discuss sensitivity of soil water contents and only addressed simulated long term averages of crop yields the apex model has been applied to a range of scenarios to simulate crop yields and soil water content in the cbw where calibration and parameterization have been carried out in only a few localized areas wang et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2014 also used the apex model to investigate a total maximum daily load tmdl from agriculture source in the cbw the apex model was recently used to assess the effects of crop management practices on nitrogen phosphorus and sediment loading of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw by the usda natural resources and conservation service usda nrcs usda nrcs 2015 addressed that the apex model was calibrated for the cbw by running against several sets of observed data and adjusting the parameters to obtain reasonably consistent and realistic results however the cbw is large and contains a diverse array of soils climates management scenarios and ecosystem types consequently even though apex has been calibrated to simulate water balances and yield based responses for specific locations within the cbw it is not practical to obtain data for all areas where the model is going to be applied there is a need to understand the ranges of error for simulated soil water content and crop yield that can be expected when the model is used to assess management practices for growing crop in the cbw and calibration data are not available the goal of this study is to investigate the performance of the apex model for simulating soil water content runoff corn yields and et in an instrumented field in the cbw where a detailed site specific calibration has not been carried out the motivation to address this question is that using default apex model parameters for the cbw may contribute to inaccurate results in a specific study area where a calibration is not available the specific objective is to evaluate the apex model performance for prediction of water content water balance scs curve number method 1972 et and maize yields using default parameters for the cbw by comparing simulations

bay is an estuary lying inland from the atlantic ocean and surrounded by the north american mainland to the west and the delmarva peninsula to the east it is the largest such body in u s the northern bay is within maryland the southern portion is within virginia and is a very important feature for the ecology of those two states more than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay s 1 6 105 km2 drainage basin fig 1 a the study site is located at the usda henry a wallace beltsville agriculture research center barc the research center comprises an area of approximately 3500 ha and is the largest green space in the metropolitan washington d c area it is in the patuxent river watershed that drains into the chesapeake bay much of the area is forested though significant areas are planted to grain and forage crops for both research and animal support observations on corn yield soil water content evapotranspiration and management are from a long term study of management effects on crop yields and environmental impact carried out at the ope3 site optimizing production inputs for economic and environmental enhancement fig 1b gish et al 2005 the ope3 site has four adjacent small watersheds with similar surface and sub surface soil and water flow characteristics the site consists of four surface hydrologically bounded sub watersheds about four ha each that are contained within a 25 ha field with no till management the sub watersheds feed a wooded riparian wetland and first order stream each of the four watersheds was formed from sandy fluvial deposits and has a varying slope ranging from 1 to 4 the research site is about 40 m above sea level and the site representative soil taxonomy includes coarse loamy siliceous mesic typic or aquic hapludults gish et al 2005 the

data from field b of the ope3 site consist of water content at various layers and locations corn grain yields covering the period from 1998 to 2013 and et from 2001 to 2013 soil water content is recorded by multi sensor capacitance probes guber et al 2011 which are installed at eight locations in field b of ope3 site fig 1b the water contents are recorded at specific vertical monitoring points 10 30 50 80 120 and 180 cm with 10 min time intervals the observed data were taken from sub basin b because a uniform application of n was applied as opposed to the variable rate applied to others table 1 presents a summary of ope3 operation schedules yield data were excluded from three years because of extensive damage from hurricane isabel 2003 and delayed harvests due to weather 2010 and 2012 which resulted in loss of the crop table 1 daily weather data were obtained from a nearby weather station at the research center located close to the site these weather data station 1 are also available from national climate data center ncdc the daily weather data obtained from barc had 57 missing records over the 16 year period the weather generator wxgn 3020 distributed by texas a m

components have been incorporated into apex in addition to the routing algorithms the routing mechanisms provide for evaluation of interactions between subareas involving surface runoff return flow sediment deposition and degradation nutrient transport and groundwater flow the apex parameters used in this study were from calibrations carried out for 22 sub watersheds in the cbw by the usda natural resources conservation service lee atwood personal communication 2015 we did not do any further calibration to fit the parameters to the ope3 site data the parameter values were provided by

and discussion apex model simulation results for water content corn yields and et in an instrumented field at beltsville md in the cbw using default parameters from previous calibrations are presented in this study overall observed grain yields were 5 higher than simulated where the rsq was 0 54 figs 2 a and b the simulations captured the mean and trends well but yields were over predicted at low yields and under predicted at high yields simulated water stress and biomass described in fig 3 a and b show the correlation of a high number of water stress days in a season with low observed yields 36 days for 1998 40 days for 1999 and 34 days for 2002 but the overall correlation is low 0 09 there is one year with low yield 2011 and a low number of water stress days that pulls the correlation down fig 3b it is possible that a factor other than water stress caused the low yield that year the predicted and observed yields for this year were 5 7 and 2 8 t ha 1 respectively indicating the model did not capture the reason for the low yield the correlation of 0 54 for yield prediction shown in fig 2b and the water stress day scatter plot in fig 3b indicate that for many of the other years the model does capture the effects of water stress on yields fig 4 shows weekly averaged soil water content variation with apex simulations at sub basin b the initial results for total soil water content in the soil profile to 100 cm showed that simulated water amounts were about 4 4 cm 28 higher than observed but the trends followed the observed ones there may be several reasons for the consistently higher simulated water contents the higher simulated water contents could be due to higher infiltration amounts relative to actual or higher actual rates of drainage below 100 cm the ratio of precipitation that resulted in streamflow was 0 7 the ratio of evapotranspiration et to precipitation was 0 14 and the ratio of surface runoff to all components contributing to runoff e g surface flow return flow and subsurface flow returning to the surface was 0 74 the surface runoff ratio is slightly less than what is normally seen in related water flow 0 8 usgs 2004 this suggests that the higher than observed soil water contents in the simulations may be related to underestimation of surface runoff using the same soil water content measurements guber et al 2011 estimated that 65 83 of the rainfall events resulted in runoff or surface ponding the ratio of 0 74 reported above is in this range but at the low end suggesting that simulation of runoff was only slightly under predicted if at all water contents could also be higher if the parameters for the hydraulic properties result in higher water contents at a particular soil matric potential simulated water contents are higher than observed could lead to underestimation of nutrient movement from the profile via drainage seasonal based soil water content error analysis corresponding to fig 4 is given in table 4 planting and harvest dates are shown in the operation schedule in table 1 the r square and ns values for soil water content simulations had higher values for most cases in the planting season than in

keywords winter wheat root sourced signal regulated deficit irrigation water control modes root respiration rate dry matter accumulation and remobilization 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the main crops in northern china the precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat is less than 40 of its water requirement li et al 2010 and irrigation provides more than 60 of seasonal water requirement by winter wheat zhang et al 2004 agricultural water supplies are running low in northern china which has seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture in this area however the shortage and serious waste of agricultural water are two contradictory aspects in this area zhang et al 2010 apparently in order to alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of agricultural water resources it is urgent to develop water saving irrigation in this area reasonable irrigation schedule is the key to implementing water saving irrigation excessive irrigation can not only cause deep seepage but also result in soil moisture saturation and hypoxia in the rhizosphere which is not conducive to the absorption of water and nutrients bhattarai et al 2006 inadequate irrigation cannot meet the water needs of crops resulting in a decline in crop yields li et al 2010 jha et al 2017 however the production practice of dry land agriculture shows that the crops are highly malleable in water use appropriate water deficit can meet water requirement of plant metabolism and improve wue of crops chaves et al 2003 jackson et al 2000 as important parameters to formulate water saving irrigation schedule the upper and lower limits of soil water determine the irrigation quota and time of crops previous researches on irrigation quota have mostly been based on the principle of water balance in farmland smout and gorantiwar 2005 the theory of deficit irrigation araya et al 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 farre and faci 2006 and model simulation iqbal et al 2014 also some researches were conducted to determine optimal irrigation schedule by artificially designing some irrigation amounts and then comparing grain yield and wue of different water treatments panda et al 2004 du et al 2010 although some positive effects have been confirmed in the above studies water saving benefits of crops still need to be further improved by controlling irrigation water accurately therefore it is necessary to optimize the current water control modes and develop accurate irrigation so as to give full play to the water saving and yield potential of crops in agricultural water saving irrigation practice irrigation schedules are often optimized according to the sensitivity of plants to water deficit kirda 2002 plant s sensitivity to soil moisture varies in different growth stages payero et al 2009 so it is very difficult to determine reasonable irrigation quota in different growth stages root of plant is the absorber of soil water and the earliest perceiver of soil water deficit therefore water saving research of crops should concentrate on root behaviors especially root sourced signaling behavior root sourced signaling is often considered to be important in regulating shoot growth and water use davies and zhang 1991 dodd 2005 the regulation of root sourced signals on plants in gradually dry soil includes two processes nhrs and hrs xiong et al 2006 roots of plant first produce nhrs mainly aba during the drought which are transmitted to the shoot where leaf stomatal opening are restricted thus reducing the water loss through stomata transpiration by this time however shoot water status and p n is not affected significantly davies et al 1994 xiong et al 2007 continuing drought gradually causes leaf water deficit and further lowers stomatal opening and p n this indicates that the end of nhrs and the appearence of hrs of plant blackman and davies 1985 nhrs is the plant s early defense against impending drought davies et al 1994 in the practice of irrigation controlling suitable irrigation quota can regulate leaf transpiration rate tr with nhrs generated by roots so as to reduce water loss of canopy and improve water use efficiency of crop it will be an effective way to optimize the water saving irrigation of crops li and zhao 1997 in the present study the measurements were first conducted to quantify the characteristics of non hydraulic root sourced signals nhrs hydraulic root sourced signals hrs and photosynthetic rate p n of winter wheat in progressively drying soil based on the characteristics of root sourced signal of winter wheat plants were exposed to 3 different water control modes according to the threshold range of root sourced signals the objective of this study was to determine the suitable water saving irrigation mode by analyzing physiological characteristics the consumption and distribution of water and photosynthate and yield formation of winter wheat under diferrent water control modes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design the experiments were performed at the experimental stationthe of farmland irrigation research institute xinxiang china

were fertilized with n 120 kg ha 1 p 60 kg ha 1 and k 48 kg ha 1 before sowing winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv yumai 49 was sown in rows 20 cm apart on 15 october the total density was 2 50 million basic seedlings per hectare 2 2 the micro plot experiment the experiment was performed from october 15th 2011 to june 10th 2012 each micro plot was 0 5 m 0 5 m the micro plot is constructed with a metal bucket with a height of 1 3 m the metal bucket was put into a square hole with a depth of 1 2 m which had been dug in the field beforehand and then filled with the soil just as it was in levels of original soil profiles soil volume was 0 30 m3 winter wheat was planted at a density of 60 seedlings per micro plot plants were maintained at about 65 70 fwc field water capacity before root sourced signal measurements at the jointing and heading stages plants were divided into two groups group a and group b plants in group a were maintained at 70 75 fwc throughout the experiment plants in group b were dried naturally the root sourced signals and p n were monitored during drought monitoring the root sourced signals of plant the root sourced signals of plants were monitored at jointing and heading stages the occurrence of root sourced signals was determined by analyzing stomatal conductance gs and leaf relative water content lrwc of plants nhrs was adjudged to appear when plants in group b had significantly lower gs with similar lrwc compared with group a fig 1 hrs was adjudged to appear when gs and lrwc of plants in group b were both lower than those in group a when nhrs and hrs each occured swc of group b was measured by drying and weighing method monitoring p n gs and lrwc at the jointing and heading stages p n and gs of recently fully mature leaves were monitored using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa every two hours from 9 00 am to 16 00 pm daily after p n measurements the leaf was promptly cut down to deternine its lrwc each group included 9 replicated measures 3 leaves 3 micro plots 2 3 the field experiment the field experiment was performed from october 2011 to june 2013 based on swcs when nhrs and hrs appeared and p n decreased significantly in winter wheat at different growing stages fig 2 3 water control modes were designed ck full irrigation swc when nhrs occurs was used as the lower limit of irrigation w1 swcs when nhrs occurs and p n has significant decline were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation respectively after jointing stage and w2 swcs when p n has significant decline and nhrs terminates that is hrs occurs were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation respectively after jointing stage all plots were arranged under a transparent rainproof shelter each treatment consisted of three replicated plots and each plot was 2 m 3 3 m all treatments were maintained at 60 65 fwc during seedling stage after jointing stage soil moisture of each treatment was controlled according to the characteristics of root sourced signal and p n in the micro plot experiment fig 4 the upper and lower limits of soil water and planned wetting depth of each treatment in different growing stages are shown in table 1 the soil water content swc was measured at every10 cm in 0 20 cm soil layer by drying and weighing and at every 20 cm in 20 80 cm soil layer by the neutron scattering technique cpn 503 usa every 10 days during the growing period of winter wheat the average moisture content of soil in each plot was calculated after swc measurements irrigation was carried out when swc was below the lower limit of soil water table 1 irrigation amount was calculated according to the following formula 1 i γ θ u θ h 10 where i is irrigating water quota mm γ is volume mass g cm3 h is planned wetting depth cm θ u is the upper limit of soil water θ is swc of planned wetting depth before irrigation pn tr and root respiration the instantaneous p n and tr of recently fully mature leaves were measured using a portable photosynthesis system from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m on sunny days at jointing and anthesis stages respectively each plot included 3 replicated measures at anthesis stage root respiration was immediately measured after p n was measured plants were first cut off along the ground before measuring the root respiration after excision root respiration was measured using a portable environmental gas analyer pp systems boston usa each plot contains two measurements one centered over the row and the other from the mid point between the rows their mean value represented the total soil respiration the respiration of bare soil was estimated in 3 bare plots root respiration r root was calculated as 2 r root r total r bare where r total is the total soil respiration in each plot r bare is the bare soil respiration adm and dmr plants of 1 0 m2 in each plot were randomly sampled at flowering and maturity stages respectively plant samples were immediately dried at 75 to constant weight adm of plants was calculated according to the following formula 3 adm dmwm dmwa dmr of plants was calculated according to the following formula 4 dmr dmwa dmwm grain yield where dmwa is dry matter weight of plants at anthesis dmwm is dry matter weight of plants at maturity yield traits at maturity plants of 1 0 m2 was randomly sampled from each plot for measuring their yield traits including spike number kernels per spike thousand kernel weight and grain yield water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue wue and iwue was calculated according to the following formulas 5 wue y grain et 6 iwue y grain ir where y grain is the grain yield of wheat in each plot et is the total seasonal evapotranspiration and ir was the recorded irrigation volume in the field 2 4 statistical analysis the data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance in spss 13 0 comparisons among different irrigation modes were performed using least significant difference lsd tests at the 0 05levels 3 results 3 1 the threshold of root sourced signals and swcs when pn decreased significantly in the micro plot experiment the occurrence of root sourced signals was determined by analyzing gs and lrwc of plants at jointing stage compared group a plants in group b had similar gs and lrwc 1 4 d after stopping water but had significantly lower gs without a change in lrwc 6 d after stopping water fig 3 this showed that the nhrs of plants in group b appeared at this moment continuing drought aggravated leaf water deficit and further restricted leaf gs p n and lrwc of plants in group b decreased significantly 8 and10 days after stopping water respectively fig 3 a significantly decreased lrwc means the end of nhrs and the appearence of hrs of plant by measuring swc in group b it indicated that swcs when nhrs and hrs of plants appeared were 60 3 and 51 3 fwc respectively the swc when p n of plants in group b decreased significantly was 55 2 fwc fig 4 at anthesis the nhrs and hrs of plants in group b appeared 3 and 7d after stopping water respectively fig 3 the swcs when nhrs and hrs of plants appeared were 65 2 and

fig 4 3 2 plant population traits of winter wheat under different water control modes in the plot experiment plants were subjected to 3 water control modes table 1 based on the above characteristics of root sourced signal and p n fig 4 3 water control modes had different effects on plants population traits at jointing stage w1 and w2 had similar tiller number to ck but significantly lower plant height and leaf area compared with ck there was no significant difference in plant height and tiller number between w1 and w2 w2 had lower leaf area compared to w1 at anthesis plant height leaf area and tiller number significantly differed from each other among different water control modes both w1 and w2 significantly reduced plant height leaf area and tiller number of plant compared with ck table 2 3 3 p n t r and wueleaf of winter wheat under different water control modes different water control modes significantly affected leaf physiological properties of plants at jointing and flowering stages w1 and w2 both significantly lowered leaf t r of plant compared with ck w1 had similar leaf p n to ck and but w2 significantly lowered p n of plant fig 5 the leaf instantaneous water use efficiency wueleaf was estimated based on the p n t r both w1 and w2 had significantly higher wueleaf compared with ck at jointing and flowering stages 3 4 root respiration adm and dmr of wheat under different water control modes root respiration of plants significantly differed from each other among different water control modes at flowering stage w1 and w2 both had significantly lower root respiration rate compared with ck different water control modes also had significant effect on adm and dmr w1 significantly increased adm and dmr of wheat compared with ck w2 significantly lowered adm of wheat but had no effect on dmr fig 6 3 5 yield traits wue and iwue of wheat under different water control modes 3 water control modes had different effects on yield traits of winter wheat compared with ck w1 reduced spike number but had no effect on grain yield due to increased thousand kernel weight tkw w2 significantly lowered spike number kernels per spike and tkw thus reducing grian yield compared with ck w1 significantly raised harvest index of winter wheat but w2 reduced it compared with ck table 3 in two test years w1 significantly reduced irrigation water and improved wue and iwue of wheat compared with w2 and ck table 4 w2 failed to increase wue of plant due to a reduced grain yield compared to ck 4 discussion 4 1 root sourced signal theory and irrigation schedule optimization optimizing irrigation regime can improve the benefit of irrigation water and save water resource thus increase the yield and wue of crop farre and faci 2009 root can regulate leaf tr and water loss of plant through the transmission of root sourced signals which is used to guide agricultural water saving irrigation li and zhao 1997 some water saving irrigation techniques such as partial root zone drought dry and loveys 1998 and alternate partial root zone irrigation kang and zhang 2004 both reduced water consumption by lowering tr through the regulation of root sourced signal on the shoot and thus improved wue of crops our previous study also showed that appropriate water deficit during jointing stage can trigger nhrs of plants at higher swc level by improving the nhrs sensitivity in the late growing stages and thus reduce water loss through tr and increase wue of winter wheat ma et al 2015 in addition irrigation schedules are often optimized according to the sensitivity of plants to water deficit at different growing stages kirda 2002 crop is relatively insensitive to water deficit during early vegetative growth stages because plant s demand to water is relatively low at this point and the plants are better adapted to severe water deficit than during reproductive stage cakir 2004 the results of our study also showed swcs when nhrs and hrs appeared and pn decreased significantly at flowering stage were higher than at jointing stage this high sensitivity to water deficit means that it is risky to implement water saving irrigation strategies during reproductive stage without incurring loss of yield the limited irrigation imposed on crop during reproductive stage resulted in more yield reduction than during vegetative stage mansouri far et al 2010 however igbadun et al 2007 reported that good yields can be obtained with suitable irrigation at the flowering growth stage even if irrigation is limited during the vegetative stages it is obvious that only scientifically controlling irrigation volume can save irrigation water without causing significant reduction in yield in the present study the irrigation water of winter wheat was controlled based on the characteristics of root sourced signal and p n of plant the results showed w1 saved irrigation water but had no effect on grain yield thus increasing wue of wheat therefore optimizing the irrigation schedules based on the regulation of root sourced signals on plant has wide application prospects in water saving irrigation of crops 4 2 plant population traits and wue of crop under different water control modes soil water condition affects the growth development and metabolism of root system by which also affects the growth and physiology of the shoots xue et al 2006 jensen et al 2010 sampathkumar et al 2012 previous studies showed that nhrs produced by the root in drying soil can regulate the growth of the shoot mainly leaf expansion thus reducing the water loss through the leaf xiong et al 2006 2007 in the present study plants in w1 were maintained swc within the threshold range of nhrs table 1 and fig 4 influenced by the nhrs w1 reduced not only leaf area and plant height but also tiller number of plant which is good for reducing water consumption through the canopy the leaf t r and p n of plants are regulated by stomata opening but the decreased stomata opening has less effect on p n than on t r of plants plaut 1995 wueleaf depends on the ratio of p n and t r and so partial stomatal closure is beneficial to improving wueleaf and realizing physiological water saving of plant previous study showed that the drought signals nhrs produced by the root can optimize the relationship between p n and t r by regulating stomata opening thus improving the wue of the plant lyer and caplan 1998 xiong et al 2006 this study also showed influenced by the nhrs w1 significantly reduced t r and had no effect on p n of plants thus increasing wueleaf and wue compared to ck jensen et al 2010 suggested that deficit irrigation based on root signaling improved iwue of potatoes and tomatoes without causing significant reduction of yield in this study w1 significantly reduced irrigation water but had no effect on grain yield thus increasing wue and iwue of plant the regulation of root sourced signal on the shoots of plant has been confirmed by more and more studies ahmadi et al 2009 2010 croker et al 1998 rodrigues et al 2008 zweifel et al 2007 therefore controlling suitable soil moisture w1 based on characteristics of nhrs and p n can optimize the relationship between pn and t r and improve wue of crops by the regulation of nhrs in plants 4 3 the grain yield root respiration adm and dmr under different water control modes the root system is the main absorption organ of soil water and nutrients maintaining the physiological and metabolic functions of the root system consumes a large amount of photosynthate through root respiration mccree 1986 previous studies have showed that the root system of wheat consumes more than 50 of the photosynthate through root respiration lambers et al 1996 therefore maintaining stable leaf photosynthesis and less carbon consumption through root respiration will help increase the grain yield of crop liu and li 2005 soil moisture had significant effect on leaf p n ma et al 2015 and root respiration of plant paudel et al 2018 in addition proper soil moisture helps to increase yield of crop by optimizing allocation of photosynthate between root and shoot mingo et al 2004 therefore it is reasonable to increase grain yield of wheat by reducing root respiration and optimizing photosynthate allocation between root and shoot through controlling soil water the present study showed that w1 had no effect on leaf p n but lowered the photosynthate consumption through root respiration which resulted in increased adm of shoot grain growth depends not only on current photosynthesis and adm but also on dmr to grains after flowering foulkes et al 2002 richards et al 2002 soil moisture has vital influence on the dmr in the filling stage of wheat foulkes et al 2002 proper water stress helps to increase the dmr yang et al 2000 the previous studies showed that proper water deficit between jointing and anthesis stages increased both p n and dmr thus increasing grain yield of wheat xue et al 2006 ma et al 2015 in the present study w1 reduced spike number and increased thousand kernel weight tkw due to higher adm and dmr and so had no effect on grain yield compared to ck the declining photosynthesis during grain filling often leads to a significant decrease in wheat yield kobata et al 1992 this study also shows that w2 significantly reduced grian yield due to reduced p n and adm 5 conclusion this study showed that swcs when root sourced signal occured and p n decreased significantly are different in different growing stages of plant at jointing stage swcs when nhrs and hrs occured were 60 3 and 51 3 fwc respectively and swc when leaf p n decreased significantly was 55 2 fwc at heading stage these swcs were 65 2 56 3 and 61 3 fwc respectively based on the above characteristics of root sourced signals and p n in different growing stages of plant controlling suitable soil moisture w1 can optimize the relationship between p n and t r through the regulation of nhrs in plants and thus improve wueleaf of crops in addition w1 also reduced irrigation water and increased wue and iwue of wheat by regulating the consumption and distribution of water and photosynthate although w2 significantly reduced irrigation water it reduced grain yield due to a declined p n and thus failed to increase wue of plant compared to ck acknowledgements this research was supported by the fund of

main crops in northern china the precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat is less than 40 of its water requirement li et al 2010 and irrigation provides more than 60 of seasonal water requirement by winter wheat zhang et al 2004 agricultural water supplies are running low in northern china which has seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture in this area however the shortage and serious waste of agricultural water are two contradictory aspects in this area zhang et al 2010 apparently in order to alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of agricultural water resources it is urgent to develop water saving irrigation in this area reasonable irrigation schedule is the key to implementing water saving irrigation excessive irrigation can not only cause deep seepage but also result in soil moisture saturation and hypoxia in the rhizosphere which is not conducive to the absorption of water and nutrients bhattarai et al 2006 inadequate irrigation cannot meet the water needs of crops resulting in a decline in crop yields li et al 2010 jha et al 2017 however the production practice of dry land agriculture shows that the crops are highly malleable in water use appropriate water deficit can meet water requirement of plant metabolism and improve wue of crops chaves et al 2003 jackson et al 2000 as important parameters to formulate water saving irrigation schedule the upper and lower limits of soil water determine the irrigation quota and time of crops previous researches on irrigation quota have mostly been based on the principle of water balance in farmland smout and gorantiwar 2005 the theory of deficit irrigation araya et al 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 farre and faci 2006 and model simulation iqbal et al 2014 also some researches were conducted to determine optimal irrigation schedule by artificially designing some irrigation amounts and then comparing grain yield and wue of different water treatments panda et al 2004 du et al 2010 although some positive effects have been confirmed in the above studies water saving benefits of crops still need to be further improved by controlling irrigation water accurately therefore it is necessary to optimize the current water control modes and develop accurate irrigation so as to give full play to the water saving and yield potential of crops in agricultural water saving irrigation practice irrigation schedules are often optimized according to the sensitivity of plants to water deficit kirda 2002 plant s sensitivity to soil moisture varies in different growth stages payero et al 2009 so it is very difficult to determine reasonable irrigation quota in different growth stages root of plant is the absorber of soil water and the earliest perceiver of soil water deficit therefore water saving research of crops should concentrate on root behaviors especially root sourced signaling behavior root sourced signaling is often considered to be important in regulating shoot growth and water use davies and zhang 1991 dodd 2005 the regulation of root sourced signals on plants in gradually dry soil includes two processes nhrs and hrs xiong et al 2006 roots of plant first produce nhrs mainly aba during the drought which are transmitted to the shoot where leaf stomatal opening are restricted thus reducing the water loss through stomata transpiration by this time however shoot water status and p n is not affected significantly davies et al 1994 xiong et al 2007 continuing drought gradually causes leaf water deficit and further lowers stomatal opening and p n this indicates that the end of nhrs and the appearence of hrs of plant blackman and davies 1985 nhrs is the plant s early defense against impending drought davies et al 1994 in the practice of irrigation controlling suitable irrigation quota can regulate leaf transpiration rate tr with nhrs generated by roots so as to reduce water loss of canopy and improve water use efficiency of crop it will be an effective way to optimize the water saving irrigation of crops li and zhao 1997 in the present study the measurements were first conducted to quantify the characteristics of non hydraulic root sourced signals nhrs hydraulic root sourced signals hrs and photosynthetic rate p n of winter wheat in progressively drying soil based on the characteristics of root sourced signal of winter wheat plants were exposed to 3 different water control modes according to the threshold range of root sourced signals the objective of this study was to determine the suitable water saving irrigation mode by analyzing physiological characteristics the consumption and distribution of water and photosynthate and yield formation of winter wheat under diferrent water control modes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design the experiments were performed at the experimental stationthe of farmland irrigation research institute xinxiang china 35 18 n 113 54 e the experiments include a plot experiment and a micro plot experiment all plots and micro plots were arranged randomly under a transparent rainproof shelter all plots and micro plots were fertilized with n 120 kg ha 1 p 60 kg ha 1 and k 48 kg ha 1 before sowing winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv yumai 49 was sown in rows 20 cm apart on 15 october the total density was 2 50 million basic seedlings per hectare 2 2 the micro plot experiment the experiment was performed from october 15th 2011 to june 10th 2012 each micro plot was 0 5 m 0 5 m the micro plot is constructed with a metal bucket with a height of 1 3 m the metal bucket was put into a square hole with a depth of 1 2 m which had been dug in the field beforehand and then filled with the soil just as it was in levels of original soil profiles soil volume was 0 30 m3 winter wheat was planted at a density of 60 seedlings per micro plot plants were maintained at about 65 70 fwc field water capacity before root sourced signal measurements at the jointing and heading stages plants were divided into two groups group a and group b plants in group a were maintained at 70 75 fwc throughout the experiment plants in group b were dried naturally the root sourced signals and p n were monitored during drought monitoring the root sourced signals of plant the root sourced signals of plants were monitored at jointing and heading stages the occurrence of root sourced signals was determined by analyzing stomatal conductance gs and leaf relative water content lrwc of plants nhrs was adjudged to appear when plants in group b had significantly lower gs with similar lrwc compared with group a fig 1 hrs was adjudged to appear when gs and lrwc of plants in group b were both lower than those in group a when nhrs and hrs each occured swc of group b was measured by drying and weighing method monitoring p n gs and lrwc at the jointing and heading stages p n and gs of recently fully mature leaves were monitored using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa every two hours from 9 00 am to 16 00 pm daily after p n measurements the leaf was promptly cut down to deternine its lrwc each group included 9 replicated measures 3 leaves 3 micro plots 2 3 the field experiment the field experiment was performed from october 2011 to june 2013 based on swcs when nhrs and hrs appeared and p n decreased significantly in winter wheat at different growing stages fig 2 3 water control modes were designed ck full irrigation swc when nhrs occurs was used as the lower limit of irrigation w1 swcs when nhrs occurs and p n has significant decline were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation respectively after jointing stage and w2 swcs when p n has significant decline and nhrs terminates that is hrs occurs were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation respectively after jointing stage all plots were arranged under a transparent rainproof shelter each treatment consisted of three replicated plots and each plot was 2 m 3 3 m all treatments were maintained at 60 65 fwc during seedling stage after jointing stage soil moisture of each treatment was controlled according to the characteristics of root sourced signal and p n in the micro plot experiment fig 4 the upper and lower limits of soil water and planned wetting depth of each treatment in different growing stages are shown in table 1 the soil water content swc was measured at every10 cm in 0 20 cm soil layer by drying and weighing and at every 20 cm in 20 80 cm soil layer by the neutron scattering technique cpn 503 usa every 10 days during the growing period of winter wheat the average moisture content of soil in each plot was calculated after swc measurements irrigation was carried out when swc was below the lower limit of soil water table 1 irrigation amount was calculated according to the following formula 1 i γ θ u θ h 10 where i is irrigating water quota mm γ is volume mass g cm3 h is planned wetting depth cm θ u is the upper limit of soil water θ is swc of planned wetting depth before irrigation pn tr and root respiration the instantaneous p n and tr of recently fully mature leaves were measured using a portable photosynthesis system from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m on sunny days at jointing and anthesis stages respectively each plot included 3 replicated measures at anthesis stage root respiration was immediately measured after p n was measured plants were first cut off along the ground before measuring the root respiration after excision root respiration was measured using a portable environmental gas analyer pp systems boston usa each plot contains two measurements one centered over the row and the other from the mid point between the rows their mean value represented the total soil respiration the respiration of bare soil was estimated in 3 bare plots root respiration r root was calculated as 2 r root r total r bare where r total is the total soil respiration in each plot r bare is the bare soil respiration adm and dmr plants of 1 0 m2 in each plot were randomly sampled at flowering and maturity stages respectively plant samples were immediately dried at 75 to constant weight adm of plants was calculated according to the following formula 3 adm dmwm dmwa dmr of plants was calculated according to the following formula 4 dmr dmwa dmwm grain yield where dmwa is dry matter weight of plants at anthesis dmwm is dry matter weight of plants at maturity yield traits at maturity plants of 1 0 m2 was randomly sampled from each plot for measuring their yield traits including spike number kernels per spike thousand kernel weight and grain yield water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue wue and iwue was calculated according to the following formulas 5 wue y grain et 6 iwue y grain ir where y grain is the grain yield of wheat in each plot et is the total seasonal evapotranspiration and ir was the recorded irrigation volume in the field 2 4 statistical analysis the data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance in spss 13 0 comparisons among different irrigation modes were performed using least significant difference lsd tests at the 0 05levels 3 results 3 1 the threshold of root sourced signals and swcs when pn decreased significantly in the micro plot experiment the occurrence of root sourced signals was determined by analyzing gs and lrwc of plants at jointing stage compared group a plants in group b had similar gs and lrwc 1 4 d after stopping water but had significantly lower gs without a change in lrwc 6 d after stopping water fig 3 this showed that the nhrs of plants in group b appeared at this moment continuing drought aggravated leaf water deficit and further restricted leaf gs p n and lrwc of plants in group b decreased significantly 8 and10 days after stopping water respectively fig 3 a significantly decreased lrwc means the end of nhrs and the appearence of hrs of plant by measuring swc in group b it indicated that swcs when nhrs and hrs of plants appeared were 60 3 and 51 3 fwc respectively the swc when p n of plants in group b decreased significantly was 55 2 fwc fig 4 at anthesis the nhrs and hrs of plants in group b appeared 3 and 7d after stopping water respectively fig 3 the swcs when nhrs and hrs of plants appeared were 65 2 and

fig 4 3 2 plant population traits of winter wheat under different water control modes in the plot experiment plants were subjected to 3 water control modes table 1 based on the above characteristics of root sourced signal and p n fig 4 3 water control modes had different effects on plants population traits at jointing stage w1 and w2 had similar tiller number to ck but significantly lower plant height and leaf area compared with ck there was no significant difference in plant height and tiller number between w1 and w2 w2 had lower leaf area compared to w1 at anthesis plant height leaf area and tiller number significantly differed from each other among different water control modes both w1 and w2 significantly reduced plant height leaf area and tiller number of plant compared with ck table 2 3 3 p n t r and wueleaf of winter wheat under different water control modes different water control modes significantly affected leaf physiological properties of plants at jointing and flowering stages w1 and w2 both significantly lowered leaf t r of plant compared with ck w1 had similar leaf p n to ck and but w2 significantly lowered p n of plant fig 5 the leaf instantaneous water use efficiency wueleaf was estimated based on the p n t r both w1 and w2 had significantly higher wueleaf compared with ck at jointing and flowering stages 3 4 root respiration adm and dmr of wheat under different water control modes root respiration of plants significantly differed from each other among different water control modes at flowering stage w1 and w2 both had significantly lower root respiration rate compared with ck different water control modes also had significant effect on adm and dmr w1 significantly increased adm and dmr of wheat compared with ck w2 significantly lowered adm of wheat but had no effect on dmr fig 6 3 5 yield traits wue and iwue of wheat under different water control modes 3 water control modes had different effects on yield traits of winter wheat compared with ck w1 reduced spike number but had no effect on grain yield due to increased thousand kernel weight tkw w2 significantly lowered spike number kernels per spike and tkw thus reducing grian yield compared with ck w1 significantly raised harvest index of winter wheat but w2 reduced it compared with ck table 3 in two test years w1 significantly reduced irrigation water and improved wue and iwue of wheat compared with w2 and ck table 4 w2 failed to increase wue of plant due to a reduced grain yield compared to ck 4 discussion 4 1 root sourced signal theory and irrigation schedule optimization optimizing irrigation regime can improve the benefit of irrigation water and save water resource thus increase the yield and wue of crop farre and faci 2009 root can regulate leaf tr and water loss of plant through the transmission of root sourced signals which is used to guide agricultural water saving irrigation li and zhao 1997 some water saving irrigation techniques such as partial root zone drought dry and loveys 1998 and alternate partial root zone irrigation kang and zhang 2004 both reduced water consumption by lowering tr through the regulation of root sourced signal on the shoot and thus improved wue of crops our previous study also showed that appropriate water deficit during jointing stage can trigger nhrs of plants at higher swc level by improving the nhrs sensitivity in the late growing stages and thus reduce water loss through tr and increase wue of winter wheat ma et al 2015 in addition irrigation schedules are often optimized according to the sensitivity of plants to water deficit at different growing stages kirda 2002 crop is relatively insensitive to water deficit during early vegetative growth stages because plant s demand to water is relatively low at this point and the plants are better adapted to severe water deficit than during reproductive stage cakir 2004 the results of our study also showed swcs when nhrs and hrs appeared and pn decreased significantly at flowering stage were higher than at jointing stage this high sensitivity to water deficit means that it is risky to implement water saving irrigation strategies during reproductive stage without incurring loss of yield the limited irrigation imposed on crop during reproductive stage resulted in more yield reduction than during vegetative stage mansouri far et al 2010 however igbadun et al 2007 reported that good yields can be obtained with suitable irrigation at the flowering growth stage even if irrigation is limited during the vegetative stages it is obvious that only scientifically controlling irrigation volume can save irrigation water without causing significant reduction in yield in the present study the irrigation water of winter wheat was controlled based on the characteristics of root sourced signal and p n of plant the results showed w1 saved irrigation water but had no effect on grain yield thus increasing wue of wheat therefore optimizing the irrigation schedules based on the regulation of root sourced signals on plant has wide application prospects in water saving irrigation of crops 4 2 plant population traits and wue of crop under different water control modes soil water condition affects the growth development and metabolism of root system by which also affects the growth and physiology of the shoots xue et al 2006 jensen et al 2010 sampathkumar et al 2012 previous studies showed that nhrs produced by the root in drying soil can regulate the growth of the shoot mainly leaf expansion thus reducing the water loss through the leaf xiong et al 2006 2007 in the present study plants in w1 were maintained swc within the threshold range of nhrs table 1 and fig 4 influenced by the nhrs w1 reduced not only leaf area and plant height but also tiller number of plant which is good for reducing water consumption through the canopy the leaf t r and p n of plants are regulated by stomata opening but the decreased stomata opening has less effect on p n than on t r of plants plaut 1995 wueleaf depends on the ratio of p n and t r and so partial stomatal closure is beneficial to improving wueleaf and realizing physiological water saving of plant previous study showed that the drought signals nhrs produced by the root can optimize the relationship between p n and t r by regulating stomata opening thus improving the wue of the plant lyer and caplan 1998 xiong et al 2006 this study also showed influenced by the nhrs w1 significantly reduced t r and had no effect on p n of plants thus increasing wueleaf and wue compared to ck jensen et al 2010 suggested that deficit irrigation based on root signaling improved iwue of potatoes and tomatoes without causing significant reduction of yield in this study w1 significantly reduced irrigation water but had no effect on grain yield thus increasing wue and iwue of plant the regulation of root sourced signal on the shoots of plant has been confirmed by more and more studies ahmadi et al 2009 2010 croker et al 1998 rodrigues et al 2008 zweifel et al 2007 therefore controlling suitable soil moisture w1 based on characteristics of nhrs and p n can optimize the relationship between pn and t r and improve wue of crops by the regulation of nhrs in plants 4 3 the grain yield root respiration adm and dmr under different water control modes the root system is the main absorption organ of soil water and nutrients maintaining the physiological and metabolic functions of the root system consumes a large amount of photosynthate through root respiration mccree 1986 previous studies have showed that the root system of wheat consumes more than 50 of the photosynthate through root respiration lambers et al 1996 therefore maintaining stable leaf photosynthesis and less carbon consumption through root respiration will help increase the grain yield of crop liu and li 2005 soil moisture had significant effect on leaf p n ma et al 2015 and root respiration of plant paudel et al 2018 in addition proper soil moisture helps to increase yield of crop by optimizing allocation of photosynthate between root and shoot mingo et al 2004 therefore it is reasonable to increase grain yield of wheat by reducing root respiration and optimizing photosynthate allocation between root and shoot through controlling soil water the present study showed that w1 had no effect on leaf p n but lowered the photosynthate consumption through root respiration which resulted in increased adm of shoot grain growth depends not only on current photosynthesis and adm but also on dmr to grains after flowering foulkes et al 2002 richards et al 2002 soil moisture has vital influence on the dmr in the filling stage of wheat foulkes et al 2002 proper water stress helps to increase the dmr yang et al 2000 the previous studies showed that proper water deficit between jointing and anthesis stages increased both p n and dmr thus increasing grain yield of wheat xue et al 2006 ma et al 2015 in the present study w1 reduced spike number and increased thousand kernel weight tkw due to higher adm and dmr and so had no effect on grain yield compared to ck the declining photosynthesis during grain filling often leads to a significant decrease in wheat yield kobata et al 1992 this study also shows that w2 significantly reduced grian yield due to reduced p n and adm 5 conclusion this study showed that swcs when root sourced signal occured and p n decreased significantly are different in different growing stages of plant at jointing stage swcs when nhrs and hrs occured were 60 3 and 51 3 fwc respectively and swc when leaf p n decreased significantly was 55 2 fwc at heading stage these swcs were 65 2 56 3 and 61 3 fwc respectively based on the above characteristics of root sourced signals and p n in different growing stages of plant controlling suitable soil moisture w1 can optimize the relationship between p n and t r through the regulation of nhrs in plants and thus improve wueleaf of crops in addition w1 also reduced irrigation water and increased wue and iwue of wheat by regulating the consumption and distribution of water and photosynthate although w2 significantly reduced irrigation water it reduced grain yield due to a declined p n and thus failed to increase wue of plant compared to ck acknowledgements this research was supported by the fund of

11018,groundwater is one of the most important and vital resources in the world in current decades increased water demand and pollution threaten groundwater availability yet groundwater governance is a serious challenge and despite many studies focusing on groundwater assessments its governance has been largely neglected smart groundwater governance is one of the most critical areas to improve the sustainable use of this resource in societies and people s livelihood the main goal of this paper was to introduce a model to evaluate and measure the smartness level of any policy or action as an index to do so this study uses a system dynamics sd approach to develop a smart groundwater governance sgg model to assist policy and decision makers to better understand the short and long term impacts of their actions plans and policies for this purpose the sgg index was introduced in the dynamic model including four indicators i e equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy and was applied in iran the results indicate that groundwater balance is critical i e negative and the current trend of groundwater governance is highly non smart in the country this study concluded that the best strategy to manage this situation and to govern the groundwater resources in a smarter manner includes both increasing the infiltration rate and decreasing the extraction rate or increase the water efficiency as the left and right based scenarios the obtained results also demonstrate the benefits of the sgg index for policy and decision makers in sgg keywords groundwater crisis water management smart governance water shortage iran water crisis 1 introduction water plays a critical role in sustainable development batchelor 2007 and its scarcity is among the major global challenges today jacobson et al 2013 groundwater is one of the world s most important water resources accounts for over 98 of all liquid freshwater dunnivant and anders 2006 fao 2018 about one third of humanity depends totally on groundwater for their daily needs also 99 of the planet earth s accessible freshwater is found in aquifers fao 2015 according to the project of the groundwater governance of fao 2018 groundwater extraction over the past 50 years 1960 2010 has increased by more than 300 recently communities agriculture and industry around the nation and the world have increased their use of groundwater megdal et al 2015 in the future the use of groundwater will continue to increase at higher rate than before as there is a critical need to supply water for agriculture sector urban areas industry and ecosystems groundwater provides drinking water to at least 50 of the world s population and 43 of all of the water is used for irrigation fao 2018 therefore groundwater is an essential natural resource to sustain life it is also substantial to agriculture and food security over the past 50 years groundwater irrigation has grown rapidly it supplies over one third of the world s irrigated area shah 2014 increased water demand and pollution threaten groundwater availability in order to share groundwater resources equitably among nations regions consumers per sector and generations and to maintain the groundwater availability and quality informed decisions need to be made about allocation and protection of groundwater resources igrac 2017 groundwater is a critical component of the water supply for agriculture urban areas industry and ecosystems but its managing is a challenge because it is difﬁcult to map quantify and evaluate groundwater until recently study and assessment of governance of this water resource has been largely neglected megdal et al 2015 globally more than 150 million people live below the altitude of 1 m a s l and 250 million live below the altitude of 5 m a s l igrac 2017 some countries e g africa are in an initial stage in terms of protection areas of groundwater sources or they have not yet started these practices because more stringent problems such as the scarcity of water resources have taken the priority doveri et al 2015 the crisis of groundwater in iran is multifold especially because a it is the most important water resource for most regions of iran hojjati and boustani 2010 which means iran is more dependent on groundwater b the average annual precipitation in iran has been 228 mm year 1994 2014 which means 6 less than the long term average 242 mm year moridi 2017 which means water resources will be more limited c iran s population according to world population review will reach 95 million over the next two decades the current population of iran is more than 80 million and it means there will be more pressure on groundwater resources d intensification of climate change and periodic droughts can worsen the quantity and quality condition of water resources for example in the last 50 years iran has faced ten severe and prolonged droughts which have significantly threatened water availability in all sectors sadeghi 2017 it is expected that climate change will further increase the risk of droughts in some parts of the country and cause floods in others e the recent acceleration of inland use and land cover changes such as deforestation destruction of rangelands and conversion of agricultural lands asadi et al 2014 azadi and barati 2013 azadi et al 2016 barati et al 2015 will increase natural disasters and climatic changes e g flood drought and frostbite which will damage i e drying up the water resources more than before f finally mismanagement nabavi 2017 and the lack of a good water management or governance hojjati and boustani 2010 moridi 2017 are at the top of all causes for instance low water efficiency in the agricultural sector the biggest water consumer sector dropping of the groundwater level and land subsidence 1 1 groundwater levels are dropping at an average of 2 4 meters per year since the slow flling aquifers have not been able to keep up with the growing number of water users and subscribers this drop has caused unprecedented land subsidence of an average of 2 30cm in di erent plains across the country and sinkhole formation all of these factors are contributing to massive desertifcation sadeghi 2017 are two main impacts of impractical water management and governance in iran sadeghi 2017 therefore it seems that the issue of water governance in iran is a complex dynamic system therefore its study needs suitable methodologies and techniques groundwater governance could be defined as a procedure which determines who gets when and how much of the water undp water governance facility at siwi 2015 it is the overarching framework of groundwater use laws regulations and customs as well as the processes of engaging the public sector the private sector and civil society shah 2014 since it relates not only to the state or government but also to civil society and the private sector its development takes place within different constellations of these three entities in this sense improved governance is path dependent and needs to be linked to particular development goals in society such as water services and sanitation for all equitable reallocation of water between users or any other goals such as food and energy for all or conservation and restoration of ecosystems undp et al 2017 now despite the seriousness of the water crisis in most parts of the world and especially in arid and semiarid areas such as iran madani 2014 nabavi 2017 middle east and north africa fao 2012 lezzaik et al 2018 mekki et al 2017 the question is why the previous and current actions plans policies and strategies have not been successful today increasing water scarcity is still one of the major global challenges as local demand for water rises above available supply in many regions the governance of available water resources becomes the key issue to achieve water security at the local regional and global level around the world communities agriculture and industry are increasing their use of groundwater sometimes with adverse impacts on riparian habitats and often with disregard for sustainability megdal et al 2015 poor and bad resource management corruption lack of appropriate institutions bureaucratic inertia insufficient capacity and a shortage of new investments undermine the effective governance of water in many places around the world jacobson et al 2013 after 113 years of the persian constitution in 1906 the country is experiencing a serious water crisis nabavi 2017 in the case of iran the over use and abuse of increasingly precious water resources has been dramatically intensified over the recent decades it is reaching a point where water shortages water quality degradation and aquatic ecosystem destruction are seriously affecting the prospects for socio economic development political stability ecosystem integrity batchelor 2007 the health and the welfare of natural systems and human communities moridi 2017 blame is often attributed to the government s management nabavi 2017 or misgovernance of water resources including both surface and groundwater then apparently there is a need to be a new and different kind of view about groundwater governance this view should be holistic dynamic and systematic to achieve smart groundwater governance this paper aims to address this issue to deal with this at first this paper will model the system dynamics sd of groundwater in iran then it will define smart groundwater governance and finally it will analyze the operation of the smart groundwater governance sd there are some previous studies that tried to analyze water systems in different ways for example madani 2010 illustrated the utility of game theory in water systems analysis and conflict resolution and loáiciga 2004 studied the roles of cooperation and non cooperation in the sustainable exploitation of a jointly used groundwater resource using an analytical game theoretic formulation bhattacharjee et al 2018 evaluated the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions and discussed the key challenges of effective groundwater management also huo et al 2016 used a simulation method to develop an operational water governance model for predicting the future water cycle although these studies tried to analyze and explain the governance of water and groundwater systems they could not develop a smart system to explain the dynamics of groundwater resources over time and under different scenarios in addition they could not tell us whether the governance system is smart or how much it is equitable efficient sustainable and democratic accordingly this study tries to introduce new smart and dynamic models to meet groundwater management deficiencies therefore the main aim of this study is to introduce a model to forecast not only the future trend of groundwater balance but also to evaluate and measure the smartness level of any policies or actions as an index it also aims at assisting policy and decision makers to realize the impacts of their decisions to better understand the short and long term impacts of their actions plans and policies and to ask themselves whether their decisions on groundwater are smart 2 methodology 2 1 study area the site of this study was iran that is located in the world s dry belt according to the last formal census of iran 2016 the total population of the country is 79 926 270 persons iran is one of the largest countries in southwestern asia with an area of 1 648 000 square kilometers the average of iran s annual precipitation is about 240 mm that is about a third of the global average the rainy period in most of the country is from november to may in the dry period between may and october rain is rare in most of the country about 90 of total precipitation occurs in cold and humid seasons in northern and western parts of the country and only 10 occurs in warm and dry seasons in central southern and eastern parts moreover about 52 of precipitation occurs in 25 of the area of the country sadeghi 2017 therefore the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation in iran is volatile and uneven across the country fig 1 while in many localities of iran there is no rainfall torrential rains cause floods and local damages in other locations hence some parts of iran are suffering lack of water resources and iran is experiencing a serious water crisis 2 2 system dynamic modeling sd is an approach to policy analysis and design it applies to dynamic problems arising in different complex systems which are characterized by interdependence mutual interaction information feedback and circular causality thus this approach is one of the most appropriate ways to examine the groundwater governance complexity especially in iran therefore the current study applied for the first time the sd modeling approach to deal with the problem of water crisis and its smart governance in iran recently several studies li et al 2018 xiao qing et al 2012 yang et al 2019 zomorodian et al 2018 used or emphasized this approach to solve the water crisis problem sd is an approach to understand and model the behavior of complex systems over time to model the groundwater cycle this paper applied both primary collected by interviewing experts to develop the sgg model and secondary the databases such as aquastat and statistical center of iran to model the dynamic system of groundwater in iran data according to the sd approach the following steps have been proceeded to design the smart governance index sterman 2000 2 2 1 problem articulation boundary selection it is a situation in which the problem the key variables the time horizon and the dynamic problem should be defined and considered in this study the key variables of the system were identified using two main sources a interviews with filed experts and b literature review 2 2 2 formulation of dynamic hypothesis it includes a process that will be ended in the maps of causal structure based on initial hypotheses reference modes and other available data and tools the base of causal structure in the groundwater system is the hydrological cycle which is relevant for smart groundwater governance jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 some data to formulate the model are adapted from aquastat 2018 a iranian government database 2 2 3 formulation of a simulation model it includes the specification of structure decision rules estimation of parameters behavioral relationships initial conditions and tests for consistency with the purpose and boundary the structure decision rules parameters behavioral relationships and initial conditions were estimated using a basic models and b analyzing the available time series datasets such as aquastat 2018 statistical center of iran sci ministry of agriculture jihad maj etc 2 2 4 testing the model after formulating the model it is necessary to test it this phase includes some specific tests such as comparison to reference modes robustness under extreme conditions and sensitivity analysis this study uses the calibration and sensitivity procedure of the vensim software to test the model during this process the observed data were compared with the model data for a period of time according to the time series data then the simulation is repeated many times in which parameters of the model have changed for each simulation at the end the software will propose the details of the best parameters for the tested variables 2 2 5 policy design and evaluation during this phase the capability of the model to develop scenarios and to design policies is evaluated based on new decision rules strategies and structures on the ground decision making is the main object of modeling any phenomena or systems to solve the modeling problem s therefore this phase is critical for managers and policy makers the scenarios in this study were developed based on the main key variables of the model that have the greatest impacts on the groundwater balance these impacts were determined by analyzing the sensitivity of the model to their changes the number of these variables per each scenario was selected using experts opinions and monitoring the model behaviors under each condition the software that used for sd modelling and simulation was ventana vensim dds for windows version 6 4e we used the case of iran for testing policy design and evaluation 2 3 elaboration of the specific smart groundwater governance model for iran 2 3 1 the system dynamics of groundwater for smart governance of groundwater this paper investigates a sd approach to expose the key variables and the dynamics of groundwater fig 2 depicts part of a causal structure of a groundwater sd this system includes two main parts the left part indicates the inflow of groundwater using the hydrologic cycle and the right part includes the main outflows of groundwater resources and their main important variables and factors the hydrologic cycle begins with the evaporation 90 and evapotranspiration 10 from the surface of water plants and lands the moist air and water vapor condense to form clouds and return to the surface as precipitation once the water reaches the ground one of the two processes may occur 1 evaporates and transpires back into the atmosphere or 2 penetrates into the surface and becomes groundwater infiltration penuel et al 2013 the amount of water that plants transpire varies geographically over time there are a number of factors that determine transpiration rates including temperature relative humidity wind and air movement soil moisture availability and type of plant usgs and perlman 2016 infiltration is known as the process of water entering the soil surface when rain or irrigation water is supplied to a field it seeps into the soil called infiltration the infiltration rate is the velocity at which water can seep into the soil it is commonly measured by the depth in mm of the water layer that the soil can absorb in an hour the infiltration rate of a soil depends on the factors that are constant such as the soil texture and it also depends on factors that vary such as the soil moisture content and the soil structure infiltration rate is higher for coarse textured soils than for fine textured soils the water infiltrates faster higher infiltration rate when the soil is dry than when it is wet generally water infiltrates quickly high infiltration rate into granular soils but very slowly low infiltration rate into massive and compact soils brouwer et al 1985 johnson 1963 the head of the applied water the depth to ground water the length of time of application of water and biological activity are some of the other influencing variables johnson 1963 groundwater either seeps its way into the oceans rivers and streams or is released back into the atmosphere through transpiration large amounts of water are stored in the ground the water is still moving possibly very slowly and it is a part of the water cycle most of the water in the ground comes from precipitation that infiltrates downward from the land surface as a part of the water cycle groundwater is a major contributor to flow in many streams and rivers and it has a strong influence on river and wetland habitats for plants and animals people have been using groundwater for thousands of years and continue to use it today largely for irrigation and drinking life on earth depends on groundwater just as surface water usgs and perlman 2016 wells springs and qanats especially in iran are three main ways to evacuate groundwater ahmadi et al 2010 hamidian et al 2015 the balance of water that remains on the earth s surface is runoff which is emptied into lakes rivers and streams and is carried back to the oceans where the cycle begins again based on this causal model we can map the main groundwater processes based on the concepts of stocks and flows which are a central idea in sd see fig 3 2 3 2 governance of groundwater governance is the activity of coordinating communications in order to achieve collective goals through collaboration willke 2007 the need for governance not only arises as the population grows but also with shortage of resources in addition with simultaneous increase in resources shortage such as water resource the need for governance will increase and will be more complex governance is also obvious when there is an explicit goal to be implemented resulting from a project a plan or a strategy willke 2007 therefore water governance is to determine who obtains when and how much water undp water governance facility at siwi 2015 water governance also refers to the political social economic and administrative systems that influence water use and resource management rogers and hall 2003 water governance determines the equity and efficiency in water resource and services allocation and distribution it balances water use between socio economic activities and ecosystems it determines who gets water when and how and who has the right to water and related services and their benefits how the decisions are made and the roles of power and politics are important issues in governance undp et al 2017 given the limitation of water resources the competition for this resource has rapidly increased and there is a general agreement that improvements to water governance and collaboration among key stakeholders are a necessary part of the solution batchelor 2007 on the whole to analyze the dynamics of water resources and their governance at least four fundamental dimensions including social economic political and environmental should be considered jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 in terms of social dimension its distribution should be equitable among various socio economic groups in both time from now to the future and space from local to non local in economic terms the allocation of water should be efficient which means it should be done in a way to have a suitable role in the overall economic growth and poverty reduction politically water stakeholders should have the equal rights opportunities and facilities to play a bigger role in decision making processes it could greatly improve the short and the long outcomes and solve and decrease current and future conflicts finally water governance should lead to sustainable use of water and related ecosystem services water resources need to be sufficiently safeguarded against the current agricultural urban and industrial unsustainable uses 2 3 3 smart groundwater governance sgg smart groundwater governance especially in the present era and for the modern world is necessary due to the vital role of water for humanity also water changes and shortages are of the main crises of the current world all too often well intentioned efforts to solve pressing problems lead to policy resistance where our policies are delayed diluted or defeated by the unforeseen reactions of other people or of nature then we need to have a new kind of smart governance which is an innovation of traditional concepts of municipality from administrative approaches to different manager visions smart governance is using technology to facilitate and support better planning and decision making it is about improving democratic processes and transforming ways of delivering public services ioppolo 2013 also smart governance is about the future and it should be transparent accountable responsive and efficient in this study smart groundwater governance sgg is defined as a sd including a range of political social economic and administrative components these components are responsible for developing and managing groundwater resources their inflows and outflows in an equitable efficient democratic and sustainable way in this regard sgg at least needs to indicate who uses water who decides about using water how much water could be used how to use water using in a way that does not deal with the shortage and when to use water fig 4 sgg aims to balance groundwater use between socio economic activities and ecosystems through developing a smart and open model also sgg would involve governmental institutions as well as stakeholder participation and collaboration at all levels and in all branches of the governing process smart groundwater governance needs to follow a sd approach because it contains several elements with a complex network of relationships the networks affect smart groundwater governance performance and the bad governance would lead to many socio economic political and environmental outputs immediate results outcomes mid term results and impacts long term results which will appear now and in the future furthermore ssg needs the systems dynamics sd approach because there is an increasing competition between the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors especially in arid and semiarid agro systems mekki et al 2017 that will increase its complexity over time moreover testing and assessing different ways and methods are time and resources consuming groundwater plays a pivotal role in sustaining human activities especially in arid environments with scarce surface water resources giordano 2009 also the bad governance of groundwater has countless challenges and crises for many countries including iran madani 2014 nabavi 2017 according to a global risk report water crises have been identified as one of the four major risks most likely to impose devastating threats globally lezzaik et al 2018 the sd approach could improve our understanding of how the governance performance is the result of its internal and external structure including stakeholders competitors and suppliers the approach could also help us use our understanding to design high leverage successful groundwater governance policies finally it is a fundamental interdisciplinary method to solve important real world problems sterman 2000 ssg s conceptual model could be changed to a stock and flow model as represented in figs 5 and 6 in this model we defined cumulative sgg index as a stock and sgg index as a flow variable the sgg index as a flow variable measures the average value of the sgg index for each main stockholder of groundwater resources agriculture municipal industry and ecosystem over an interval of time the cumulative sgg index as a stock variable measures the aggregate value of total sgg indicators at one specific time since a flow variable is measured over an interval of time the sgg index would be measured per unit of time such as a year or a month a flow is roughly similar to rate or speed in this sense the sgg index is defined as a function of four variables that indicate the value of equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy indicators of each stockholder eq 1 1 s g g i n d e x i e q u i t a b l e e f f i c i e n t d e m o c r a t i c s u s t a i n a b l e 4 stocks are accumulations that characterize the state of the system and generate the information upon which decisions and actions are based sterman 2000 they are measured at one specific time and represent quantities existing at that point in time the cumulative sgg index aggregates or integrates their inflow or overall sgg index eq 2 2 c u m u l a t i v e s g g i n d e x t 0 t o v e r a l l s g g i n d e x s g g i n d e x t 0 eq 2 adapted from sterman 2000 determines the cumulative sgg index which represents the value of the overall sgg index as a flow at any time between the initial time to and the current time t the overall sgg index is the weighted mean of sgg indicators it could be calculated by eq 3 where aws eq 3 is the share of stakeholder i of total accessible water it could be a number between 0 and 1 3 o v e r a l l s g g i n d e x s g g i n d e x i a w s i we measure equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy indicators by the following equations 4 e q u i p o p u l a t i o n i e e d g s i where equi is the equitability index of subsector or main stockholders i populationi is a proportion of the population of stockholders i who have access to extracted water and eedgsi is the share of subsector i of the total extracted groundwater of the country 5 e f f i g d p i e e d g s i where effi is efficiency index of subsector i gdpi is the share of subsector i in total gdp and eedgsi is the share of the extracted groundwater of subsector i 6 d e m i r g c i e e d g s where demi is the democracy index of subsector i in every country rgci represents part of the regulations government agencies and cooperatives etc that belong to a specific subsector such as agriculture or industry subsector i eedgsi is the share of subsector i from the total extracted groundwater 7 s u s i e e d g i t e e d g t e a b l e g t e e d g t e a b l e g 1 where susi is sustainability index of subsector i eedgi is the extracted groundwater of subsector i teedg is the total extracted groundwater of the country and teableg is the total extractable groundwater of the country it is equal to the total infiltration of water entering the soil surface fig 7 depicts a general shape of the stock and flow model for sgg index the value of each indicator will be between 0 and 1 where 0 means the subsector is completely non equitable or efficient sustainable or democratic in contrary the value of 1 means it is quite equitable or efficient sustainable or democratic as a result the value of sgg index will also have a range between zero and one based on figs 4 7 the sd of sgg could be exposed as fig 8 in which cumulative sgg index is accumulated over time by the overall sgg index which is a rate of four flow variables including sgg index muni sgg index indu sgg index eco and sgg index agri 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic system of groundwater in iran to introduce a model for smart groundwater governance in iran at first it needs to realize the dynamics of iran groundwater according to aquastat 2018 the annual average precipitation of iran over the past twenty years has been 397 9 km³ year or 228 mm year which is about 6 less than the long term average 242 mm year in addition the average surface run off during this period has been 52 km³ year moridi 2017 it is about 44 less than the long term average 97 3 km³ year aquastat 2018 the volume of groundwater that was produced internally is about 49 3 km³ year and there is an overlap of about 18 1 km³ year between surface water and groundwater total external renewable water resources of iran are about 8 5 km³ year based on these data total surface water total groundwater and total renewable water resources of iran are respectively about 105 8 49 3 and 137 km³ year see table 1 although the total renewable water of iran is about 137 km³ year but only about 30 of this amount is accessible postel et al 1996 it means the total accessible renewable water of iran is 41 1 km³ year total renewable water is equal to surface water plus groundwater minus the overlap between surface water and groundwater kohli and frenken 2015 table 1 and the data mentioned above were used to model the dynamics of groundwater in iran over the next years fig 9 the left hand of this model shows the resources of groundwater inflows the trend of precipitation by 2050 was forecasted based on time series data 1964 2017 fig 10 the right hand of the model is about the extraction of water from resources of groundwater outflows based on the observed and literature reviewed data three main outflows including agriculture municipality and industry were considered in the model it is also assumed that only 30 of renewable water is accessible which implies that extraction higher than this amount will damage the ecosystem the agricultural water demand is dependent on agricultural land area and water efficiency in the agriculture sector the agricultural land area decreased during recent years and its changes over time have been mainly related to population growth azadi and barati 2013 azadi et al 2015 2016 barati et al 2015 the trends of the agricultural land area and population of iran were forecasted based on maj and csi computational science and informatics time series databases this model has also included water efficiency in different sectors agricultural water efficiency in iran is generally low frenken 2009 according to alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 it is about 35 and based on frenken 2009 it is about 33 also about 62 64 of water used in agriculture is withdrawn from groundwater these shares for the industrial and municipal sectors from groundwater are about 50 and 25 then the total withdrawal of water from these sectors agriculture industry and municipal have been 86 1 1 and 6 2 km3 year respectively frenken 2009 table 2 shows some other information real or observed data about the variables that is used in the groundwater dynamic model based on this model the model data the volume of precipitation population and irrigated land area according to the current situations and changes will reach 344 7 km3 112 500 thousand person and 2 470 000 ha by 2050 respectively for the base model the efficiency of water is supposed to be fixed as well 3 2 model calibration and testing results after formulating the model it is necessary to validate the model this phase includes some specific tests such as comparison to reference modes robustness under extreme conditions and sensitivity to do so at first the modeler needs to evaluate the model calibration and then the validity of the calibration this study used the vensim software calibration and sensitivity procedure followed by the sd approach since it is an initial effort to measure the smartness level of the groundwater governance accordingly the first step is to evaluate the model calibration the term evaluation refers to the estimated parameters of the system models wallach et al 2018 if the parameters are estimated within reasonable ranges the modeling results are comparable with observed data oliva 2003 in addition the only real time series data in this study were precipitation population and agricultural land areas to which the calibration and validation are limited fig 10 shows the results of the calibrated model compared to the observed or actual data showing good consistency in addition table 2 indicates the average of the long term observed and resulting data of the groundwater dynamic model these data are close to each other as well similarly the calibration of variables relevant to the state variable s groundwater outflow side extraction was evaluated the parameters of the model were estimated by fitting data method wallach et al 2018 if the parameters are estimated within reasonable ranges the modeling results are comparable with observed data oliva 2003 moreover the only real time series data in this study were precipitation population and agricultural land areas to which the calibration and the validation are limited fig 10 indicates the results of the calibrated model in comparison to the observed or real data which demonstrates a good consistence in addition table 1 indicates the average long term data reported by aquastat and the same data resulted of the model these data are close to each other as well in the same way the calibration of the influencing variables relevant to the outflow side extraction of the state variable groundwater was evaluated the parameters of the model were estimated by the method of fitting the full system model to the data in addition to calibration veriﬁcation and validation were used as a critical part of the model testing process generally the sd model testing has two types behavioral and structural elsawah et al 2017 sterman 2000 this study uses sensitivity analysis as a valuable approach to behavioral and structural testing it assesses the effects of variations in parameter values boundary conditions and other model inputs on model output elsawah et al 2017 vensim has the capability of sensitivity analysis in which model parameters change for each simulation in an arbitrary or default variation range for each simulation 50 75 95 and 100 the assumptions about the value of constants in the model were changed during the sensitivity testing process and then the resulting outputs were examined this can be very helpful to understand the behavioral boundaries of a model and testing the robustness of model based policies fig 11 indicates the results of the sensitivity analysis for four main variables of the study based on four different ranges of variations 50 75 95 and 100 these variables were selected based on both experts opinion and the sensitivity of the model to their changes in regard to these results the outputs of the model have been allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs demonstrating the confidence of the model 3 3 the trends of variables 3 3 1 scenarios and simulation results when the dynamic model was formulated and the model validation verification and functions were checked it can run fig 12 depicts the changes of infiltration extraction and its impacts on the balance of groundwater resources this base model indicates the balance between infiltration and extraction for groundwater it was implemented under the conditions that the water efficiency and the rate of transmission loss will not change until 2050 under the assumption that the accessible water is less than 30 of renewable water postel et al 1996 it shows that there is a surplus extraction from groundwater fig 12 the current balance between accessible water and extraction is about 21 2 km3 year by 2042 the accumulated value of this over withdrawal will reach about 183 4 km3 and then the balance between accessible water and extraction will be established because of low water efficiency this model also indicates that about 32 km3 year water would be wasted annually from 2018 to 2050 if the current conditions continue as before and the current government policies do not change it will take more than 22 years until the extraction rate from groundwater reaches to less than its infiltration rate as in the past population and agriculture will be the two main influence factors that affect groundwater as fig 13 indicates the growing population increases the pressure on groundwater resources and due to the decrease in the agricultural irrigated land area this pressure will begin to decrease and will gradually be intensified according to the dynamic groundwater model groundwater governance has at least two sides extraction and infiltration it means that not only the rapid increase of water withdrawal is a main cause of the ground water crisis but also it is the result of low water infiltration a decreasing infiltration is not only the result of a decline in precipitation but is also the result of a lower infiltration rate where land cover changes and soil erosion are the main reasons of lower infiltration rate see fig 2 therefore any government who wants to manage groundwater resources should consider both sides for example if over 10 years a the current infiltration rate of internal renewable water 0 384 using land cover and watershed projects reaches 0 4 as a left side base scenario or b agriculture water efficiency increases from 0 4 to 0 5 as a right side base scenario see fig 14 then the groundwater balance will change see fig 14 as fig 15 shows the return time of the groundwater balance equality of inflow and outflow under the left scenario is about 25 years but under the right scenario this return time will be about 16 years it means the right hand policies and programs extraction scenarios will have a faster effect than the left hand scenarios infiltration scenarios the government can also apply an integrated scenario including both infiltration and extraction modifications which increase the infiltration rate of internal renewable water from 0 384 to 0 395 and the water efficiency of agriculture from 0 4 to 0 45 during the next 10 years therefore returning the balance to groundwater equality of inflow and outflow will take about 14 years fig 15 such dynamic model could help decision makers to test many scenarios and to apply smarter policies and programs it also helps them to see the impacts of their programs and policies it can also help them to see the impacts of their programs and policies for example incentive and punitive policies that prevent the agricultural land conversion other examples of policies include soil erosion through increasing the vegetative cover of the land increasing soil organic matter and preventing unnecessary use of chemical fertilizers that damage the soil structure can increase the infiltration rate of surface water to groundwater using a dynamic model can help policymakers realize the impacts of such policies and make the best decisions since governments usually deal with their problems in the real world with a combination of different programs and policies in this study three different scenarios a pessimistic b probable and c optimistic were designed the scenarios were based on four variables including agricultural water efficiency agricultural transmission loss rate municipal water efficiency and infiltration rate of irw table 3 in order to have logical and possible choices for each variable the selections of variables is made based on the field observations and opinions of scientific experts in agriculture irrigation soil and rangeland sciences moreover the change in these variables is more likely for the government than other variables to achieve the goals a 30 year period was considered changes in the other variables such as precipitation population and gdp share are similar for all the scenarios table 4 fig 16 displays the groundwater balance changes under pessimistic a probable b and optimistic c scenarios in fact the pessimistic scenario is the base model under this scenario the current condition will continue to exist in the future as said above under this scenario coming back to balance in groundwater will take about 24 years by 2042 but under scenario b and c reaching to the balance between infiltration and extraction will take respectively about 18 by 2036 and 14 by 2032 years for example under the probable scenario it is assumed that during a 30 year program the amounts of agricultural water efficiency agricultural transmission loss rate municipal water efficiency and infiltration rate of irw reaches 45 5 40 and 40 respectively see table 3 3 3 2 integrated system for smart groundwater governance in iran in this section at first a smart dynamic model for groundwater governance has been introduced and then the changes of the sgg index under three main scenarios a b and c have been discussed fig 17 shows a simplified smart dynamic model for groundwater governance in iran this model is linked to the iran groundwater dynamic model fig 9 it means that some inputs for this model are derived from the groundwater dynamic model the changes in the overall sgg index and its components by 2050 based on the sgg and groundwater models are shown in fig 18 it seems that above scenarios not only will change the groundwater resource conditions but also will affect the sgg index on the other hand implementation of these scenarios especially b and c notably by increasing agriculture and ecosystem sgg indices will affect and improve the overall sgg index a little however using scenarios b and specially c at first will make this rising faster and then it will be stopped what is the main cause of this behavior it seems that smart groundwater governance like other smart systems is a complex phenomenon that requires more systematic attention if the government wants to be smarter in this context there should be more systematic plans moreover this study assumed that the duration of each policy is 30 years if the policy implementation continues after 30 years the sgg index will certainly continue to increase these plans and policy also should consider the equitability efficiency sustainability and democratic aspects of smart groundwater governance for example in the agriculture sector it is very important not only to increase the water efficiency but also to make some efforts to increase the value added in the agricultural sector in order to increase its gdp share in addition the government needs to increase the share of agriculture in rules regulations and organizations for instance if the government under a different scenario while other conditions are similar to scenario c tries to increase the gdp share agri variable up to 15 and the rgc agri variable up to 40 i e during 30 years scenario c2 then the sgg index agri will reach 0 491 from 0 231 over this period it will also increase the overall sgg index from 0 076 to 0 132 fig 19 the model presented in this paper is capable not only to demonstrate the impacts of various actions plans and scenarios on the changes of groundwater resources but also to measure an index to determine the smart level of groundwater governance there are many earlier and currently presented models and studies such as madani 2010 jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 mechlem 2016 and bhattacharjee et al 2018 that have looked at the groundwater governance from a specific angle although all these studies have been useful and could improve our awareness about the issue and crisis of water scarcity we think they could not simulate the complexity of this issue as a dynamic system and its changes over a long time the presented model can help governments have a smart and systematic view about groundwater governance and it is the main contribution of this study 4 conclusion population growth rapid urbanization industrialization economic development food security and climate change are putting unprecedented pressure on groundwater consumption mechlem 2016 in addition the lack of precipitation as the main result of climate change has forced many nations to use groundwater resources more than in the past while groundwater use has some short term socioeconomic and political benefits it has many long term environmental socioeconomic and political costs and influences america and region 2009 kumar et al 2001 procházka et al 2018 although it is well acknowledged that effective governance is the prerequisite for any sound water resource management little attention has been given to groundwater resource governance conservation and protection ineffective and non smart groundwater governance systems are serious threats such as depletion quality degradation and reduced replenishment of these vital resources this paper assesses the emerging global concerns over increasingly unsustainable groundwater use and aquifer degradation since the groundwater system as a subpart of a water system is a part of a broader social political and economic system in any country it is affected by actors decisions outside the water sector thus this study uses a sd approach to address these concerns it developed a smart system that can indicate the effects of different actions plans programs and policies or scenarios it can do it with measuring the equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy impacts of any decision this smart dynamic system can help policy makers to know better about the short and long term impacts of their decisions then it also allows them to choose the best alternative scenarios about groundwater governance more specifically this study indicates that to govern groundwater resources in iran it is not sufficient to pay only attention to water efficiency economic dimension it also needs to pay attention to the other dimensions such as equity in access to resources who to use and how much to use equity in rights and opportunities who decides sustainable use how much to use and how to use in iran although the agricultural sector is the biggest consumer of the groundwater resources it does not have the same big role in decision or policy making this study also shows that following multi dimensional policies or scenarios would enable the government to overcome the water crisis much faster and smarter despite all the benefits this primary smart system is still at the beginning this model could be more developed and improved using more accurate data completing the variables that affect it and improving and validating its indicators and indexes for example this study suggests that some ecological e g population trends of some key species linked to aquatic ecosystems land cover types temperature change co2 emissions etc and socio economic indicators e g gross national income index poverty index education index etc should be included and linked to the groundwater dynamics model in future works and model developments in particular in some of these indicators there are generally quite direct or indirect relationships between groundwater dynamics and observed trends of them making such improvements and developments in the groundwater dynamics model or any other similar models requires more quantitative information data series and variables related to those aspects therefore this study also suggests that local governments and international institutions develop some databases and complete the relevant existing databases it would be very interesting to have them included in such models in the frame of ecological socio economic etc indicators acknowledgements this work was supported in part by the dfg cluster of excellence clisap appendix a model

11018,groundwater is one of the most important and vital resources in the world in current decades increased water demand and pollution threaten groundwater availability yet groundwater governance is a serious challenge and despite many studies focusing on groundwater assessments its governance has been largely neglected smart groundwater governance is one of the most critical areas to improve the sustainable use of this resource in societies and people s livelihood the main goal of this paper was to introduce a model to evaluate and measure the smartness level of any policy or action as an index to do so this study uses a system dynamics sd approach to develop a smart groundwater governance sgg model to assist policy and decision makers to better understand the short and long term impacts of their actions plans and policies for this purpose the sgg index was introduced in the dynamic model including four indicators i e equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy and was applied in iran the results indicate that groundwater balance is critical i e negative and the current trend of groundwater governance is highly non smart in the country this study concluded that the best strategy to manage this situation and to govern the groundwater resources in a smarter manner includes both increasing the infiltration rate and decreasing the extraction rate or increase the water efficiency as the left and right based scenarios the obtained results also demonstrate the benefits of the sgg index for policy and decision makers in sgg keywords groundwater crisis water management smart governance water shortage iran water crisis 1 introduction water plays a critical role in sustainable development batchelor 2007 and its scarcity is among the major global challenges today jacobson et al 2013 groundwater is one of the world s most important water resources accounts for over 98 of all liquid freshwater dunnivant and anders 2006 fao 2018 about one third of humanity depends totally on groundwater for their daily needs also 99 of the planet earth s accessible freshwater is found in aquifers fao 2015 according to the project of the groundwater governance of fao 2018 groundwater extraction over the past 50 years 1960 2010 has increased by more than 300 recently communities agriculture and industry around the nation and the world have increased their use of groundwater megdal et al 2015 in the future the use of groundwater will continue to increase at higher rate than before as there is a critical need to supply water for agriculture sector urban areas industry and ecosystems groundwater provides drinking water to at least 50 of the world s population and 43 of all of the water is used for irrigation fao 2018 therefore groundwater is an essential natural resource to sustain life it is also substantial to agriculture and food security over the past 50 years groundwater irrigation has grown rapidly it supplies over one third of the world s irrigated area shah 2014 increased water demand and pollution threaten groundwater availability in order to share groundwater resources equitably among nations regions consumers per sector and generations and to maintain the groundwater availability and quality informed decisions need to be made about allocation and protection of groundwater resources igrac 2017 groundwater is a critical component of the water supply for agriculture urban areas industry and ecosystems but its managing is a challenge because it is difﬁcult to map quantify and evaluate groundwater until recently study and assessment of governance of this water resource has been largely neglected megdal et al 2015 globally more than 150 million people live below the altitude of 1 m a s l and 250 million live below the altitude of 5 m a s l igrac 2017 some countries e g africa are in an initial stage in terms of protection areas of groundwater sources or they have not yet started these practices because more stringent problems such as the scarcity of water resources have taken the priority doveri et al 2015 the crisis of groundwater in iran is multifold especially because a it is the most important water resource for most regions of iran hojjati and boustani 2010 which means iran is more dependent on groundwater b the average annual precipitation in iran has been 228 mm year 1994 2014 which means 6 less than the long term average 242 mm year moridi 2017 which means water resources will be more limited c iran s population according to world population review will reach 95 million over the next two decades the current population of iran is more than 80 million and it means there will be more pressure on groundwater resources d intensification of climate change and periodic droughts can worsen the quantity and quality condition of water resources for example in the last 50 years iran has faced ten severe and prolonged droughts which have significantly threatened water availability in all sectors sadeghi 2017 it is expected that climate change will further increase the risk of droughts in some parts of the country and cause floods in others e the recent acceleration of inland use and land cover changes such as deforestation destruction of rangelands and conversion of agricultural lands asadi et al 2014 azadi and barati 2013 azadi et al 2016 barati et al 2015 will increase natural disasters and climatic changes e g flood drought and frostbite which will damage i e drying up the water resources more than before f finally mismanagement nabavi 2017 and the lack of a good water management or governance hojjati and boustani 2010 moridi 2017 are at the top of all causes for instance low water efficiency in the agricultural sector the biggest water consumer sector dropping of the groundwater level and land subsidence 1 1 groundwater levels are dropping at an average of 2 4 meters per year since the slow flling aquifers have not been able to keep up with the growing number of water users and subscribers this drop has caused unprecedented land subsidence of an average of 2 30cm in di erent plains across the country and sinkhole formation all of these factors are contributing to massive desertifcation sadeghi 2017 are two main impacts of impractical water management and governance in iran sadeghi 2017 therefore it seems that the issue of water governance in iran is a complex dynamic system therefore its study needs suitable methodologies and techniques groundwater governance could be defined as a procedure which determines who gets when and how much of the water undp water governance facility at siwi 2015 it is the overarching framework of groundwater use laws regulations and customs as well as the processes of engaging the public sector the private sector and civil society shah 2014 since it relates not only to the state or government but also to civil society and the private sector its development takes place within different constellations of these three entities in this sense improved governance is path dependent and needs to be linked to particular development goals in society such as water services and sanitation for all equitable reallocation of water between users or any other goals such as food and energy for all or conservation and restoration of ecosystems undp et al 2017 now despite the seriousness of the water crisis in most parts of the world and especially in arid and semiarid areas such as iran madani 2014 nabavi 2017 middle east and north africa fao 2012 lezzaik et al 2018 mekki et al 2017 the question is why the previous and current actions plans policies and strategies have not been successful today increasing water scarcity is still one of the major global challenges as local demand for water rises above available supply in many regions the governance of available water resources becomes the key issue to achieve water security at the local regional and global level around the world communities agriculture and industry are increasing their use of groundwater sometimes with adverse impacts on riparian habitats and often with disregard for sustainability megdal et al 2015 poor and bad resource management corruption lack of appropriate institutions bureaucratic inertia insufficient capacity and a shortage of new investments undermine the effective governance of water in many places around the world jacobson et al 2013 after 113 years of the persian constitution in 1906 the country is experiencing a serious water crisis nabavi 2017 in the case of iran the over use and abuse of increasingly precious water resources has been dramatically intensified over the recent decades it is reaching a point where water shortages water quality degradation and aquatic ecosystem destruction are seriously affecting the prospects for socio economic development political stability ecosystem integrity batchelor 2007 the health and the welfare of natural systems and human communities moridi 2017 blame is often attributed to the government s management nabavi 2017 or misgovernance of water resources including both surface and groundwater then apparently there is a need to be a new and different kind of view about groundwater governance this view should be holistic dynamic and systematic to achieve smart groundwater governance this paper aims to address this issue to deal with this at first this paper will model the system dynamics sd of groundwater in iran then it will define smart groundwater governance and finally it will analyze the operation of the smart groundwater governance sd there are some previous studies that tried to analyze water systems in different ways for example madani 2010 illustrated the utility of game theory in water systems analysis and conflict resolution and loáiciga 2004 studied the roles of cooperation and non cooperation in the sustainable exploitation of a jointly used groundwater resource using an analytical game theoretic formulation bhattacharjee et al 2018 evaluated the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions and discussed the key challenges of effective groundwater management also huo et al 2016 used a simulation method to develop an operational water governance model for predicting the future water cycle although these studies tried to analyze and explain the governance of water and groundwater systems they could not develop a smart system to explain the dynamics of groundwater resources over time and under different scenarios in addition they could not tell us whether the governance system is smart or how much it is equitable efficient sustainable and democratic accordingly this study tries to introduce new smart and dynamic models to meet groundwater management deficiencies therefore the main aim of this study is to introduce a model to forecast not only the future trend of groundwater balance but also to evaluate and measure the smartness level of any policies or actions as an index it also aims at assisting policy and decision makers to realize the impacts of their decisions to better understand the short and long term impacts of their actions plans and policies and to ask themselves whether their decisions on groundwater are smart 2 methodology 2 1 study area the site of this study was iran that is located in the world s dry belt according to the last formal census of iran 2016 the total population of the country is 79 926 270 persons iran is one of the largest countries in southwestern asia with an area of 1 648 000 square kilometers the average of iran s annual precipitation is about 240 mm that is about a third of the global average the rainy period in most of the country is from november to may in the dry period between may and october rain is rare in most of the country about 90 of total precipitation occurs in cold and humid seasons in northern and western parts of the country and only 10 occurs in warm and dry seasons in central southern and eastern parts moreover about 52 of precipitation occurs in 25 of the area of the country sadeghi 2017 therefore the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation in iran is volatile and uneven across the country fig 1 while in many localities of iran there is no rainfall torrential rains cause floods and local damages in other locations hence some parts of iran are suffering lack of water resources and iran is experiencing a serious water crisis 2 2 system dynamic modeling sd is an approach to policy analysis and design it applies to dynamic problems arising in different complex systems which are characterized by interdependence mutual interaction information feedback and circular causality thus this approach is one of the most appropriate ways to examine the groundwater governance complexity especially in iran therefore the current study applied for the first time the sd modeling approach to deal with the problem of water crisis and its smart governance in iran recently several studies li et al 2018 xiao qing et al 2012 yang et al 2019 zomorodian et al 2018 used or emphasized this approach to solve the water crisis problem sd is an approach to understand and model the behavior of complex systems over time to model the groundwater cycle this paper applied both primary collected by interviewing experts to develop the sgg model and secondary the databases such as aquastat and statistical center of iran to model the dynamic system of groundwater in iran data according to the sd approach the following steps have been proceeded to design the smart governance index sterman 2000 2 2 1 problem articulation boundary selection it is a situation in which the problem the key variables the time horizon and the dynamic problem should be defined and considered in this study the key variables of the system were identified using two main sources a interviews with filed experts and b literature review 2 2 2 formulation of dynamic hypothesis it includes a process that will be ended in the maps of causal structure based on initial hypotheses reference modes and other available data and tools the base of causal structure in the groundwater system is the hydrological cycle which is relevant for smart groundwater governance jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 some data to formulate the model are adapted from aquastat 2018 a iranian government database 2 2 3 formulation of a simulation model it includes the specification of structure decision rules estimation of parameters behavioral relationships initial conditions and tests for consistency with the purpose and boundary the structure decision rules parameters behavioral relationships and initial conditions were estimated using a basic models and b analyzing the available time series datasets such as aquastat 2018 statistical center of iran sci ministry of agriculture jihad maj etc 2 2 4 testing the model after formulating the model it is necessary to test it this phase includes some specific tests such as comparison to reference modes robustness under extreme conditions and sensitivity analysis this study uses the calibration and sensitivity procedure of the vensim software to test the model during this process the observed data were compared with the model data for a period of time according to the time series data then the simulation is repeated many times in which parameters of the model have changed for each simulation at the end the software will propose the details of the best parameters for the tested variables 2 2 5 policy design and evaluation during this phase the capability of the model to develop scenarios and to design policies is evaluated based on new decision rules strategies and structures on the ground decision making is the main object of modeling any phenomena or systems to solve the modeling problem s therefore this phase is critical for managers and policy makers the scenarios in this study were developed based on the main key variables of the model that have the greatest impacts on the groundwater balance these impacts were determined by analyzing the sensitivity of the model to their changes the number of these variables per each scenario was selected using experts opinions and monitoring the model behaviors under each condition the software that used for sd modelling and simulation was ventana vensim dds for windows version 6 4e we used the case of iran for testing policy design and evaluation 2 3 elaboration of the specific smart groundwater governance model for iran 2 3 1 the system dynamics of groundwater for smart governance of groundwater this paper investigates a sd approach to expose the key variables and the dynamics of groundwater fig 2 depicts part of a causal structure of a groundwater sd this system includes two main parts the left part indicates the inflow of groundwater using the hydrologic cycle and the right part includes the main outflows of groundwater resources and their main important variables and factors the hydrologic cycle begins with the evaporation 90 and evapotranspiration 10 from the surface of water plants and lands the moist air and water vapor condense to form clouds and return to the surface as precipitation once the water reaches the ground one of the two processes may occur 1 evaporates and transpires back into the atmosphere or 2 penetrates into the surface and becomes groundwater infiltration penuel et al 2013 the amount of water that plants transpire varies geographically over time there are a number of factors that determine transpiration rates including temperature relative humidity wind and air movement soil moisture availability and type of plant usgs and perlman 2016 infiltration is known as the process of water entering the soil surface when rain or irrigation water is supplied to a field it seeps into the soil called infiltration the infiltration rate is the velocity at which water can seep into the soil it is commonly measured by the depth in mm of the water layer that the soil can absorb in an hour the infiltration rate of a soil depends on the factors that are constant such as the soil texture and it also depends on factors that vary such as the soil moisture content and the soil structure infiltration rate is higher for coarse textured soils than for fine textured soils the water infiltrates faster higher infiltration rate when the soil is dry than when it is wet generally water infiltrates quickly high infiltration rate into granular soils but very slowly low infiltration rate into massive and compact soils brouwer et al 1985 johnson 1963 the head of the applied water the depth to ground water the length of time of application of water and biological activity are some of the other influencing variables johnson 1963 groundwater either seeps its way into the oceans rivers and streams or is released back into the atmosphere through transpiration large amounts of water are stored in the ground the water is still moving possibly very slowly and it is a part of the water cycle most of the water in the ground comes from precipitation that infiltrates downward from the land surface as a part of the water cycle groundwater is a major contributor to flow in many streams and rivers and it has a strong influence on river and wetland habitats for plants and animals people have been using groundwater for thousands of years and continue to use it today largely for irrigation and drinking life on earth depends on groundwater just as surface water usgs and perlman 2016 wells springs and qanats especially in iran are three main ways to evacuate groundwater ahmadi et al 2010 hamidian et al 2015 the balance of water that remains on the earth s surface is runoff which is emptied into lakes rivers and streams and is carried back to the oceans where the cycle begins again based on this causal model we can map the main groundwater processes based on the concepts of stocks and flows which are a central idea in sd see fig 3 2 3 2 governance of groundwater governance is the activity of coordinating communications in order to achieve collective goals through collaboration willke 2007 the need for governance not only arises as the population grows but also with shortage of resources in addition with simultaneous increase in resources shortage such as water resource the need for governance will increase and will be more complex governance is also obvious when there is an explicit goal to be implemented resulting from a project a plan or a strategy willke 2007 therefore water governance is to determine who obtains when and how much water undp water governance facility at siwi 2015 water governance also refers to the political social economic and administrative systems that influence water use and resource management rogers and hall 2003 water governance determines the equity and efficiency in water resource and services allocation and distribution it balances water use between socio economic activities and ecosystems it determines who gets water when and how and who has the right to water and related services and their benefits how the decisions are made and the roles of power and politics are important issues in governance undp et al 2017 given the limitation of water resources the competition for this resource has rapidly increased and there is a general agreement that improvements to water governance and collaboration among key stakeholders are a necessary part of the solution batchelor 2007 on the whole to analyze the dynamics of water resources and their governance at least four fundamental dimensions including social economic political and environmental should be considered jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 in terms of social dimension its distribution should be equitable among various socio economic groups in both time from now to the future and space from local to non local in economic terms the allocation of water should be efficient which means it should be done in a way to have a suitable role in the overall economic growth and poverty reduction politically water stakeholders should have the equal rights opportunities and facilities to play a bigger role in decision making processes it could greatly improve the short and the long outcomes and solve and decrease current and future conflicts finally water governance should lead to sustainable use of water and related ecosystem services water resources need to be sufficiently safeguarded against the current agricultural urban and industrial unsustainable uses 2 3 3 smart groundwater governance sgg smart groundwater governance especially in the present era and for the modern world is necessary due to the vital role of water for humanity also water changes and shortages are of the main crises of the current world all too often well intentioned efforts to solve pressing problems lead to policy resistance where our policies are delayed diluted or defeated by the unforeseen reactions of other people or of nature then we need to have a new kind of smart governance which is an innovation of traditional concepts of municipality from administrative approaches to different manager visions smart governance is using technology to facilitate and support better planning and decision making it is about improving democratic processes and transforming ways of delivering public services ioppolo 2013 also smart governance is about the future and it should be transparent accountable responsive and efficient in this study smart groundwater governance sgg is defined as a sd including a range of political social economic and administrative components these components are responsible for developing and managing groundwater resources their inflows and outflows in an equitable efficient democratic and sustainable way in this regard sgg at least needs to indicate who uses water who decides about using water how much water could be used how to use water using in a way that does not deal with the shortage and when to use water fig 4 sgg aims to balance groundwater use between socio economic activities and ecosystems through developing a smart and open model also sgg would involve governmental institutions as well as stakeholder participation and collaboration at all levels and in all branches of the governing process smart groundwater governance needs to follow a sd approach because it contains several elements with a complex network of relationships the networks affect smart groundwater governance performance and the bad governance would lead to many socio economic political and environmental outputs immediate results outcomes mid term results and impacts long term results which will appear now and in the future furthermore ssg needs the systems dynamics sd approach because there is an increasing competition between the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors especially in arid and semiarid agro systems mekki et al 2017 that will increase its complexity over time moreover testing and assessing different ways and methods are time and resources consuming groundwater plays a pivotal role in sustaining human activities especially in arid environments with scarce surface water resources giordano 2009 also the bad governance of groundwater has countless challenges and crises for many countries including iran madani 2014 nabavi 2017 according to a global risk report water crises have been identified as one of the four major risks most likely to impose devastating threats globally lezzaik et al 2018 the sd approach could improve our understanding of how the governance performance is the result of its internal and external structure including stakeholders competitors and suppliers the approach could also help us use our understanding to design high leverage successful groundwater governance policies finally it is a fundamental interdisciplinary method to solve important real world problems sterman 2000 ssg s conceptual model could be changed to a stock and flow model as represented in figs 5 and 6 in this model we defined cumulative sgg index as a stock and sgg index as a flow variable the sgg index as a flow variable measures the average value of the sgg index for each main stockholder of groundwater resources agriculture municipal industry and ecosystem over an interval of time the cumulative sgg index as a stock variable measures the aggregate value of total sgg indicators at one specific time since a flow variable is measured over an interval of time the sgg index would be measured per unit of time such as a year or a month a flow is roughly similar to rate or speed in this sense the sgg index is defined as a function of four variables that indicate the value of equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy indicators of each stockholder eq 1 1 s g g i n d e x i e q u i t a b l e e f f i c i e n t d e m o c r a t i c s u s t a i n a b l e 4 stocks are accumulations that characterize the state of the system and generate the information upon which decisions and actions are based sterman 2000 they are measured at one specific time and represent quantities existing at that point in time the cumulative sgg index aggregates or integrates their inflow or overall sgg index eq 2 2 c u m u l a t i v e s g g i n d e x t 0 t o v e r a l l s g g i n d e x s g g i n d e x t 0 eq 2 adapted from sterman 2000 determines the cumulative sgg index which represents the value of the overall sgg index as a flow at any time between the initial time to and the current time t the overall sgg index is the weighted mean of sgg indicators it could be calculated by eq 3 where aws eq 3 is the share of stakeholder i of total accessible water it could be a number between 0 and 1 3 o v e r a l l s g g i n d e x s g g i n d e x i a w s i we measure equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy indicators by the following equations 4 e q u i p o p u l a t i o n i e e d g s i where equi is the equitability index of subsector or main stockholders i populationi is a proportion of the population of stockholders i who have access to extracted water and eedgsi is the share of subsector i of the total extracted groundwater of the country 5 e f f i g d p i e e d g s i where effi is efficiency index of subsector i gdpi is the share of subsector i in total gdp and eedgsi is the share of the extracted groundwater of subsector i 6 d e m i r g c i e e d g s where demi is the democracy index of subsector i in every country rgci represents part of the regulations government agencies and cooperatives etc that belong to a specific subsector such as agriculture or industry subsector i eedgsi is the share of subsector i from the total extracted groundwater 7 s u s i e e d g i t e e d g t e a b l e g t e e d g t e a b l e g 1 where susi is sustainability index of subsector i eedgi is the extracted groundwater of subsector i teedg is the total extracted groundwater of the country and teableg is the total extractable groundwater of the country it is equal to the total infiltration of water entering the soil surface fig 7 depicts a general shape of the stock and flow model for sgg index the value of each indicator will be between 0 and 1 where 0 means the subsector is completely non equitable or efficient sustainable or democratic in contrary the value of 1 means it is quite equitable or efficient sustainable or democratic as a result the value of sgg index will also have a range between zero and one based on figs 4 7 the sd of sgg could be exposed as fig 8 in which cumulative sgg index is accumulated over time by the overall sgg index which is a rate of four flow variables including sgg index muni sgg index indu sgg index eco and sgg index agri 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic system of groundwater in iran to introduce a model for smart groundwater governance in iran at first it needs to realize the dynamics of iran groundwater according to aquastat 2018 the annual average precipitation of iran over the past twenty years has been 397 9 km³ year or 228 mm year which is about 6 less than the long term average 242 mm year in addition the average surface run off during this period has been 52 km³ year moridi 2017 it is about 44 less than the long term average 97 3 km³ year aquastat 2018 the volume of groundwater that was produced internally is about 49 3 km³ year and there is an overlap of about 18 1 km³ year between surface water and groundwater total external renewable water resources of iran are about 8 5 km³ year based on these data total surface water total groundwater and total renewable water resources of iran are respectively about 105 8 49 3 and 137 km³ year see table 1 although the total renewable water of iran is about 137 km³ year but only about 30 of this amount is accessible postel et al 1996 it means the total accessible renewable water of iran is 41 1 km³ year total renewable water is equal to surface water plus groundwater minus the overlap between surface water and groundwater kohli and frenken 2015 table 1 and the data mentioned above were used to model the dynamics of groundwater in iran over the next years fig 9 the left hand of this model shows the resources of groundwater inflows the trend of precipitation by 2050 was forecasted based on time series data 1964 2017 fig 10 the right hand of the model is about the extraction of water from resources of groundwater outflows based on the observed and literature reviewed data three main outflows including agriculture municipality and industry were considered in the model it is also assumed that only 30 of renewable water is accessible which implies that extraction higher than this amount will damage the ecosystem the agricultural water demand is dependent on agricultural land area and water efficiency in the agriculture sector the agricultural land area decreased during recent years and its changes over time have been mainly related to population growth azadi and barati 2013 azadi et al 2015 2016 barati et al 2015 the trends of the agricultural land area and population of iran were forecasted based on maj and csi computational science and informatics time series databases this model has also included water efficiency in different sectors agricultural water efficiency in iran is generally low frenken 2009 according to alizadeh and keshavarz 2005 it is about 35 and based on frenken 2009 it is about 33 also about 62 64 of water used in agriculture is withdrawn from groundwater these shares for the industrial and municipal sectors from groundwater are about 50 and 25 then the total withdrawal of water from these sectors agriculture industry and municipal have been 86 1 1 and 6 2 km3 year respectively frenken 2009 table 2 shows some other information real or observed data about the variables that is used in the groundwater dynamic model based on this model the model data the volume of precipitation population and irrigated land area according to the current situations and changes will reach 344 7 km3 112 500 thousand person and 2 470 000 ha by 2050 respectively for the base model the efficiency of water is supposed to be fixed as well 3 2 model calibration and testing results after formulating the model it is necessary to validate the model this phase includes some specific tests such as comparison to reference modes robustness under extreme conditions and sensitivity to do so at first the modeler needs to evaluate the model calibration and then the validity of the calibration this study used the vensim software calibration and sensitivity procedure followed by the sd approach since it is an initial effort to measure the smartness level of the groundwater governance accordingly the first step is to evaluate the model calibration the term evaluation refers to the estimated parameters of the system models wallach et al 2018 if the parameters are estimated within reasonable ranges the modeling results are comparable with observed data oliva 2003 in addition the only real time series data in this study were precipitation population and agricultural land areas to which the calibration and validation are limited fig 10 shows the results of the calibrated model compared to the observed or actual data showing good consistency in addition table 2 indicates the average of the long term observed and resulting data of the groundwater dynamic model these data are close to each other as well similarly the calibration of variables relevant to the state variable s groundwater outflow side extraction was evaluated the parameters of the model were estimated by fitting data method wallach et al 2018 if the parameters are estimated within reasonable ranges the modeling results are comparable with observed data oliva 2003 moreover the only real time series data in this study were precipitation population and agricultural land areas to which the calibration and the validation are limited fig 10 indicates the results of the calibrated model in comparison to the observed or real data which demonstrates a good consistence in addition table 1 indicates the average long term data reported by aquastat and the same data resulted of the model these data are close to each other as well in the same way the calibration of the influencing variables relevant to the outflow side extraction of the state variable groundwater was evaluated the parameters of the model were estimated by the method of fitting the full system model to the data in addition to calibration veriﬁcation and validation were used as a critical part of the model testing process generally the sd model testing has two types behavioral and structural elsawah et al 2017 sterman 2000 this study uses sensitivity analysis as a valuable approach to behavioral and structural testing it assesses the effects of variations in parameter values boundary conditions and other model inputs on model output elsawah et al 2017 vensim has the capability of sensitivity analysis in which model parameters change for each simulation in an arbitrary or default variation range for each simulation 50 75 95 and 100 the assumptions about the value of constants in the model were changed during the sensitivity testing process and then the resulting outputs were examined this can be very helpful to understand the behavioral boundaries of a model and testing the robustness of model based policies fig 11 indicates the results of the sensitivity analysis for four main variables of the study based on four different ranges of variations 50 75 95 and 100 these variables were selected based on both experts opinion and the sensitivity of the model to their changes in regard to these results the outputs of the model have been allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs demonstrating the confidence of the model 3 3 the trends of variables 3 3 1 scenarios and simulation results when the dynamic model was formulated and the model validation verification and functions were checked it can run fig 12 depicts the changes of infiltration extraction and its impacts on the balance of groundwater resources this base model indicates the balance between infiltration and extraction for groundwater it was implemented under the conditions that the water efficiency and the rate of transmission loss will not change until 2050 under the assumption that the accessible water is less than 30 of renewable water postel et al 1996 it shows that there is a surplus extraction from groundwater fig 12 the current balance between accessible water and extraction is about 21 2 km3 year by 2042 the accumulated value of this over withdrawal will reach about 183 4 km3 and then the balance between accessible water and extraction will be established because of low water efficiency this model also indicates that about 32 km3 year water would be wasted annually from 2018 to 2050 if the current conditions continue as before and the current government policies do not change it will take more than 22 years until the extraction rate from groundwater reaches to less than its infiltration rate as in the past population and agriculture will be the two main influence factors that affect groundwater as fig 13 indicates the growing population increases the pressure on groundwater resources and due to the decrease in the agricultural irrigated land area this pressure will begin to decrease and will gradually be intensified according to the dynamic groundwater model groundwater governance has at least two sides extraction and infiltration it means that not only the rapid increase of water withdrawal is a main cause of the ground water crisis but also it is the result of low water infiltration a decreasing infiltration is not only the result of a decline in precipitation but is also the result of a lower infiltration rate where land cover changes and soil erosion are the main reasons of lower infiltration rate see fig 2 therefore any government who wants to manage groundwater resources should consider both sides for example if over 10 years a the current infiltration rate of internal renewable water 0 384 using land cover and watershed projects reaches 0 4 as a left side base scenario or b agriculture water efficiency increases from 0 4 to 0 5 as a right side base scenario see fig 14 then the groundwater balance will change see fig 14 as fig 15 shows the return time of the groundwater balance equality of inflow and outflow under the left scenario is about 25 years but under the right scenario this return time will be about 16 years it means the right hand policies and programs extraction scenarios will have a faster effect than the left hand scenarios infiltration scenarios the government can also apply an integrated scenario including both infiltration and extraction modifications which increase the infiltration rate of internal renewable water from 0 384 to 0 395 and the water efficiency of agriculture from 0 4 to 0 45 during the next 10 years therefore returning the balance to groundwater equality of inflow and outflow will take about 14 years fig 15 such dynamic model could help decision makers to test many scenarios and to apply smarter policies and programs it also helps them to see the impacts of their programs and policies it can also help them to see the impacts of their programs and policies for example incentive and punitive policies that prevent the agricultural land conversion other examples of policies include soil erosion through increasing the vegetative cover of the land increasing soil organic matter and preventing unnecessary use of chemical fertilizers that damage the soil structure can increase the infiltration rate of surface water to groundwater using a dynamic model can help policymakers realize the impacts of such policies and make the best decisions since governments usually deal with their problems in the real world with a combination of different programs and policies in this study three different scenarios a pessimistic b probable and c optimistic were designed the scenarios were based on four variables including agricultural water efficiency agricultural transmission loss rate municipal water efficiency and infiltration rate of irw table 3 in order to have logical and possible choices for each variable the selections of variables is made based on the field observations and opinions of scientific experts in agriculture irrigation soil and rangeland sciences moreover the change in these variables is more likely for the government than other variables to achieve the goals a 30 year period was considered changes in the other variables such as precipitation population and gdp share are similar for all the scenarios table 4 fig 16 displays the groundwater balance changes under pessimistic a probable b and optimistic c scenarios in fact the pessimistic scenario is the base model under this scenario the current condition will continue to exist in the future as said above under this scenario coming back to balance in groundwater will take about 24 years by 2042 but under scenario b and c reaching to the balance between infiltration and extraction will take respectively about 18 by 2036 and 14 by 2032 years for example under the probable scenario it is assumed that during a 30 year program the amounts of agricultural water efficiency agricultural transmission loss rate municipal water efficiency and infiltration rate of irw reaches 45 5 40 and 40 respectively see table 3 3 3 2 integrated system for smart groundwater governance in iran in this section at first a smart dynamic model for groundwater governance has been introduced and then the changes of the sgg index under three main scenarios a b and c have been discussed fig 17 shows a simplified smart dynamic model for groundwater governance in iran this model is linked to the iran groundwater dynamic model fig 9 it means that some inputs for this model are derived from the groundwater dynamic model the changes in the overall sgg index and its components by 2050 based on the sgg and groundwater models are shown in fig 18 it seems that above scenarios not only will change the groundwater resource conditions but also will affect the sgg index on the other hand implementation of these scenarios especially b and c notably by increasing agriculture and ecosystem sgg indices will affect and improve the overall sgg index a little however using scenarios b and specially c at first will make this rising faster and then it will be stopped what is the main cause of this behavior it seems that smart groundwater governance like other smart systems is a complex phenomenon that requires more systematic attention if the government wants to be smarter in this context there should be more systematic plans moreover this study assumed that the duration of each policy is 30 years if the policy implementation continues after 30 years the sgg index will certainly continue to increase these plans and policy also should consider the equitability efficiency sustainability and democratic aspects of smart groundwater governance for example in the agriculture sector it is very important not only to increase the water efficiency but also to make some efforts to increase the value added in the agricultural sector in order to increase its gdp share in addition the government needs to increase the share of agriculture in rules regulations and organizations for instance if the government under a different scenario while other conditions are similar to scenario c tries to increase the gdp share agri variable up to 15 and the rgc agri variable up to 40 i e during 30 years scenario c2 then the sgg index agri will reach 0 491 from 0 231 over this period it will also increase the overall sgg index from 0 076 to 0 132 fig 19 the model presented in this paper is capable not only to demonstrate the impacts of various actions plans and scenarios on the changes of groundwater resources but also to measure an index to determine the smart level of groundwater governance there are many earlier and currently presented models and studies such as madani 2010 jacobson et al 2013 undp et al 2017 mechlem 2016 and bhattacharjee et al 2018 that have looked at the groundwater governance from a specific angle although all these studies have been useful and could improve our awareness about the issue and crisis of water scarcity we think they could not simulate the complexity of this issue as a dynamic system and its changes over a long time the presented model can help governments have a smart and systematic view about groundwater governance and it is the main contribution of this study 4 conclusion population growth rapid urbanization industrialization economic development food security and climate change are putting unprecedented pressure on groundwater consumption mechlem 2016 in addition the lack of precipitation as the main result of climate change has forced many nations to use groundwater resources more than in the past while groundwater use has some short term socioeconomic and political benefits it has many long term environmental socioeconomic and political costs and influences america and region 2009 kumar et al 2001 procházka et al 2018 although it is well acknowledged that effective governance is the prerequisite for any sound water resource management little attention has been given to groundwater resource governance conservation and protection ineffective and non smart groundwater governance systems are serious threats such as depletion quality degradation and reduced replenishment of these vital resources this paper assesses the emerging global concerns over increasingly unsustainable groundwater use and aquifer degradation since the groundwater system as a subpart of a water system is a part of a broader social political and economic system in any country it is affected by actors decisions outside the water sector thus this study uses a sd approach to address these concerns it developed a smart system that can indicate the effects of different actions plans programs and policies or scenarios it can do it with measuring the equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy impacts of any decision this smart dynamic system can help policy makers to know better about the short and long term impacts of their decisions then it also allows them to choose the best alternative scenarios about groundwater governance more specifically this study indicates that to govern groundwater resources in iran it is not sufficient to pay only attention to water efficiency economic dimension it also needs to pay attention to the other dimensions such as equity in access to resources who to use and how much to use equity in rights and opportunities who decides sustainable use how much to use and how to use in iran although the agricultural sector is the biggest consumer of the groundwater resources it does not have the same big role in decision or policy making this study also shows that following multi dimensional policies or scenarios would enable the government to overcome the water crisis much faster and smarter despite all the benefits this primary smart system is still at the beginning this model could be more developed and improved using more accurate data completing the variables that affect it and improving and validating its indicators and indexes for example this study suggests that some ecological e g population trends of some key species linked to aquatic ecosystems land cover types temperature change co2 emissions etc and socio economic indicators e g gross national income index poverty index education index etc should be included and linked to the groundwater dynamics model in future works and model developments in particular in some of these indicators there are generally quite direct or indirect relationships between groundwater dynamics and observed trends of them making such improvements and developments in the groundwater dynamics model or any other similar models requires more quantitative information data series and variables related to those aspects therefore this study also suggests that local governments and international institutions develop some databases and complete the relevant existing databases it would be very interesting to have them included in such models in the frame of ecological socio economic etc indicators acknowledgements this work was supported in part by the dfg cluster of excellence clisap appendix a model

11019,irrigation efficiency ie and water saving potential wsp are two fundamental parameters for assessing water use and management in irrigation systems a new calculation method was proposed herein to accurately estimate the ie and wsp in irrigation systems the proposed method considers the reuse of return flow a modified soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios for the yangshudang ysd watershed within the zhanghe irrigation system zis in hubei province china the dry year of 2010 was chosen as a study case based on simulation results the traditional irrigation efficiency i e 0 and water saving potential w s p 0 as well as the irrigation efficiency taking into account the reuse of return flow i e r and water saving potential considering the reuse of return flow w s p r were calculated for various scenarios the relationships between the two ie indicators and the cause thereof as well as the two wsp values were analyzed and explored the results showed that both ie and wsp were improved with the enhancement of water saving as long as there was the reuse of return flow i e r must be greater than i e 0 moreover in terms of water saving approaches that improved the reuse rate of return flow w s p r was determined to be greater than w s p 0 thereby suggesting that the traditional method underestimated the wsp however for water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of return flow w s p r was determined to be less than w s p 0 which suggested that the traditional method overestimated the wsp the relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r was attributed to the fact that w s p r was calculated by subtracting the amount of the water saved by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 and this difference can be either positive or negative therefore the managers of irrigation systems should use i e r as the actual ie but not i e 0 and use w s p r instead of w s p 0 to evaluate the actual wsp keywords irrigation efficiency water saving potential modified swat reuse of return flow 1 introduction irrigation efficiency ie is an indicator that comprehensively reflects the efficiencies of irrigation projects water management and the irrigation technology at various scales it is an important basis for correctly evaluating the effective use degree of irrigation water and the development effect of water saving irrigation water saving potential wsp refers to the amount of water that can be conserved in an irrigation system by adopting one or more water saving approaches under certain socio economic conditions the correct calculation of wsp is of significance for guiding water saving reforming engineering in irrigation systems presently the effective use degree of irrigation water is evaluated by using the traditional ie i e 0 the difference between the gross irrigation water use before and after the application of water saving approaches is used to describe the wsp which is calculated based on the net irrigation requirement and i e 0 this value is also known as the water saving amount for irrigation water intake w s p 0 cui and xiong 2009 cui et al 2014 however i e 0 is calculated without considering the reuse of the return flow in irrigation systems therefore it cannot reflect the true effective use degree of irrigation water and the level of water management in irrigation systems moreover w s p 0 is not the true amount of water saved because the amount of water leaking into the deep ground and the amount returning to the surface are also considered to be savable in the calculation of w s p 0 however in reality a part of these return flows still remains in the water resource system and can be reused therefore this portion of return flows should not be counted as savable seckler 1996 indicated that water loss at the field scale might not amount to real loss because it may be reused on the larger scale he further indicated that misconceptions regarding ie can lead to erroneous estimation of wsp solomon and davidoff 1999 pointed out that the relationship between ie at the field scale and ie at the irrigation system or basin scale was not well understood and the complex relationship between these scales was attributed to the fact that the drainage water of one farmland may be used by another farmland i e there was the reuse of return flow li et al 2005 and cui et al 2007 analyzed the different wsps in the zhanghe irrigation system zis in hubei province china and determined that the wsp calculated based on water balance was much smaller than that calculated based on the i e 0 and net irrigation requirement blanke et al 2007 indicated that the adoption of water saving engineering methods and technology could be effective on a relatively small scale but was extremely costly and failed to save water because a vast majority of losses were reused therefore it is important to explore new calculation methods for ie and wsp by taking the reuse of return flow into account herein i e r is the irrigation efficiency with the reuse of return flow and w s p r is the water saving potential with reuse of the return flow considering these findings many researchers have proposed new methods for calculating ie and wsp by considering the reuse of the return flow from the perspective of water resource management in irrigation systems jensen 1977 keller and keller 1995 molden 1997 campadelli et al 2007 cui et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 although the rationality of the associated concepts and theories have been emphasized in these methods the application of these methods in real situations has been challenging owing to the difficulties associated with determining some of the water balance elements especially the return flow and its reused amount such difficulties have hindered the application of these methods to water management in irrigation systems therefore the difficulty in correctly evaluating the level of water management and water saving potential in the irrigation systems lies in proposing practical methods to estimate ie which consider the reuse of return flow and quantifying the return flow and its reused amount recently many studies have explored the process of quantifying the return flow and its reused amount zulu et al 1996 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 however most of these studies only emphasized the estimation of the quantity of return flow with limited consideration of the quantification of the reuse of the return flow apart from these difficulties it is too difficult and expensive to conduct experiments for calculating the return flow and its reused amount over large scale areas such as irrigation systems therefore modeling methods are suitable for these cases that involve large scale areas considering the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation systems a distributed hydrological model is the best choice for the estimation of the return flow and its reused amount consequently the development of a distributed hydrological model capable of describing hydrological processes in an irrigation system is the key to estimating the return flow and its reused amount wu et al 2019a 2019b modified the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 and proposed a new method for calculating the return flow and its reused amount in irrigation systems their method was based on the simulation results obtained from the modified swat model these studies notwithstanding there is little research on the relationship between w s p r and w s p 0 from the perspective of irrigation water management the managers of irrigation systems hope to obtain the accurate ie and wsp but at present i e 0 and w s p 0 do not take the reuse of return flow into account where i e 0 is underestimated and w s p 0 cannot represent the actual wsp which may lead the managers to make improper water saving measures and water management decisions i e r and w s p r take the reuse of return flow into account and can be used to evaluate actual wsp which can provide irrigation management decision support for the managers while the current methods proposed by predecessors to calculate them are difficult to be used in practice from what has been discussed above the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to define and propose a practical method for calculating i e r and w s p r for providing irrigation management decision support for the managers 2 to study the ysd watershed in the zis in hubei province china as a case we applied the new method to calculate the i e r and w s p r of ysd under various water saving scenarios additionally we calculated i e 0 and w s p 0 by using traditional methods 3 to analyze the change rules of i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r under various water saving scenarios and the relationships between them and the causes thereof 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation efficiency considering reuse of return flow 2 1 1 definitions of indicators a few definitions of the irrigation efficiency from different perspectives israelsen 1950 jensen 1977 guo 1997 liu et al 2011 huffman et al 2013 cui et al 2014 have been proposed during the past few decades i e 0 is the most widely used and is defined as follows 1 i e 0 w s w g where w s is the water applied to the soil root zone through irrigation m3 and w g is the gross irrigation water use i e the sum of water diverted from all different water sources for irrigation m3 guo 1997 huffman et al 2013 as shown in eq 1 i e 0 does not consider the impact of the reuse of return flow nevertheless the return flow and its reuse are common phenomena in any irrigation system to accurately reflect the irrigation water use efficiency assess the level of water management and calculate the wsp in an irrigation system in this study i e r is defined as follows 2 i e r w i w g w s w r u w g where w i is the water applied to the soil root zone through irrigation and the reuse of return flow m3 and w r u is the water applied to the soil root zone through the reuse of return flow m3 i e r considers the impact of the reuse of return flow not only from the water use terminal i e from the soil root zone but also from the water intake terminal i e from the water sources therefore i e r can also be defined as follows 3 i e r w s w n e w g w s w g w r where w n e w g is the gross irrigation water use that does not include the reused return flow m3 which is equal to w g minus the gross reused return flow in the irrigation system w r is the gross reused irrigation return flow m3 which is the return flow taken from drainage channels or ponds for irrigation in terms of the definition of i e r as shown in eq 2 the numerator and denominator simultaneously contain the reused return flow the numerator contains the net and the denominator contains the gross while as shown in eq 3 the numerator and denominator do not contain the reused return flow in other words the definition of i e r needs that both the numerator and denominator involve the reuse of return flow or neither compared with i e 0 the calculation of i e r considers the reuse of return flow for irrigation by adding the water applied to the soil root zone through the reuse of return flow in the numerator or by subtracting the gross reused return flow in the denominator to explore the relationship between i e 0 and i e r eq 2 is further represented as 4 i e r w i w g w s w r u w g w s w g w r u w g i e 0 w r w g w r u w r i e 0 η i η r where η r is the use rate of the irrigation return flow defined as the percentage of w r u in w r η i is the irrigation water reuse rate defined as the percentage of w r in w g eq 3 can be further expanded on the basis of the equal ratios theorem in mathematics as follows 5 i e r w s w n e w g w s w g w r w s w s w g w r w r w g w r w r w s i e r w r w g w r w r w s w g i e r w r w g i e 0 i e r w r w g i e 0 i e r η i 2 1 2 simplification of indicators as shown in eq 4 the calculation of i e r requires that i e 0 η i and η r should be known i e 0 can be calculated by monitoring the amount of water introduced at the head of the canal and the amount of water applied to the soil root zone alternatively it can be obtained from the management department of the irrigation system η i can be calculated by using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a based on the modified swat model but it is difficult to measure or estimate the value of η r here it is assumed that the effective use degree of w r is the same as that of w g that is to say η r i e r the equation for calculating i e r can be simplified by substituting this relationship into eq 4 6 i e r i e 0 1 η i as for eq 5 it can be transformed into eq 6 by equation transformation this demonstrates that the final equations for calculating the irrigation efficiency are the same when considering the reuse of return flow from the two different perspectives furthermore it can be seen from eq 6 that i e r is always greater than i e 0 as long as that there is the reuse of the return flow 2 2 methods for calculating the water saving potential in this study the focus is on the analysis of w s p 0 and w s p r the equation for calculating w s p 0 is as follows cui and liu 2015 7 w s p 0 w n i e 0 b w n i e 0 a where w n is the net irrigation requirement which is generally obtained by multiplying the net irrigation quota by the irrigated area m3 and it is different from w s that refers to the single use of irrigation water and excludes the reuse of return flow whereas w n includes the single use of irrigation water and the reuse of return flow which corresponds to the sum of w s and w r u the subscripts b and a represent before and after the application of the water saving approaches to calculate the wsp that accounts for the reuse of return flow it is necessary to replace i e 0 by i e r on the basis of eq 7 8 w s p r w n i e r b w n i e r a it can be seen that the main difference between the two wsps is attributed to the difference in the methods for calculating the ie the method used in eq 7 is referred to as the traditional method the method used in eq 8 accounts for the reuse of the return flow therefore the wsp calculated using eq 8 considers the change of the reused return flow after applying the water saving approaches and can better reflect the true water saving potential in an irrigation system 2 3 study area and model setup 2 3 1 study area the study area was the ysd watershed in the zis of the hubei province in china it is a relatively closed area of approximately 43 3 km2 the area is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis the first tributary canal of the third main canal and a small branch canal as shown in fig 1 wu et al 2019a the study area has a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm the mainland includes paddy fields dry lands forests and grasslands of which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil the study area cultivates crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed rice is the main irrigated crop and uses the intermittent irrigation mode 2 3 2 model setup according to eq 8 w n and i e r must be determined prior to calculating w s p r however eq 6 implies that η i must be obtained before calculating i e r for the whole irrigation system η i can be calculated by using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a which was based on the modified swat model wu et al 2019b the modified swat model allows for the simulation of hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios in this study a distributed hydrological model was set up for the study area based on the modified swat model and the η i was calculated using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a the study area was divided into 10 sub basins based on the digital elevation model dem data as shown in fig 1 in particular in terms of the ysd watershed the river channels as shown in fig 1 are mainly used as the actual drainage channels furthermore 105 hydrologic response units hrus were obtained according to the type of land use soil type distribution and slope division next a distributed hydrological model was established for the ysd watershed based on meteorological data and relevant parameters of ponds in addition the model was calibrated and validated using the observed discharge series in the ysd watershed outlet the observed evapotranspiration series and the irrigation water use from different water sources measured in the study area for the detailed modeling calibration and validation process and the associated results one can refer to the study by wu et al 2019b 2 4 setting up water saving scenarios to explore the change rules of w s p 0 and w s p r under various water saving scenarios the relationship between the two water saving potentials as well as the underlying causes of this relationship four different water saving scenarios were set up based on the characteristics of the study area 1 different drainage areas of ponds the change in the drainage areas of ponds was represented by the amplification in a fraction of the sub basin area that drains into ponds p n d f r there is a p n d f r for each sub basin based on the present scenario the amplification is 0 the amplifications were set as 10 20 30 40 and 50 2 different traditional irrigation efficiencies as far as the ysd watershed is concerned the main water sources include both the local water sources ponds and drainage channels and the zhanghe reservoir the canal system is rarely used for the local water sources however it is required for transporting water from the zhanghe reservoir to the fields therefore two different traditional ie values were set for the different water sources under the present scenario these values are i e 01 0 90 for the local water sources and i e 02 0 65 for the zhanghe reservoir the overall traditional ie is calculated as the weighted average based on the corresponding irrigation water use of the two water sources in particular the traditional ie associated with the zhanghe reservoir can be increased by improving the anti seep standards of the corresponding canals based on the present scenario i e 02 is 0 65 we gradually increased the traditional ie of zhanghe reservoir by 0 05 in other words i e 02 was set to be 0 70 0 75 0 80 and 0 85 3 different rice irrigation modes because the study area is a typical irrigation system with paddy rice three different irrigation modes were set for the irrigation system these included the flood irrigation mode intermittent irrigation mode and the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode the three critical water depths of paddy fields at different growing stages for these three irrigation modes namely the maximum fitting depth h max the minimum fitting depth h min and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p are shown in table 1 4 a comprehensive water saving scenario for each of the above mentioned three scenarios there exists a specific condition where the water saving potential is maximized therefore integrating the conditions with the maximum water saving potential associated with the three different scenarios will yield a comprehensive water saving scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 results and analysis of irrigation efficiency and water saving potential the hydrological processes under the present scenario and various water saving scenarios described in the preceding sections were simulated with the modified swat model of the study area we ranked the rainfall between 1973 and 2010 from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area to calculate the rainfall frequency we selected the dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 for the case study given that the difference between the new method proposed in this study and the traditional method is the consideration of the reuse of the return flow η i should be calculated under various water saving scenarios according to the simulation results moreover the corresponding values of i e 0 and i e r were also calculated according to the simulation results where i e 0 was calculated as the weighted average based on irrigation water use from the local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir as well as the corresponding i e 01 and i e 02 values i e r was calculated directly using eq 6 finally w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated using eqs 7 and 8 respectively 3 1 1 results and analysis under various drainage areas of ponds according to the simulation results with the modified swat for ysd under various drainage areas of ponds the corresponding values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated as shown in fig 2 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 2 1 η i increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds because of an increase in the amount of return flow captured by the ponds with an increase in the drainage area of ponds the increase in the return flow further resulted in an increase in the amount of the reused irrigation return flow consequently increasing the drainage area of ponds could be classified as a water saving approach that improved the reuse rate of return flow 2 both i e 0 and i e r increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds this was attributed to the fact that the total amount of irrigation water required for the crops remained unchanged therefore with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds more water can be captured by the ponds this causes an increase in the amount of irrigation water from local water sources correspondingly less irrigation water was required from the zhanghe reservoir in addition because the ie of the local water sources was higher than that of the zhanghe reservoir the overall ie was improved i e r was determined to be greater than i e 0 that was because according to eq 6 as long as there was the reuse of return flow i e η i 0 i e r was greater than i e 0 3 both w s p 0 and w s p r increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds according to eqs 7 and 8 increases in i e 0 and i e r will inevitably lead to increases in w s p 0 and w s p r in addition w s p 0 was determined to be smaller than w s p r under the water saving scenario with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds this indicated that the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential under this scenario the above results showed that increasing the drainage areas of ponds could enhance the reuse of return flow increase the ie values and save water for irrigation in order to increase the drainage areas of ponds in irrigation systems the managers of irrigation systems can take some measures such as constructing ponds and digging small ditches to divert return flow into ponds and the managers should decide whether or not to adopt these measures in real practice irrigation systems according to the amplification in i e r and the size of w s p r instead of i e 0 and w s p 0 under the traditional method 3 1 2 results and analysis under various traditional irrigation efficiencies according to the simulation results with the modified swat for ysd under various i e 02 values traditional ie for water from the zhanghe reservoir the corresponding values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r are shown in fig 3 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 3 1 η i decreased gradually with an increase in i e 02 this decrease was caused by the reduction in the water conveyance losses in the canal system with an increase in i e 02 which led to a reduction in the return flow η i became smaller because less irrigation return flow was reused in the field based on this trend an increase in i e 02 could be classified as a water saving approach that decreased the reuse rate of return flow 2 both i e 0 and i e r increased with an increase in i e 02 because the total amount of net irrigation requirement for the crops remained unchanged the reduction in the water conveyance losses in the canal system from the zhanghe reservoir to fields resulted in a smaller gross irrigation water use this further led to a higher irrigation efficiency in addition fig 3 showed that i e r was greater than i e 0 because of the reuse of return flow 3 both w s p 0 and w s p r increased gradually with an increase in i e 02 this trend was caused by increases in i e 0 and i e r as previously explained in addition w s p 0 was determined to be greater than w s p r under the water saving scenario with an increase in the traditional ie this result indicated that the traditional method overestimated the real water saving potential in this scenario as mentioned above it can be seen that an increase in i e 02 could increase the overall ie values and save water for irrigation some measures can be taken to improve the anti seep standards of the corresponding canals for increasing i e 02 such as lining irrigation canals and if the investment is enough using water pipelines instead of canals while increasing i e 02 would cut down on the reuse rate of return flow the managers of irrigation systems do not have to increase i e 02 much because the existence of the reuse of return flow can increase i e r together with the increase of i e 02 3 1 3 results and analysis under various irrigation modes during the analysis of the results under various irrigation modes the flood irrigation mode was used as the basis for calculating the water saving potentials of the two water saving irrigation modes fig 4 shows the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r under various irrigation modes as shown in fig 4 the η i values under two water saving irrigation modes namely the intermittent irrigation mode and thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode were higher than that under the flood irrigation mode this result indicated that water saving irrigation could be classified as a water saving approach that increased the reuse rate of return flow in addition both i e 0 and i e r were found to be higher under the water saving irrigation mode compared with the traditional flood irrigation mode therefore water saving potentials can be generated by replacing the traditional flood irrigation mode with water saving irrigation modes moreover η i was determined to be higher when the intermittent irrigation mode was used compared with the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode however the w s p 0 and w s p r of the intermittent irrigation mode were smaller than those of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode this is because replacing the flood irrigation mode with the water saving irrigation mode not only improved the η i value but also reduced the net irrigation water use required for the paddy rice furthermore the application of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode could reduce the net irrigation water requirement to a greater extent and therefore yield a larger water saving potential compared with the case where the intermittent irrigation mode was used fig 4 showed that w s p 0 was smaller than w s p r when the water saving irrigation modes were used in other words the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential under this scenario the above analysis indicated that the rice water saving irrigation modes could not only improve the reuse rate of return flow and ie values but also save water the managers of irrigation systems can carry out the rice water saving irrigation modes in the irrigation systems with paddy rice besides some water saving irrigation technologies like drip and sprinkle can be used for upland crops the micro irrigation systems save water mainly by reducing the loss of water delivery system and field irrigation requirement so the multi source auto irrigation module of the modified swat model can be used to reflect this situation which is through increasing the traditional ie of water sources and decreasing irrigation water amount in an irrigation application further the hydrological processes under corresponding scenarios can be simulated and the η i i e r and w s p r can be calculated which can assist them to decide whether to adopt these technologies or not 3 1 4 results and analysis under the comprehensive water saving scenario as shown in figs 2 4 the individual water saving scenarios with the highest water saving potentials include 1 the amplification of 50 in the drainage areas of ponds 2 i e 02 0 85 and 3 the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode therefore a comprehensive water saving scenario can be constructed by combining these three water saving scenarios the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r for the comprehensive water saving scenario were calculated based on the corresponding simulation results with the modified swat model and are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 η i became smaller under the comprehensive water saving scenario compared with the present scenario in other words the comprehensive water saving scenario could be classified as a water saving approach that reduced the reuse rate of return flow both i e 0 and i e r were determined to be higher under the comprehensive water saving scenario compared with the values obtained under the present scenario this indicated that there is high wsp under comprehensive water saving scenarios compared with the present scenario as shown in table 2 w s p 0 was greater than w s p r this suggested that the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential under the comprehensive water saving scenario furthermore when comparing the wsp given in table 2 with that obtained under the individual water saving scenarios it was determined that combining multiple water saving scenarios could yield a higher wsp therefore combining multiple water saving scenarios is most effective in reducing irrigation water use 3 1 5 results and analysis on the sub basin scale the abovementioned results were mainly on the whole watershed scale the results on the sub basin scale were also needed to be analyzed wu et al 2019b verified the water balance components of no 3 sub basin fig 1 so it was taken as a typical sub basin taking the scenarios of increasing drainage areas of ponds as examples and according to the simulation results with modified swat model the corresponding water amounts and indicators of no 3 sub basin were calculated as shown in table 3 the results showed that with the increase of drainage areas of ponds the reused irrigation return flow increased which made the gross irrigation water use decrease and η i increase in addition the ies and wsps increased and i e r was greater than i e 0 and w s p r was greater than w s p 0 combining the results and analysis on the whole ysd watershed scale it could be found that the change rules of indicators and relationships between them in the no 3 sub basin were same as that in the whole ysd watershed that is to say the results are correct and universally applicable for the scenarios of increasing drainage areas of ponds and similarly in other scenarios the results on the sub basin scale and whole watershed scale are consistent 3 2 relationship between the two water saving potentials and cause thereof based on the w s p 0 w s p r and η i values obtained under various water saving scenarios in section 3 1 it can be concluded that 1 increasing the drainage areas of ponds and using a water saving irrigation mode for rice were the water saving approaches that increased the reuse rate of the return flow for these approaches w s p 0 was smaller than w s p r suggesting that the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential 2 increasing i e 02 and integrating multiple water saving methods were water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow for these approaches w s p 0 was greater than w s p r which suggested that the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential in addition as shown in fig 4 the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode exhibited greater wsp than the intermittent irrigation mode the w s p 0 and w s p r of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode calculated on the basis of the intermittent irrigation mode were 1 054 900 m3 and 872 600 m3 respectively the η i of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode was smaller than that of the intermittent irrigation mode this also suggested that w s p 0 was greater than w s p r for the water saving approach that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow which was consistent with the previous conclusion furthermore a similar conclusion was also drawn by cui et al 2014 when analyzing the relationship between the two wsps in the liuyuankou irrigation system in north china therefore the above conclusions might be universal to further analyze the cause for the previously discussed relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r we substituted eq 6 into eq 8 and performed an additional analysis of the equation for calculating w s p r as follows 9 w s p r w n i e r b w n i e r a w n i e 0 1 η i b w n i e 0 1 η i a w n i e 0 b w n i e 0 a w n i e 0 η i b w n i e 0 η i a w s p 0 w n i e 0 η i b w n i e 0 η i a as shown in eq 9 w s p r is calculated by subtracting the water saving amount difference induced by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 for water saving approaches that maintain a constant w n such as increasing the drainage area of ponds or increasing the traditional ie the water saving amount difference is a positive if η i decreases after adopting the water saving approaches in this case w s p 0 is smaller than w s p r but if η i increases the result will be the opposite moreover for water saving approaches that reduce w n such as changing the irrigation mode for rice the water saving difference is determined by both w n and η i however the magnitude of the reduction in w n is usually quite small to ensure that the irrigation requirements of crops can be satisfied consequently the sign of the water saving amount difference is primarily determined by η i according to eq 9 and the above description the previously shown relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r is caused by the fact that w s p r is calculated by incorporating a water saving amount difference term induced by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 the traditional ie can usually be obtained from the management of the irrigation systems in this study we proposed a new method to calculate i e r and w s p r by accounting for the reuse of the return flow by combining the modified swat model proposed by wu et al 2019b for multi source irrigation systems and the calculation method for η i based on the simulation results with the modified swat model wu et al 2019a we established a comprehensive set of methods for calculating i e r and w s p r the proposed method can be used to accurately reflect the level of irrigation water management and evaluate the wsp in an irrigation system in addition the proposed method can be effectively used in real practice irrigation systems wang et al 2017 used bayesian multi model to project the water use efficiency of rice plantation region owing to the climate change meanwhile the modified swat model and the method in this study also can be used to project the i e r and w s p r under the climate change which can provide decision support for irrigation system managers to prevent negative effects caused by climate change and guide the direction of water saving reforming engineering as shown in eq 6 if the value of η i in an irrigation system can be obtained i e r can be calculated based on i e 0 although the calculation method for η i proposed by wu et al 2019a can be used in most irrigation systems it is difficult to use in the irrigation systems where detailed data is lacking therefore we can calculate the η i of multiple irrigation systems and give the range of η i or further establish a statistical model between η i and the characteristic parameters of irrigation systems such as terrain parameters crops planting structure meteorological parameters and so on in practical application the η i of another irrigation system can be estimated according to the abovementioned range or statistical model 4 conclusion in this study a new method for calculating the ie and wsp by considering the reuse of return flow was proposed a distributed hydrological model was set up for the ysd watershed based on the modified swat model after calibrating and validating the distributed hydrological model using the observed data sets it was used to simulate the hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios taking the dry year 2010 as an example the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated under various scenarios based on the simulation results with the modified swat model the results showed that 1 an increase in the drainage area of ponds resulted in increases in η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r 2 an increase in i e 02 traditional ie of water from the zhanghe reservoir resulted in a decrease in η i but increases in i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r 3 the water saving irrigation modes for rice exhibited significant wsp owing to their higher η i and irrigation efficiency compared with the flood irrigation mode 4 the two wsps of a comprehensive water saving scenario were greater than those of a single water saving scenario a comparison showed that i e r was greater than i e 0 provided that the reused return flow was nonzero a comparison and analysis of w s p 0 and w s p r indicated that for the water saving approaches that improved the reuse rate of the return flow such as increasing the drainage area of ponds or using a water saving irrigation mode for rice the traditional method underestimated the water saving potential for the water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow such as increasing the traditional irrigation efficiency the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential this was because the difference of water saving amount induced by the reuse of the return flow was included in the calculation for w s p r on the basis of w s p 0 and the difference can be either positive or negative in addition the abovementioned change rules of the indicators and relationships between them in a sub basin are same as that in the whole watershed which means that the results are correct and universal consequently this study systematically analyzed the relationship between i e 0 and i e r as well as that between w s p 0 and w s p r for the sake of accuracy the managers of irrigation systems should use i e r as the ie of the irrigation systems but not i e 0 and use w s p r instead of w s p 0 to evaluate the actual wsp after adopting one or more water saving approaches moreover further researches are needed for better using these indicators in reality such as simplifying the calculation of intermediate variables etc acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 51579184 we are grateful to the editor and

11019,irrigation efficiency ie and water saving potential wsp are two fundamental parameters for assessing water use and management in irrigation systems a new calculation method was proposed herein to accurately estimate the ie and wsp in irrigation systems the proposed method considers the reuse of return flow a modified soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios for the yangshudang ysd watershed within the zhanghe irrigation system zis in hubei province china the dry year of 2010 was chosen as a study case based on simulation results the traditional irrigation efficiency i e 0 and water saving potential w s p 0 as well as the irrigation efficiency taking into account the reuse of return flow i e r and water saving potential considering the reuse of return flow w s p r were calculated for various scenarios the relationships between the two ie indicators and the cause thereof as well as the two wsp values were analyzed and explored the results showed that both ie and wsp were improved with the enhancement of water saving as long as there was the reuse of return flow i e r must be greater than i e 0 moreover in terms of water saving approaches that improved the reuse rate of return flow w s p r was determined to be greater than w s p 0 thereby suggesting that the traditional method underestimated the wsp however for water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of return flow w s p r was determined to be less than w s p 0 which suggested that the traditional method overestimated the wsp the relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r was attributed to the fact that w s p r was calculated by subtracting the amount of the water saved by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 and this difference can be either positive or negative therefore the managers of irrigation systems should use i e r as the actual ie but not i e 0 and use w s p r instead of w s p 0 to evaluate the actual wsp keywords irrigation efficiency water saving potential modified swat reuse of return flow 1 introduction irrigation efficiency ie is an indicator that comprehensively reflects the efficiencies of irrigation projects water management and the irrigation technology at various scales it is an important basis for correctly evaluating the effective use degree of irrigation water and the development effect of water saving irrigation water saving potential wsp refers to the amount of water that can be conserved in an irrigation system by adopting one or more water saving approaches under certain socio economic conditions the correct calculation of wsp is of significance for guiding water saving reforming engineering in irrigation systems presently the effective use degree of irrigation water is evaluated by using the traditional ie i e 0 the difference between the gross irrigation water use before and after the application of water saving approaches is used to describe the wsp which is calculated based on the net irrigation requirement and i e 0 this value is also known as the water saving amount for irrigation water intake w s p 0 cui and xiong 2009 cui et al 2014 however i e 0 is calculated without considering the reuse of the return flow in irrigation systems therefore it cannot reflect the true effective use degree of irrigation water and the level of water management in irrigation systems moreover w s p 0 is not the true amount of water saved because the amount of water leaking into the deep ground and the amount returning to the surface are also considered to be savable in the calculation of w s p 0 however in reality a part of these return flows still remains in the water resource system and can be reused therefore this portion of return flows should not be counted as savable seckler 1996 indicated that water loss at the field scale might not amount to real loss because it may be reused on the larger scale he further indicated that misconceptions regarding ie can lead to erroneous estimation of wsp solomon and davidoff 1999 pointed out that the relationship between ie at the field scale and ie at the irrigation system or basin scale was not well understood and the complex relationship between these scales was attributed to the fact that the drainage water of one farmland may be used by another farmland i e there was the reuse of return flow li et al 2005 and cui et al 2007 analyzed the different wsps in the zhanghe irrigation system zis in hubei province china and determined that the wsp calculated based on water balance was much smaller than that calculated based on the i e 0 and net irrigation requirement blanke et al 2007 indicated that the adoption of water saving engineering methods and technology could be effective on a relatively small scale but was extremely costly and failed to save water because a vast majority of losses were reused therefore it is important to explore new calculation methods for ie and wsp by taking the reuse of return flow into account herein i e r is the irrigation efficiency with the reuse of return flow and w s p r is the water saving potential with reuse of the return flow considering these findings many researchers have proposed new methods for calculating ie and wsp by considering the reuse of the return flow from the perspective of water resource management in irrigation systems jensen 1977 keller and keller 1995 molden 1997 campadelli et al 2007 cui et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 although the rationality of the associated concepts and theories have been emphasized in these methods the application of these methods in real situations has been challenging owing to the difficulties associated with determining some of the water balance elements especially the return flow and its reused amount such difficulties have hindered the application of these methods to water management in irrigation systems therefore the difficulty in correctly evaluating the level of water management and water saving potential in the irrigation systems lies in proposing practical methods to estimate ie which consider the reuse of return flow and quantifying the return flow and its reused amount recently many studies have explored the process of quantifying the return flow and its reused amount zulu et al 1996 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 however most of these studies only emphasized the estimation of the quantity of return flow with limited consideration of the quantification of the reuse of the return flow apart from these difficulties it is too difficult and expensive to conduct experiments for calculating the return flow and its reused amount over large scale areas such as irrigation systems therefore modeling methods are suitable for these cases that involve large scale areas considering the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation systems a distributed hydrological model is the best choice for the estimation of the return flow and its reused amount consequently the development of a distributed hydrological model capable of describing hydrological processes in an irrigation system is the key to estimating the return flow and its reused amount wu et al 2019a 2019b modified the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 and proposed a new method for calculating the return flow and its reused amount in irrigation systems their method was based on the simulation results obtained from the modified swat model these studies notwithstanding there is little research on the relationship between w s p r and w s p 0 from the perspective of irrigation water management the managers of irrigation systems hope to obtain the accurate ie and wsp but at present i e 0 and w s p 0 do not take the reuse of return flow into account where i e 0 is underestimated and w s p 0 cannot represent the actual wsp which may lead the managers to make improper water saving measures and water management decisions i e r and w s p r take the reuse of return flow into account and can be used to evaluate actual wsp which can provide irrigation management decision support for the managers while the current methods proposed by predecessors to calculate them are difficult to be used in practice from what has been discussed above the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to define and propose a practical method for calculating i e r and w s p r for providing irrigation management decision support for the managers 2 to study the ysd watershed in the zis in hubei province china as a case we applied the new method to calculate the i e r and w s p r of ysd under various water saving scenarios additionally we calculated i e 0 and w s p 0 by using traditional methods 3 to analyze the change rules of i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r under various water saving scenarios and the relationships between them and the causes thereof 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation efficiency considering reuse of return flow 2 1 1 definitions of indicators a few definitions of the irrigation efficiency from different perspectives israelsen 1950 jensen 1977 guo 1997 liu et al 2011 huffman et al 2013 cui et al 2014 have been proposed during the past few decades i e 0 is the most widely used and is defined as follows 1 i e 0 w s w g where w s is the water applied to the soil root zone through irrigation m3 and w g is the gross irrigation water use i e the sum of water diverted from all different water sources for irrigation m3 guo 1997 huffman et al 2013 as shown in eq 1 i e 0 does not consider the impact of the reuse of return flow nevertheless the return flow and its reuse are common phenomena in any irrigation system to accurately reflect the irrigation water use efficiency assess the level of water management and calculate the wsp in an irrigation system in this study i e r is defined as follows 2 i e r w i w g w s w r u w g where w i is the water applied to the soil root zone through irrigation and the reuse of return flow m3 and w r u is the water applied to the soil root zone through the reuse of return flow m3 i e r considers the impact of the reuse of return flow not only from the water use terminal i e from the soil root zone but also from the water intake terminal i e from the water sources therefore i e r can also be defined as follows 3 i e r w s w n e w g w s w g w r where w n e w g is the gross irrigation water use that does not include the reused return flow m3 which is equal to w g minus the gross reused return flow in the irrigation system w r is the gross reused irrigation return flow m3 which is the return flow taken from drainage channels or ponds for irrigation in terms of the definition of i e r as shown in eq 2 the numerator and denominator simultaneously contain the reused return flow the numerator contains the net and the denominator contains the gross while as shown in eq 3 the numerator and denominator do not contain the reused return flow in other words the definition of i e r needs that both the numerator and denominator involve the reuse of return flow or neither compared with i e 0 the calculation of i e r considers the reuse of return flow for irrigation by adding the water applied to the soil root zone through the reuse of return flow in the numerator or by subtracting the gross reused return flow in the denominator to explore the relationship between i e 0 and i e r eq 2 is further represented as 4 i e r w i w g w s w r u w g w s w g w r u w g i e 0 w r w g w r u w r i e 0 η i η r where η r is the use rate of the irrigation return flow defined as the percentage of w r u in w r η i is the irrigation water reuse rate defined as the percentage of w r in w g eq 3 can be further expanded on the basis of the equal ratios theorem in mathematics as follows 5 i e r w s w n e w g w s w g w r w s w s w g w r w r w g w r w r w s i e r w r w g w r w r w s w g i e r w r w g i e 0 i e r w r w g i e 0 i e r η i 2 1 2 simplification of indicators as shown in eq 4 the calculation of i e r requires that i e 0 η i and η r should be known i e 0 can be calculated by monitoring the amount of water introduced at the head of the canal and the amount of water applied to the soil root zone alternatively it can be obtained from the management department of the irrigation system η i can be calculated by using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a based on the modified swat model but it is difficult to measure or estimate the value of η r here it is assumed that the effective use degree of w r is the same as that of w g that is to say η r i e r the equation for calculating i e r can be simplified by substituting this relationship into eq 4 6 i e r i e 0 1 η i as for eq 5 it can be transformed into eq 6 by equation transformation this demonstrates that the final equations for calculating the irrigation efficiency are the same when considering the reuse of return flow from the two different perspectives furthermore it can be seen from eq 6 that i e r is always greater than i e 0 as long as that there is the reuse of the return flow 2 2 methods for calculating the water saving potential in this study the focus is on the analysis of w s p 0 and w s p r the equation for calculating w s p 0 is as follows cui and liu 2015 7 w s p 0 w n i e 0 b w n i e 0 a where w n is the net irrigation requirement which is generally obtained by multiplying the net irrigation quota by the irrigated area m3 and it is different from w s that refers to the single use of irrigation water and excludes the reuse of return flow whereas w n includes the single use of irrigation water and the reuse of return flow which corresponds to the sum of w s and w r u the subscripts b and a represent before and after the application of the water saving approaches to calculate the wsp that accounts for the reuse of return flow it is necessary to replace i e 0 by i e r on the basis of eq 7 8 w s p r w n i e r b w n i e r a it can be seen that the main difference between the two wsps is attributed to the difference in the methods for calculating the ie the method used in eq 7 is referred to as the traditional method the method used in eq 8 accounts for the reuse of the return flow therefore the wsp calculated using eq 8 considers the change of the reused return flow after applying the water saving approaches and can better reflect the true water saving potential in an irrigation system 2 3 study area and model setup 2 3 1 study area the study area was the ysd watershed in the zis of the hubei province in china it is a relatively closed area of approximately 43 3 km2 the area is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis the first tributary canal of the third main canal and a small branch canal as shown in fig 1 wu et al 2019a the study area has a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm the mainland includes paddy fields dry lands forests and grasslands of which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil the study area cultivates crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed rice is the main irrigated crop and uses the intermittent irrigation mode 2 3 2 model setup according to eq 8 w n and i e r must be determined prior to calculating w s p r however eq 6 implies that η i must be obtained before calculating i e r for the whole irrigation system η i can be calculated by using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a which was based on the modified swat model wu et al 2019b the modified swat model allows for the simulation of hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios in this study a distributed hydrological model was set up for the study area based on the modified swat model and the η i was calculated using the method proposed by wu et al 2019a the study area was divided into 10 sub basins based on the digital elevation model dem data as shown in fig 1 in particular in terms of the ysd watershed the river channels as shown in fig 1 are mainly used as the actual drainage channels furthermore 105 hydrologic response units hrus were obtained according to the type of land use soil type distribution and slope division next a distributed hydrological model was established for the ysd watershed based on meteorological data and relevant parameters of ponds in addition the model was calibrated and validated using the observed discharge series in the ysd watershed outlet the observed evapotranspiration series and the irrigation water use from different water sources measured in the study area for the detailed modeling calibration and validation process and the associated results one can refer to the study by wu et al 2019b 2 4 setting up water saving scenarios to explore the change rules of w s p 0 and w s p r under various water saving scenarios the relationship between the two water saving potentials as well as the underlying causes of this relationship four different water saving scenarios were set up based on the characteristics of the study area 1 different drainage areas of ponds the change in the drainage areas of ponds was represented by the amplification in a fraction of the sub basin area that drains into ponds p n d f r there is a p n d f r for each sub basin based on the present scenario the amplification is 0 the amplifications were set as 10 20 30 40 and 50 2 different traditional irrigation efficiencies as far as the ysd watershed is concerned the main water sources include both the local water sources ponds and drainage channels and the zhanghe reservoir the canal system is rarely used for the local water sources however it is required for transporting water from the zhanghe reservoir to the fields therefore two different traditional ie values were set for the different water sources under the present scenario these values are i e 01 0 90 for the local water sources and i e 02 0 65 for the zhanghe reservoir the overall traditional ie is calculated as the weighted average based on the corresponding irrigation water use of the two water sources in particular the traditional ie associated with the zhanghe reservoir can be increased by improving the anti seep standards of the corresponding canals based on the present scenario i e 02 is 0 65 we gradually increased the traditional ie of zhanghe reservoir by 0 05 in other words i e 02 was set to be 0 70 0 75 0 80 and 0 85 3 different rice irrigation modes because the study area is a typical irrigation system with paddy rice three different irrigation modes were set for the irrigation system these included the flood irrigation mode intermittent irrigation mode and the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode the three critical water depths of paddy fields at different growing stages for these three irrigation modes namely the maximum fitting depth h max the minimum fitting depth h min and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p are shown in table 1 4 a comprehensive water saving scenario for each of the above mentioned three scenarios there exists a specific condition where the water saving potential is maximized therefore integrating the conditions with the maximum water saving potential associated with the three different scenarios will yield a comprehensive water saving scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 results and analysis of irrigation efficiency and water saving potential the hydrological processes under the present scenario and various water saving scenarios described in the preceding sections were simulated with the modified swat model of the study area we ranked the rainfall between 1973 and 2010 from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area to calculate the rainfall frequency we selected the dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 for the case study given that the difference between the new method proposed in this study and the traditional method is the consideration of the reuse of the return flow η i should be calculated under various water saving scenarios according to the simulation results moreover the corresponding values of i e 0 and i e r were also calculated according to the simulation results where i e 0 was calculated as the weighted average based on irrigation water use from the local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir as well as the corresponding i e 01 and i e 02 values i e r was calculated directly using eq 6 finally w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated using eqs 7 and 8 respectively 3 1 1 results and analysis under various drainage areas of ponds according to the simulation results with the modified swat for ysd under various drainage areas of ponds the corresponding values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated as shown in fig 2 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 2 1 η i increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds because of an increase in the amount of return flow captured by the ponds with an increase in the drainage area of ponds the increase in the return flow further resulted in an increase in the amount of the reused irrigation return flow consequently increasing the drainage area of ponds could be classified as a water saving approach that improved the reuse rate of return flow 2 both i e 0 and i e r increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds this was attributed to the fact that the total amount of irrigation water required for the crops remained unchanged therefore with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds more water can be captured by the ponds this causes an increase in the amount of irrigation water from local water sources correspondingly less irrigation water was required from the zhanghe reservoir in addition because the ie of the local water sources was higher than that of the zhanghe reservoir the overall ie was improved i e r was determined to be greater than i e 0 that was because according to eq 6 as long as there was the reuse of return flow i e η i 0 i e r was greater than i e 0 3 both w s p 0 and w s p r increased gradually with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds according to eqs 7 and 8 increases in i e 0 and i e r will inevitably lead to increases in w s p 0 and w s p r in addition w s p 0 was determined to be smaller than w s p r under the water saving scenario with an increase in the drainage areas of ponds this indicated that the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential under this scenario the above results showed that increasing the drainage areas of ponds could enhance the reuse of return flow increase the ie values and save water for irrigation in order to increase the drainage areas of ponds in irrigation systems the managers of irrigation systems can take some measures such as constructing ponds and digging small ditches to divert return flow into ponds and the managers should decide whether or not to adopt these measures in real practice irrigation systems according to the amplification in i e r and the size of w s p r instead of i e 0 and w s p 0 under the traditional method 3 1 2 results and analysis under various traditional irrigation efficiencies according to the simulation results with the modified swat for ysd under various i e 02 values traditional ie for water from the zhanghe reservoir the corresponding values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r are shown in fig 3 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 3 1 η i decreased gradually with an increase in i e 02 this decrease was caused by the reduction in the water conveyance losses in the canal system with an increase in i e 02 which led to a reduction in the return flow η i became smaller because less irrigation return flow was reused in the field based on this trend an increase in i e 02 could be classified as a water saving approach that decreased the reuse rate of return flow 2 both i e 0 and i e r increased with an increase in i e 02 because the total amount of net irrigation requirement for the crops remained unchanged the reduction in the water conveyance losses in the canal system from the zhanghe reservoir to fields resulted in a smaller gross irrigation water use this further led to a higher irrigation efficiency in addition fig 3 showed that i e r was greater than i e 0 because of the reuse of return flow 3 both w s p 0 and w s p r increased gradually with an increase in i e 02 this trend was caused by increases in i e 0 and i e r as previously explained in addition w s p 0 was determined to be greater than w s p r under the water saving scenario with an increase in the traditional ie this result indicated that the traditional method overestimated the real water saving potential in this scenario as mentioned above it can be seen that an increase in i e 02 could increase the overall ie values and save water for irrigation some measures can be taken to improve the anti seep standards of the corresponding canals for increasing i e 02 such as lining irrigation canals and if the investment is enough using water pipelines instead of canals while increasing i e 02 would cut down on the reuse rate of return flow the managers of irrigation systems do not have to increase i e 02 much because the existence of the reuse of return flow can increase i e r together with the increase of i e 02 3 1 3 results and analysis under various irrigation modes during the analysis of the results under various irrigation modes the flood irrigation mode was used as the basis for calculating the water saving potentials of the two water saving irrigation modes fig 4 shows the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r under various irrigation modes as shown in fig 4 the η i values under two water saving irrigation modes namely the intermittent irrigation mode and thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode were higher than that under the flood irrigation mode this result indicated that water saving irrigation could be classified as a water saving approach that increased the reuse rate of return flow in addition both i e 0 and i e r were found to be higher under the water saving irrigation mode compared with the traditional flood irrigation mode therefore water saving potentials can be generated by replacing the traditional flood irrigation mode with water saving irrigation modes moreover η i was determined to be higher when the intermittent irrigation mode was used compared with the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode however the w s p 0 and w s p r of the intermittent irrigation mode were smaller than those of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode this is because replacing the flood irrigation mode with the water saving irrigation mode not only improved the η i value but also reduced the net irrigation water use required for the paddy rice furthermore the application of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode could reduce the net irrigation water requirement to a greater extent and therefore yield a larger water saving potential compared with the case where the intermittent irrigation mode was used fig 4 showed that w s p 0 was smaller than w s p r when the water saving irrigation modes were used in other words the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential under this scenario the above analysis indicated that the rice water saving irrigation modes could not only improve the reuse rate of return flow and ie values but also save water the managers of irrigation systems can carry out the rice water saving irrigation modes in the irrigation systems with paddy rice besides some water saving irrigation technologies like drip and sprinkle can be used for upland crops the micro irrigation systems save water mainly by reducing the loss of water delivery system and field irrigation requirement so the multi source auto irrigation module of the modified swat model can be used to reflect this situation which is through increasing the traditional ie of water sources and decreasing irrigation water amount in an irrigation application further the hydrological processes under corresponding scenarios can be simulated and the η i i e r and w s p r can be calculated which can assist them to decide whether to adopt these technologies or not 3 1 4 results and analysis under the comprehensive water saving scenario as shown in figs 2 4 the individual water saving scenarios with the highest water saving potentials include 1 the amplification of 50 in the drainage areas of ponds 2 i e 02 0 85 and 3 the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode therefore a comprehensive water saving scenario can be constructed by combining these three water saving scenarios the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r for the comprehensive water saving scenario were calculated based on the corresponding simulation results with the modified swat model and are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 η i became smaller under the comprehensive water saving scenario compared with the present scenario in other words the comprehensive water saving scenario could be classified as a water saving approach that reduced the reuse rate of return flow both i e 0 and i e r were determined to be higher under the comprehensive water saving scenario compared with the values obtained under the present scenario this indicated that there is high wsp under comprehensive water saving scenarios compared with the present scenario as shown in table 2 w s p 0 was greater than w s p r this suggested that the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential under the comprehensive water saving scenario furthermore when comparing the wsp given in table 2 with that obtained under the individual water saving scenarios it was determined that combining multiple water saving scenarios could yield a higher wsp therefore combining multiple water saving scenarios is most effective in reducing irrigation water use 3 1 5 results and analysis on the sub basin scale the abovementioned results were mainly on the whole watershed scale the results on the sub basin scale were also needed to be analyzed wu et al 2019b verified the water balance components of no 3 sub basin fig 1 so it was taken as a typical sub basin taking the scenarios of increasing drainage areas of ponds as examples and according to the simulation results with modified swat model the corresponding water amounts and indicators of no 3 sub basin were calculated as shown in table 3 the results showed that with the increase of drainage areas of ponds the reused irrigation return flow increased which made the gross irrigation water use decrease and η i increase in addition the ies and wsps increased and i e r was greater than i e 0 and w s p r was greater than w s p 0 combining the results and analysis on the whole ysd watershed scale it could be found that the change rules of indicators and relationships between them in the no 3 sub basin were same as that in the whole ysd watershed that is to say the results are correct and universally applicable for the scenarios of increasing drainage areas of ponds and similarly in other scenarios the results on the sub basin scale and whole watershed scale are consistent 3 2 relationship between the two water saving potentials and cause thereof based on the w s p 0 w s p r and η i values obtained under various water saving scenarios in section 3 1 it can be concluded that 1 increasing the drainage areas of ponds and using a water saving irrigation mode for rice were the water saving approaches that increased the reuse rate of the return flow for these approaches w s p 0 was smaller than w s p r suggesting that the traditional method underestimated the real water saving potential 2 increasing i e 02 and integrating multiple water saving methods were water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow for these approaches w s p 0 was greater than w s p r which suggested that the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential in addition as shown in fig 4 the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode exhibited greater wsp than the intermittent irrigation mode the w s p 0 and w s p r of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode calculated on the basis of the intermittent irrigation mode were 1 054 900 m3 and 872 600 m3 respectively the η i of the thin shallow wet dry irrigation mode was smaller than that of the intermittent irrigation mode this also suggested that w s p 0 was greater than w s p r for the water saving approach that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow which was consistent with the previous conclusion furthermore a similar conclusion was also drawn by cui et al 2014 when analyzing the relationship between the two wsps in the liuyuankou irrigation system in north china therefore the above conclusions might be universal to further analyze the cause for the previously discussed relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r we substituted eq 6 into eq 8 and performed an additional analysis of the equation for calculating w s p r as follows 9 w s p r w n i e r b w n i e r a w n i e 0 1 η i b w n i e 0 1 η i a w n i e 0 b w n i e 0 a w n i e 0 η i b w n i e 0 η i a w s p 0 w n i e 0 η i b w n i e 0 η i a as shown in eq 9 w s p r is calculated by subtracting the water saving amount difference induced by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 for water saving approaches that maintain a constant w n such as increasing the drainage area of ponds or increasing the traditional ie the water saving amount difference is a positive if η i decreases after adopting the water saving approaches in this case w s p 0 is smaller than w s p r but if η i increases the result will be the opposite moreover for water saving approaches that reduce w n such as changing the irrigation mode for rice the water saving difference is determined by both w n and η i however the magnitude of the reduction in w n is usually quite small to ensure that the irrigation requirements of crops can be satisfied consequently the sign of the water saving amount difference is primarily determined by η i according to eq 9 and the above description the previously shown relationship between w s p 0 and w s p r is caused by the fact that w s p r is calculated by incorporating a water saving amount difference term induced by the reuse of return flow on the basis of w s p 0 the traditional ie can usually be obtained from the management of the irrigation systems in this study we proposed a new method to calculate i e r and w s p r by accounting for the reuse of the return flow by combining the modified swat model proposed by wu et al 2019b for multi source irrigation systems and the calculation method for η i based on the simulation results with the modified swat model wu et al 2019a we established a comprehensive set of methods for calculating i e r and w s p r the proposed method can be used to accurately reflect the level of irrigation water management and evaluate the wsp in an irrigation system in addition the proposed method can be effectively used in real practice irrigation systems wang et al 2017 used bayesian multi model to project the water use efficiency of rice plantation region owing to the climate change meanwhile the modified swat model and the method in this study also can be used to project the i e r and w s p r under the climate change which can provide decision support for irrigation system managers to prevent negative effects caused by climate change and guide the direction of water saving reforming engineering as shown in eq 6 if the value of η i in an irrigation system can be obtained i e r can be calculated based on i e 0 although the calculation method for η i proposed by wu et al 2019a can be used in most irrigation systems it is difficult to use in the irrigation systems where detailed data is lacking therefore we can calculate the η i of multiple irrigation systems and give the range of η i or further establish a statistical model between η i and the characteristic parameters of irrigation systems such as terrain parameters crops planting structure meteorological parameters and so on in practical application the η i of another irrigation system can be estimated according to the abovementioned range or statistical model 4 conclusion in this study a new method for calculating the ie and wsp by considering the reuse of return flow was proposed a distributed hydrological model was set up for the ysd watershed based on the modified swat model after calibrating and validating the distributed hydrological model using the observed data sets it was used to simulate the hydrological processes under various water saving scenarios taking the dry year 2010 as an example the values of η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r were calculated under various scenarios based on the simulation results with the modified swat model the results showed that 1 an increase in the drainage area of ponds resulted in increases in η i i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r 2 an increase in i e 02 traditional ie of water from the zhanghe reservoir resulted in a decrease in η i but increases in i e 0 i e r w s p 0 and w s p r 3 the water saving irrigation modes for rice exhibited significant wsp owing to their higher η i and irrigation efficiency compared with the flood irrigation mode 4 the two wsps of a comprehensive water saving scenario were greater than those of a single water saving scenario a comparison showed that i e r was greater than i e 0 provided that the reused return flow was nonzero a comparison and analysis of w s p 0 and w s p r indicated that for the water saving approaches that improved the reuse rate of the return flow such as increasing the drainage area of ponds or using a water saving irrigation mode for rice the traditional method underestimated the water saving potential for the water saving approaches that reduced the reuse rate of the return flow such as increasing the traditional irrigation efficiency the traditional method overestimated the water saving potential this was because the difference of water saving amount induced by the reuse of the return flow was included in the calculation for w s p r on the basis of w s p 0 and the difference can be either positive or negative in addition the abovementioned change rules of the indicators and relationships between them in a sub basin are same as that in the whole watershed which means that the results are correct and universal consequently this study systematically analyzed the relationship between i e 0 and i e r as well as that between w s p 0 and w s p r for the sake of accuracy the managers of irrigation systems should use i e r as the ie of the irrigation systems but not i e 0 and use w s p r instead of w s p 0 to evaluate the actual wsp after adopting one or more water saving approaches moreover further researches are needed for better using these indicators in reality such as simplifying the calculation of intermediate variables etc acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 51579184 we are grateful to the editor and
