abdulmotaleb 2017 heppel 2015 chapin et al 2015 for their high performances in terms of total encountered resistance dynamic stability and immunity to waves interference phenomena the high performances are the result of favorable cruising heights above the sea level which lead to a considerable decrease of hull s total wet surface good stability to external disturbances is the result of good designing of lifting surfaces but sometimes this could be at the expense of penalties in terms of handling qualities and or hydrodynamic performances deng et al 2014 heppel 2015 in real sea conditions waves and external disturbances vary along with many factors including yacht speed encounter direction of waves and sea state the system of forces acting on a basic flying yacht hull during its motion could be summarized into four main components the lift which is composed by the sum of all the hydrodynamic forces resulting from the relative motion and the hydrostatic buoyancy forces of the lifting surfaces the total weight of the yacht the thrust produced by propellers or sails and the total encountered resistance the latter could be further decomposed into several different components being related to friction cross sectional area of the lifting surfaces transverse three dimensional effects wakes interference phenomena and sea water conditions kleijweg 2016 when active control is used for dynamics augmentation additional control force components are present in the equations of motion which are those needed for the deflection of the lifting surfaces the maximum value of the control forces and the related change rates are both constrained by limited capability of the actuators and machinery limitations this being a primary factor that certainly affects the choice of the control method wang et al 2016 conventional controllers such as pids have been widely adopted hickey et al 1999 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2007 to cope with dynamics augmentation and stabilization for ships and crafts although these controllers do not belong to the optimal control category athans 1971 van amerongen et al 1990 wang et al 2016 bagassi et al 2009 they are used due to readiness in theoretical analysis and implementation the basic concept relying only on the response of a measured system variable and not on a mathematical knowledge of the system itself ang et al 2005 however the pid algorithm does not guarantee an intrinsic control stability and loop tuning gain scheduling operations are necessary when uncertain parameters or severe nonlinearities are present in the dynamic system gao et al 2007 to predict overall performances in terms of stability encountered resistance handling qualities and dynamic behavior now available codes and models find application over a wide range of complexity and accuracy which extends from complete unsteady three dimensional numerical codes chapin et al 2015 filippas and belibassakis 2013 wackers et al 2017 bakhtiari et al 2016 çakici et al 2015 to quick simple lumped parameters models heppel 2015 gao et al 2007 fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 savitsky 1964 in the numerical field for example chapin et al 2015 performed a numerical investigation on a two elements wingsail for high performance multihull yachts the study is based on a computational cfd evaluation of the flow around the wingsail by resolving navier stokes equations unsteady modeling is also used to characterize the stall behavior and give good understanding of the flow physics that may occur in such configurations infilippas and belibassakis 2013 filippas etal developed an unsteady boundary element method which is applied to the analysis of oscillating non lifting bodies and flapping hydrofoils operating beneath the free surface and in the presence of incident waves numerical results include the lift and thrust coefficients of the system over a range of motion parameters such as reduced frequency and strouhal number fu 2012 used the numerical flow analysis nfa to model breaking waves around a ship including both plunging and spilling breaking waves the formation of spray and the entrainment of air nfa solves the navier stokes equations utilizing a cut cell cartesian grid formulation with interface capturing to model the unsteady flow of air and water around moving bodies a panellized surface representation of the ship hull is required as input in terms of body geometry and domain decomposition is used to distribute portions of the grid over a large number of processors hpc although recent numerical codes filippas and belibassakis 2013 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 and computational methods cfd fvm and nfa chapin et al 2015 bakhtiari et al 2016 duman et al 2017 fu 2012 are able to describe complex three dimensional hydrodynamic fields and unsteady motions they still require large computational resources and time consuming in terms of geometry preparation mesh grid generation and or computational domain distribution processes from the first half of the twentieth century onwards various yacht dynamic systems have been studied through the use of simple analytical models fossati and muggiasca 2012 used a simple lumped parameters model with the aim to reproduce unsteady sail aerodynamics taking into account three dimensional effects and unsteady mainsail jib interaction in this study the hull of the yacht is modeled as a single point mass constrained to move on a surface governed by the equations of wave motion in matveev 2012 a method of hydrodynamic discrete sources is applied for two dimensional modeling of stepped planing surfaces the water surface deformations wetted hull lengths and pressure distribution are also included in the formulation previous published works wang et al 2016 heppel 2015 gao et al 2007 also explored the application of classic and modern control theory to passive and active stability of both propelled and sailing foilers inheppel 2015 for example the classic methods of flight dynamics are applied to the passive stability of a specific modern high performance sailing foiler the whole system is returned to a six degrees of freedom dof point and the equations of motion are solved in the frequency domain good insight is gained by extracting the natural modes and frequencies from the linearization of the equations inwang et al 2016 the sailing performances of a twin hull s swath vehicle in waves are investigated in this study a flapping foil stabilizer is proposed to enhance the seakeeping advantages of the vehicle in rough waves a vertical plane motion control model is built and the unsteady hydrodynamic characteristics of the flapping foil stabilizer are also investigated ingao et al 2007 an adapted water jet propulsion based on pid control is implemented in a high speed slid ship model to obtain active control on heave pitch modes and dynamic instabilities at the high speed ranges in contrast to the now available cfd nfa and numerical codes simple lumped parameters models are still largely used due to their simplicity and quickness although their inaccuracy and limited range of application savitsky 1964 piancastelli et al 2014 2015a axiomatic assumptions and restrictions are intrinsic in the use of this type of models lumped parameters formulation is not suitable for capturing complex three dimensional phenomena such as free water surface deformation and wakes propagation interaction involved in a system of lifting surfaces during unsteady motion from the point of view of active control low degrees of freedom models give poor insight into unsteadiness of coupled dynamic modes and control forces heppel 2015 wang et al 2016 gao et al 2007 leaving out also other basic aspects of interest such as minimum control speed regimes and relative deviation errors from desired states when finite time evolutions are involved different extensions filippas and belibassakis 2013 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 are indeed necessary to take into account such aspects leading thus to more rigorous and complex formulations in view of this the main outcome of the present work is to investigate on the existence of an active pid control scheme for a specific engine propelled yacht hull which is able to return dynamics augmentation and superior seakeeping characteristics through the control of six foiling maneuvering appendages over a specified range of cruising speeds propulsion power and sea water conditions in particular it is authors goal to conduct a numerical investigation on the minimum cruising speed ranges and control force gains which are necessary to obtain satisfying control hydrodynamic performances for the sake of this the lumped parameters model presented inamoroso et al 2018 is extended to a multi lifting surface system in conjunction with a pid control loop feedback scheme in the next section the physical and mathematical model of the problem will be developed and particularized to the test flying yacht hull due to lack of ad hoc experimental data and or measurements numerical cfd simulations of the test yacht were conducted the results being collected and implemented in the present formulation it is shown that the present formulation is able to well capture dynamics and seakeeping performances of the augmented flying yacht system the results of the model being in good agreement with the cfd numerical measurements over the specified range of cruising speeds 2 physical model and assumptions in the present work an extension of the lumped parameters model presented inamoroso et al 2018 is developed and used in order to capture the main dynamic effects of a pid control system on a specific high speed flying yacht hull fig 1 for a given set of parametric quantities and initial conditions to be in line with the authors goals main effects of interest could be stability augmentation seakeeping performances and unsteady rigid body dynamics both in calm and rough water conditions the yacht dynamic system is returned to a six degrees of freedom point g of weight mg whose three linear and angular displacement variables are unknowns of the problem each foiling and maneuvering appendage is in turn returned to a six degrees of freedom point f i of weight m i g whose three linear and angular displacement variables are also unknowns of the problem in the present paper the rotation around the leading edge of each foiling and maneuvering appendage will be considered only the remaining degrees of freedom being considered fixed with respect to the g x b y b z b frame of reference furthermore yacht pitching and rolling dynamic modes will be mostly affected by exercising controlled torque around the leading edge of four j type foils placed almost symmetrically with respect to the center of gravity g whereas two aft vertical rudders will be used for yawing modes control figs 1 and 3 each ith component of the yacht system has a local frame of reference a i x a i y a i z a i placed at the middle point a i of the respective trailing edge and is treated as a rigid croccolo et al 2015 degidi et al 2016 lifting surface of finite thickness span entirely characterized by its overall dimensions l i b i h i hydrostatic parameters c b i c x i c y i c z i and

tuveri et al 2014 are first estimated through the use of numerical cfd evaluations then space time averaged and implicitly treated in the physical model by augmentation of basic hydrodynamic coefficients the space time average process leads to hydrodynamic parameters which are unique for each component of the yacht system but constant both in space and time load lift resistance and thrust are treated as integrated quantities and concentrated forces acting on their respective application point as depicted in fig 1 3 mathematical formulation when all the components of the yacht system and the initial conditions of the problem are defined the present model utilizes basic unsteady motion and hydrodynamic equations to predict the temporal evolution of all state variables and related output quantities for a given thrust load and center of gravity location the general unsteady motion equations of a rigid body in the three directions and rotations are written with respect to a reference frame which is positioned on the center of gravity of the whole dynamic system and which is stationary with respect to it this is the g fixed frame of reference g x b y b z b where not specified signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in fig 1 with respect to the g x b y b z b reference frame the unsteady equilibrium equations in the three directions and rotations could be written as 1 t r s p m d v d t ϖ ω v 2 m i d ω d t ϖ ω i ω where 3 m i xt b i t i xd b i r i xb b i s 4 t i r δ

and low camber sections a i f i varies its position along the chord of the hydrofoil the excursion range depending both on the relative incidence of the surface and its wetted length this excursion will be further discussed in the next 3 3 section in the present study the moment equilibrium equations will be applied to the case of a flying yacht with x b z b as a plane of symmetry and x b y b z b as principal axes for convenience it is useful to write the whole system of equations in the state form by introducing an extra set of six cinematic equations in both linear and angular directions this leads to a single set of twelve differential equations of the 1st order in the state variables v x v y v z ϕ b θ b ψ b p b q b r b x e y e z e this extra set of equations could be constructed through the use of the following cinematic relationships 15 d d t ϕ b θ b ψ b r ϕ b θ b ψ b ω 16 d d t x e y e z e r ϕ b θ b ψ b t v which have been written in a convenient way by introducing an

system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 and 16 has twelve unknown state variables which are herein evaluated numerically by an explicit time integration scheme based on the runge kutta method for solving initial value problems the reader is referred toizzo 2017 for further information about the method before proceeding with the integration of the equations the problem must be closed by adding explicit formulas for the hydrodynamic coefficients the water air medium properties and the pid control system 3 1 hydrodynamic lift the lift acting on a lifting surface could be separated into two distinct components the dynamic reaction of the fluid against the moving surface and the static buoyant contribution of the displaced volume under the free water surface the dynamic lift component has different behaviors depending on cruising speed and or froud number range savitsky 1964 at lower speed regimes the dynamic lift component is order of magnitude smaller than the buoyant component as speeds are increased transition or planing regime may occur savitsky 2014 1964 and the dynamic lift component could be the same order or greater than the static one from the classic aerodynamic theory kats and plotkin 1991 it is known that for lifting surfaces of finite aspect ratio the lift force coefficient could be expressed as a function of the relative incidence in the following form 21 c l α i l i b i 2 π 1 2 l i b i b i 2 ξ i α i α o i the related lift forces being 22 l i 1 2 ρ i u i 2 v i 2 w i 2 c z i l i b i c l α i l i b i for the z a i direction and 23 c i 1 2 ρ i u i 2 v i 2 w i 2 c y i l i h i c l β i l i h i for the y a i direction the parametric quantity ξ i in eq 21 has been introduced to take into account three dimensional and free water surface effects which are related to the real form of the ith lifting appendage allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 in this work the value of ξ i will be arbitrarily chosen and assigned to each component of the yacht system in order to obtain good agreement with the available cfd numerical data 3 2 hydrodynamic drag the total encountered resistance acting on a lifting surface during its motion in water could be decomposed into several different components which are related to friction cross sectional area of the surface transverse three dimensional effects wake profile and sea water conditions in this study the total hydrodynamic drag force acting on a lifting surface is decomposed into four main components namely frictional form induced and residuary resistance the first three components are treated explicitly through the use of semi empirical formulas kats and plotkin 1991 kleijweg 2016 while the last residuary term is treated implicitly in the formulation through the use of a correction factor ξ i and corrected hydrodynamic coefficients c d x i c d y i c d z i cfd simulations have been conducted and used in the present paper in order to give an estimation of the correction parameters within the speed range of interest with respect to the local frame of reference a i x a i y a i z a i the frictional form and induced resistance components for the ith lifting surface could be respectively evaluated through the use of the following expressions kleijweg 2016 kats and plotkin 1991 24 x f i y f i z f i ρ i u i 2 c f ρ i μ i u i l i c z i l i b i c y i l i h i ρ i v i 2 c f ρ i μ i v i b i

i b i c d z i 26 d i 1 2 ρ i u i 2 v i 2 w i 2 c z i l i b i c z i l i b i π b i 2 c l 2 where c f is the friction coefficient calculated with the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line ittc 2011 and the hydrodynamic coefficients c d x i c d y i c d z i are replaced by their averaged value obtained through cfd computations within the analyzed speed range 3 3 center of pressure it is shown insavitsky 1964 and savitsky and ward 1954 that the longitudinal position of the center of pressure of planing surfaces could be evaluated by separating the hydrodynamic lift contribute from the hydrostatic one the center of pressure of the dynamic lift component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom of conventional planing surfaces on the other hand the longitudinal position of the application point of the buoyancy force is found to be nearly constant at the 33 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical expression for the total center of pressure excursion 27 c p i 0 75 1 5 21 u i g l w i 2 b w i l w i 2 39 where c p i is the ratio of the longitudinal distance from the transom to the center of pressure divided by the wetted length l w i in the present paper the application point of the buoyancy force component is calculated through the geometric centroid of the displaced volume γ i under the free surface level while the hydrodynamic force component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the wetted length l w i according to eq 27 3 4 multiphase model the present formulation is based on a multiphase model which is used to compute the hydrodynamic forces acting on all the lifting surfaces of the analyzed yacht system medium properties such as mass density and dynamic viscosity are treated as integrated quantities over each lifting surface and are functions of the position of the application point where the hydrodynamic forces act with reference to fig 2 and for the ith lifting surface of the yacht the mass density and dynamic viscosity properties of the water air medium could be written as 28 ρ i γ i ρ w 1 γ i ρ a μ

function δ i δ φ i δ α i δ β i is the deflection vector of the ith lifting surface and ξ x is the wave elevation which will be discussed in the next section 3 5 rough water model this section extents the above mathematical formulation to the case of yacht motion in rough water conditions in the present study rough water conditions are simulated through the use of regular basic ocean waves salmon 2015 moving in the x e direction at the phase speed c w the velocity field w e w x x y z w y x y z w z x y z associated with this type of waves could be described salmon 2015 by the following scalar components which are written with respect to the earth fixed reference frame e x e y e z e and for a single wave of frequency ω w 36 w x w y w z a w 2 ω w c o s h 2 π λ w h w z s i n h 2 π λ w h w c o s 2 π λ w x ω w t 0 a w 2 ω w s i n h 2 π λ w h w z s i n h 2 π λ w h w s i n 2 π λ w x ω w t where 37 ω w g 2 π λ w t a n h 2 π λ w h w is the wave frequency for a fixed ocean depth h w the two parameters λ w and a w are respectively the wavelength and the height of the wave it is shown salmon 2015 that the free water surface elevation associated with the velocity field of eq 36 could be approximated through the use of the following harmonic function 38 ξ x a w 2 ω w c o s 2 π λ w x ω w t this being equivalent to considering sinusoidal wave profiles instead of those obtained by direct integration of eq 36 moreover it is assumed here that there is no slip velocity and or boundary layer thickness at the water air interface this being considered of zero thickness and placed at the wave elevation ξ x 3 6 yacht control and pid closed loop feedback scheme this section of the paper presents the synthesis and the mathematical aspects of the pid control scheme which has been implemented in the analyzed flying yacht model in this study a state x t will be considered controlled if the relation 39 m a x x t x d x d ε o is satisfied for all t δ t where ε o is an arbitrary deviation error from the desired state x d and δ t is the minimum time of dynamic evolution which is necessary to reach steady conditions starting from an initial state x o due to the fact that the desired states are reached through the use of foiling and maneuvering appendages relative high speed regimes are necessary to make lifting surfaces effective in particular it is authors interest to conduct numerical investigation over a specified speed range where the relation 40 i l i m g is satisfied for all t δ t it has to be underlined here that the total lift force included in the present mathematical formulation could generally exceed the total weight force of the yacht this is especially true when either unsteady transitional regimes or motions out of symmetry plane are involved in both cases the inertial terms of the r h s of eq 1 become explicit in eq 40 equating the two sides of eq 40 and substituting eq 22 in eq 40 it follows that a minimum cruising speed of 41 v m i n mg i 1 2 ρ i c z i l i b i c l δ m a x is a necessary condition for the yacht to obtain both foiling and control δ m a x being the maximum allowed deflection of the appendages before hydrodynamic stall and or cavitation insurgence abbott and doenhoff 1959 astolfi and bot 2015 chapin et al 2015 in the present formulation a saturation threshold for all the angular displacement variables δ i has been introduced when lifting surfaces are controlled by the pid control system maximum deflections being limited according to the relation 42 δ i f δ i where f is a clip function which is here defined as 43 f δ i δ i u δ i δ m a x 1 u δ i δ m a x δ m a x u δ i δ m a x δ m a x 1 u δ i δ m a x and u is the unit step function this implies that the angular deflections δ i are not allowed to exceed the value δ m a x whatever the amplitude of the control forces is as already mentioned above before proceeding with the integration of the 6 dof system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 and 16 the problem must be closed by adding extra dofs for all foiling maneuvering appendages and explicit formulas for pid control with reference to fig 3 the deflections δ α i of the four foiling appendages are herein used to control the pitching and rolling dynamic modes of the flying yacht whereas the δ β i deflections of the two maneuvering appendages are used to control the dynamic yawing modes it has to be underlined that in the analyzed flying yacht model there is no relative motion between the maneuvering appendages and the aft propellers the thrust vector t i being fixed to the x a i axis for i equal to rud1 and rud2 in the present paper each foiling and maneuvering appendage is returned to a dynamic subsystem of mass m i spring constant k i and damping factor c i all parameters being collected in their respective diagonal matrices m δ k δ and c δ the angular displacement variables δ δ α f o i l 1 δ α f o i l 2 δ α f o i l 3 δ α f o i l 4 δ β r u d 1 δ β r u d 2 are the extra dofs to be added in the yacht system with respect to the ith local reference frame a i x a i y a i z a i the unsteady equilibrium equations in both z a i foiling and y a i maneuvering directions could be written for all the appendages and collected as follows 44 m δ r δ δ c δ r δ δ k δ r δ δ g δ f δ z i y i where r δ a i f i 1 is the application point of the hydrodynamic forces z i y i f δ is the vector of the control forces and g δ is a dimensionless global gain for the pid control system for the control loop feedback scheme ang et al 2005 of fig 4 the overall control function could be expressed in time domain as 45 f δ k p x δ x d k d x δ x d k i 0 t x δ x d d t where x δ is the vector of the state variables which must be controlled and x d is the final desired state it has to be underlined here that the derivative action in eq 45 is ideal i e not casual and improves settling time and stability of the system by predicting its behavior hence an approximation of the overall pid control function might indeed be necessary in the present paper the following discrete form of eq 45 will be implemented 46 f δ k p x δ x d k d δ x δ x d δ t k i δ x δ x d where 47 δ x t δ t x t x t δ t n δ t n 48 δ x t i 1 n x t i δ t n δ t n are the discrete forms of the derivative and integral operators respectively in eqs 47 and 48 the quantity n is the number of iteration steps or subdivisions within the 1st computation cycle which will be discussed in the next section furthermore the state variables ϕ b θ b ψ b and z e will be the components of the controlled state vector x δ from a practical point of view it has to be underlined here that while the three rotational state variables could be ready to be measured providing gyroscope sensors the linear state variable z e is not directly measurable and must be read or estimated indirectly from a physical point of view if the difference x δ x d is not zero due to the fact that external disturbances are present during the motion of the yacht control forces must deflect the foiling maneuvering appendages accordingly in order to counteract the external disturbances and minimize the deviation from the desired state where not specified the signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in figs 1 3 hence for the case of longitudinal stability control if a positive trim angle error is present a negative pitching moment must be exerted on the yacht to minimize the error the respective deflections of the fore aft foiling appendages being opposite in sign

performed until yacht dynamic response returns satisfying control qualities within both the time interval δ t and the speed range of interest once the control criteria eq 39 are met all the parameters are collected in the respective gain matrices and used in the numerical evaluations 4 numerical evaluations to perform a parametric study of the foregoing unsteady equations of motion the numerical scheme presented inamoroso et al 2018 will be implemented in the present work the numerical scheme is based on two computation cycles of n and n iteration steps respectively a total evolution time δ t is chosen a priori this interval time must be large enough to ensure that the solution reaches steady state conditions in the present study a total evolution time of 25s was found to be sufficient large to yield steady calculations at all the cruising speed values during each step of the two cycles the 6 4 dofs system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 16 and 44 is solved numerically by explicit time integration based on the runge kutta method izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 a dynamic controlled time step size is used in this method and the reader could find more specific information about the solution control and stability inizzo 2017 gear 1971 and forsythe et al 1977 the solution of the unsteady hydrodynamic problem is first calculated n times in the 1st cycle at the end of each step i e when the dynamic response of the system covers the total interval of time δ t n input parameters are updated following a 1st cycle scheduled table of values the 1st computation cycle ends as soon as the total evolution time δ t is fully covered subsequently the same procedure applies to the 2nd cycle with n iteration steps input parameters being updated following a 2nd cycle scheduled table of values at the end of each cycle a vector of the desired output variables is stored for post processing operations the solution of the problem is calculated a total of n x n times in the present study while the 1st computation cycle is used for explicit time integration of the system solution the 2nd computation cycle is used to conduct parametric studies on the dynamic response of the system itself an averaged number of n 10000 subdivisions for the temporal evolution δ t was found to be sufficient large to reach solution convergence and capture yacht dynamics in a satisfactory manner the 2nd cycle iteration steps varying according to the parametric studies requirements 5 validation to establish the reliability of the present mathematical model a validation analysis is performed validation analysis consists of a qualitative comparison between the results obtained with the present formulation and available cfd numerical data numerical resistance trim and elevation measurements at control open loop conditions with motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry are selected for the validation of the present results the validation is performed for a particular test flying yacht model fig 3 and within a specific cruising speed range i e from 20 knts up to 50 knts results for variables outside the validation range are also shown and are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation overall dimensions and parameters of each component of the yacht model are listed in table1 for convenience standard naca series sections abbott and doenhoff 1959 have been used here for all the lifting surfaces in particular naca 4412 and naca 0012 for foiling and maneuvering appendages respectively for this type of foil sections a value of δ m a x 12 has been chosen as a maximum allowed deflection in order to avoid non linearities hydrodynamic stall and or cavitation insurgence abbott and doenhoff 1959 astolfi and bot 2015 chapin et al 2015 steady mean values for the hydrodynamic coefficients of each component of the test yacht are estimated using ranse method bakhtiari et al 2016 chapin et al 2015 with single phase model and static mesh scheme wackers et al 2017 piancastelli et al 2015b hydrodynamic performances of the yacht system at foiling mode with in plane motion are estimated with both multiphase vof model and dynamic mesh scheme hirt and nichols 1981 sieber and schäfer 2001 in all the cfd computations the standard k ε model bakhtiari et al 2016 has been implemented for modeling the turbulence of the flow test conditions of present formulation are set according to the cfd numerical measurements and for the same flying yacht model where it is not specified the test model is considered at rest conditions when t 0 s the steady output quantities being collected after a time interval of δ t moreover the two aft thrust vectors are fixed in magnitude during each temporal evolution the quantity t m a x following a scheduled table of values according to the yacht cruising speed requirements the yacht system presented and analyzed in this paper showed motion instabilities gao et al 2007 in pitch heave dynamic modes for a cruising speed range of v x 35 kts and for deflections of δ α i 6 in test conditions all lifting surfaces are locked at their nominal incidences which are chosen so that 55 δ α i 0 i f v x 35 kts δ α m a x 6 o t h e r w i s e t 0 56 δ β i 0 i n p l a n e m o t i o n 2 o t h e r w i s e t 0 in order to avoid the motion instabilities it has to be underlined here that δ α m a x and δ m a x are actually two different values of maximum allowed deflections which are related to each other through the trim attitude of the yacht system and the hydrodynamic incidence of the lifting surfaces in the following manner 57 δ m a x δ α m a x θ b m a x α i m a x fig 5 shows a comparison between cfd numerical measurements and results obtained with the present model although its basis on lumped parameters and simplifying assumptions the model has shown good agreement with the results the corresponding comparison errors being between 1 5 and 33 percent for the output quantities within the specific speed range as reported in figure the trends in the yacht total resistance trim and heave curves are well captured by present formulation showing good qualitative quantitative agreement between cfd measurements and present results a better estimation could be sought for the trim angle θ b which is the state variable most affected by three dimensional effects such as free water surface deformation and wakes interference phenomena when the froude number of the yacht hull lies below its critical value savitsky and gore 1979 of 0 4 i e v x 9 kts the bulk of the yacht weight is mostly supported by the hydrostatic buoyancy of the hull almeter 1993 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 in this low speed regime the hydrodynamic forces acting on all the lifting surfaces of the yacht including the hull are too low to return either planing or foiling conditions for the present test yacht model it has been found indeed that a minimum cruising speed of v m i n δ m a x 20 kts eq 41 is necessary to obtain foiling conditions which is more than twice the critical speed value of the yacht hull this could also be verified from fig 5 where considerable yacht elevations z e are reached only after v x 20 kts within the mid speed range 9 kts v x 20 kts planing regime occurs the yacht being still largely supported by the hydrodynamic forces acting on its hull in this speed range variations of the state variable z e are also effect of yacht rotation and trimming attitudes θ b hence for the whole speed range 0 kts v x 20 kts the approach discussed inamoroso et al 2018 could be more suitable to give a better approximation of the reached steady states if sought moreover it has to be underlined that the parametric quantity ξ i of eq 21 has been chosen ad hoc and arbitrarily for the specific flying yacht model table1 used in present results matching with numerical measurements is strongly affected by this parameter and additional cfd and or experimental database is needed when both shapes and dimensions of the appendages are changed or altered 6 results and discussion this section of the paper presents the results which have been obtained through the use of the above formulation when the control loop feedback scheme of fig 4 is implemented results are related to the same flying yacht model of the validation test case and the cfd numerical measurements what is expected from the present analysis is the existence of a pid algorithm capable of returning over the specified range of cruising speed an augmentation of yacht dynamics in terms of stabilization and state control both in calm and rough water conditions it is main purpose to investigate on the minimum cruising speed regimes and control forces which are necessary to obtain low deviation errors from the desired states x d and satisfying yacht control 6 1 yacht performances in calm water conditions in the previous section yacht performances at open loop control mode have been evaluated and shown all foiling maneuvering appendages being locked at their nominal incidence from a physical point of view the higher the yacht cruising elevations are the greater the reduction of the total wet surface is this could also result in a reduction of the total encountered resistance if no accelerations were present in the advancement direction in this section the pid control scheme will be used to control the yacht elevations within the speed range of interest in order to obtain a further reduction of the total wet surface with respect to the basic uncontrolled system fig 5 evaluations are performed in calm water conditions and with yacht motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry a desired state of x d ϕ b θ b ψ b z e 0 0 25 0 1 20 m has been chosen the choice depending on the fact that cruising elevations higher than 1 20 m lead foiling appendages to become control ineffective due to poor wet surface furthermore a low trim angle of θ b 0 25 has been chosen here as desired pitching attitude in terms of handling comfort qualities as already mentioned above the analyzed yacht system has shown a minimum cruising speed of v m i n δ m a x 20 kts as a necessary condition to enter foiling mode this value of speed is well different from the minimum control speed of the flying yacht which must be a function of the desired state x d the control gain g δ and the allowed deviation error ε o to underline this difference fig 6 shows the maximum deviation error ε δ t m a x x δ δ t x d x d obtained for six different values of the control gain g δ when the desired state is x d a value of 1 for the gain g δ means that open loop conditions are treated and control system is not active all foiling maneuvering appendages being locked at their respective nominal incidence eq 55 from fig 6 it could be seen that for the analyzed flying yacht a control gain value greater than 5 0e 04 is necessary to reach the desired state x d with a deviation error below 0 1 furthermore there is a specific cruising speed for each g δ curve at which the maximum deviation error reaches its lower value above this cruising speed the hydrodynamic forces tend to overcome the control forces and higher values of the gain are needed to not increase the deviation error in the right half of the plot i e v x 1 6 v m i n high values of g δ are mostly associated with controlled states of lower deviation error giving good control capabilities and stability augmentation in the dynamic response of the yacht system in the low speed range on the other hand a value of 5 0e 03 for the gain g δ is necessary to maintain a deviation error below the unity lower values resulting in a complete loss of control for all the cruising speeds conversely values which are higher than 5 0e 03 are not necessarily associated with lower deviation error states this is consistent with the fact that control forces must be large enough to overcome the hydrodynamic forces acting on the foiling appendages but not too large to excessively deflect the moving surfaces excessive deflections could result in a large increase of total encountered resistance this affecting yacht trim attitudes in a severe way from this point of view figs 7 and 8 show the maximum value obtained when a mean plus standard deviation operator is applied to each component of the angular deflection vector δ and control force vector f δ respectively as it could be seen from fig 7 almost all g δ curves decrease monotonically with respect to the cruising speed this underlining the fact that lower deflections of foiling appendages are needed for control when higher hydrodynamic forces are present the same considerations also apply to the magnitude of the control forces fig 8 for a value of v x which is well above 1 6 v m i n part of the energy needed to control and move the lifting surfaces could be extracted from the hydrodynamic forces themselves this is valid until the pid control loop feedback mechanism reaches its intrinsic residual steady state error sse ang et al 2005 which could be mitigated by increasing either the k i integral term in eq 45 or the control gain g δ it has to be underlined here that although the presence of an integral action in the implemented control scheme the existence of a residual steady state error is possible due to the fact that a finite time δ t has been chosen for yacht dynamics evolution from fig 7 it could also be seen that there are two exceptions in the trend of the g δ curves i e when the control gain assumes the value of 5 0e 03 and 1 0e 03 respectively in the first case a sudden increase in the lifting surface deflection is measured as soon as the ratio v x v m i n exceeds the value of 2 0 this underlining the fact that the hydrodynamic forces are of the same order of magnitude of the control forces at this speed regime in the second case the control forces are too low to overcome the hydrodynamic forces at all the cruising speeds this leading to a complete loss of control for the angular position vector δ which is totally dictated by the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic forces an uncontrolled deflection of lifting surfaces could in turn result in a severe increase of yacht total resistance see next fig 9 in this latter case an increment of either the spring or the damping factors k δ c δ in eq 44 could mitigate the unfavorable effect but this is at the expense of an increase in both the magnitude and the change rate of the control forces for the analyzed flying yacht system it could be seen from fig 8 that there is a specific cruising speed range i e 1 1 v m i n v x 1 6 v m i n where control forces reach their lowest values the interval 5 0e 03 g δ 10 0e 03 being a compromise between supply energy and active control characteristics higher values of g δ would lead to better control and handling qualities but the magnitude of the control forces could become very high and unfeasible from a practical point of view fig 9 shows yacht performances in terms of total encountered resistance trim attitude and elevation when the pid controller is at closed loop mode and for six different values of the control gain g δ by comparison with open loop conditions blue dashed lines in figure and with regard to the output quantity of the total encountered resistance the examined speed range could be subdivided into two distinct parts it could be seen that active control is desirable only in the high speed range its effect being not beneficial if cruising speed lies below the value of 1 6 v m i n in the latter case control forces tend to establish the desired state x d overcoming the hydrodynamic forces with very high deflections of the lifting surfaces this inevitably leads to a considerable increase in the total encountered resistance the effect being more severe as soon as g δ becomes large conversely if control forces become too small within the range of the higher cruising speeds hydrodynamic forces tend to overly deflect all the foiling appendages leading to a further increase in the yacht resistance this is the case of g δ 5 0 e 03 when cruising speeds are higher than 2 v m i n from fig 9 it could also be seen that there is a control gain value within the range 1 0 e 03 5 0 e 03 below which none of the examined cruising speeds is useful for resistance reduction in the same figure yacht trim attitude and cog elevation curves are also shown as already mentioned before high values of the control gain g δ 5 0e 03 are necessary to reach the desired state x d within the time interval δ t in a satisfactory manner lower values leading to a complete loss of control at all the cruising speeds although a limit value of g δ 5 0 e 03 is characterized by having a relative high deviation error above the unity fig 6 it could however be sufficient in terms of stability augmentation and motion damping this could be seen more specifically in fig 10 where the temporal evolutions of the controlled state variables are also shown for four different values of g δ 6 2 yacht performances in rough water conditions in the previous section the performances of the test flying yacht model have been investigated for the case of motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry and water in calm conditions this section extents the above results to the case of motion not on yacht symmetry plane and in rough water conditions due to the fact that numerical investigation is conducted on yacht state variables lying outside the validation range and test conditions results are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation open and closed loop conditions for pid control are both investigated when the control system is not active g δ 1 all foiling and maneuvering appendages are locked at their respective nominal incidences eqs 55 and 56 as verified a posteriori a permanent deflection of δ β i 2 for the two aft maneuvering appendages and propellers is sufficient to obtain an increase of ψ b 45 in yacht heading within the examined time interval δ t it has to be underlined here that due to the coupling of the equations of motion eq 2 rolling modes are affected if yawing modes are induced and vice versa for a desired heeling angle of ϕ b 5 elevations higher than z e 1 00 m resulted indeed in a poorer control and stability augmentation of the yacht system hence a desired state of x d ϕ b θ b ψ b z e 5 0 25 45 1 00 m has been chosen here in order to avoid excessive water surface piercing by foiling appendages during roll modes evolution furthermore the magnitude of the two aft thrust vectors t m a x is constant during the time interval δ t and it has been chosen according to a desired yacht cruising speed of 50 kts as already mentioned in previous sections in the present study rough water conditions are simulated through the use of regular basic ocean waves eq 36 in this paper numerical investigation is conducted for a fixed ocean depth h w 10 m a wave amplitude a w 25 cm and a wavelength λ w 15 x a f o i l 1 x a f o i l 2 to not go beyond the scope of the present paper numerical investigation for other values of h w a w and λ w will be future extension areas of work fig 11 shows the temporal evolution of yacht state variables during maneuver in rough water conditions and starting from an initial state vector of x o v x ϕ b θ b ψ b z e v m i n 0 0 1 0 0 75 m all curves in figure are shown for four different values of the control gain g δ by comparison with control open loop mode g δ 1 it could be seen that values of g δ higher than 5e 03 are sufficient both to reach the desired state x d and to suppress a wave amplitude of a w 25 cm in a satisfactory manner in particular there are shorter transients for the yawing mode the desired heading angle of ψ b 45 being reached more quickly than in the basic uncontrolled test case with regard to those curves where g δ 5 0 e 03 an appreciable deviation error is still present at the end of the interval δ t this being reducible through a further increase of either the integral term k i in eq 45 or the global gain g δ but at the expense of higher control forces on the other hand values of g δ which are below 5 0e 03 have turned out to not be beneficial in terms of yacht dynamics augmentation all modes showing both sustained fluctuations and large deviations from the desired state x d this being consistent with the fact that in this case surface deflections are mostly dictated by the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic forces and not by the control system 7 conclusions in the present paper a numerical investigation has been conducted in order to identify a pid control loop feedback scheme able to return dynamics augmentation and superior seakeeping

abdulmotaleb 2017 heppel 2015 chapin et al 2015 for their high performances in terms of total encountered resistance dynamic stability and immunity to waves interference phenomena the high performances are the result of favorable cruising heights above the sea level which lead to a considerable decrease of hull s total wet surface good stability to external disturbances is the result of good designing of lifting surfaces but sometimes this could be at the expense of penalties in terms of handling qualities and or hydrodynamic performances deng et al 2014 heppel 2015 in real sea conditions waves and external disturbances vary along with many factors including yacht speed encounter direction of waves and sea state the system of forces acting on a basic flying yacht hull during its motion could be summarized into four main components the lift which is composed by the sum of all the hydrodynamic forces resulting from the relative motion and the hydrostatic buoyancy forces of the lifting surfaces the total weight of the yacht the thrust produced by propellers or sails and the total encountered resistance the latter could be further decomposed into several different components being related to friction cross sectional area of the lifting surfaces transverse three dimensional effects wakes interference phenomena and sea water conditions kleijweg 2016 when active control is used for dynamics augmentation additional control force components are present in the equations of motion which are those needed for the deflection of the lifting surfaces the maximum value of the control forces and the related change rates are both constrained by limited capability of the actuators and machinery limitations this being a primary factor that certainly affects the choice of the control method wang et al 2016 conventional controllers such as pids have been widely adopted hickey et al 1999 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2007 to cope with dynamics augmentation and stabilization for ships and crafts although these controllers do not belong to the optimal control category athans 1971 van amerongen et al 1990 wang et al 2016 bagassi et al 2009 they are used due to readiness in theoretical analysis and implementation the basic concept relying only on the response of a measured system variable and not on a mathematical knowledge of the system itself ang et al 2005 however the pid algorithm does not guarantee an intrinsic control stability and loop tuning gain scheduling operations are necessary when uncertain parameters or severe nonlinearities are present in the dynamic system gao et al 2007 to predict overall performances in terms of stability encountered resistance handling qualities and dynamic behavior now available codes and models find application over a wide range of complexity and accuracy which extends from complete unsteady three dimensional numerical codes chapin et al 2015 filippas and belibassakis 2013 wackers et al 2017 bakhtiari et al 2016 çakici et al 2015 to quick simple lumped parameters models heppel 2015 gao et al 2007 fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 savitsky 1964 in the numerical field for example chapin et al 2015 performed a numerical investigation on a two elements wingsail for high performance multihull yachts the study is based on a computational cfd evaluation of the flow around the wingsail by resolving navier stokes equations unsteady modeling is also used to characterize the stall behavior and give good understanding of the flow physics that may occur in such configurations infilippas and belibassakis 2013 filippas etal developed an unsteady boundary element method which is applied to the analysis of oscillating non lifting bodies and flapping hydrofoils operating beneath the free surface and in the presence of incident waves numerical results include the lift and thrust coefficients of the system over a range of motion parameters such as reduced frequency and strouhal number fu 2012 used the numerical flow analysis nfa to model breaking waves around a ship including both plunging and spilling breaking waves the formation of spray and the entrainment of air nfa solves the navier stokes equations utilizing a cut cell cartesian grid formulation with interface capturing to model the unsteady flow of air and water around moving bodies a panellized surface representation of the ship hull is required as input in terms of body geometry and domain decomposition is used to distribute portions of the grid over a large number of processors hpc although recent numerical codes filippas and belibassakis 2013 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 and computational methods cfd fvm and nfa chapin et al 2015 bakhtiari et al 2016 duman et al 2017 fu 2012 are able to describe complex three dimensional hydrodynamic fields and unsteady motions they still require large computational resources and time consuming in terms of geometry preparation mesh grid generation and or computational domain distribution processes from the first half of the twentieth century onwards various yacht dynamic systems have been studied through the use of simple analytical models fossati and muggiasca 2012 used a simple lumped parameters model with the aim to reproduce unsteady sail aerodynamics taking into account three dimensional effects and unsteady mainsail jib interaction in this study the hull of the yacht is modeled as a single point mass constrained to move on a surface governed by the equations of wave motion in matveev 2012 a method of hydrodynamic discrete sources is applied for two dimensional modeling of stepped planing surfaces the water surface deformations wetted hull lengths and pressure distribution are also included in the formulation previous published works wang et al 2016 heppel 2015 gao et al 2007 also explored the application of classic and modern control theory to passive and active stability of both propelled and sailing foilers inheppel 2015 for example the classic methods of flight dynamics are applied to the passive stability of a specific modern high performance sailing foiler the whole system is returned to a six degrees of freedom dof point and the equations of motion are solved in the frequency domain good insight is gained by extracting the natural modes and frequencies from the linearization of the equations inwang et al 2016 the sailing performances of a twin hull s swath vehicle in waves are investigated in this study a flapping foil stabilizer is proposed to enhance the seakeeping advantages of the vehicle in rough waves a vertical plane motion control model is built and the unsteady hydrodynamic characteristics of the flapping foil stabilizer are also investigated ingao et al 2007 an adapted water jet propulsion based on pid control is implemented in a high speed slid ship model to obtain active control on heave pitch modes and dynamic instabilities at the high speed ranges in contrast to the now available cfd nfa and numerical codes simple lumped parameters models are still largely used due to their simplicity and quickness although their inaccuracy and limited range of application savitsky 1964 piancastelli et al 2014 2015a axiomatic assumptions and restrictions are intrinsic in the use of this type of models lumped parameters formulation is not suitable for capturing complex three dimensional phenomena such as free water surface deformation and wakes propagation interaction involved in a system of lifting surfaces during unsteady motion from the point of view of active control low degrees of freedom models give poor insight into unsteadiness of coupled dynamic modes and control forces heppel 2015 wang et al 2016 gao et al 2007 leaving out also other basic aspects of interest such as minimum control speed regimes and relative deviation errors from desired states when finite time evolutions are involved different extensions filippas and belibassakis 2013 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 are indeed necessary to take into account such aspects leading thus to more rigorous and complex formulations in view of this the main outcome of the present work is to investigate on the existence of an active pid control scheme for a specific engine propelled yacht hull which is able to return dynamics augmentation and superior seakeeping characteristics through the control of six foiling maneuvering appendages over a specified range of cruising speeds propulsion power and sea water conditions in particular it is authors goal to conduct a numerical investigation on the minimum cruising speed ranges and control force gains which are necessary to obtain satisfying control hydrodynamic performances for the sake of this the lumped parameters model presented inamoroso et al 2018 is extended to a multi lifting surface system in conjunction with a pid control loop feedback scheme in the next section the physical and mathematical model of the problem will be developed and particularized to the test flying yacht hull due to lack of ad hoc experimental data and or measurements numerical cfd simulations of the test yacht were conducted the results being collected and implemented in the present formulation it is shown that the present formulation is able to well capture dynamics and seakeeping performances of the augmented flying yacht system the results of the model being in good agreement with the cfd numerical measurements over the specified range of cruising speeds 2 physical model and assumptions in the present work an extension of the lumped parameters model presented inamoroso et al 2018 is developed and used in order to capture the main dynamic effects of a pid control system on a specific high speed flying yacht hull fig 1 for a given set of parametric quantities and initial conditions to be in line with the authors goals main effects of interest could be stability augmentation seakeeping performances and unsteady rigid body dynamics both in calm and rough water conditions the yacht dynamic system is returned to a six degrees of freedom point g of weight mg whose three linear and angular displacement variables are unknowns of the problem each foiling and maneuvering appendage is in turn returned to a six degrees of freedom point f i of weight m i g whose three linear and angular displacement variables are also unknowns of the problem in the present paper the rotation around the leading edge of each foiling and maneuvering appendage will be considered only the remaining degrees of freedom being considered fixed with respect to the g x b y b z b frame of reference furthermore yacht pitching and rolling dynamic modes will be mostly affected by exercising controlled torque around the leading edge of four j type foils placed almost symmetrically with respect to the center of gravity g whereas two aft vertical rudders will be used for yawing modes

coefficients the space time average process leads to hydrodynamic parameters which are unique for each component of the yacht system but constant both in space and time load lift resistance and thrust are treated as integrated quantities and concentrated forces acting on their respective application point as depicted in fig 1 3 mathematical formulation when all the components of the yacht system and the initial conditions of the problem are defined the present model utilizes basic unsteady motion and hydrodynamic equations to predict the temporal evolution of all state variables and related output quantities for a given thrust load and center of gravity location the general unsteady motion equations of a rigid body in the three directions and rotations are written with respect to a reference frame which is positioned on the center of gravity of the whole dynamic system and which is stationary with respect to it this is the g fixed frame of reference g x b y b z b where not specified signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in fig 1 with respect to the g x b y b z b reference

will be further discussed in the next 3 3 section in the present study the moment equilibrium equations will be applied to the case of a flying yacht with x b z b as a plane of symmetry and x b y b z b as principal axes for convenience it is useful to write the whole system of equations in the state form by introducing an extra set of six cinematic equations in both linear and angular directions

system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 and 16 has twelve unknown state variables which are herein evaluated numerically by an explicit time integration scheme based on the runge kutta method for solving initial value problems the reader is referred toizzo 2017 for further information about the method before proceeding with the integration of the equations the problem must be closed by adding explicit formulas for the hydrodynamic coefficients the water air medium properties and the pid control system 3 1 hydrodynamic lift the lift acting on a lifting surface could be separated into two distinct components the dynamic reaction of the fluid against the moving surface and the static buoyant contribution of the displaced volume under the free water surface the dynamic lift component has different behaviors depending on cruising speed and or froud number range savitsky 1964 at lower speed regimes the dynamic lift component is order of magnitude smaller than the buoyant component as speeds are increased transition or planing regime may occur savitsky 2014 1964 and the dynamic lift component could be the same order or greater than the static one from the classic aerodynamic theory kats and plotkin 1991 it is known that for lifting surfaces of finite aspect ratio the lift force coefficient could be expressed as a function of the relative incidence in the following form 21 c l α i l i b i 2 π 1 2 l i b i b i 2 ξ i α i α o i the related lift forces being 22 l i 1 2 ρ i u i 2 v i 2 w i 2 c z i l i b i c l α i l i b i for the z a i direction and 23 c i 1 2 ρ i u i 2 v i 2 w i 2 c y i l i h i c l β i l i h i for the y a i direction the parametric quantity ξ i in eq 21 has been introduced to take into account three dimensional and free water surface effects which are related to the real form of the ith lifting appendage allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 in this work the value of ξ i will be arbitrarily chosen and assigned to each component of the yacht system in order to obtain good agreement with the available cfd numerical data 3 2 hydrodynamic drag the total encountered resistance acting on a lifting surface during its motion in water could be decomposed into several different components which are related to friction cross sectional area of the surface transverse three dimensional effects wake profile and sea water conditions in this study the total hydrodynamic drag force acting on a lifting surface is decomposed into four main components namely frictional form induced and residuary resistance the first three components are treated explicitly through the use of semi empirical formulas kats and plotkin 1991 kleijweg 2016 while the last residuary term is treated implicitly in the formulation through the use of a correction factor ξ i and corrected hydrodynamic coefficients c d x i c d y i c d z i cfd simulations have been conducted and used in the present paper in order to give an estimation of the correction parameters within the speed range of interest with respect to the local frame of reference a i x a i y a i z a i the frictional form and induced resistance components for the ith lifting surface could be respectively evaluated through the use of the following expressions kleijweg 2016 kats and plotkin 1991 24 x f i y f i z f i ρ i u i 2 c f ρ i μ i u i l i c z i l i b i c y i l i h i ρ i v i 2 c f ρ i μ i v i b i

the hydrodynamic coefficients c d x i c d y i c d z i are replaced by their averaged value obtained through cfd computations within the analyzed speed range 3 3 center of pressure it is shown insavitsky 1964 and savitsky and ward 1954 that the longitudinal position of the center of pressure of planing surfaces could be evaluated by separating the hydrodynamic lift contribute from the hydrostatic one the center of pressure of the dynamic lift component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom of conventional planing surfaces on the other hand the longitudinal position of the application point of the buoyancy force is found to be nearly constant at the 33 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical expression for the total center of pressure excursion 27 c p i 0 75 1 5 21 u i g l w i 2 b w i l w i 2 39 where c p i is the ratio of the longitudinal distance from the transom to the center of pressure divided by the wetted length l w i in the present paper the application point of the buoyancy force component is calculated through the geometric centroid of the displaced volume γ i under the free surface level while the hydrodynamic force component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the wetted length l w i according to eq 27 3 4 multiphase model the present formulation is based on a multiphase model which is used to compute the hydrodynamic forces acting on all the lifting surfaces of the analyzed yacht system medium properties such as mass density and dynamic viscosity are treated as integrated quantities over each lifting surface and are functions of the position of the application point where the hydrodynamic forces act with reference to fig 2 and for the ith lifting surface of the yacht the mass density and dynamic viscosity properties of the water air medium could be written as 28 ρ i γ i ρ w 1 γ i ρ a μ

function δ i δ φ i δ α i δ β i is the deflection vector of the ith lifting surface and ξ x is the wave elevation which will be discussed in the next section 3 5 rough water model this section extents the above mathematical formulation to the case of yacht motion in rough water conditions in the present study rough water conditions are simulated through the use of regular basic ocean waves salmon 2015 moving in the x e direction at the phase speed c w the velocity field w e w x x y z w y x y z w z x y z associated with this type of waves could be described salmon 2015 by the following scalar components which are written with respect to the earth fixed reference frame e x e y e z e and for a single wave of frequency ω w 36 w x w y w z a w 2 ω w c o s h 2 π λ w h w z s i n h 2 π λ w h w c o s 2 π λ w x ω w t 0 a w 2 ω w s i n h 2 π λ w h w z s i n h 2 π λ w h w s i n 2 π λ w x ω w t where 37 ω w g 2 π λ w t a n h 2 π λ w h w is the wave frequency for a fixed ocean depth h w the two parameters λ w and a w are respectively the wavelength and the height of the wave it is shown salmon 2015 that the free water surface elevation associated with the velocity field of eq 36 could be approximated through the use of the following harmonic function 38 ξ x a w 2 ω w c o s 2 π λ w x ω w t this being equivalent to considering sinusoidal wave profiles instead of those obtained by direct integration of eq 36 moreover it is assumed here that there is no slip velocity and or boundary layer thickness at the water air interface this being considered of zero thickness and placed at the wave elevation ξ x 3 6 yacht control and pid closed loop feedback scheme this section of the paper presents the synthesis and the mathematical aspects of the pid control scheme which has been implemented in the analyzed flying yacht model in this study a state x t will be considered controlled if the relation 39 m a x x t x d x d ε o is satisfied for all t δ t where ε o is an arbitrary deviation error from the desired state x d and δ t is the minimum time of dynamic evolution which is necessary to reach steady conditions starting from an initial state x o due to the fact that the desired states are reached through the use of foiling and maneuvering appendages relative high speed regimes are necessary to make lifting surfaces effective in particular it is authors interest to conduct numerical investigation over a specified speed range where the relation 40 i l i m g is satisfied for all t δ t it has to be underlined here that the total lift force included in the present mathematical formulation could generally exceed the total weight force of the yacht this is especially true when either unsteady transitional regimes or motions out of symmetry plane are involved in both cases the inertial terms of the r h s of eq 1 become explicit in eq 40 equating the two sides of eq 40 and substituting eq 22 in eq 40 it follows that a minimum cruising speed of 41 v m i n mg i 1 2 ρ i c z i l i b i c l δ m a x is a necessary condition for the yacht to obtain both foiling and control δ m a x being the maximum allowed deflection of the appendages before hydrodynamic stall and or cavitation insurgence abbott and doenhoff 1959 astolfi and bot 2015 chapin et al 2015 in the present formulation a saturation threshold for all the angular displacement variables δ i has been introduced when lifting surfaces are controlled by the pid control system maximum deflections being limited according to the relation 42 δ i f δ i where f is a clip function which is here defined as 43 f δ i δ i u δ i δ m a x 1 u δ i δ m a x δ m a x u δ i δ m a x δ m a x 1 u δ i δ m a x and u is the unit step function this implies that the angular deflections δ i are not allowed to exceed the value δ m a x whatever the amplitude of the control forces is as already mentioned above before proceeding with the integration of the 6 dof system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 and 16 the problem must be closed by adding extra dofs for all foiling maneuvering appendages and explicit formulas for pid control with reference to fig 3 the deflections δ α i of the four foiling appendages are herein used to control the pitching and rolling dynamic modes of the flying yacht whereas the δ β i deflections of the two maneuvering appendages are used to control the dynamic yawing modes it has to be underlined that in the analyzed flying yacht model there is no relative motion between the maneuvering appendages and the aft propellers the thrust vector t i being fixed to the x a i axis for i equal to rud1 and rud2 in the present paper each foiling and maneuvering appendage is returned to a dynamic subsystem of mass m i spring constant k i and damping factor c i all parameters being collected in their respective diagonal matrices m δ k δ and c δ the angular displacement variables δ δ α f o i l 1 δ α f o i l 2 δ α f o i l 3 δ α f o i l 4 δ β r u d 1 δ β r u d 2 are the extra dofs to be added in the yacht system with respect to the ith local reference frame a i x a i y a i z a i the unsteady equilibrium equations in both z a i foiling and y a i maneuvering directions could be written for all the appendages and collected as follows 44 m δ r δ δ c δ r δ δ k δ r δ δ g δ f δ z i y i where r δ a i f i 1 is the application point of the hydrodynamic forces z i y i f δ is the vector of the control forces and g δ is a dimensionless global gain for the pid control system for the control loop feedback scheme ang et al 2005 of fig 4 the overall control function could be expressed in time domain as 45 f δ k p x δ x d k d x δ x d k i 0 t x δ x d d t where x δ is the vector of the state variables which must be controlled and x d is the final desired state it has to be underlined here that the derivative action in eq 45 is ideal i e not casual and improves settling time and stability of the system by predicting its behavior hence an approximation of the overall pid control function might indeed be necessary in the present paper the following discrete form of eq 45 will be implemented 46 f δ k p x δ x d k d δ x δ x d δ t k i δ x δ x d where 47 δ x t δ t x t x t δ t n δ t n 48 δ x t i 1 n x t i δ t n δ t n are the discrete forms of the derivative and integral operators respectively in eqs 47 and 48 the quantity n is the number of iteration steps or subdivisions within the 1st computation cycle which will be discussed in the next section furthermore the state variables ϕ b θ b ψ b and z e will be the components of the controlled state vector x δ from a practical point of view it has to be underlined here that while the three rotational state variables could be ready to be measured providing gyroscope sensors the linear state variable z e is not directly measurable and must be read or estimated indirectly from a physical point of view if the difference x δ x d is not zero due to the fact that external disturbances are present during the motion of the yacht control forces must deflect the foiling maneuvering appendages accordingly in order to counteract the external disturbances and minimize the deviation from the desired state where not specified the signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in figs 1 3 hence for the case of longitudinal stability control if a positive trim angle error is present a negative pitching moment must be exerted on the yacht to minimize the error the respective deflections of the fore aft foiling appendages being opposite in sign the same procedure also applies to the lateral stability control leading thus to the following structures for the pid gain matrices which will be here used according to the arrangement of the appendages in the analyzed yacht model 49 k p k p a p ϕ a p θ 0 a p z a p ϕ a p θ 0 a p z a p ϕ a p θ 0 a p z a p ϕ a p θ 0 a p z 0 0 a p ψ 0 0 0 a p ψ 0 50 k d k d a d ϕ a d θ 0 a d z a d ϕ a d θ 0 a

performed until yacht dynamic response returns satisfying control qualities within both the time interval δ t and the speed range of interest once the control criteria eq 39 are met all the parameters are collected in the respective gain matrices and used in the numerical evaluations 4 numerical evaluations to perform a parametric study of the foregoing unsteady equations of motion the numerical scheme presented inamoroso et al 2018 will be implemented in the present work the numerical scheme is based on two computation cycles of n and n iteration steps respectively a total evolution time δ t is chosen a priori this interval time must be large enough to ensure that the solution reaches steady state conditions in the present study a total evolution time of 25s was found to be sufficient large to yield steady calculations at all the cruising speed values during each step of the two cycles the 6 4 dofs system obtained by joining eqs 1 2 15 16 and 44 is solved numerically by explicit time integration based on the runge kutta method izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 a dynamic controlled time step size is used in this method and the reader could find more specific information about the solution control and stability inizzo 2017 gear 1971 and forsythe et al 1977 the solution of the unsteady hydrodynamic problem is first calculated n times in the 1st cycle at the end of each step i e when the dynamic response of the system covers the total interval of time δ t n input parameters are updated following a 1st cycle scheduled table of values the 1st computation cycle ends as soon as the total evolution time δ t is fully covered subsequently the same procedure applies to the 2nd cycle with n iteration steps input parameters being updated following a 2nd cycle scheduled table of values at the end of each cycle a vector of the desired output variables is stored for post processing operations the solution of the problem is calculated a total of n x n times in the present study while the 1st computation cycle is used for explicit time integration of the system solution the 2nd computation cycle is used to conduct parametric studies on the dynamic response of the system itself an averaged number of n 10000 subdivisions for the temporal evolution δ t was found to be sufficient large to reach solution convergence and capture yacht dynamics in a satisfactory manner the 2nd cycle iteration steps varying according to the parametric studies requirements 5 validation to establish the reliability of the present mathematical model a validation analysis is performed validation analysis consists of a qualitative comparison between the results obtained with the present formulation and available cfd numerical data numerical resistance trim and elevation measurements at control open loop conditions with motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry are selected for the validation of the present results the validation is performed for a particular test flying yacht model fig 3 and within a specific cruising speed range i e from 20 knts up to 50 knts results for variables outside the validation range are also shown and are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation overall dimensions and parameters of each component of the yacht model are listed in table1 for convenience standard naca series sections abbott and doenhoff 1959 have been used here for all the lifting surfaces in particular naca 4412 and naca 0012 for foiling and maneuvering appendages respectively for this type of foil sections a value of δ m a x 12 has been chosen as a maximum allowed deflection in order to avoid non linearities hydrodynamic stall and or cavitation insurgence abbott and doenhoff 1959 astolfi and bot 2015 chapin et al 2015 steady mean values for the hydrodynamic coefficients of each component of the test yacht are estimated using ranse method bakhtiari et al 2016 chapin et al 2015 with single phase model and static mesh scheme wackers et al 2017 piancastelli et al 2015b hydrodynamic performances of the yacht system at foiling mode with in plane motion are estimated with both multiphase vof model and dynamic mesh scheme hirt and nichols 1981 sieber and schäfer 2001 in all the cfd computations the standard k ε model bakhtiari et al 2016 has been implemented for modeling the turbulence of the flow test conditions of present formulation are set according to the cfd numerical measurements and for the same flying yacht model where it is not specified the test model is considered at rest conditions when t 0 s the steady output quantities being collected after a time interval of δ t moreover the two aft thrust vectors are fixed in magnitude during each temporal evolution the quantity t m a x following a scheduled table of values according to the yacht cruising speed requirements the yacht system presented and analyzed in this paper showed motion instabilities gao et al 2007 in pitch heave dynamic modes for a cruising speed range of v x 35 kts and for deflections of δ α i 6 in test conditions all lifting surfaces are locked at their nominal incidences which are chosen so that 55 δ α i 0 i f v x 35 kts δ α m a x 6 o t h e r w i s e t 0 56 δ β i 0 i n p l a n e m o t i o n 2 o t h e r w i s e t 0 in order to avoid the motion instabilities it has to be underlined here that δ α m a x and δ m a x are actually two different values of maximum allowed deflections which are related to each other through the trim attitude of the yacht system and the hydrodynamic incidence of the lifting surfaces in the following manner 57 δ m a x δ α m a x θ b m a x α i m a x fig 5 shows a comparison between cfd numerical measurements and results obtained with the present model although its basis on lumped parameters and simplifying assumptions the model has shown good agreement with the results the corresponding comparison errors being between 1 5 and 33 percent for the output quantities within the specific speed range as reported in figure the trends in the yacht total resistance trim and heave curves are well captured by present formulation showing good qualitative quantitative agreement between cfd measurements and present results a better estimation could be sought for the trim angle θ b which is the state variable most affected by three dimensional effects such as free water surface deformation and wakes interference phenomena when the froude number of the yacht hull lies below its critical value savitsky and gore 1979 of 0 4 i e v x 9 kts the bulk of the yacht weight is mostly supported by the hydrostatic buoyancy of the hull almeter 1993 ghassemi and kohansal 2010 in this low speed regime the hydrodynamic forces acting on all the lifting surfaces of the yacht including the hull are too low to return either planing or foiling conditions for the present test yacht model it has been found indeed that a minimum cruising speed of v m i n δ m a x 20 kts eq 41 is necessary to obtain foiling conditions which is more than twice the critical speed value of the yacht hull this could also be verified from fig 5 where considerable yacht elevations z e are reached only after v x 20 kts within the mid speed range 9 kts v x 20 kts planing regime occurs the yacht being still largely supported by the hydrodynamic forces acting on its hull in this speed range variations of the state variable z e are also effect of yacht rotation and trimming attitudes θ b hence for the whole speed range 0 kts v x 20 kts the approach discussed inamoroso et al 2018 could be more suitable to give a better approximation of the reached steady states if sought moreover it has to be underlined that the parametric quantity ξ i of eq 21 has been chosen ad hoc and arbitrarily for the specific flying yacht model table1 used in present results matching with numerical measurements is strongly affected by this parameter and additional cfd and or experimental database is needed when both shapes and dimensions of the appendages are changed or altered 6 results and discussion this section of the paper presents the results which have been obtained through the use of the above formulation when the control loop feedback scheme of fig 4 is implemented results are related to the same flying yacht model of the validation test case and the cfd numerical measurements what is expected from the present analysis is the existence of a pid algorithm capable of returning over the specified range of cruising speed an augmentation of yacht dynamics in terms of stabilization and state control both in calm and rough water conditions it is main purpose to investigate on the minimum cruising speed regimes and control forces which are necessary to obtain low deviation errors from the desired states x d and satisfying yacht control 6 1 yacht performances in calm water conditions in the previous section yacht performances at open loop control mode have been evaluated and shown all foiling maneuvering appendages being locked at their nominal incidence from a physical point of view the higher the yacht cruising elevations are the greater the reduction of the total wet surface is this could also result in a reduction of the total encountered resistance if no accelerations were present in the advancement direction in this section the pid control scheme will be used to control the yacht elevations within the speed range of interest in order to obtain a further reduction of the total wet surface with respect to the basic uncontrolled system fig 5 evaluations are performed in calm water conditions and with yacht motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry a desired state of x d ϕ b θ b ψ b z e 0 0 25 0 1 20 m has been chosen the choice depending on the fact that cruising elevations higher than 1 20 m lead foiling appendages to become control ineffective due to poor wet surface furthermore a low trim angle of θ b 0 25 has been chosen here as desired pitching attitude in terms of handling comfort qualities as already mentioned above the analyzed yacht system has shown a minimum cruising speed of v m i n δ m a x 20 kts as a necessary condition to enter foiling mode this value of speed is well different from the minimum control speed of the flying yacht which must be a function of the desired state x d the control gain g δ and the allowed deviation error ε o to underline this difference fig 6 shows the maximum deviation error ε δ t m a x x δ δ t x d x d obtained for six different values of the control gain g δ when the desired state is x d a value of 1 for the gain g δ means that open loop conditions are treated and control system is not active all foiling maneuvering appendages being locked at their respective nominal incidence eq 55 from fig 6 it could be seen that for the analyzed flying yacht a control gain value greater than 5 0e 04 is necessary to reach the desired state x d with a deviation error below 0 1 furthermore there is a specific cruising speed for each g δ curve at which the maximum deviation error reaches its lower value above this cruising speed the hydrodynamic forces tend to overcome the control forces and higher values of the gain are needed to not increase the deviation error in the right half of the plot i e v x 1 6 v m i n high values of g δ are mostly associated with controlled states of lower deviation error giving good control capabilities and stability augmentation in the dynamic response of the yacht system in the low speed range on the other hand a value of 5 0e 03 for the gain g δ is necessary to maintain a deviation error below the unity lower values resulting in a complete loss of control for all the cruising speeds conversely values which are higher than 5 0e 03 are not necessarily associated with lower deviation error states this is consistent with the fact that control forces must be large enough to overcome the hydrodynamic forces acting on the foiling appendages but not too large to excessively deflect the moving surfaces excessive deflections could result in a large increase of total encountered resistance this affecting yacht trim attitudes in a severe way from this point of view figs 7 and 8 show the maximum value obtained when a mean plus standard deviation operator is applied to each component of the angular deflection vector δ and control force vector f δ respectively as it could be seen from fig 7 almost all g δ curves decrease monotonically with respect to the cruising speed this underlining the fact that lower deflections of foiling appendages are needed for control when higher hydrodynamic forces are present the same considerations also apply to the magnitude of the control forces fig 8 for a value of v x which is well above 1 6 v m i n part of the energy needed to control and move the lifting surfaces could be extracted from the hydrodynamic forces themselves this is valid until the pid control loop feedback mechanism reaches its intrinsic residual steady state error sse ang et al 2005 which could be mitigated by increasing either the k i integral term in eq 45 or the control gain g δ it has to be underlined here that although the presence of an integral action in the implemented control scheme the existence of a residual steady state error is possible due to the fact that a finite time δ t has been chosen for yacht dynamics evolution from fig 7 it could also be seen that there are two exceptions in the trend of the g δ curves i e when the control gain assumes the value of 5 0e 03 and 1 0e 03 respectively in the first case a sudden increase in the lifting surface deflection is measured as soon as the ratio v x v m i n exceeds the value of 2 0 this underlining the fact that the hydrodynamic forces are of the same order of magnitude of the control forces at this speed regime in the second case the control forces are too low to overcome the hydrodynamic forces at all the cruising speeds this leading to a complete loss of control for the angular position vector δ which is totally dictated by the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic forces an uncontrolled deflection of lifting surfaces could in turn result in a severe increase of yacht total resistance see next fig 9 in this latter case an increment of either the spring or the damping factors k δ c δ in eq 44 could mitigate the unfavorable effect but this is at the expense of an increase in both the magnitude and the change rate of the control forces for the analyzed flying yacht system it could be seen from fig 8 that there is a specific cruising speed range i e 1 1 v m i n v x 1 6 v m i n where control forces reach their lowest values the interval 5 0e 03 g δ 10 0e 03 being a compromise between supply energy and active control characteristics higher values of g δ would lead to better control and handling qualities but the magnitude of the control forces could become very high and unfeasible from a practical point of view fig 9 shows yacht performances in terms of total encountered resistance trim attitude and elevation when the pid controller is at closed loop mode and for six different values of the control gain g δ by comparison with open loop conditions blue dashed lines in figure and with regard to the output quantity of the total encountered resistance the examined speed range could be subdivided into two distinct parts it could be seen that active control is desirable only in the high speed range its effect being not beneficial if cruising speed lies below the value of 1 6 v m i n in the latter case control forces tend to establish the desired state x d overcoming the hydrodynamic forces with very high deflections of the lifting surfaces this inevitably leads to a considerable increase in the total encountered resistance the effect being more severe as soon as g δ becomes large conversely if control forces become too small within the range of the higher cruising speeds hydrodynamic forces tend to overly deflect all the foiling appendages leading to a further increase in the yacht resistance this is the case of g δ 5 0 e 03 when cruising speeds are higher than 2 v m i n from fig 9 it could also be seen that there is a control gain value within the range 1 0 e 03 5 0 e 03 below which none of the examined cruising speeds is useful for resistance reduction in the same figure yacht trim attitude and cog elevation curves are also shown as already mentioned before high values of the control gain g δ 5 0e 03 are necessary to reach the desired state x d within the time interval δ t in a satisfactory manner lower values leading to a complete loss of control at all the cruising speeds although a limit value of g δ 5 0 e 03 is characterized by having a relative high deviation error above the unity fig 6 it could however be sufficient in terms of stability augmentation and motion damping this could be seen more specifically in fig 10 where the temporal evolutions of the controlled state variables are also shown for four different values of g δ 6 2 yacht performances in rough water conditions in the previous section the performances of the test flying yacht model have been investigated for the case of motion in the longitudinal plane of symmetry and water in calm conditions this section extents the above results to the case of motion not on yacht symmetry plane and in rough water conditions due to the fact that numerical investigation is conducted on yacht state variables lying outside the validation range and test conditions results are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation open and closed loop conditions for pid control are both investigated when the control system is not active g δ 1 all foiling and maneuvering appendages are locked at their respective nominal incidences eqs 55 and 56 as verified a posteriori a permanent deflection of δ β i 2 for the two aft maneuvering appendages and propellers is sufficient to obtain an increase of ψ b 45 in yacht heading within the examined time interval δ t it has to be underlined here that due to the coupling of the equations of motion eq 2 rolling modes are affected if yawing modes are induced and vice versa for a desired heeling angle of ϕ b 5 elevations higher than z e 1 00 m resulted indeed in a poorer control and stability augmentation of the yacht system hence a desired state of x d ϕ b θ b ψ b z e 5 0 25 45 1 00 m has been chosen here in order to avoid excessive water surface piercing by foiling appendages during roll modes evolution furthermore the magnitude of the two aft thrust vectors t m a x is constant during the time interval δ t and it has been chosen according to a desired yacht cruising speed of 50 kts as already mentioned in previous sections in the present study rough water conditions are simulated through the use of regular basic ocean waves eq 36 in this paper numerical investigation is conducted for a fixed ocean depth h w 10 m a wave amplitude a w 25 cm and a wavelength λ w 15 x a f o i l 1 x a f o i l 2 to not go beyond the scope of the present paper numerical investigation for other values of h w a w and λ w will be future extension areas of work fig 11 shows the temporal evolution of yacht state variables during maneuver in rough water conditions and starting from an initial state vector of x o v x ϕ b θ b ψ b z e v m i n 0 0 1 0 0 75 m all curves in figure are shown for four different values of the control gain g δ by comparison with control open loop mode g δ 1 it could be seen that values of g δ higher than 5e 03 are sufficient both to reach the desired state x d and to suppress a wave amplitude of a w 25 cm in a satisfactory manner in particular there are shorter transients for the yawing mode the desired heading angle of ψ b 45 being reached more quickly than in the basic uncontrolled test case with regard to those curves where g δ 5 0 e 03 an appreciable deviation error is still present at the end of the interval δ t this being reducible through a further increase of either the integral term k i in eq 45 or the global gain g δ but at the expense of higher control forces on the other hand values of g δ which are below 5 0e 03 have turned out to not be beneficial in terms of yacht dynamics augmentation all modes showing both sustained fluctuations and large deviations from the desired state x d this being consistent with the fact that in this case surface deflections are mostly dictated by the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic forces and not by the control system 7 conclusions in the present paper a numerical investigation has been conducted in order to identify a pid control loop feedback scheme able to return dynamics augmentation and superior seakeeping characteristics in the application of high speed flying yacht hulls an existing lumped parameters model based on general unsteady equations of motion has been extended to a multi lifting surface system and implemented in combination with a regular basic ocean waves model to conduct parametric studies and predict the overall performances of a specific engine propelled flying yacht hull both in calm and rough water conditions the unsteady behavior of six foiling maneuvering appendages has been investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics being based on a database generated through the use of computational fluid dynamics methods cfd coupled with static dynamic mesh schemes equations of motion and hydrodynamics have been solved numerically by explicit time integration method by comparison with control open loop conditions the results have shown the effects of the use of pid controllers in such dynamic systems in terms of seakeeping performances and dynamics augmentation in particular more insight has been given on the cruising speed regimes and control force gains which are necessary to obtain satisfying control hydrodynamic performances for the presented flying yacht model future areas of work include the implementation of control systems which are part of the optimal robust control category future works also include parametric studies on different starting conditions and sea water scenarios more insight being necessary to give good understanding for a spectrum of random amplitudes and frequencies which could be involved in real sea conditions credit

21106,in this paper the stress concentration factors scfs in tubular t y connections strengthened with ﬁber reinforced polymer frp under opb are investigated for this aim 263 fe models of t y joints with frp were generated and analyzed in the fe models the contact between the frp sheets and the members was modeled by using the generated fe models the effect of the frp layers the brace inclination angle and the joint geometry on the scf ratios of the reinforced to the corresponding un reinforced joints were investigated results showed that the scf of an frp strengthened joint can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint moreover the increase of the frp layer number results in a considerable decrease of the scfs also this phenomenon is more significant in the joints with larger γ moreover the increase of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers results in the remarkable decrease of the scf ratios finally the fe results were used to propose a design equation

fabrication are advantages for welded tubular structures to these structures to be applied extensively in oﬀshore jacket type platforms shao et al 2017 but because of the cyclic loading such as the wave loading the tubular joints are exposed to serious fatigue problem due to the stress concentration problem nie et al 2017 so far some procedures to decrease the stress concentration factor scf in tubular connections have been presented one of these techniques is the ﬁber reinforced polymer frp reinforcement method this method can be a valuable choice for such rehabilitation purposes in old and new structures a tubular connection can be reinforced by adding frp layers to the outside of the chord weld and brace resulting in what is called frp reinforced tubular joints fig 1 there are available several researches on the scfs in the unreinforced tubular t y joins under axial out of plane bending opb and in plane bending ipb loads e g hellier et al 1990 chang and dover 1996 1999 lee 1999a b shao 2007 thandavamoorthy 2009 liu et al 2015 also n diaye et al 2007 2009 predicted the location of hot spot stress t connections under opb load bao et al 2019 and 2020a proposed some formulas for calculating the scfs in three planar tubular y joints under axial and opb loads liu et al 2016 studied the scfs in multi planar dx joint under opb load they showed that the hotspot positions of the dx connections commonly happened at the saddle points ahmadi and zavvar 2016 numerically studied the effect of loaded out of plane braces on the values of the scf in tubular kt joints the scfs in overlapped tubular joints are studied by gao 2006 gho et al 2006 and zhang et al 2018 they proposed some formulas for predicting the scfs morgan and lee 1998 and shao et al 2009 derived some parametric equations for calculating the scfs in tubular k joints under opb load musa et al 2018 and musa and mashiri 2019 experimentally and numerically evaluated the scfs in t joints with concrete under opb loads they proposed some safe equations for determining the scfs zheng et al 2018 studied the scfs in concrete ﬁlled steel tubular t joints they simulated the interaction between the steel members and concrete with the contact modeling zhao and zhang 2007 conducted significant investigations on frp strengthened steel structures also fu et al 2016 and prashob et al 2018 used the contact for modeling the interaction between the frp and steel member in tubular joints hosseini et al 2019a and 2019b numerically studied the scfs in t joints with frp under basic loads hosseini et al 2020 experimentally and numerically studied the scfs in t connections reinforced with frp under axially compressive load they showed that this method can result in the decrement of the scfs tong et al 2019 and xu et al 2020 experimentally and numerically studied the scfs in k connections with carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp they proposed some formulas for determining the scfs in k joints under axial load nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 evaluated the scfs in tubular t y joints with gfrp under compression they proposed two equations for determining the scfs in the present paper the scfs in tubular t y connections strengthened with frp under opb load are studied and discussed because there was not any investigation on the scfs in y joints with frp in addition no formula was available for determining the scfs in the t y connections reinforced with frp under opb load hence there was an essential requirement for further research so that more detailed guidelines on scf assessment in the t y connections strengthened with frp under opb load can be formulated which is the impetus of this research work in this work in the first step the fe model was introduced and verified by against the test results provided in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of lloyd s register lr formulas uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 and the experimental test results provided by tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 in the next step 263 fe models were generated fig 1 32 of these 263 fe models which were unreinforced t y connections were compared with the predictions of the proposed equations in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 in the next step by using these 263fe models the role and important of the frp layers the connection geometry and the brace angle were investigated on the scfs in the t y connections under opb load finally a parametric formula was proposed for the prediction of the scfs in t y connections strengthened with the frp applicability of the proposed formula was validated according to the experimental data and the uk department of energy 1983 standard 2 fe modeling the details of the weld proﬁle according to the american welding society aws 2015 are listed in table 1 because of the intricate shape of the brace chord intersecting curve it is very hard to exactly model the weld profile moreover a few simplifying techniques provided by lee 1999a b and chiew et al 1999 were used to model an adequately accurate weld proﬁle ansys software package v19 0 was used for the study for meshing of the weld chord and brace members the element type solid186 was used the solid186 element is described by 20 nodes having three degrees of freedom per node the frp layers were modeled using the shell element 281 the shell 281 element is described by eight nodes having six degrees of freedom each node the shell elements were created from the area elements of the joint so that the meshes of the frp layers were similar to those of the steel area for modeling number of frp layers fig 2 different shell sections were created in ansys ansys preprocessor sections shell lay up add edit create shell sections after that because of the change in the direction of the frp layers the orientation of the layers was set according to fig 3 this procedure is performed in the create shell sections ansys preprocessor sections shell lay up add edit create shell sections table 2 is used for defining the material of these frp layers moreover the perfect bonding was considered between the frp layers also for simulating the behavior of the frp layers and steel members the contact was modeled to guarantee the mesh quality a sub zone mesh generation method was used during the fe modeling in this method the entire structure is divided into several different zones according to the computational requirements the mesh of each zone is generated separately using different densities and then the mesh of complete model is produced by merging the meshes of all the sub zones this technique can easily control the mesh quantity and quality and avoid badly distorted elements hence two layers of elements were generated in the wall thickness direction as research works conducted by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 also the mesh size of the chord members and frp layers along the extrapolation direction was one tenth of the chord wall thickness t 10 fig 2 as research work carried out by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 to give an example in the joints with d 0 3 m γ 15 θ 90 β 0 5 τ 0 5 α 16 fig 2 the mesh size of the chord members and frp layers along the extrapolation direction is 0 001 m moreover the mesh size is gradually coarse at the zones away from the hot spots locations to save computational time bao et al 2020a for example the areas on which the frp was applied had 10 mm in dimension in comparison to the extrapolation region but still fine enough to deliver the required computational accuracy hosseini et al 2020 a meshed frp strengthened tubular t connection is showed in fig 2 moreover fig 3 shows the order and number of frp layers in the layup and the orientation for modeling the opb load two parallel concentrated forces were used at the brace end fig 4 for the boundary condition of the chord ends morgan and lee 1998 showed that the influence of the chord end restraints is only remarkable for the connections with α 8 for high β and γ values which do not commonly occur in practice besides in offshore tubular structures the chord end ﬁxity conditions of tubular connections change from approximately ﬁxed to approximately pinned with generally being closer to approximately ﬁxed efthymiou 1988 for these reasons in the present paper as previous research works conducted on the scfs in tubular joints ahmadi and zavvar 2016 bao et al 2020b hosseini et al 2020 nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 both of the chord ends were fixed fig 4 two parameters α and α b are used for defining the length of the chord and brace the α is equal to 2l d where the l and d are the chord length and diameter respectively also α b is equal to 2 l d where the l and d are the brace length and diameter respectively efthymiou 1988 indicated that enough long chord α 12 should be applied to ensure that the stresses at the brace chord junction are not affected by the chord s boundary conditions for this reason in this paper the α is equal to 16 the same as research works conducted on the tubular joints by ahmadi and zavvar 2016 also chang and dover 1999 showed that the brace length has no influence on hot spot stress when the parameter α b is greater than the critical value approximately 6 in this work in order to avoid the influence of short brace length a realistic value of α b 8 was chosen for all connections the same as research works conducted on the tubular joints by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 in this research to resolve the contact that occurred between the bottom surface of the frp layers and the outer surface of the members chord weld and brace the ansys contact ability was used to simulate the interaction between them in problems involving contact between two boundaries one of them is usually defined to be to the contact surface and the other is the target surface in this work the outer surfaces of the members were chosen as the contact surface and inner surfaces of the frp sheets were selected as the target surface to consider the crucial role of contact in transferring load between frp and members flexible to flexible surface to surface contact elements were used to simulate the interaction the behavior of the contact surface was defined to be always bonded contact was set to be detected on nodes normal to target also no actual contact value was supposed by the user also the type of contact constraint was auto assembly detection load step number for ramping was 1 for determining the scfs in the tubular connections the linearly static analysis is suitable jiang et al 2018 the hot spot is introduced as the point along the weld toe where the extrapolated stress has a peak value jiang et al 2018 in the present work as recommended by the api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 the stress component perpendicular to the weld toe is chosen to carry out the line extrapolation for determining the hss the zone from which the stresses have to be extrapolated the so called extrapolation region iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 is depicted in fig 5 the hot spot stress hss along the connection intersection fig 6 can be extrapolated by the following equation jiang et al 2018 σ w 1 4 σ e 1 0 4 σ e 2 the σ e1 and the σ e2 are the stresses at the first and the second extrapolation positions in the perpendicular direction to the weld toe respectively on the other hands σ e1 and σ e2 are the stresses at a distance of 0 4t and 1 4t from the weld toe in the direction perpendicular to the weld toe respectively the stress at an extrapolation point is determined by eq 2 2 σ e σ n 1 σ n 2 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ 2 σ n 2 in eq 2 σ n 1 and σ n 2 are the nodal stresses at the instant near of the extrapolation point along the direction perpendicular to the weld toe σ 1 and σ 2 are the distance between the weld toe and the nodes δ is equal to 0 4t and 1 4t for the first and second extrapolation points respectively fig 4 the scf value can be determined by eq 3 3 scf σ w σ n where σ n is the nominal stress for a tubular connection under opb moment m o σ n can be theoretically determined by 4 σ n 32 d m o π d 4 d 2 t 4 to facilitate the scf determination a macro has been written in the ansys parametric design language apdl in this macro the formulation of the scfs is conducted in addition the input data are the node numbers on the chord thickness at the weld toe and the node numbers inside the extrapolation region fig 4 these nodes are defined by the graphic user interface gui 3 verification as far as the authors are aware no experimental data in the literature on the scf in t y connections strengthened with frp subjected to bending load due to this reason the following experimental results and empirical formulas are used the experimental test results reported in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 on the tubular t y joints under opb load also the present fe model is verified by the experimental test results provided by tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 on the t and k joint with frp under axially loaded brace different from the loading condition in the present study the geometrical parameters of the specimens are tabulated in table 3 all of the numerical simulation details were the same as details of the experimental tests also in the parametric section of this paper the results of all 32 unreinforced t y joints will be compared with the predictions of proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 fig 7 s1 s4 shows the results of the present work the test results provided in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of the derived equations in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 for the un reinforced t y joints under opb load comparing shows the present fe model can well predict the scfs in chs t y joints subjected to opb load also fig 7 s5 s9 shows the comparison of scfs in the crown and saddle points of the t and k joints with and without with frp in axial load the comparison indicates that the present fe model can accurately predict the scfs in saddle and crown points of tubular joints strengthened with frp therefore it can be concluded that the present fe model is capable of simulating the scfs of t y connection with and without the frp subjected to opb load with enough accuracy 4 parametric investigation 4 1 details of the parametric study based on the verified 3 d fe models in the ansys software package v19 0 263 fe models were produced to investigate the effect of the frp layers frp materials the brace inclination angle and the connection geometry on the scf ratios r frp r frp scffrp scfu scffrp is the scf in the strengthened joint and scfu is the scf in the associated un strengthened joint the fe models include seven different τ τ 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 five various β β 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 five various θ θ 30 45 60 75 90 five various γ γ 10 15 20 25 30 six different frp materials table 2 and three various η η 4 8 12 values these include the practical ranges of the non dimension parameters generally found in tubular connections of offshore structures the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of steel materials are 207 gpa and 0 3 respectively also the material parameters of the frp are listed in table 2 the thickness of each frp layer t frp is equal to 0 0005 m the weld material was assumed to have the same properties as the steel members xu et al 2020 nassiraei 2020 a new parameter r frp is introduced for better comparison between the results of the reinforced joints and the results of the unreinforced joints it is equal to the ratio of the scf in the reinforced joints to the scf in the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun also the scfs of the unreinforced joints in the parametric study are compared with the predictions of the proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997 api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 the results are listed in table 4 table 4 shows that the results obtained from the present fe models for unreinforced t y joins under opb load are reasonable 4 2 effect of the θ and frp layer number on the scf ratio re the parameter θ is the angle between the brace member and chord member this section investigates the effects of the θ and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters for this aim 30 fe models with five different values of the θ θ 30 45 60 and 90 two different values of the γ γ 15 and 30 and three different values of the frp layer number η η 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 2 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined the reason of these used values for the α and α b is discussed in section 2 also β is equal to 0 3 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 06 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 and 20 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 hence the brace thickness is equal to the chord thickness fig 8 shows that the raise of the frp layer numbers leads to the decrement of the scf ratios in all the connections with small and big γ because the increment of the frp layer number leads to the redistribution of stresses in frp and metal substrate hence the hss decreases by the increase of the frp layer number the decrease of the hss leads to the decrease of the scfs because the nominal stress is constant hence the use of the frp with more layers can more improve fatigue behavior of the t y joints under opb load also the tendency of the scf ratio diagrams for 4 8 and 12 frp layers are same the results show that the scf of an frp strengthened joint can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint also fig 8 shows that in the y joints with 60 θ 30 the effect of the θ on the scf ratios is not remarkable but in the joints with θ 60 the increment of the θ leads to the raise of the scf ratios 4 3 influence of the β and frp layer number on the scf ratios the parameter β is the ratio of brace diameter d to chord diameter d therefore the increase of the β in the models having constant value of the chord diameter results in the increase of the brace diameter four charts in fig 9 depict the change of the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun because of the change in the value of β and the number of frp layers η in the connections with small and large γ the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 2 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 10 and 30 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 7 the results show that the raise of the frp layer number leads to the remarkable reduction of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp layer number leads to the increase in the stiffness distribution along the brace chord intersection therefore the use of 12 layers leads to more decrease of the stress rather than the use of 4 or 8 layers for an instance in the connections with γ 10 β 0 4 τ 0 7 and θ 45 fig 9a the raise the frp layer numbers from 4 to 12 leads to the reduction of the scf ratios from 0 92 to 0 74 fig 9a and b shows that in the joints with big γ fig 9b the effect of the β on the scf ratios can be ignored however in the joints with small γ and big frp layer number fig 9a the increase of the β from 0 4 to 0 6 leads to the considerable decrease of the scf ratios because the changes in the relative diameter of the joints leads to a change in the orientation of the brace and the surface of chord this change directly affects the force transfer path in the chord also when the β is equal to 0 6 this orientation is big in other hand the joints are under opb load and the saddle points tolerate main stress in this specific situation the use of 4 or 8 frp layer numbers due to small stiffness could not efficiently participate in transferring load because the stiffness of chord member in the joints with small γ is very high fig 9a but the use of 12 frp layers could well transfer the load due to high frp thickness it should be noted that this is notable in the joints with small γ because of the high chord wall stiffness 4 4 influence of the τ and η on the scf ratios the parameter τ is the ratio of brace thickness t to chord thickness t hence the increase of the τ in models having a constant value of the γ leads to the increase of the brace thickness in this section the effects of the τ and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters are investigated for this aim 24 fe models with three various values of the τ τ 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 two different values of the β β 0 2 and 0 6 three different values of frp layer numbers η η 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 2 and 0 6 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 1 and 0 3 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 30 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 fig 10 a and b shows that in all joints with different β and frp layer numbers the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun can be ignored moreover the results show that the scf ratios of all joints are smaller than 1 0 also the raise of the frp layer number results in the significant reduction of the scf ratios because the rise of the frp layer number results in the redistribution of stresses in metal substrate and frp hence it results in the decrease of the hss to give an example in the connections with τ 0 4 θ 75 γ 30 and β 0 2 fig 10a when the joints are reinforced with 4 and 12 frp layer number γ the scf ratios are equal to 0 88 and 0 63 respectively moreover the tendency of the scf ratio diagrams for 4 8 and 12 frp sheets are same 4 5 influence of the γ and the η on the scfs and the scf ratios the parameter γ is the ratio of radius to thickness of the chord hence the increase of the γ in models having constant value of chord diameter leads to the decrease of chord thickness two charts in fig 11 a and b depict the change of the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun in the saddle position because of the change in the value of γ and η the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 3 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 5 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 15 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 20 and 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 5 and 1 0 fig 11a and b shows that the increment of the γ leads to the reduction of the scf ratios r frp this phenomenon is clearer in the joist with bigger frp layer numbers to give an example in the joints with θ 90 β 0 5 τ 1 0 fig 11b when the joint is reinforced with four frp layers the raise of the γ from 15 to 25 leads to the reduction of the r frp from 0 88 to 0 84 but when the same joint is reinforced with 12 frp layers the raise of the γ from 15 to 25 leads to the reduction of the r frp from 0 66 to 0 52 also the increase of the frp layer leads to the decrease of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp sheet number leads to the redistribution of stresses in the chord member and frp sheets hence the stress at the saddle point reduces by the increase of the frp layer number the decrease of the hss results in the decrement of the scfs since the nominal stress does not change with the change of the frp layer number also the same tendency can be seen in the scf ratio diagrams with different frp layer numbers hence the reinforcing of the joints with big frp layer numbers results in the remarkable reduction of the scfs and the raise of the fatigue life 4 6 effect of the frp materials ξ and the η on the scf ratios in this section the effect of frp material parameters on the scf ratios is investigated the scf ratios are studied in the joints with different geometrical details and different frp layers fig 12 shows the scf ratios in fig 12a c and 12e τ 1 0 θ 90 γ 25 and β 0 5 the chord diameter is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 5 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 25 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 to normalize elastic parameters the elastic and shear modulus of materials were divided by those of steel fig 12 shows that among the elastic constants of the frp material a consistent relationship only observes between e 1 and scf ratios also the amount of the e 1 is notably bigger than the other elastic parameters of the frp material see table 2 hence e 1 has a higher contribution to capacity of the frp materials as a result e 1 can be taken as a representative parameter for investigating the effect of frp materials on scf ratios 4 7 appropriate place for the insertion of fig 12 the effects of the frp materials ξ ξ e 1 e s and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters are indicated in fig 13 the e 1 and e s are the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers and the elastic modulus of the steel respectively several fe models were generated and analyzed the material parameters of the frp are listed in table 2 also the elastic modulus of the steel is kept constant in all of the joints in fig 13 the chord diameter is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined in fig 13a and b β 0 4 θ 90 τ 1 γ 15 and 25 β is equal to 0 4 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 20 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 and 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 hence the brace thickness is equal to chord thickness also fig 13c and d presents the result for the joints with γ 20 θ 60 τ 0 9 β 0 3 and 0 6 fig 13e and f presents the result for the joints with β 0 3 γ 15 τ 1 θ 75 and 90 also fig 13g and h shows the results for the joints with β 0 3 γ 30 τ 1 θ 75 and 90 the results show that in the all joints with different joint geometry the increase of the frp layer number with all six different materials leads to the considerable decrease of the scf ratios since the rise of the frp layer number leads to the redistribution of stresses in frp and metal substrate this is more significant for the joints with more elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 because the rise of the e 1 results in the more its contribution to stiffness to give an example in the joints with β 0 4 θ 90 τ 1 γ 15 η 12 fig 13a the scf ratio for the joints with gv glass vinyl ester and ct 300 carbon epoxy t300 5208 are 0 85 and 0 57 respectively hence the increase of the ξ leads to the significant decrease of the scf ratios also it can be concluded that the scfs in the joints with cfrp is lower than that in the corresponding joints with gfrp 5 parametric design formula in the present study a statistical analysis on the results is conducted hence an individual parametric equation is proposed for determining the scfs in tubular t y joints with frp under opb load in order to develop this parametric equation multiple nonlinear regression analyses were performed by the statistical software package spss v22 values of dependent variable i e scfs and independent variables constitute the input data imported in the form of a matrix every row of this matrix involves the information about the scf values in an frp reinforced t y joint having specific geometrical properties the input matrix for derivation of the equation had 216 rows equation the number of reinforced joints and seven columns equation the number of dependent and independent variables hence the whole fe scfs database was arranged as 1512 input matrices when the dependent and independent variables are defined a model expression must be built with defined parameters parameters of the model expression are unknown coefficients and exponents the researcher must specify a starting value for each parameter preferably as close as possible to the expected final solution poor starting values can result in failure to converge or in convergence on a solution that is local rather than global or is physically impossible various model expressions must be built to derive a parametric equation having a high coefficient of determination after conducting a large number of nonlinear analyses following parametric equation is proposed for predicting the scf in t y joints reinforced with frp under opb load 5 scffrp 0 826γ 1 35 β 0 698 τ 0 2 θ 0 154 τ frp 0 075 ξ

the τ frp is equal to ηt frp t the η is frp layer number also t frp is the thickness of each frp layer and it is equal to 0 0005 m the ξ is equal to e1 es the e 1 and e s are the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers and the elastic modulus of the steel respectively r 2 indicates the factor of determination and its value for the derived formula is regarded to be acceptable considering the

or 5 p r 0 8 7 5 the equation is considered as borderline and engineering assessment should be used for further evaluation otherwise the proposed equation cannot be accepted because it is too optimistic because for a mean ﬁt formula there is a large number percentage of under prediction bomel consulting engineers 1994 recommended that the requirement for connections with p r 1 0 can be completely eliminated in the evaluating of the parametric equation evaluating eq 5 according to the uk department of energy 1983 standard is listed in table 5 it can be seen that eq 5 is accepted 6 conclusions a set of 263 fe models validated against available experimental data and empirical equations was generated to investigate the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun in the strengthened t y connections under out of plane bending opb load the following conclusions can be drawn the scf of a tubular t y joint reinforced with fiber reinforced polymer frp can be down to 29 of the scf of the corresponding un reinforced joint also in all joints with various values of the β γ τ and θ the raise of the frp layer number leads to the reduction of the scfs also this issue is more remarkable in the reinforced joints with large γ the increase of the γ results in the decrease of the scf ratios this phenomenon is more significant in the joints with bigger frp layer number also in the tubular y joints with the brace inclination angle θ between 30 and 60 the effect of the θ on the scf ratios is not remarkable also the influence of the τ on the scf ratios can be ignored the scf ratios in the t y joints reinforced with cfrp is lower than that in the corresponding t y joints reinforced with gfrp also the increase of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 leads to the more decrease of the scf ratios a parametric formula was proposed for determining the scfs in tubular t y joints strengthened with frp under opb load relatively high coefficients of determination r 2 and satisfaction of acceptance criteria proposed by the uk doe guaranty the accuracy of the proposed equation consequently this equation can reliably be used for

21106,in this paper the stress concentration factors scfs in tubular t y connections strengthened with ﬁber reinforced polymer frp under opb are investigated for this aim 263 fe models of t y joints with frp were generated and analyzed in the fe models the contact between the frp sheets and the members was modeled by using the generated fe models the effect of the frp layers the brace inclination angle and the joint geometry on the scf ratios of the reinforced to the corresponding un reinforced joints were investigated results showed that the scf of an frp strengthened joint can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint moreover the increase of the frp layer number results in a considerable decrease of the scfs also this phenomenon is more significant in the joints with larger γ moreover the increase of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers results in the remarkable decrease of the scf ratios finally the fe results were used to propose a design equation

fabrication are advantages for welded tubular structures to these structures to be applied extensively in oﬀshore jacket type platforms shao et al 2017 but because of the cyclic loading such as the wave loading the tubular joints are exposed to serious fatigue problem due to the stress concentration problem nie et al 2017 so far some procedures to decrease the stress concentration factor scf in tubular connections have been presented one of these techniques is the ﬁber reinforced polymer frp reinforcement method this method can be a valuable choice for such rehabilitation purposes in old and new structures a tubular connection can be reinforced by adding frp layers to the outside of the chord weld and brace resulting in what is called frp reinforced tubular joints fig 1 there are available several researches on the scfs in the unreinforced tubular t y joins under axial out of plane bending opb and in plane bending ipb loads e g hellier et al 1990 chang and dover 1996 1999 lee 1999a b shao 2007 thandavamoorthy 2009 liu et al 2015 also n diaye et al 2007 2009 predicted the location of hot spot stress t connections under opb load bao et al 2019 and 2020a proposed some formulas for calculating the scfs in three planar tubular y joints under axial and opb loads liu et al 2016 studied the scfs in multi planar dx joint under opb load they showed that the hotspot positions of the dx connections commonly happened at the saddle points ahmadi and zavvar 2016 numerically studied the effect of loaded out of plane braces on the values of the scf in tubular kt joints the scfs in overlapped tubular joints are studied by gao 2006 gho et al 2006 and zhang et al 2018 they proposed some formulas for predicting the scfs morgan and lee 1998 and shao et al 2009 derived some parametric equations for calculating the scfs in tubular k joints under opb load musa et al 2018 and musa and mashiri 2019 experimentally and numerically evaluated the scfs in t joints with concrete under opb loads they proposed some safe equations for determining the scfs zheng et al 2018 studied the scfs in concrete ﬁlled steel tubular t joints they simulated the interaction between the steel members and concrete with the contact modeling zhao and zhang 2007 conducted significant investigations on frp strengthened steel structures also fu et al 2016 and prashob et al 2018 used the contact for modeling the interaction between the frp and steel member in tubular joints hosseini et al 2019a and 2019b numerically studied the scfs in t joints with frp under basic loads hosseini et al 2020 experimentally and numerically studied the scfs in t connections reinforced with frp under axially compressive load they showed that this method can result in the decrement of the scfs tong et al 2019 and xu et al 2020 experimentally and numerically studied the scfs in k connections with carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp they proposed some formulas for determining the scfs in k joints under axial load nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 evaluated the scfs in tubular t y joints with gfrp under compression they proposed two equations for determining the scfs in the present paper the scfs in tubular t y connections strengthened with frp under opb load are studied and discussed because there was not any investigation on the scfs in y joints with frp in addition no formula was available for determining the scfs in the t y connections reinforced with frp under opb load hence there was an essential requirement for further research so that more detailed guidelines on scf assessment in the t y connections strengthened with frp under opb load can be formulated which is the impetus of this research work in this work in the first step the fe model was introduced and verified by against the test results provided in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of lloyd s register lr formulas uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 and the experimental test results provided by tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 in the next step 263 fe models were generated fig 1 32 of these 263 fe models which were unreinforced t y connections were compared with the predictions of the proposed equations in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 in the next step by using these 263fe models the role and important of the frp layers the connection geometry and the brace angle were investigated on the scfs in the t y connections under opb load finally a parametric formula was proposed for the prediction of the scfs in t y connections strengthened with the frp applicability of the proposed formula was validated according to the experimental data and the uk department of energy 1983 standard 2 fe modeling the details of the weld proﬁle according to the american welding society aws 2015 are listed in table 1 because of the intricate shape of the brace chord intersecting curve it is very hard to exactly model the weld profile moreover a few simplifying techniques provided by lee 1999a b and chiew et al 1999 were used to model an adequately accurate weld proﬁle ansys software package v19 0 was used for the study for meshing of the weld chord and brace members the element type solid186 was used the solid186 element is described by 20 nodes having three degrees of freedom per node the frp layers were modeled using the shell element 281 the shell 281 element is described by eight nodes having six degrees of freedom each node the shell elements were created from the area elements of the joint so that the meshes of the frp layers were similar to those of the steel area for modeling number of frp layers fig 2 different shell sections were created in ansys ansys preprocessor sections shell lay up add edit create shell sections after that because of the change in the direction of the frp layers the orientation of the layers was set according to fig 3 this procedure is performed in the create shell sections ansys preprocessor sections shell lay up add edit create shell sections table 2 is used for defining the material of these frp layers moreover the perfect bonding was considered between the frp layers also for simulating the behavior of the frp layers and steel members the contact was modeled to guarantee the mesh quality a sub zone mesh generation method was used during the fe modeling in this method the entire structure is divided into several different zones according to the computational requirements the mesh of each zone is generated separately using different densities and then the mesh of complete model is produced by merging the meshes of all the sub zones this technique can easily control the mesh quantity and quality and avoid badly distorted elements hence two layers of elements were generated in the wall thickness direction as research works conducted by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 also the mesh size of the chord members and frp layers along the extrapolation direction was one tenth of the chord wall thickness t 10 fig 2 as research work carried out by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 to give an example in the joints with d 0 3 m γ 15 θ 90 β 0 5 τ 0 5 α 16 fig 2 the mesh size of the chord members and frp layers along the extrapolation direction is 0 001 m moreover the mesh size is gradually coarse at the zones away from the hot spots locations to save computational time bao et al 2020a for example the areas on which the frp was applied had 10 mm in dimension in comparison to the extrapolation region but still fine enough to deliver the required computational accuracy hosseini et al 2020 a meshed frp strengthened tubular t connection is showed in fig 2 moreover fig 3 shows the order and number of frp layers in the layup and the orientation for modeling the opb load two parallel concentrated forces were used at the brace end fig 4 for the boundary condition of the chord ends morgan and lee 1998 showed that the influence of the chord end restraints is only remarkable for the connections with α 8 for high β and γ values which do not commonly occur in practice besides in offshore tubular structures the chord end ﬁxity conditions of tubular connections change from approximately ﬁxed to approximately pinned with generally being closer to approximately ﬁxed efthymiou 1988 for these reasons in the present paper as previous research works conducted on the scfs in tubular joints ahmadi and zavvar 2016 bao et al 2020b hosseini et al 2020 nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 both of the chord ends were fixed fig 4 two parameters α and α b are used for defining the length of the chord and brace the α is equal to 2l d where the l and d are the chord length and diameter respectively also α b is equal to 2 l d where the l and d are the brace length and diameter respectively efthymiou 1988 indicated that enough long chord α 12 should be applied to ensure that the stresses at the brace chord junction are not affected by the chord s boundary conditions for this reason in this paper the α is equal to 16 the same as research works conducted on the tubular joints by ahmadi and zavvar 2016 also chang and dover 1999 showed that the brace length has no influence on hot spot stress when the parameter α b is greater than the critical value approximately 6 in this work in order to avoid the influence of short brace length a realistic value of α b 8 was chosen for all connections the same as research works conducted on the tubular joints by nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 in this research to resolve the contact that occurred between the bottom surface of the frp layers and the outer surface of the members chord weld and brace the ansys contact ability was used to simulate the interaction between them in problems involving contact between two boundaries one of them is usually defined to be to the contact surface and the other is the target surface in this work the outer surfaces of the members were chosen as the contact surface and inner surfaces of the frp sheets were selected as the target surface to consider the crucial role of contact in transferring load between frp and members flexible to flexible surface to surface contact elements were used to simulate the interaction the behavior of the contact surface was defined to be always bonded contact was set to be detected on nodes normal to target also no actual contact value was supposed by the user also the type of contact constraint was auto assembly detection load step number for ramping was 1 for determining the scfs in the tubular connections the linearly static analysis is suitable jiang et al 2018 the hot spot is introduced as the point along the weld toe where the extrapolated stress has a peak value jiang et al 2018 in the present work as recommended by the api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 the stress component perpendicular to the weld toe is chosen to carry out the line extrapolation for determining the hss the zone from which the stresses have to be extrapolated the so called extrapolation region iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 is depicted in fig 5 the hot spot stress hss along the connection intersection fig 6 can be extrapolated by the following equation jiang et al 2018 σ w 1 4 σ e 1 0 4 σ e 2 the σ e1 and the σ e2 are the stresses at the first and the second extrapolation positions in the perpendicular direction to the weld toe respectively on the other hands σ e1 and σ e2 are the stresses at a distance of 0 4t and 1 4t from the weld toe in the direction perpendicular to the weld toe respectively the stress at an extrapolation point is determined by eq 2 2 σ e σ n 1 σ n 2 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ 2 σ n 2 in eq 2 σ n 1 and σ n 2 are the nodal stresses at the instant near of the extrapolation point along the direction perpendicular to the weld toe σ 1 and σ 2 are the distance between the weld toe and the nodes δ is equal to 0 4t and 1 4t for the first and second extrapolation points respectively fig 4 the scf value can be determined by eq 3 3 scf σ w σ n where σ n is the nominal stress for a tubular connection under opb moment m o σ n can be theoretically determined by 4 σ n 32 d m o π d 4 d 2 t 4 to facilitate the scf determination a macro has been written in the ansys parametric design language apdl in this macro the formulation of the scfs is conducted in addition the input data are the node numbers on the chord thickness at the weld toe and the node numbers inside the extrapolation region fig 4 these nodes are defined by the graphic user interface gui 3 verification as far as the authors are aware no experimental data in the literature on the scf in t y connections strengthened with frp subjected to bending load due to this reason the following experimental results and empirical formulas are used the experimental test results reported in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 on the tubular t y joints under opb load also the present fe model is verified by the experimental test results provided by tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 on the t and k joint with frp under axially loaded brace different from the loading condition in the present study the geometrical parameters of the specimens are tabulated in table 3 all of the numerical simulation details were the same as details of the experimental tests also in the parametric section of this paper the results of all 32 unreinforced t y joints will be compared with the predictions of proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 fig 7 s1 s4 shows the results of the present work the test results provided in ukosrp i 1980 ukosrp ii 1986 jissp 1986 hellier et al 1990 and the predictions of the derived equations in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997a b api american petroleum institute 2005 cidect zhao et al 2000 for the un reinforced t y joints under opb load comparing shows the present fe model can well predict the scfs in chs t y joints subjected to opb load also fig 7 s5 s9 shows the comparison of scfs in the crown and saddle points of the t and k joints with and without with frp in axial load the comparison indicates that the present fe model can accurately predict the scfs in saddle and crown points of tubular joints strengthened with frp therefore it can be concluded that the present fe model is capable of simulating the scfs of t y connection with and without the frp subjected to opb load with enough accuracy 4 parametric investigation 4 1 details of the parametric study based on the verified 3 d fe models in the ansys software package v19 0 263 fe models were produced to investigate the effect of the frp layers frp materials the brace inclination angle and the connection geometry on the scf ratios r frp r frp scffrp scfu scffrp is the scf in the strengthened joint and scfu is the scf in the associated un strengthened joint the fe models include seven different τ τ 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 five various β β 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 five various θ θ 30 45 60 75 90 five various γ γ 10 15 20 25 30 six different frp materials table 2 and three various η η 4 8 12 values these include the practical ranges of the non dimension parameters generally found in tubular connections of offshore structures the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of steel materials are 207 gpa and 0 3 respectively also the material parameters of the frp are listed in table 2 the thickness of each frp layer t frp is equal to 0 0005 m the weld material was assumed to have the same properties as the steel members xu et al 2020 nassiraei 2020 a new parameter r frp is introduced for better comparison between the results of the reinforced joints and the results of the unreinforced joints it is equal to the ratio of the scf in the reinforced joints to the scf in the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun also the scfs of the unreinforced joints in the parametric study are compared with the predictions of the proposed formulas in the lr uk health and safety executive 1997 api american petroleum institute 2005 and cidect zhao et al 2000 the results are listed in table 4 table 4 shows that the results obtained from the present fe models for unreinforced t y joins under opb load are reasonable 4 2 effect of the θ and frp layer number on the scf ratio re the parameter θ is the angle between the brace member and chord member this section investigates the effects of the θ and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters for this aim 30 fe models with five different values of the θ θ 30 45 60 and 90 two different values of the γ γ 15 and 30 and three different values of the frp layer number η η 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 2 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined the reason of these used values for the α and α b is discussed in section 2 also β is equal to 0 3 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 06 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 and 20 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 hence the brace thickness is equal to the chord thickness fig 8 shows that the raise of the frp layer numbers leads to the decrement of the scf ratios in all the connections with small and big γ because the increment of the frp layer number leads to the redistribution of stresses in frp and metal substrate hence the hss decreases by the increase of the frp layer number the decrease of the hss leads to the decrease of the scfs because the nominal stress is constant hence the use of the frp with more layers can more improve fatigue behavior of the t y joints under opb load also the tendency of the scf ratio diagrams for 4 8 and 12 frp layers are same the results show that the scf of an frp strengthened joint can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint also fig 8 shows that in the y joints with 60 θ 30 the effect of the θ on the scf ratios is not remarkable but in the joints with θ 60 the increment of the θ leads to the raise of the scf ratios 4 3 influence of the β and frp layer number on the scf ratios the parameter β is the ratio of brace diameter d to chord diameter d therefore the increase of the β in the models having constant value of the chord diameter results in the increase of the brace diameter four charts in fig 9 depict the change of the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun because of the change in the value of β and the number of frp layers η in the connections with small and large γ the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 2 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 10 and 30 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 7 the results show that the raise of the frp layer number leads to the remarkable reduction of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp layer number leads to the increase in the stiffness distribution along the brace chord intersection therefore the use of 12 layers leads to more decrease of the stress rather than the use of 4 or 8 layers for an instance in the connections with γ 10 β 0 4 τ 0 7 and θ 45 fig 9a the raise the frp layer numbers from 4 to 12 leads to the reduction of the scf ratios from 0 92 to 0 74 fig 9a and b shows that in the joints with big γ fig 9b the effect of the β on the scf ratios can be ignored however in the joints with small γ and big frp layer number fig 9a the increase of the β from 0 4 to 0 6 leads to the considerable decrease of the scf ratios because the changes in the relative diameter of the joints leads to a change in the orientation of the brace and the surface of chord this change directly affects the force transfer path in the chord also when the β is equal to 0 6 this orientation is big in other hand the joints are under opb load and the saddle points tolerate main stress in this specific situation the use of 4 or 8 frp layer numbers due to small stiffness could not efficiently participate in transferring load because the stiffness of chord member in the joints with small γ is very high fig 9a but the use of 12 frp layers could well transfer the load due to high frp thickness it should be noted that this is notable in the joints with small γ because of the high chord wall stiffness 4 4 influence of the τ and η on the scf ratios the parameter τ is the ratio of brace thickness t to chord thickness t hence the increase of the τ in models having a constant value of the γ leads to the increase of the brace thickness in this section the effects of the τ and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters are investigated for this aim 24 fe models with three various values of the τ τ 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 two different values of the β β 0 2 and 0 6 three different values of frp layer numbers η η 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 2 and 0 6 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 1 and 0 3 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 30 hence the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 fig 10 a and b shows that in all joints with different β and frp layer numbers the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun can be ignored moreover the results show that the scf ratios of all joints are smaller than 1 0 also the raise of the frp layer number results in the significant reduction of the scf ratios because the rise of the frp layer number results in the redistribution of stresses in metal substrate and frp hence it results in the decrease of the hss to give an example in the connections with τ 0 4 θ 75 γ 30 and β 0 2 fig 10a when the joints are reinforced with 4 and 12 frp layer number γ the scf ratios are equal to 0 88 and 0 63 respectively moreover the tendency of the scf ratio diagrams for 4 8 and 12 frp sheets are same 4 5 influence of the γ and the η on the scfs and the scf ratios the parameter γ is the ratio of radius to thickness of the chord hence the increase of the γ in models having constant value of chord diameter leads to the decrease of chord thickness two charts in fig 11 a and b depict the change of the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun in the saddle position because of the change in the value of γ and η the frp material glass epoxy kept constant table 2 the chord diameter in the fe models of this subsection is equal to 0 3 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 5 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 15 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 20 and 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 0 5 and 1 0 fig 11a and b shows that the increment of the γ leads to the reduction of the scf ratios r frp this phenomenon is clearer in the joist with bigger frp layer numbers to give an example in the joints with θ 90 β 0 5 τ 1 0 fig 11b when the joint is reinforced with four frp layers the raise of the γ from 15 to 25 leads to the reduction of the r frp from 0 88 to 0 84 but when the same joint is reinforced with 12 frp layers the raise of the γ from 15 to 25 leads to the reduction of the r frp from 0 66 to 0 52 also the increase of the frp layer leads to the decrease of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp sheet number leads to the redistribution of stresses in the chord member and frp sheets hence the stress at the saddle point reduces by the increase of the frp layer number the decrease of the hss results in the decrement of the scfs since the nominal stress does not change with the change of the frp layer number also the same tendency can be seen in the scf ratio diagrams with different frp layer numbers hence the reinforcing of the joints with big frp layer numbers results in the remarkable reduction of the scfs and the raise of the fatigue life 4 6 effect of the frp materials ξ and the η on the scf ratios in this section the effect of frp material parameters on the scf ratios is investigated the scf ratios are studied in the joints with different geometrical details and different frp layers fig 12 shows the scf ratios in fig 12a c and 12e τ 1 0 θ 90 γ 25 and β 0 5 the chord diameter is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined also β is equal to 0 5 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 25 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 to normalize elastic parameters the elastic and shear modulus of materials were divided by those of steel fig 12 shows that among the elastic constants of the frp material a consistent relationship only observes between e 1 and scf ratios also the amount of the e 1 is notably bigger than the other elastic parameters of the frp material see table 2 hence e 1 has a higher contribution to capacity of the frp materials as a result e 1 can be taken as a representative parameter for investigating the effect of frp materials on scf ratios 4 7 appropriate place for the insertion of fig 12 the effects of the frp materials ξ ξ e 1 e s and the frp layer numbers η on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interaction with the other geometrical parameters are indicated in fig 13 the e 1 and e s are the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers and the elastic modulus of the steel respectively several fe models were generated and analyzed the material parameters of the frp are listed in table 2 also the elastic modulus of the steel is kept constant in all of the joints in fig 13 the chord diameter is equal to 0 5 m the α 2l d 16 and α b 2 l d 8 hence the values of the chord and brace length can be determined in fig 13a and b β 0 4 θ 90 τ 1 γ 15 and 25 β is equal to 0 4 therefore the brace diameter is equal to 0 20 m γ γ d 2t is equal to 15 and 25 therefore the chord thickness can be determined also τ τ t t is equal to 1 0 hence the brace thickness is equal to chord thickness also fig 13c and d presents the result for the joints with γ 20 θ 60 τ 0 9 β 0 3 and 0 6 fig 13e and f presents the result for the joints with β 0 3 γ 15 τ 1 θ 75 and 90 also fig 13g and h shows the results for the joints with β 0 3 γ 30 τ 1 θ 75 and 90 the results show that in the all joints with different joint geometry the increase of the frp layer number with all six different materials leads to the considerable decrease of the scf ratios since the rise of the frp layer number leads to the redistribution of stresses in frp and metal substrate this is more significant for the joints with more elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 because the rise of the e 1 results in the more its contribution to stiffness to give an example in the joints with β 0 4 θ 90 τ 1 γ 15 η 12 fig 13a the scf ratio for the joints with gv glass vinyl ester and ct 300 carbon epoxy t300 5208 are 0 85 and 0 57 respectively hence the increase of the ξ leads to the significant decrease of the scf ratios also it can be concluded that the scfs in the joints with cfrp is lower than that in the corresponding joints with gfrp 5 parametric design formula in the present study a statistical analysis on the results is conducted hence an individual parametric equation is proposed for determining the scfs in tubular t y joints with frp under opb load in order to develop this parametric equation multiple nonlinear regression analyses were performed by the statistical software package spss v22 values of dependent variable i e scfs and independent variables constitute the input data imported in the form of a matrix every row of this matrix involves the information about the scf values in an frp reinforced t y joint having specific geometrical properties the input matrix for derivation of the equation had 216 rows equation the number of reinforced joints and seven columns equation the number of dependent and independent variables hence the whole fe scfs database was arranged as 1512 input matrices when the dependent and independent variables are defined a model expression must be built with defined parameters parameters of the model expression are unknown coefficients and exponents the researcher must specify a starting value for each parameter preferably as close as possible to the expected final solution poor starting values can result in failure to converge or in convergence on a solution that is local rather than global or is physically impossible various model expressions must be built to derive a parametric equation having a high coefficient of determination after conducting a large number of nonlinear analyses following parametric equation is proposed for predicting the scf in t y joints reinforced with frp under opb load 5 scffrp 0 826γ 1 35 β 0 698 τ 0 2 θ 0 154 τ frp 0 075 ξ

the τ frp is equal to ηt frp t the η is frp layer number also t frp is the thickness of each frp layer and it is equal to 0 0005 m the ξ is equal to e1 es the e 1 and e s are the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers and the elastic modulus of the steel respectively r 2 indicates the factor of determination and its value for the derived formula is regarded to be acceptable considering the

2 0 965 and fig 14 that the derived formula can be safely used for producing valid results the uk department of energy 1983 suggests the below assessment criteria in the below assessment criteria p r is the ratio of the predicted value to the measured value if p r 1 0 25 and p r 0 8 5 the formula is accepted if also p r 1 5 50 the formula is regarded as generally conservative if 25 p r 1 0 30 and or 5 p r 0 8 7 5 the equation is considered as borderline and engineering assessment should be used for further evaluation otherwise the proposed equation cannot be accepted because it is too optimistic because for a mean ﬁt formula there is a large number percentage of under prediction bomel consulting engineers 1994 recommended that the requirement for connections with p r 1 0 can be completely eliminated in the evaluating of the parametric equation evaluating eq 5 according to the uk department of energy 1983 standard is listed in table 5 it can be seen that eq 5 is accepted 6 conclusions a set of 263 fe models validated against available experimental data and empirical equations was generated to investigate the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced joint r frp scffrp scfun in the strengthened t y connections under out of plane bending opb load the following conclusions can be drawn the scf of a tubular t y joint reinforced with fiber reinforced polymer frp can be down to 29 of the scf of the corresponding un reinforced joint also in all joints with various values of the β γ τ and θ the raise of the frp layer number leads to the reduction of the scfs also this issue is more remarkable in the reinforced joints with large γ the increase of the γ results in the decrease of the scf ratios this phenomenon is more significant in the joints with bigger frp layer number also in the tubular y joints with the brace inclination angle θ between 30 and 60 the effect of the θ on the scf ratios is not remarkable also the influence of the τ on the scf ratios can be ignored the scf ratios in the t y joints reinforced with cfrp is lower than that in the corresponding t y joints reinforced with gfrp also the increase of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 leads to the more decrease of the scf ratios a parametric formula was proposed for determining the scfs in tubular t y joints strengthened with frp under opb load relatively high coefficients of determination r 2 and satisfaction of acceptance criteria proposed by the uk doe guaranty the accuracy of the proposed equation consequently this equation can reliably be used for

21107,this paper aims at investigating the optimum positions and the required flexural rigidity γ rq of a single and two longitudinal web stiffeners of unsymmetric plate girders subjected to pure bending by using gradient based optimization algorithms the optimization procedure is performed into two steps the first step is to maximize the bend buckling coefficient k b generated from eigenvalue buckling analyses and then the second step aims to minimize the flexural rigidity of the stiffeners γ this procedure is implemented using the abaqus2matlab toolbox which allows for the transfer of data between matlab and abaqus and vice versa based on this research the optimum locations of the stiffeners are recommended for the unsymmetric plate girders under pure bending additionally equations are suggested to determine γ rq of the longitudinal web stiffeners of the unsymmetric plate girders these proposed equations are more realistic in the practical designs than those recommended by aashto lrfd specifications and several works in the literature in which γ rq of the longitudinal web stiffeners is determined based on the simply supported plates but not the unsymmetric plate girders

panel aspect ratio ϕ a d 1 introduction in deep plate girders having slender webs longitudinal stiffeners are widely used since the presence of the longitudinal stiffeners can enhance the web strength against bend buckling due to bending stresses by controlling the lateral deflection of the girder webs additionally longitudinally stiffened web can provide improved restraint to the rotation of the compression flanges and consequently result in greatly increased bending strength ziemian 2010 myung et al 2016 research related to longitudinal stiffeners of the plate girders especially their optimum location and γ rq under pure bending has been extensively conducted in the literature plate girders with stiffeners are a common structural component in various structures e g bridges and ship hulls in the latter case stiffened panels and box girders are usually of critical importance for the ultimate strength of conventional cargo ships under longitudinal bending the design of swath small waterplane area twin hull ships against transverse bending due to their special sectional configuration liu et al 2018 and the twin hull inland catamarans which require special design against longitudinal bending due to their shallow draught xu et al 2019 for the steel plate girder with a single longitudinal stiffener many researches have proven that the optimum position of the stiffener is at 0 2d from the compression flange for the symmetric girder assuming longitudinal edges of girder webs are simply supported cooper 1967 azhari and bradford 1993 frank and helwig 1995 maiorana et al 2011 vu et al 2019a among these researches frank and helwig 1995 conducted a series of eigenvalue buckling analyses for the optimum stiffener position of the unsymmetric girder in which the longitudinal edges of the web were presumed to be simply supported based on their research they suggested that the optimum stiffener position is at 0 4d c d c is the web depth in compression in the elastic range regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section in addition they also separately proposed the formulations computing k b of the stiffened webs depending on the stiffener location d s d c 0 4 and d s d c 0 4 which have been adopted by aashto lrfd aashto 2012 the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 is the national standard for the design and construction of bridges in the united states published by the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto the aashto lrfd specifications aashto 2012 for k b of a longitudinally stiffened web plate girder are based on the research of frank and helwig 1995 the equations and the associated optimum stiffener position adopted by aashto lrfd aashto 2012 assume simply supported boundary conditions at the flanges performing numerical investigation of the entire steel plate girder under pure bending cho and shin 2011 reported that the optimum stiffener location is achieved when it is located at around 0 425d c from the compression flange they suggested new equations to calculate k b for cases when d s d c 0 425 and d s d c 0 425 more recently elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 recommended that the optimum position of the stiffener is at around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section it is noteworthy that the optimum stiffener location suggested by cho and shin 2011 elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 is slightly different from aashto lrfd aashto 2012 since they considered the effect of rotational restraints along the web edges due to the presence of the compression flanges regarding the steel plate girder with multiple longitudinal stiffeners researches related to its optimum locations and γ rq are very limited rockey and cook 1965a 1965b conducted an investigation on the optimum locations of multiple longitudinal stiffeners for the plate girders with doubly symmetric section subjected to pure bending in their model the longitudinal edges of the girder web were assumed to be either simply supported or clamped while the vertical edges of the girder web were presumed to be simply supported it was also assumed that the longitudinal stiffeners were symmetrically located about the mid plane of the girder web and their flexural rigidity was finite while torsional rigidity was negligible based on their results the optimum positions of multiple stiffeners up to six were suggested rockey and cook 1965b also proposed equations to calculate γ rq of the stiffeners of the girder webs with aspect ratio lower than 1 6 the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 bridge design specification only mentions about k b the optimum location and γ rq of a single stiffener but not multiple stiffeners it has been reported by viet et al vu et al 2019a that by using two stiffeners k b can increase by as much as 180 while the web thickness necessary for design decreases at least by 61 76 compared to the case in which only a single stiffener is used however engineers still use the aashto lrfd provision to determine k b of the web plates with multiple stiffeners therefore in practical design this provision leads to uneconomical design of plate girders with more than one stiffener as stated above the optimum stiffener position has been completely investigated for the girders with a single stiffener but not for multiple stiffeners however the γ rq of one stiffener for the steel plate girders has not been fully studied since the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 recommends γ rq for the plate girders based on the results obtained from simply supported plates moreover to the best of the authors knowledge the issue of the optimum location and γ rq of multiple stiffeners for the unsymmetric plate girders in which the influence of the flanges are taken into consideration has not yet been adequately addressed in the literature this research aims to examine the optimum locations and γ rq of a single and two longitudinal stiffeners for the unsymmetric plate girders under pure bending using various optimization procedures at first an eigenvalue buckling analysis is performed using abaqus abaqus 2014 after that the optimization algorithm is employed to firstly maximize k b until the optimum stiffener positions are attained and then the same algorithm is used to minimize γ until the optimum stiffener dimensions are achieved the abaqus2matlab toolbox papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a which integrates between abaqus abaqus 2014 and matlab mathworks and inc r 2017 in a loop is utilized for the optimization procedure based on this study the optimum locations of a single and two longitudinal stiffeners are suggested for the unsymmetric plate girders subjected to pure bending in addition formulas to determine γ rq of the longitudinal stiffeners are recommended for practical design purposes the results achieved from these formulas are compared with aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 and previous works to demonstrate their efficiency 2 method of analysis 2 1 linear elastic buckling analysis research related to elastic buckling analysis of stiffened plates have been extensively implemented ranji 2013 song et al 2019 papazafeiropoulos et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in this study the procedure for the solution of the problem of linear elastic buckling of the stiffened plate girders that was followed includes two analysis components a a standard linear perturbation static analysis is firstly carried out in which a unit reference load pattern f is applied to the model the stresses and or loads that are calculated from this static analysis are then used to form the geometric stiffness matrix kg b an eigenvalue analysis is then carried out for the calculation of the buckling loads by solving the following eigenvalue problem 1 k λ k g u 0 equation 1 is solved for the lowest positive value of λ which is the buckling eigenvalue denoted as λ c r as well as the buckling mode shapes eigenvectors u after carrying out the above two analyses the buckling load is calculated as follows 2 f c r λ c r f on the other hand according to classical buckling theory of plates under pure bending the critical buckling load is given as follows 3 f c r k b π 2 e t w 3 12 1 ν 2 d equations 2 and 3 above are used in this study in order to calculate the buckling coefficient k b since for the solution of equation 1 only a small number of the lowest eigenvalues are needed for estimation of the buckling load the lanczos eigensolver was used the lanczos eigensolver was forced to provide only positive eigenvalues minimum eigenvalue is equal to 0 the block size for the lanczos method is equal to 1 whereas the maximum number of block lanczos steps within each lanczos run is equal to 40 besides the boundary conditions that are specified for the applied loads of the static perturbation analysis a and for the definition of the antisymmetry boundary conditions for the buckling modes b are identical the reader is referred to section 2 5 for more details about the finite element model used for the calculation of the buckling coefficient 2 2 effect of longitudinal stiffeners on the critical buckling response in general the presence of the stiffeners increases the critical buckling load of a longitudinally stiffened web plate thanks to their bending resistance two characteristic dimensionless quantities that describe the effect of a stiffener on the buckling response of a stiffened plate are the stiffener location parameter given by the ratio d s d and the relative rigidity given by 4 γ i e i s i d d w where d w is the flexural rigidity of the web plate given by 5 d w e t w 3 12 1 ν 2 is i is determined by the following expression 6 i s i t s i b s i 3 12 t s i b s i b s i 2 y 0 i 2 18 t w 4 12 18 t w 2 y 0 i 2 and y 0 i is the distance of the out of plane bending elastic neutral axis of the i t h longitudinal stiffener web integrated cross section designated in aashto lrfd part 6 10 11 3 3 aashto 2012 and shown in fig 1 from the mid plane of the web plate and is given by 7 y 0 i t s i b s i b s i 2 t s i b s i 18 t w 2 as already observed in some studies e g alinia and moosavi 2008 depending on the bending rigidity of the stiffener various buckling configurations of the stiffened plate can occur at critical conditions a overall buckling of plates as illustrated in fig 2 a whereby stiffeners displace with the web plate this situation occurs for stiffeners having small values of relative rigidity γ 4 or for stiffeners having moderate values of relative rigidity 4 γ 14 and are located relatively close to the maximum compression edge of the plate d s d 0 2 b local buckling of the part of the plate above the stiffener as illustrated in fig 2b this situation typically occurs for stiffeners with γ 4 and 0 2 d s d 0 5 c local buckling of the part of the plate below the stiffener as illustrated in fig 2c this situation occurs for stiffeners with γ 14 and d s d 0 2 it has been shown that the buckling resistance of the stiffened web plate in cases b and c above is much higher than that in case a this happens due to the fact that the longitudinal stiffener remains intact and enforces a nodal line at the stiffener plate junction in the two former cases therefore this nodal line condition is generally desired and stiffeners have to be appropriately designed for this purpose in the optimization analyses that are performed in this study a constraint related to the formation of nodal line s is incorporated more specifically the ratio of the maximum out of plane displacement of the longitudinal stiffeners to the maximum out of plane displacement of the web plate must be lower than a very small nonzero positive tolerance utol as follows 8 u r u t o l where 9 u r max u s 1 z u s 2 z max u w z u s i z u w z are taken from the buckling mode shapes eigenvectors that are calculated from eq 1 and denotes the absolute value it has to be noted that setting u t o l 0 would render the optimization procedure prone to errors due to the slight numerical error introduced by the finite element method used in the objective function evaluations more details about the constraints of the optimization procedure implemented in this study are presented in section 2 3 1 2 3 optimization theory of plate girders the optimization problem that is considered in this study is to find the optimum position s and cross section dimensions of a single or two stiffeners of the plate girder shown in fig 3 that correspond to maximum k b of the girder subjected to pure bending and to minimum γ of the stiffeners provided that they form nodal lines at critical buckling conditions the optimization problem consists of two optimization sub problems in the first sub problem the design variables are the stiffener locations d s 1 d s 2 whereas the cross section dimensions of the stiffeners b s 1 t s 1 b s 2 t s 2 are fixed to relatively large values equations 15 and 16 the buckling coefficient k b x that is calculated from equations 2 and 3 is maximized in this sub problem it is also checked that the distance between the two stiffeners at their optimum position is larger than 18 t w in order to ensure that the fundamental assumptions behind the definitions 6 and 7 remain valid throughout the optimization procedure equation 14 the first sub problem of the optimization problem can be mathematically

abaqus2matlab papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a developed by papazafeiropoulos et al 2017b which integrates between matlab mathworks and inc r 2017 and abaqus abaqus 2014 in a loop is employed for carrying out the various optimization analyses three different optimization algorithms are considered in this study for the solution of the two optimization problems which are described in the following sections 2 3 1 interior point algorithm ipa this method is described in byrd et al 1999 2000 waltz et al 2006 according to this algorithm equations 26 and 27 are solved as a sequence of the following approximate equality constrained minimization problems for δ x δ s 28 min x s f j μ o b j x s min x s f j o b j x μ i ln s i subject to g j x s 0 where f 1 o b j x k b x for the first optimization sub problem j 1 and f 2 o b j x i 1 2 γ i x for the second optimization sub problem j 2 there is one slack variable s i 0 for each inequality the number of slack variables of the first optimization sub problem is 5 and of the second optimization sub problem is 9 as μ decreases to zero the minimum of f j μ o b j x s and the minimum of f j o b j x should coincide to solve the approximate problem the interior point algorithm uses one of the following two main types of steps at each iteration step 1 a direct newton step in x s this step attempts to solve the karush kuhn tucker kkt equations karush 1939 kuhn and tucker 1951 for the approximate problem using a linearized lagrangian as follows 29 h 0 j g t 0 s λ s j g s i δ x δ s δ λ f j o b j j g t λ s λ μ e g j s equation 29 defines the direct step δ x δ s where h is calculated according to the formula of broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 and shanno 1970 bfgs step 2 a cg conjugate gradient step using a trust region the conjugate gradient approach to solving the approximate problem of eq 28 adjusts both x and s keeping the slacks s positive the algorithm obtains lagrange multipliers by approximately solving the kkt equations 30 x l x f j o b j i λ i g j i x 0 subject to λ 0 the following quadratic approximation to eq 28 is minimized in a trust region of radius r 31 min δ x δ s f j o b j t δ x 1 2 δ x t x x 2 l δ x μ e t s 1 δ s 1 2 δ s t s 1 λ δ s subject to the linearized constraints 32 g j x j g δ x δ s 0 from eq 31 the step δ x δ s is obtained by default the algorithm first attempts to take a direct step if it cannot it attempts a cg step the algorithm takes a cg step either if the approximate problem is not locally convex near the current iterate or if the hessian is not positive definite at the current iteration 2 3 2 active set algorithm active set algorithm solves a number of quadratic programming sub problems sequentially sequential quadratic programming sqp in a way that resembles the newton s method for unconstrained optimization but applied for constrained problems the sqp method which is implemented in each major iteration of the active set algorithm is comprised of three main stages as follows a update of the hessian matrix the bfgs method is used for the calculation of an approximation of the hessian of the lagrangian function h h is positive definite and is updated at the k 1 th iteration as 33 h k 1 h k q k q k t q k t s k h k s k s k t h k t s k t h k s k where 34 s k x k 1 x k and 35 q k f j o b j x k 1 i 1 m λ i g j i x k 1 f j o b j x k i 1 m λ i g j i x k if q k t s k 0 at any iteration the vector q k is appropriately modified until q k t s k 0 the latter ensures that h given by eq 33 will always be positive definite b solution of the quadratic programming qp sub problem the following quadratic programming problem has to be solved at each major iteration of the sqp method 36 min q d 1 2 d t h d c t d subject to a d b an active set strategy similar to that described in gill et al 1991 and gill et al 1984 is used for the solution of eq 36 this method generates a sequence of feasible points that converge to the solution and an active set a k that is updated at each iteration k and is used for the calculation of the search direction d k the last is given by 37 d k z k p the search direction d k is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix z k which is found from the last m l columns of the qr decomposition of the matrix a k t the matrices z k and a k are orthogonal i e a k z k 0 p is found by solving the following equation 38 z k t h z k p z k t c having calculated d k from 37 a step is taken as follows 39 x k 1 x k a d k if a step of length equal to unity i e a 1 is feasible without violation of the constraints then this is the solution to the qp problem 36 if this is not possible then the step length is reduced appropriately and the nearest constraint becomes active and thus it is incorporated in the active set a k it is noted that in this study the active set algorithm always starts from a feasible point which is provided as an initial guess of the solution c line search for the calculation of the step length parameter a that is needed in eq 39 it is ensured that a specific function merit function is sufficiently decreased the merit function of the active set algorithm used in this study is the following 40 ψ x f j o b j x i 1 m r i max 0 g j i x where the penalty parameter r i is calculated in a way that allows contributions from constraints that may be not active at the current iteration but were active at a recent iteration an overview of sqp can be found in fletcher 1987 gill et al 1981 powell et al 1983 hock and schittkowski 1983 2 3 3 sqp algorithm the sqp algorithm is similar to the active set algorithm for a description the reader is referred to chapter 18 of nocedal and wright 2006 and to section 2 3 2 2 of this study 2 4 set up of the optimization procedure in this section the optimization procedure that is followed in this study and the way in which it is set up are described the abaqus2matlab application papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a is used for this optimization procedure fig 4 describes the flowchart of the optimization process the steps of which are presented as follows step 1 define the design variables position width and width to thickness ratio for each stiffener and the global variables other parameters which are adjustable but remain constant during the optimization procedures step 2 construct a matlab function which accepts the design and global variables as input and automatically generates the abaqus input file inp of the model which corresponds to the values of these variables step 3 define the two objective functions for the two optimization sub problems i e the bend buckling coefficient and the sum of the flexural rigidities of the two stiffeners the various constraints are incorporated in the objective functions as shown in the previous sections step 4 construct a main matlab code in which the initial values of the design variables their lower and upper bounds and the optimization algorithm ipa as or sqp are defined the aforementioned optimization algorithms are implemented using the fmincon function in matlab step 5 check that the two objective functions work properly and return the expected output step 6 assume some large values for the dimensions of the stiffeners and give some initial values to the stiffeners locations run the optimization sub problem 1 i e maximize the bend buckling coefficient step 6 1 create a new abaqus input file step 6 2 run abaqus analysis step 6 3 check if the termination criterion is met if the termination criterion is satisfied the process will terminate otherwise go to step 6 1 step 7 fix the locations of the stiffeners to the optimum values found in step 6 and assume some initial values for the dimensions of the stiffeners run the optimization sub problem 2 i e minimize the sum of the flexural rigidities of the two stiffeners steps similar to step 6 1 6 3 are followed in this step 2 5 finite element modeling the purpose of finite element analysis is to determine the lowest eigenvalue by performing eigenvalue buckling analysis via abaqus buckle step the lowest eigenvalue then is utilized to compute k b which is maximized to examine the optimum stiffener locations of steel plate girders in this study geometric descriptions of plate girders having a single and two stiffeners are indicated in fig 3 the height and thickness of the webs are chosen to be d 3 0 m and t 9 0 mm respectively which are identical with the model used in the paper of viet et al vu et al 2019b the flange width and thickness of the girder are selected as 600 mm and 54 mm respectively for verification purposes with the results given in the paper of elbanna et al 2014 the girder lengths aspect ratio ϕ are varied from ϕ 0 50 to ϕ 3 0 and girder webs are strengthened by one or two longitudinal stiffeners having various dimensions to take into consideration the influence of ϕ and γ on the buckling strength the material properties of steels used in all models are identical young s modulus e is 210 gpa and the poisson s ratio ν is 0 3 two models corresponding to two types of support conditions are considered as shown in fig 5 the first model is a stiffened plate girder segment with vertical edges to be simply supported the second model is a stiffened plate girder segment with vertical edges to be fixed to take into account the effect of the vertical stiffener in all models all elements consisting of web plate girder web flanges stiffeners are simulated by 4 node shell elements s4r from the abaqus element library this element was demonstrated to be suitable for thin walled structures maiorana et al 2011 vu et al 2018 2019a 2019b papazafeiropoulos et al 2019 alinia and moosavi 2008 cui and wang 2020 ao et al 2020 truong et al 2019 jo et al 2020 in order to select a suitable mesh size a sensitivity analysis is carried out the mesh size is varied from 200 mm to 160 mm 120 mm 80 mm 40 mm and 20 mm for each mesh size the buckling coefficient is determined based on buckling analysis as presented in sub section 2 1 when the mesh size reduces from 200 mm to 40 mm the buckling coefficient is significantly reduced however when the mesh size reduces from 40 mm to 20 mm the value of the buckling coefficient is almost the same therefore the suitable mesh size is chosen to be 40 mm 3 verification of fe model to demonstrate the accuracy of developed finite element fe models results obtained from these models are compared with previous works the results taken from model 1 are compared with those given in the paper of elbanna et al 2014 while the results of model 2 are used to compare with the results of elbanna et al 2014 and cho and shin 2011 for the model 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the results obtained from present work agree well with those obtained from elbanna et al 2014 for the girder with ϕ 1 and 2 for the model 2 tables 2 and 3 report the comparisons between the current study and previous works with a good agreement it is noted that in order to compare with the results given in the paper of cho and shin 2011 the geometry of model 2 is adjusted so that it is identical to that used in the paper by cho and shin 2011 based on all the comparisons above it is concluded that the developed fe models are reasonably accurate and reliable and consequently can be used for the optimization analyses that follow 4 proposed optimization algorithms in this section the efficiency of three optimization algorithms namely ipa sqp and as are investigated on the model 1 and model 2 with ϕ 0 52 0 76 1 and 1 6 to choose the algorithm with the best performance to be used for all subsequent optimization analyses tables 4 and 5 report the comparison of three algorithms about running time optimum location and γ rq of a stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 respectively it can be seen from these tables that all algorithms yield the same results in optimum location and k b of the stiffener however there is a difference in the running time and γ rq for the model 1 the running time of as algorithm is smallest regardless of ϕ however γ rq obtained from this algorithm are highest in most cases the results running time and γ rq obtained from sqp algorithm are better than those obtained from ipa algorithm therefore sqp is the most suitable algorithm for the analysis of model 1 regarding the model 2 it is clear that as algorithm provides the best results among all algorithms based on analysis results above sqp and as algorithms are employed for all analyses of the model 1 and model 2 respectively the results that appear in tables 4 and 5 give us a picture of the behavior of the various optimization algorithms regarding the optimum buckling analysis of stiffened plate girders and illustrate the nature of the design space of the problem special traits of the various optimization algorithms used in this study can be combined to yield hybrid optimization algorithms with optimized performance and especially suited for buckling problems similar to that considered in this study 5 steel plate girders reinforced with a single longitudinal stiffener in this section the optimum position and γ rq of a single stiffener are examined for the model 1 and model 2 using the optimization procedure presented in section 2 3 various web thicknesses of 9 10 12 and 15 mm corresponding to web slenderness ratios λ w of 333 300 250 and 200 respectively are considered to investigate the effect of λ w while different top flange thicknesses of 54 45 36 and 25 mm corresponding to top flange slenderness ratios λ fc of 11 11 13 33 16 67 and 24 respectively are taken into consideration to investigate the influence of asymmetry of the girder section on the optimum position and γ rq of the stiffener note that the minimum flange thickness of 25 mm is chosen based on aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 in order to avoid local buckling of the flange λ fc 11 11 corresponds to symmetric section while λ fc 13 33 16 67 and 24 correspond to unsymmetric sections ϕ is varied from 0 52 to 3 to cover most cases of ratios that appear in realistic design as mentioned in aashto lrfd aashto 2012 5 1 optimum location of a single stiffener by using the optimization procedure shown in section 2 3 the optimum position of a single stiffener obtained from model 1 and model 2 for various ϕ λ w and λ fc is indicated in tables 6 and 7 respectively for the model 1 having a symmetric section it is apparent that the optimum stiffener location is at around 0 21d 0 42d c regardless of the value of λ w and ϕ this result is similar to that obtained from the paper of elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 for the model 1 with unsymmetric sections the optimum stiffener position is about 0 425d c which is similar to the result of cho and shin 2011 it is clear that there is insignificant effect of ϕ λ w and λ fc on the optimum location of the stiffener regarding the model 2 having a symmetric section the optimum stiffener location is close to 0 21d 0 42d c regardless of λ w and ϕ except ϕ 0 52 in which the optimum value is close to 0 2d 0 4d c for the model 2 with unsymmetric sections except the case ϕ 0 52 the optimum value is about 0 42d c with respect to t w 9 λ w 333 while this value is around 0 425d c with respect to t w 10 12 and 15 λ w 300 250 and 200 which is similar to that obtained from the paper of cho and shin 2011 in case of ϕ 0 52 the optimum value is around 0 4d c from the aforementioned points it is suggested that the optimum location of a single stiffener of the steel plate girder is around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section 5 2 required rigidity of a single stiffener in previous works such as alinia and moosavi 2008 elbanna et al 2014 kim et al 2018 etc researchers only suggested γ rq of a single stiffener for the girder with only one λ w no research about the effect of λ w on γ rq has been made therefore this may lead to unrealistic designs in this section the influences of ϕ λ w and λ fc on γ rq are considered tables 6 and 7 report γ rq of the stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 with different ϕ λ w and λ fc the influences of λ w on γ rq of the model 1 and model 2 are illustrated in fig 6 for both model 1 and model 2 it appears from this figure that λ w has a slight effect on γ rq when λ w 250 however it has a significant effect on γ rq when λ w 200 and ϕ 1 6 the reason is that when λ w 250 the web is slender while when λ w 200 the web is changed from slender to non compact on the other hand the influences of λ fc on γ rq of the model 1 and model 2 are indicated in fig 7 for different λ w and ϕ this figure reveals that there is a significant effect of λ fc on γ rq regardless of λ w and ϕ in some cases γ rq obtained from unsymmetric sections is higher than that obtained from symmetric sections based on the observations above it is concluded that λ w and λ fc have a remarkable effect on γ rq of the stiffener previous works that did not consider the influence of λ w and λ fc lead to unconservative results of γ rq in addition the comparison of γ rq obtained from model 1 and model 2 is presented in fig 8 for different λ w and λ fc it can be seen that γ rq obtained from model 2 is greater than that obtained from model 1 regardless of λ w λ fc and ϕ this proves that in cases when there are vertical stiffeners in the girder γ rq is higher and the assumption of simply supported vertical edges as is done in some previous works such as alinia and moosavi 2008 elbanna et al 2014 kim et al 2018 may lead to non conservative and unsafe design of the cross section of the stiffener fig 9 depicts the eigenmode shapes of the model 1 with λ w 300 and λ f c 11 11 for the plate girder having a single stiffener it was proven in the previous works and aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 that for the simply supported plate increasing ϕ leads to increase in γ rq however for the plate girder because of the presence of the flange the behavior of the girder is more complicated when ϕ increases from 0 52 to 1 6 γ rq increases however γ rq decreases when ϕ increases to 2 based on the results of γ rq shown in tables 6 and 7 for various cases an empirical equation of γ rq is suggested for the steel plate girder with a single stiffener regardless of asymmetry of the girder section as follows 41 γ r q 4 48 a d 2 37 78 a d 3 82 or 42 i r q d t w 3 0 41 a d 2 3 46 a d 0 35 fig 10 illustrates the comparison of γ rq obtained from aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 and equation 41 it is observed that γ rq obtained from aashto lrfd equation aashto 2012 is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 however in cases ϕ 1 0 the aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 is not conservative this is also reported by kim et al 2018 6 steel plate girders reinforced with two longitudinal stiffeners this section investigates the optimum locations and γ rq of two stiffeners for the model 1 and model 2 since the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 mentions that for a single longitudinal stiffener λ w 300 for the girder reinforced by two stiffeners the values of 300 and 333 of λ w λ w 300 are taken into consideration to study the effect of λ w on γ rq of the stiffeners different t fc of 54 45 and 25 mm corresponding to λ fc equal to 11 11 13 33 and 24 respectively are taken into account to examine the influence of asymmetry of the girder section on the optimum position and γ rq of the stiffeners ϕ is varied from 0 52 to 1 6 in order to compare with a previous work kim et al 2018 6 1 optimum location of two stiffeners the optimum locations of two stiffeners obtained from model 1 and model 2 for various ϕ λ w and λ fc are presented in tables 8 and 9 in both model 1 and model 2 it is observed from these tables that the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are at around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively which are similar to those obtained from the paper of rockey and cook 1965a in addition it is clear that there is a slight effect of ϕ λ w and λ fc on the optimum stiffener locations therefore it is suggested that the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are to be around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section 6 2 required rigidity of two stiffeners tables 8 and 9 report the values of γ rq of each stiffener for various cases while fig 11 illustrates the influences of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 with respect to different values of ϕ note that in the optimum condition the required rigidities of two stiffeners are identical therefore γ rq presented in tables 8 and 9 is taken as a half of the optimum value obtained from the optimization procedure it can be observed from fig 11 that there is a significant influence of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffeners for both model 1 and model 2 for the model 1 γ rq obtained from symmetric models is always higher than that obtained from unsymmetric models for ϕ 1 but not for ϕ 1 for the model 2 in some cases γ rq obtained from the symmetric models is lower than that obtained from the unsymmetric models in addition γ rq obtained from model 2 is much higher than that obtained from model 1 in the case of ϕ 1 but not for ϕ 1 based on the observations above it is proven that if the influences of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffener are not taken into account the results may not be conservative a similar conclusion can be drawn for the model having the vertical edges to be simply supported fig 12 presents the eigenmode shapes of the model 1 and model 2 with λ w 333 and λ f c 13 33 for the plate girder having two stiffeners with respect to various ϕ values for the model 1 and model 2 with different λ w and λ f c similar eigenmode shapes are also observed based on the results of γ rq presented in tables 8 and 9 for various cases an empirical equation of γ rq of each stiffener is recommended for the steel plate girder with web reinforced with two stiffeners regardless of asymmetry of the girder section as follows 43 γ r q 25 66 a d 2 8 08 a d 14 2 or 44 i r q d t w 3 2 35 a d 2 0 74 a d 1 3 fig 13 shows the comparison of γ rq obtained from the equation of rockey and cook kim et al 2018 and equation 43 it is clear that γ rq obtained from rockey and cook s equation is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 however in cases ϕ 1 0 the equation of rockey and cook kim et al 2018 is not conservative 7 conclusions in this study a comprehensive work related to the optimum location and γ rq of longitudinal stiffeners placed at one side of the web of steel plate girders subjected to pure bending is performed using various gradient based optimization algorithms the optimization procedure is implemented into two steps the first step is to maximize k b and the second step is to minimize γ the abaqus2matlab toolbox which integrates between abaqus and matlab is used for this optimization procedure the results obtained from this work are compared with analogous results in the literature with a good agreement based on the analysis results some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 sqp and as algorithms are suggested to use for all analyses of the models having vertical edges to be simply supported and to be fixed respectively 2 for the plate girder with a single stiffener the optimum stiffener location is at around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section there is a significant effect of web slenderness asymmetry of the girder section and boundary conditions of vertical web edges on γ rq of the stiffener some previous works which do not consider the effect of these factors lead to unconservative results of γ rq and possibly to unsafe design against buckling γ rq obtained according to the aashto lrfd requirements is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 but not conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 an empirical equation to determine γ rq of the stiffener is proposed for practical designs 3 for the plate girder with two stiffeners the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section there is a significant influence of the web slenderness asymmetry of the girder section and boundary conditions of vertical web edges on γ rq of the stiffeners γ rq obtained according to rockey and cook kim et al 2018 is too conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 but not conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 an empirical equation to determine γ rq of the stiffeners is suggested for practical designs in the current study the optimum stiffener location of the plate girder under combined bending and shear force has not been investigated since in the common case of simply supported girders web panels with longitudinal stiffeners are mainly subjected to bending moments if they are placed near the mid span a further improvement of this work regarding the case of combined loads such as bending and shearing force will be considered in the future

21107,this paper aims at investigating the optimum positions and the required flexural rigidity γ rq of a single and two longitudinal web stiffeners of unsymmetric plate girders subjected to pure bending by using gradient based optimization algorithms the optimization procedure is performed into two steps the first step is to maximize the bend buckling coefficient k b generated from eigenvalue buckling analyses and then the second step aims to minimize the flexural rigidity of the stiffeners γ this procedure is implemented using the abaqus2matlab toolbox which allows for the transfer of data between matlab and abaqus and vice versa based on this research the optimum locations of the stiffeners are recommended for the unsymmetric plate girders under pure bending additionally equations are suggested to determine γ rq of the longitudinal web stiffeners of the unsymmetric plate girders these proposed equations are more realistic in the practical designs than those recommended by aashto lrfd specifications and several works in the literature in which γ rq of the longitudinal web stiffeners is determined based on the simply supported plates but not the unsymmetric plate girders

panel aspect ratio ϕ a d 1 introduction in deep plate girders having slender webs longitudinal stiffeners are widely used since the presence of the longitudinal stiffeners can enhance the web strength against bend buckling due to bending stresses by controlling the lateral deflection of the girder webs additionally longitudinally stiffened web can provide improved restraint to the rotation of the compression flanges and consequently result in greatly increased bending strength ziemian 2010 myung et al 2016 research related to longitudinal stiffeners of the plate girders especially their optimum location and γ rq under pure bending has been extensively conducted in the literature plate girders with stiffeners are a common structural component in various structures e g bridges and ship hulls in the latter case stiffened panels and box girders are usually of critical importance for the ultimate strength of conventional cargo ships under longitudinal bending the design of swath small waterplane area twin hull ships against transverse bending due to their special sectional configuration liu et al 2018 and the twin hull inland catamarans which require special design against longitudinal bending due to their shallow draught xu et al 2019 for the steel plate girder with a single longitudinal stiffener many researches have proven that the optimum position of the stiffener is at 0 2d from the compression flange for the symmetric girder assuming longitudinal edges of girder webs are simply supported cooper 1967 azhari and bradford 1993 frank and helwig 1995 maiorana et al 2011 vu et al 2019a among these researches frank and helwig 1995 conducted a series of eigenvalue buckling analyses for the optimum stiffener position of the unsymmetric girder in which the longitudinal edges of the web were presumed to be simply supported based on their research they suggested that the optimum stiffener position is at 0 4d c d c is the web depth in compression in the elastic range regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section in addition they also separately proposed the formulations computing k b of the stiffened webs depending on the stiffener location d s d c 0 4 and d s d c 0 4 which have been adopted by aashto lrfd aashto 2012 the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 is the national standard for the design and construction of bridges in the united states published by the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto the aashto lrfd specifications aashto 2012 for k b of a longitudinally stiffened web plate girder are based on the research of frank and helwig 1995 the equations and the associated optimum stiffener position adopted by aashto lrfd aashto 2012 assume simply supported boundary conditions at the flanges performing numerical investigation of the entire steel plate girder under pure bending cho and shin 2011 reported that the optimum stiffener location is achieved when it is located at around 0 425d c from the compression flange they suggested new equations to calculate k b for cases when d s d c 0 425 and d s d c 0 425 more recently elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 recommended that the optimum position of the stiffener is at around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section it is noteworthy that the optimum stiffener location suggested by cho and shin 2011 elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 is slightly different from aashto lrfd aashto 2012 since they considered the effect of rotational restraints along the web edges due to the presence of the compression flanges regarding the steel plate girder with multiple longitudinal stiffeners researches related to its optimum locations and γ rq are very limited rockey and cook 1965a 1965b conducted an investigation on the optimum locations of multiple longitudinal stiffeners for the plate girders with doubly symmetric section subjected to pure bending in their model the longitudinal edges of the girder web were assumed to be either simply supported or clamped while the vertical edges of the girder web were presumed to be simply supported it was also assumed that the longitudinal stiffeners were symmetrically located about the mid plane of the girder web and their flexural rigidity was finite while torsional rigidity was negligible based on their results the optimum positions of multiple stiffeners up to six were suggested rockey and cook 1965b also proposed equations to calculate γ rq of the stiffeners of the girder webs with aspect ratio lower than 1 6 the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 bridge design specification only mentions about k b the optimum location and γ rq of a single stiffener but not multiple stiffeners it has been reported by viet et al vu et al 2019a that by using two stiffeners k b can increase by as much as 180 while the web thickness necessary for design decreases at least by 61 76 compared to the case in which only a single stiffener is used however engineers still use the aashto lrfd provision to determine k b of the web plates with multiple stiffeners therefore in practical design this provision leads to uneconomical design of plate girders with more than one stiffener as stated above the optimum stiffener position has been completely investigated for the girders with a single stiffener but not for multiple stiffeners however the γ rq of one stiffener for the steel plate girders has not been fully studied since the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 recommends γ rq for the plate girders based on the results obtained from simply supported plates moreover to the best of the authors knowledge the issue of the optimum location and γ rq of multiple stiffeners for the unsymmetric plate girders in which the influence of the flanges are taken into consideration has not yet been adequately addressed in the literature this research aims to examine the optimum locations and γ rq of a single and two longitudinal stiffeners for the unsymmetric plate girders under pure bending using various optimization procedures at first an eigenvalue buckling analysis is performed using abaqus abaqus 2014 after that the optimization algorithm is employed to firstly maximize k b until the optimum stiffener positions are attained and then the same algorithm is used to minimize γ until the optimum stiffener dimensions are achieved the abaqus2matlab toolbox papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a which integrates between abaqus abaqus 2014 and matlab mathworks and inc r 2017 in a loop is utilized for the optimization procedure based on this study the optimum locations of a single and two longitudinal stiffeners are suggested for the unsymmetric plate girders subjected to pure bending in addition formulas to determine γ rq of the longitudinal stiffeners are recommended for practical design purposes the results achieved from these formulas are compared with aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 and previous works to demonstrate their efficiency 2 method of analysis 2 1 linear elastic buckling analysis research related to elastic buckling analysis of stiffened plates have been extensively implemented ranji 2013 song et al 2019 papazafeiropoulos et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in this study the procedure for the solution of the problem of linear elastic buckling of the stiffened plate girders that was followed includes two analysis components a a standard linear perturbation static analysis is firstly carried out in which a unit reference load pattern f is applied to the model the stresses and or loads that are calculated from this static analysis are then used to form the geometric stiffness matrix kg b an eigenvalue analysis is then carried out for the calculation of the buckling loads by solving the following eigenvalue problem 1 k λ k g u 0 equation 1 is solved for the lowest positive value of λ which is the buckling eigenvalue denoted as λ c r as well as the buckling mode shapes eigenvectors u after carrying out the above two analyses the buckling load is calculated as follows 2 f c r λ c r f on the other hand according to classical buckling theory of plates under pure bending the critical buckling load is given as follows 3 f c r k b π 2 e t w 3 12 1 ν 2 d equations 2 and 3 above are used in this study in order to calculate the buckling coefficient k b since for the solution of equation 1 only a small number of the lowest eigenvalues are needed for estimation of the buckling load the lanczos eigensolver was used the lanczos eigensolver was forced to provide only positive eigenvalues minimum eigenvalue is equal to 0 the block size for the lanczos method is equal to 1 whereas the maximum number of block lanczos steps within each lanczos run is equal to 40 besides the boundary conditions that are specified for the applied loads of the static perturbation analysis a and for the definition of the antisymmetry boundary conditions for the buckling modes b are identical the reader is referred to section 2 5 for more details about the finite element model used for the calculation of the buckling coefficient 2 2 effect of longitudinal stiffeners on the critical buckling response in general the presence of the stiffeners increases the critical buckling load of a longitudinally stiffened web plate thanks to their bending resistance two characteristic dimensionless quantities that describe the effect of a stiffener on the buckling response of a stiffened plate are the stiffener location parameter given by the ratio d s d and the relative rigidity given by 4 γ i e i s i d d w where d w is the flexural rigidity of the web plate given by 5 d w e t w 3 12 1 ν 2 is i is determined by the following expression 6 i s i t s i b s i 3 12 t s i b s i b s i 2 y 0 i 2 18 t w 4 12 18 t w 2 y 0 i 2 and y 0 i is the distance of the out of plane bending elastic neutral axis of the i t h longitudinal stiffener web integrated cross section designated in aashto lrfd part 6 10 11 3 3 aashto 2012 and shown in fig 1 from the mid plane of the web plate and is given by 7 y 0 i t s i b s i b s i 2 t s i b s i 18 t w 2 as already observed in some studies e g alinia and moosavi 2008 depending on the bending rigidity of the stiffener various buckling configurations of the stiffened plate can occur at critical conditions a overall buckling of plates as illustrated in fig 2 a whereby stiffeners displace with the web plate this situation occurs for stiffeners having small values of relative rigidity γ 4 or for stiffeners having moderate values of relative rigidity 4 γ 14 and are located relatively close to the maximum compression edge of the plate d s d 0 2 b local buckling of the part of the plate above the stiffener as illustrated in fig 2b this situation typically occurs for stiffeners with γ 4 and 0 2 d s d 0 5 c local buckling of the part of the plate below the stiffener as illustrated in fig 2c this situation occurs for stiffeners with γ 14 and d s d 0 2 it has been shown that the buckling resistance of the stiffened web plate in cases b and c above is much higher than that in case a this happens due to the fact that the longitudinal stiffener remains intact and enforces a nodal line at the stiffener plate junction in the two former cases therefore this nodal line condition is generally desired and stiffeners have to be appropriately designed for this purpose in the optimization analyses that are performed in this study a constraint related to the formation of nodal line s is incorporated more specifically the ratio of the maximum out of plane displacement of the longitudinal stiffeners to the maximum out of plane displacement of the web plate must be lower than a very small nonzero positive tolerance utol as follows 8 u r u t o l where 9 u r max u s 1 z u s 2 z max u w z u s i z u w z are taken from the buckling mode shapes eigenvectors that are calculated from eq 1 and denotes the absolute value it has to be noted that setting u t o l 0 would render the optimization procedure prone to errors due to the slight numerical error introduced by the finite element method used in the objective function evaluations more details about the constraints of the optimization procedure implemented in this study are presented in section 2 3 1 2 3 optimization theory of plate girders the optimization problem that is considered in this study is to find the optimum position s and cross section dimensions of a single or two stiffeners of the plate girder shown in fig 3 that correspond to maximum k b of the girder subjected to pure bending and to minimum γ of the stiffeners provided that they form nodal lines at critical buckling conditions the optimization problem consists of two optimization sub problems in the first sub problem the design variables are the stiffener locations d s 1 d s 2 whereas the cross section dimensions of the stiffeners b s 1 t s 1 b s 2 t s 2 are fixed to relatively large values equations 15 and 16 the buckling coefficient k b x that is calculated from equations 2 and 3 is maximized in this sub problem it is also checked that the distance between the two stiffeners at their optimum position is larger than 18 t w in order to ensure that the fundamental assumptions behind the definitions 6 and 7 remain valid throughout the optimization procedure equation 14 the first sub problem of the optimization problem can be mathematically stated as follows find 10 x d s 1 d s 2 so that 11 k b x 12 1 ν 2 d π 2 e t w 3 f c r x is maximized subject to 12 0 1 d d s 1 0 5 d 13 0 1 d d s 2 0 5 d 14 d s 2 d s 1 18 t w with the following values assigned to parameters 15 b s 1 b s 2 0 06 d 16 b s 1 t s 1 b s 2 t s 2 10 in the second sub problem the design variables are the widths of the two stiffeners and the width to thickness ratio of each stiffener whereas the locations d s 1 d s 2 are considered to be fixed to their optimum values d s 1 o p t d s 2 o p t that are calculated from the first sub problem equations 10 16 the sum of the relative flexural rigidities of the two stiffeners γ 1 γ 2 is minimized in this sub problem the range of the stiffener dimensions is chosen to cover all practical designs equations 19 and 21 whereas in order to prevent local buckling of the longitudinal stiffener the slenderness of the stiffener is limited to satisfy the requirement 6 10 11 3 2 1 in aashto lrfd aashto 2012 equations 20 and 22 it is also checked that both stiffeners remain intact enforce nodal lines at the critical buckling state of the girder eq 23 the second sub problem of the optimization problem can be mathematically stated as follows find 17 x b s 1 b s 1 t s 1 b s 2 b s 2 t s 2 so that 18 i 1 2 γ i e i s 1 x d d w e i s 2 x d d w is minimized subject to 19 0 01 d b s 1 0 1 d 20 6 b s 1 t s 1 12 21

of 12 is maximum value to avoid the local buckling of the stiffener kim et al 2018 the lower bound value is chosen to cover all cases in practical designs the original inequality constrained minimization problem of the first sub problem of the optimization procedure used in this study is described by 26 min x k b x subject to g 1 x 0 1 d x 1 x 1 0 5 d 0 1 d x 2 x 2 0 5 d x 1 x 2 18 t w 0

abaqus2matlab papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a developed by papazafeiropoulos et al 2017b which integrates between matlab mathworks and inc r 2017 and abaqus abaqus 2014 in a loop is employed for carrying out the various optimization analyses three different optimization algorithms are considered in this study for the solution of the two optimization problems which are described in the following sections 2 3 1 interior point algorithm ipa this method is described in byrd et al 1999 2000 waltz et al 2006 according to this algorithm equations 26 and 27 are solved as a sequence of the following approximate equality constrained minimization problems for δ x δ s 28 min x s f j μ o b j x s min x s f j o b j x μ i ln s i subject to g j x s 0 where f 1 o b j x k b x for the first optimization sub problem j 1 and f 2 o b j x i 1 2 γ i x for the second optimization sub problem j 2 there is one slack variable s i 0 for each inequality the number of slack variables of the first optimization sub problem is 5 and of the second optimization sub problem is 9 as μ decreases to zero the minimum of f j μ o b j x s and the minimum of f j o b j x should coincide to solve the approximate problem the interior point algorithm uses one of the following two main types of steps at each iteration step 1 a direct newton step in x s this step attempts to solve the karush kuhn tucker kkt equations karush 1939 kuhn and tucker 1951 for the approximate problem using a linearized lagrangian as follows 29 h 0 j g t 0 s λ s j g s i δ x δ s δ λ f j o b j j g t λ s λ μ e g j s equation 29 defines the direct step δ x δ s where h is calculated according to the formula of broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 and shanno 1970 bfgs step 2 a cg conjugate gradient step using a trust region the conjugate gradient approach to solving the approximate problem of eq 28 adjusts both x and s keeping the slacks s positive the algorithm obtains lagrange multipliers by approximately solving the kkt equations 30 x l x f j o b j i λ i g j i x 0 subject to λ 0 the following quadratic approximation to eq 28 is minimized in a trust region of radius r 31 min δ x δ s f j o b j t δ x 1 2 δ x t x x 2 l δ x μ e t s 1 δ s 1 2 δ s t s 1 λ δ s subject to the linearized constraints 32 g j x j g δ x δ s 0 from eq 31 the step δ x δ s is obtained by default the algorithm first attempts to take a direct step if it cannot it attempts a cg step the algorithm takes a cg step either if the approximate problem is not locally convex near the current iterate or if the hessian is not positive definite at the current iteration 2 3 2 active set algorithm active set algorithm solves a number of quadratic programming sub problems sequentially sequential quadratic programming sqp in a way that resembles the newton s method for unconstrained optimization but applied for constrained problems the sqp method which is implemented in each major iteration of the active set algorithm is comprised of three main stages as follows a update of the hessian matrix the bfgs method is used for the calculation of an approximation of the hessian of the lagrangian function h h is positive definite and is updated at the k 1 th iteration as 33 h k 1 h k q k q k t q k t s k h k s k s k t h k t s k t h k s k where 34 s k x k 1 x k and 35 q k f j o b j x k 1 i 1 m λ i g j i x k 1 f j o b j x k i 1 m λ i g j i x k if q k t s k 0 at any iteration the vector q k is appropriately modified until q k t s k 0 the latter ensures that h given by eq 33 will always be positive definite b solution of the quadratic programming qp sub problem the following quadratic programming problem has to be solved at each major iteration of the sqp method 36 min q d 1 2 d t h d c t d subject to a d b an active set strategy similar to that described in gill et al 1991 and gill et al 1984 is used for the solution of eq 36 this method generates a sequence of feasible points that converge to the solution and an active set a k that is updated at each iteration k and is used for the calculation of the search direction d k the last is given by 37 d k z k p the search direction d k is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix z k which is found from the last m l columns of the qr decomposition of the matrix a k t the matrices z k and a k are orthogonal i e a k z k 0 p is found by solving the following equation 38 z k t h z k p z k t c having calculated d k from 37 a step is taken as follows 39 x k 1 x k a d k if a step of length equal to unity i e a 1 is feasible without violation of the constraints then this is the solution to the qp problem 36 if this is not possible then the step length is reduced appropriately and the nearest constraint becomes active and thus it is incorporated in the active set a k it is noted that in this study the active set algorithm always starts from a feasible point which is provided as an initial guess of the solution c line search for the calculation of the step length parameter a that is needed in eq 39 it is ensured that a specific function merit function is sufficiently decreased the merit function of the active set algorithm used in this study is the following 40 ψ x f j o b j x i 1 m r i max 0 g j i x where the penalty parameter r i is calculated in a way that allows contributions from constraints that may be not active at the current iteration but were active at a recent iteration an overview of sqp can be found in fletcher 1987 gill et al 1981 powell et al 1983 hock and schittkowski 1983 2 3 3 sqp algorithm the sqp algorithm is similar to the active set algorithm for a description the reader is referred to chapter 18 of nocedal and wright 2006 and to section 2 3 2 2 of this study 2 4 set up of the optimization procedure in this section the optimization procedure that is followed in this study and the way in which it is set up are described the abaqus2matlab application papazafeiropoulos et al 2017a is used for this optimization procedure fig 4 describes the flowchart of the optimization process the steps of which are presented as follows step 1 define the design variables position width and width to thickness ratio for each stiffener and the global variables other parameters which are adjustable but remain constant during the optimization procedures step 2 construct a matlab function which accepts the design and global variables as input and automatically generates the abaqus input file inp of the model which corresponds to the values of these variables step 3 define the two objective functions for the two optimization sub problems i e the bend buckling coefficient and the sum of the flexural rigidities of the two stiffeners the various constraints are incorporated in the objective functions as shown in the previous sections step 4 construct a main matlab code in which the initial values of the design variables their lower and upper bounds and the optimization algorithm ipa as or sqp are defined the aforementioned optimization algorithms are implemented using the fmincon function in matlab step 5 check that the two objective functions work properly and return the expected output step 6 assume some large values for the dimensions of the stiffeners and give some initial values to the stiffeners locations run the optimization sub problem 1 i e maximize the bend buckling coefficient step 6 1 create a new abaqus input file step 6 2 run abaqus analysis step 6 3 check if the termination criterion is met if the termination criterion is satisfied the process will terminate otherwise go to step 6 1 step 7 fix the locations of the stiffeners to the optimum values found in step 6 and assume some initial values for the dimensions of the stiffeners run the optimization sub problem 2 i e minimize the sum of the flexural rigidities of the two stiffeners steps similar to step 6 1 6 3 are followed in this step 2 5 finite element modeling the purpose of finite element analysis is to determine the lowest eigenvalue by performing eigenvalue buckling analysis via abaqus buckle step the lowest eigenvalue then is utilized to compute k b which is maximized to examine the optimum stiffener locations of steel plate girders in this study geometric descriptions of plate girders having a single and two stiffeners are indicated in fig 3 the height and thickness of the webs are chosen to be d 3 0 m and t 9 0 mm respectively which are identical with the model used in the paper of viet et al vu et al 2019b the flange width and thickness of the girder are selected as 600 mm and 54 mm respectively for verification purposes with the results given in the paper of elbanna et al 2014 the girder lengths aspect ratio ϕ are varied from ϕ 0 50 to ϕ 3 0 and girder webs are strengthened by one or two longitudinal stiffeners having various dimensions to take into consideration the influence of ϕ and γ on the buckling strength the material properties of steels used in all models are identical young s modulus e is 210 gpa and the poisson s ratio ν is 0 3 two models corresponding to two types of support conditions are considered as shown in fig 5 the first model is a stiffened plate girder segment with vertical edges to be simply supported the second model is a stiffened plate girder segment with vertical edges to be fixed to take into account the effect of the vertical stiffener in all models all elements consisting of web plate girder web flanges stiffeners are simulated by 4 node shell elements s4r from the abaqus element library this element was demonstrated to be suitable for thin walled structures maiorana et al 2011 vu et al 2018 2019a 2019b papazafeiropoulos et al 2019 alinia and moosavi 2008 cui and wang 2020 ao et al 2020 truong et al 2019 jo et al 2020 in order to select a suitable mesh size a sensitivity analysis is carried out the mesh size is varied from 200 mm to 160 mm 120 mm 80 mm 40 mm and 20 mm for each mesh size the buckling coefficient is determined based on buckling analysis as presented in sub section 2 1 when the mesh size reduces from 200 mm to 40 mm the buckling coefficient is significantly reduced however when the mesh size reduces from 40 mm to 20 mm the value of the buckling coefficient is almost the same therefore the suitable mesh size is chosen to be 40 mm 3 verification of fe model to demonstrate the accuracy of developed finite element fe models results obtained from these models are compared with previous works the results taken from model 1 are compared with those given in the paper of elbanna et al 2014 while the results of model 2 are used to compare with the results of elbanna et al 2014 and cho and shin 2011 for the model 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the results obtained from present work agree well with those obtained from elbanna et al 2014 for the girder with ϕ 1 and 2 for the model 2 tables 2 and 3 report the comparisons between the current study and previous works with a good agreement it is noted that in order to compare with the results given in the paper of cho and shin 2011 the geometry of model 2 is adjusted so that it is identical to that used in the paper by cho and shin 2011 based on all the comparisons above it is concluded that the developed fe models are reasonably accurate and reliable and consequently can be used for the optimization analyses that follow 4 proposed optimization algorithms in this section the efficiency of three optimization algorithms namely ipa sqp and as are investigated on the model 1 and model 2 with ϕ 0 52 0 76 1 and 1 6 to choose the algorithm with the best performance to be used for all subsequent optimization analyses tables 4 and 5 report the comparison of three algorithms about running time optimum location and γ rq of a stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 respectively it can be seen from these tables that all algorithms yield the same results in optimum location and k b of the stiffener however there is a difference in the running time and γ rq for the model 1 the running time of as algorithm is smallest regardless of ϕ however γ rq obtained from this algorithm are highest in most cases the results running time and γ rq obtained from sqp algorithm are better than those obtained from ipa algorithm therefore sqp is the most suitable algorithm for the analysis of model 1 regarding the model 2 it is clear that as algorithm provides the best results among all algorithms based on analysis results above sqp and as algorithms are employed for all analyses of the model 1 and model 2 respectively the results that appear in tables 4 and 5 give us a picture of the behavior of the various optimization algorithms regarding the optimum buckling analysis of stiffened plate girders and illustrate the nature of the design space of the problem special traits of the various optimization algorithms used in this study can be combined to yield hybrid optimization algorithms with optimized performance and especially suited for buckling problems similar to that considered in this study 5 steel plate girders reinforced with a single longitudinal stiffener in this section the optimum position and γ rq of a single stiffener are examined for the model 1 and model 2 using the optimization procedure presented in section 2 3 various web thicknesses of 9 10 12 and 15 mm corresponding to web slenderness ratios λ w of 333 300 250 and 200 respectively are considered to investigate the effect of λ w while different top flange thicknesses of 54 45 36 and 25 mm corresponding to top flange slenderness ratios λ fc of 11 11 13 33 16 67 and 24 respectively are taken into consideration to investigate the influence of asymmetry of the girder section on the optimum position and γ rq of the stiffener note that the minimum flange thickness of 25 mm is chosen based on aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 in order to avoid local buckling of the flange λ fc 11 11 corresponds to symmetric section while λ fc 13 33 16 67 and 24 correspond to unsymmetric sections ϕ is varied from 0 52 to 3 to cover most cases of ratios that appear in realistic design as mentioned in aashto lrfd aashto 2012 5 1 optimum location of a single stiffener by using the optimization procedure shown in section 2 3 the optimum position of a single stiffener obtained from model 1 and model 2 for various ϕ λ w and λ fc is indicated in tables 6 and 7 respectively for the model 1 having a symmetric section it is apparent that the optimum stiffener location is at around 0 21d 0 42d c regardless of the value of λ w and ϕ this result is similar to that obtained from the paper of elbanna et al 2014 and kim et al 2018 for the model 1 with unsymmetric sections the optimum stiffener position is about 0 425d c which is similar to the result of cho and shin 2011 it is clear that there is insignificant effect of ϕ λ w and λ fc on the optimum location of the stiffener regarding the model 2 having a symmetric section the optimum stiffener location is close to 0 21d 0 42d c regardless of λ w and ϕ except ϕ 0 52 in which the optimum value is close to 0 2d 0 4d c for the model 2 with unsymmetric sections except the case ϕ 0 52 the optimum value is about 0 42d c with respect to t w 9 λ w 333 while this value is around 0 425d c with respect to t w 10 12 and 15 λ w 300 250 and 200 which is similar to that obtained from the paper of cho and shin 2011 in case of ϕ 0 52 the optimum value is around 0 4d c from the aforementioned points it is suggested that the optimum location of a single stiffener of the steel plate girder is around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section 5 2 required rigidity of a single stiffener in previous works such as alinia and moosavi 2008 elbanna et al 2014 kim et al 2018 etc researchers only suggested γ rq of a single stiffener for the girder with only one λ w no research about the effect of λ w on γ rq has been made therefore this may lead to unrealistic designs in this section the influences of ϕ λ w and λ fc on γ rq are considered tables 6 and 7 report γ rq of the stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 with different ϕ λ w and λ fc the influences of λ w on γ rq of the model 1 and model 2 are illustrated in fig 6 for both model 1 and model 2 it appears from this figure that λ w has a slight effect on γ rq when λ w 250 however it has a significant effect on γ rq when λ w 200 and ϕ 1 6 the reason is that when λ w 250 the web is slender while when λ w 200 the web is changed from slender to non compact on the other hand the influences of λ fc on γ rq of the model 1 and model 2 are indicated in fig 7 for different λ w and ϕ this figure reveals that there is a significant effect of λ fc on γ rq regardless of λ w and ϕ in some cases γ rq obtained from unsymmetric sections is higher than that obtained from symmetric sections based on the observations above it is concluded that λ w and λ fc have a remarkable effect on γ rq of the stiffener previous works that did not consider the influence of λ w and λ fc lead to unconservative results of γ rq in addition the comparison of γ rq obtained from model 1 and model 2 is presented in fig 8 for different λ w and λ fc it can be seen that γ rq obtained from model 2 is greater than that obtained from model 1 regardless of λ w λ fc and ϕ this proves that in cases when there are vertical stiffeners in the girder γ rq is higher and the assumption of simply supported vertical edges as is done in some previous works such as alinia and moosavi 2008 elbanna et al 2014 kim et al 2018 may lead to non conservative and unsafe design of the cross section of the stiffener fig 9 depicts the eigenmode shapes of the model 1 with λ w 300 and λ f c 11 11 for the plate girder having a single stiffener it was proven in the previous works and aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 that for the simply supported plate increasing ϕ leads to increase in γ rq however for the plate girder because of the presence of the flange the behavior of the girder is more complicated when ϕ increases from 0 52 to 1 6 γ rq increases however γ rq decreases when ϕ increases to 2 based on the results of γ rq shown in tables 6 and 7 for various cases an empirical equation of γ rq is suggested for the steel plate girder with a single stiffener regardless of asymmetry of the girder section as follows 41 γ r q 4 48 a d 2 37 78 a d 3 82 or 42 i r q d t w 3 0 41 a d 2 3 46 a d 0 35 fig 10 illustrates the comparison of γ rq obtained from aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 and equation 41 it is observed that γ rq obtained from aashto lrfd equation aashto 2012 is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 however in cases ϕ 1 0 the aashto lrfd requirement aashto 2012 is not conservative this is also reported by kim et al 2018 6 steel plate girders reinforced with two longitudinal stiffeners this section investigates the optimum locations and γ rq of two stiffeners for the model 1 and model 2 since the aashto lrfd aashto 2012 mentions that for a single longitudinal stiffener λ w 300 for the girder reinforced by two stiffeners the values of 300 and 333 of λ w λ w 300 are taken into consideration to study the effect of λ w on γ rq of the stiffeners different t fc of 54 45 and 25 mm corresponding to λ fc equal to 11 11 13 33 and 24 respectively are taken into account to examine the influence of asymmetry of the girder section on the optimum position and γ rq of the stiffeners ϕ is varied from 0 52 to 1 6 in order to compare with a previous work kim et al 2018 6 1 optimum location of two stiffeners the optimum locations of two stiffeners obtained from model 1 and model 2 for various ϕ λ w and λ fc are presented in tables 8 and 9 in both model 1 and model 2 it is observed from these tables that the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are at around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively which are similar to those obtained from the paper of rockey and cook 1965a in addition it is clear that there is a slight effect of ϕ λ w and λ fc on the optimum stiffener locations therefore it is suggested that the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are to be around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section 6 2 required rigidity of two stiffeners tables 8 and 9 report the values of γ rq of each stiffener for various cases while fig 11 illustrates the influences of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffener for the model 1 and model 2 with respect to different values of ϕ note that in the optimum condition the required rigidities of two stiffeners are identical therefore γ rq presented in tables 8 and 9 is taken as a half of the optimum value obtained from the optimization procedure it can be observed from fig 11 that there is a significant influence of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffeners for both model 1 and model 2 for the model 1 γ rq obtained from symmetric models is always higher than that obtained from unsymmetric models for ϕ 1 but not for ϕ 1 for the model 2 in some cases γ rq obtained from the symmetric models is lower than that obtained from the unsymmetric models in addition γ rq obtained from model 2 is much higher than that obtained from model 1 in the case of ϕ 1 but not for ϕ 1 based on the observations above it is proven that if the influences of λ w and λ fc on γ rq of the stiffener are not taken into account the results may not be conservative a similar conclusion can be drawn for the model having the vertical edges to be simply supported fig 12 presents the eigenmode shapes of the model 1 and model 2 with λ w 333 and λ f c 13 33 for the plate girder having two stiffeners with respect to various ϕ values for the model 1 and model 2 with different λ w and λ f c similar eigenmode shapes are also observed based on the results of γ rq presented in tables 8 and 9 for various cases an empirical equation of γ rq of each stiffener is recommended for the steel plate girder with web reinforced with two stiffeners regardless of asymmetry of the girder section as follows 43 γ r q 25 66 a d 2 8 08 a d 14 2 or 44 i r q d t w 3 2 35 a d 2 0 74 a d 1 3 fig 13 shows the comparison of γ rq obtained from the equation of rockey and cook kim et al 2018 and equation 43 it is clear that γ rq obtained from rockey and cook s equation is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 however in cases ϕ 1 0 the equation of rockey and cook kim et al 2018 is not conservative 7 conclusions in this study a comprehensive work related to the optimum location and γ rq of longitudinal stiffeners placed at one side of the web of steel plate girders subjected to pure bending is performed using various gradient based optimization algorithms the optimization procedure is implemented into two steps the first step is to maximize k b and the second step is to minimize γ the abaqus2matlab toolbox which integrates between abaqus and matlab is used for this optimization procedure the results obtained from this work are compared with analogous results in the literature with a good agreement based on the analysis results some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 sqp and as algorithms are suggested to use for all analyses of the models having vertical edges to be simply supported and to be fixed respectively 2 for the plate girder with a single stiffener the optimum stiffener location is at around 0 42d c regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section there is a significant effect of web slenderness asymmetry of the girder section and boundary conditions of vertical web edges on γ rq of the stiffener some previous works which do not consider the effect of these factors lead to unconservative results of γ rq and possibly to unsafe design against buckling γ rq obtained according to the aashto lrfd requirements is too conservative in cases ϕ 1 0 but not conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 an empirical equation to determine γ rq of the stiffener is proposed for practical designs 3 for the plate girder with two stiffeners the optimum locations of the stiffeners 1 and 2 are around 0 25d c and 0 56d c respectively regardless of the asymmetry of the girder section there is a significant influence of the web slenderness asymmetry of the girder section and boundary conditions of vertical web edges on γ rq of the stiffeners γ rq obtained according to rockey and cook kim et al 2018 is too conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 but not conservative in cases of ϕ 1 0 an empirical equation to determine γ rq of the stiffeners is suggested for practical designs in the current study the optimum stiffener location of the plate girder under combined bending and shear force has not been investigated since in the common case of simply supported girders web panels with longitudinal stiffeners are mainly subjected to bending moments if they are placed near the mid span a further improvement of this work regarding the case of combined loads such as bending and shearing force will be considered in the future

21108,wave driven robot is a flexible multi body dynamic system driven by ocean waves self propelled performance is an important index of wave driven robot which includes propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of wave driven robot as well as its ability to capture and utilize ocean wave energy however the wave driven robot belongs to flexible multi body structure whose dynamic model is more complex compared with conventional ocean vehicle and the motion of wave driven robot is completely driven by waves it is difficult to predict its dynamic response and kinematic performance in this paper a numerical method is developed to solve the self propelled process of wave driven robot by coupling flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics firstly the flexible multi body dynamic model of the whole wave driven robot is established secondly the numerical flow field which can simulate regular waves is established finally the dynamic model is combined with the numerical flow field and the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is simulated by overlapping grid under typical wave parameters and the propulsion performance resistance

driven robot multi body system computational fluid dynamics self propelled performance 1 introduction wave driven robot is an unmanned surface vehicle driven by ocean waves it is composed of a float body on water surface float a submerged glider underwater glider and a flexible umbilical connecting them both the wave driven robot has a very strong endurance because of the wide range of ocean waves that never disappear compared with the traditional marine exploration equipment the wave driven robot has got rid of the constraints of power energy and marine environment it has strong flexibility and high efficiency and the ability to explore the marine environment in a wide range and all directions morales maqueda et al 2016 dorrell et al 2019 gràcia et al 2019 feseker et al 2014 riedel et al 2018 in 2007 roger hine founded a corporation named liquid robotics at present this corporation has developed a series of wave driven robot including sv2 and sv3 smith et al 2019 during hurricane flossie the researchers dropped a wave driven robot near the eye of the wind the wave driven robot survived in the experiment and got accurate weather data related to the hurricane which demonstrated its ability to survive in extreme environments paull et al 2018 connelly et al 2012 liao et al 2017a in november 2011 four wave driven robots set out from san francisco to carry out an exploration mission across the pacific ocean on december 6 2012 liquid robot announced that after more than one year s voyage the wave driven robot successfully completed the 9000 nautical mile voyage crossing the pacific setting a new world record for the longest autonomous self sailing route of the robot wang et al 2018a hine et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 self propelled performance is an important index of wave driven robot the so called self propelled refers to the process of wave driven robot from static state to self navigation driven by ocean waves it includes propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of wave driven robot as well as the ability to capture and utilize ocean wave energy research on the self propelled performance of wave driven robot is an important link in the development process of wave driven robot in this regard in 2014 tian et al tian and yu 2015 analysed the driving principle of wave driven robot and simplified the calculation formula of driving force combined with the wave theory a motion efficiency analysis model is established according to the principle of energy conversion and the effects of wave height wave period and angles of oscillating hydrofoils on the motion efficiency are analysed the research method is based on the assumption that the float on the water is fully responsive to the wave motion which is inconsistent with the actual wave driven robot navigation state and ignores the influence of wave and other environmental disturbances on the motion of the wave driven robot in 2015 considering the fact that all the energy required for the sailing of the wave driven robot comes from the conversion of wave energy li xiao tao 2014 analysed the overall design parameters of the system from the perspective of wave energy utilization and the force state of oscillating hydrofoils in the process of rising and sinking it is concluded that as long as the wave drives the float to rise and sink the glider will be driven forward thus driving the float to move forward under the assumption that the efficiency of wave energy utilization is 10 the quantitative propulsion force under typical sea conditions is obtained and the overall parameters of float and glider are preliminarily analysed in 2016 yan yan 2016 used cfd method to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of three dimensional models of the float and glider verified that the heave motion of glider was not harmonic motion and proposed the optimal structural scheme of float and glider furthermore a method combining star ccm and aqwa is designed to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot more accurately but during the numerical calculation it is assumed that the float and glider sail at a constant speed which is not in accordance with the actual situation in 2018 based on the fluid solid interaction module of star ccm software and sst k w turbulence model lv lv et al 2018 simulated the passive swing process of oscillating hydrofoils under active heave motion in a cycle and studied the influence of limiting angle wave height wave frequency and other factors on the thrust coefficient of naca0012 hydrofoil the simulation results show that the passive rotation method can effectively simulate the swing process of hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil is better when the maximum limit angle is around 20 and the average thrust coefficient increases with the increase of wave height and wave frequency in a certain range in the numerical simulation only the thrust performance of a single hydrofoil is studied and the wave driven robot is assumed to sail at a constant speed which is inconsistent with the actual situation in 2019 yang yang 2019 put forward a numerical iterative solution method for hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot combined with fine marine and star ccm the hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot under regular waves was calculated and the motion law and influencing factors of wave driven robot were analysed the simulation results show that the horizontal wave force on the float in waves and the passive pitching rotation law of oscillating hydrofoils are the important parameters affecting the propulsion performance of the wave driven robot and locating the axis of the hydrofoil at the leading edge can significantly improve the navigation speed of the wave driven robot in the numerical simulation the flow field is assumed to be ideal fluid and the flexible umbilical is equivalent to a spring which is different from the actual situation the above scholars have provided a lot of useful ideas for the research on self propelled performance of wave driven robot but there are some common defects which are due to the following difficulties in the study of self propelled performance of wave driven robot 1 wave driven robot belongs to flexible multi body structure and its dynamic model is complex especially for the dynamic modelling of flexible umbilical 2 usually when the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problems the speed of the vehicle or other motion laws are known however the motion law of wave driven robot driven by waves is completely unpredictable and the initial conditions are only wave parameters which can only be used to solve the hydrodynamic performance and velocity variation of wave driven robot 3 it is necessary to develop a coupling method of flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd the generalized external forces on the flexible multi body dynamics model of wave driven robot are solved by cfd method at each time which requires high accuracy of numerical calculation john finnemore and franzini 2013 wang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a zhou et al 2017 the scholars mentioned above generally avoid these difficulties some scholars consider the float and glider as independent individuals and the dynamic model is incomplete which makes the tensile force of umbilical cannot be solved some scholars assume that the float and glider are both sailing at constant and uniform velocity and are unable to predict the actual kinematic law of wave driven robot when calculating and analysing the propulsion performance of wave driven robot which leads to large calculation error and low reliability of dynamic performance some scholars assume that the fluid environment around the wave driven robot is ideal fluid during hydrodynamic numerical calculation which leads to large error and low reliability of hydrodynamic numerical solution in order to overcome the above difficulties make up for the shortcomings of previous research and predict the dynamics and kinematics of wave driven robot as accurately as possible a numerical method for the self propelled process of wave driven robot coupled with flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd is developed in this paper firstly the flexible multi body dynamic model of the wave driven robot is established and the wave driven robot is regarded as a whole rather than several independent individuals secondly the flow field which can simulate regular waves is established finally the dynamic model is combined with the numerical flow field and the overlapping grid is used to simulate the self propelled process of wave driven robot under typical wave parameters in the initial time of the solution only the wave parameters and the mass parameters of the wave driven robot are given and no artificial assumption is made on the motion of wave driven robot compared with previous research this method has the following advantages 1 the flexible multi body dynamic system of wave driven robot is established and the solution of the tensile force of the umbilical is added 2 the velocities of float and glider in viscous fluid is solved and the prediction accuracy of dynamic and kinematic laws of wave driven robot is greatly improved this method can not only calculate and analyse the propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of the wave driven robot under typical wave parameters and provide guidance for the structural optimization design of the wave driven robot but also provide experience for the research and development of other similar marine bionic robot driven by ocean waves and flexible multi body marine vehicles in terms of software development it can be used for reference for the research and development of coupling algorithm of fluid mechanics and multi body dynamics 2 methods 2 1 flexible multi body dynamic model of wave driven robot the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is shown in fig 1 when the float is on the upper wave surface position a in fig 1 the glider is pulled upward by the float at this time the 6 pairs of tandem oscillating hydrofoil installed on the glider rotate downward under the action of hydrodynamic torque generating the thrust in the forward direction and propel the float to sail when the float is on the down wave surface position b in fig 1 the glider is driven downward by its own gravity at this time the tandem oscillating hydrofoil will rotate upward again under the action of hydrodynamic torque which will generate thrust in the forward direction again and propel the float to sail liao et al 2017b wang et al 2019b girard et al 2003 qi et al 2013 kinsey and dumas 2012 the force analysis of wave driven robot overall is shown in fig 2 the forward direction of the wave driven robot is defined as x direction and the direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane is z direction the direction to the port side of float is defined as y direction and the positive direction of the pitch angle of float and the angle of each hydrofoil is specified to be positive when rotating about the positive direction of y axis in this paper the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot is mainly direct navigation only the motion in the xoz plane is studied so the forward direction of the float and glider is always the same as shown in fig 2 g 1 is gravity of the float g 2 is gravity of the glider r f l o a t is sailing

the new generalized coordinates of the multi body system are obtained the solution is completed when the convergence criteria of the following formula are satisfied 9 δ q i ε 1 c q i t ε 2 as for the flexible multi body system the flexible umbilical is suspended between the two ends and bears its own weight caused by the gravity field the length of the flexible umbilical is l the micro element ds is selected from the flexible umbilical for stress analysis as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 m 1 and m 2 are two bodies connected by flexible umbilical whose coordinates are x 1 z 1 and x 2 z 2 in the geodetic coordinate system m 1 and m 2 are subjected to the tensile force f 1 and f 2 of the flexible umbilical the directions of f 1 and f 2 are along the tangent direction of the flexible chain at this point whose angles between the horizontal direction and their own directions are α and β the two ends of each unit ds in a flexible umbilical are defined as n i and n i 1 assume that the tensile

flexible umbilical in flexible multi body dynamic system can be solved 2 2 numerical flow field this calculation takes the prototype of ocean rambler wave driven robot developed by harbin engineering university as the research object and the three dimensional models of the float and glider are established there are 6 pairs of oscillating hydrofoils in glider which are named as hydrofoil1 to hydrofoil6 from the stem to stern of glider considering that the size of the equipment installed on the float deck is much smaller than the float itself the air resistance of equipment can be ignored marques et al 2016a greco et al 2014 babaz et al 2016 john et al 2015 shabana 1994 the three dimensional models are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b and the basic parameters of the wave driven robot are shown in table 1 the numerical flow field of two fluid phases including water and air is established the volume vof method is used to simulate the free surface between water and air pappalardo and guida 2018 gerstmayr et al 2013 nachbagauer et al 2013 li et al 2011 the basic principle of vof method is to determine the interface between the two flows according to the proportion v of the volume of fluid in a grid cell so as to divide the free surface vof method has the advantages of fast calculation speed and small calculation memory which can be used for steady and unsteady hydrodynamic calculation geng et al 2016 li et al 2016 marques et al 2016b shen et al 2018 v function satisfies the following equation 20 v t u v x v v y w v z 0 if the volume of the unit fluid is regarded as a standard hexahedron the height of the free surface at the initial moment is h w the grid height in computing domain is z the volume fraction of air can be defined as 21 v f a i r s t e p z h w the volume fraction of water phase is as follows 22 v f w a t e r 1 v f a i r when v f w a t e r 0 it means that the fluid in the region is air when v f w a t e r 1 it means that the fluid in the region is water when v f w a t e r v f a i r 0 5 it means it s free surface that is the wave surface in cfd solver openfoam the cuboid computational domain is established as the numerical flow field in order to make the wave driven robot have enough self propelled space in the forward direction the size of cuboid flow field is set as 50 m long 30 m wide and 15 m high the water surface in is at the position of 10 m high the fluid media above and below the water surface are water and air respectively the front side of the flow field is set as the velocity inlet which is 40 m away from the gravity centre of the float and the back side is set as pressure outlet which is 10 m away from the gravity centre of the float the top and bottom sides are also set as velocity inlet the left and right sides are set as symmetrical planes which are 15 m away from the centre of gravity of the float the surface of the wave driven robot is set as a non slip surface overlapping grid is used to simulate the motion of wave driven robot in the flow field a cuboid region with a length of 2 5 m a width of 0 6 m and a height of 0 5 m is established outside the float and then the cuboid regions of 0 6 m in length 0 2 m in width and 0 16 m in height are set up outside each hydrofoil these regions are regarded as overlapping grid regions in order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation the mesh is encrypted in the overlapping grid area of the bow and stern of the float and each hydrofoil meanwhile the mesh size of the overlapping grid area is consistent with that of the movable range around the area the total number of grids is 15 million fig 5 shows the grid scene the flexible multi body dynamic model is imported into the numerical flow field and the wave parameters are set to simulate the self propelled process of the wave driven robot driven by waves the hydrodynamic performance velocity and other motion parameters of float and glider and the tensile force of flexible umbilical are calculated the time step of the program is 0 0025s the calculation process is shown in fig 6 3 results set typical wave parameters simulate the self propelled process of wave driven robot under different wave parameters in numerical flow field calculate the dynamic and kinematic parameters of wave driven robot and analyse its hydrodynamic performance at the initial moment when t 0s the initial position of the head of wave is just at the front of the bow of float wave parameters are shown in table 2 and each wave height corresponds to three wavelengths the wave period is calculated as follows 23 τ 0 8 λ where τ is the wave period and λ is wavelength when the wavelengths are 6 m 8 m and 10 m the wave periods are 1 96s 2 26s and 2 53s respectively 3 1 dynamic response analysis of wave driven robot firstly the dynamic response of the wave driven robot in the self propelled process is analysed including t g l i d e r the total thrust generated by oscillating hydrofoils installed on the glider r f l o a t the resistance of the float and f c the tensile force of flexible umbilical 3 1 1 hydrodynamic analysis of wave driven robot the hydrodynamic response of wave driven robot includes t g l i d e r the total thrust generated by hydrofoils on the glider and r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float the self propelled scene of wave driven robot driven by wave is shown in fig 7 a firstly taking the working condition of wave parameters of 0 25 m wave height and 8 m wave length as example the rotating angle of six pairs of oscillating hydrofoil and the thrust variation of each pair of oscillating hydrofoil are shown in fig 7 b and c it can be seen from fig 7 b that the rotation laws of the six pairs of oscillating hydrofoils are basically the same in the initial motion stage the downward and upward rotating angles of hydrofoil are 25 and 40 respectively when the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is stable the hydrofoil angle is within 20 and 25 in the stable motion stage the hydrofoil1 has the smallest rotation amplitude and hydrofoil4 and hydrofoil5 have the largest rotation amplitude the average thrust generated by each pair of oscillating hydrofoils is shown in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the thrust generated by hydrofoil1 is the largest the variation curve of t g l i d e r the total thrust of 6 pairs of oscillating hydrofoil and the variation curve of r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float are shown in fig 7 d the average value of t g l i d e r is 9 145 n the average value of r f l o a t is 6 265 n and the wave period is 2 26s it can be seen from fig 7 d that t g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period this is because in each wave period when the float is on the upper wave surface position a in fig 1 the glider rises under the action of f c the tensile force of umbilical driving the oscillating hydrofoils to rotate downward thus generating thrust when the float is on the down wave surface position b in fig 1 the glider moves downward under the action of its own gravity and drives the oscillating hydrofoil to rotate upward and generate thrust again so the variation period of the curve of t g l i d e r is about half of the wave period in addition it can be seen from fig 7 d that the t g l i d e r when the float is on the upper wave surface is less than that when the float is on the down wave surface 3 1 2 influence of wave parameters on hydrodynamics of wave driven robot the influence of wave parameters on r f l o a t and t g l i d e r is studied and the hydrodynamic variation laws under the same wave height and different wavelengths are compared taking the working condition of wave height of 0 25 m as an example the variation curves of t g l i d e r under wavelengths of 6 m 8 m and 10 m are shown in fig 8 a and the variation curves of r f l o a t are shown in fig 8 b the average values of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is shown in table 4 according to the thrust values in fig 8 a and table 4 among the selected wave parameters when the wavelength is 6 m t g l i d e r is the largest followed by t g l i d e r under 8 m wavelength and when the wavelength is 10 m t g l i d e r is the smallest the difference in numerical value between t g l i d e r under 6 m wavelength and that under 8 m wavelength is small which indicates that the wavelength will affect the thrust generated by glider to a certain extent this is because the connection point between the flexible umbilical and the float is not at the centre of gravity of float but near the bow of the float before the centre of gravity because the float has a pitch motion in regular wave the vertical displacement of the connection position between the flexible umbilical and the float are larger and the vertical displacement of glider is larger therefore when the wave height is the same and the wavelength is different the pitching motion response of the float is different and the thrust is also different when the wavelength is 10 m the pitching motion of the float is weaker than those of the 6 m wavelength and 8 m wavelength which leads to the weaker heave response of glider so t g l i d e r under 10 m wavelength is smaller it can be seen from the resistance values in fig 8 b and table 4 that r f l o a t is the largest when the wavelength is 6 m and the minimum when the wavelength is 10 m which indicates that the greater the pitch amplitude of the float the larger the sailing resistance this is because the larger the pitch amplitude of float the larger the upstream area of the float in its sailing direction which makes the sailing resistance of the float increase correspondingly according to the variation period of curves in fig 8 a and b the period of the curves of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is related to wavelength and the longer the wavelength the longer the period of curves of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t compared with the hydrodynamic variation laws under the same wavelength and different wave heights taking the wavelength of 8 m as an example t g l i d e r and r f l o a t under the wavelengths of 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m are shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 b the average values of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 9 a and b that when the wavelength is fixed t g l i d e r and r f l o a t increase with the increase of the wave height this is mainly because with the increase of the wave height the amplitude of the heave motion of glider increases and the thrust generated by the oscillating hydrofoils increases which makes the velocity of float increase and the resistance of float increases correspondingly 3 1 3 tensile force analysis of flexible umbilical taking the wave height of 0 25 m and wavelength of 8 m as an example the tensile force of flexible umbilical in the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is studied fig 10 a shows f c the tensile force of flexible umbilical and its direction is consistent with that of flexible umbilical at all times fig 10 b and c respectively show f c x the component of the tensile force in forward direction x direction and f c z the component in gravity direction z direction compared with fig 10 a and c it can be seen that there is no significant difference in the numerical value between f c and f c z this is because the pitch angle of the flexible umbilical is small during the self propelled process of the wave driven robot so that f c x is significantly smaller than f c z it can be seen from fig 10 b that in a wave period f c x alternates between positive and negative in values when f c x is positive the f c x curve will have two peaks one of which is larger and the other is smaller the reason for this phenomenon is that during the self propelled process of the wave driven robot the glider is in front of the float and drags the float forward for most of the time in each wave period when the velocity of the float is larger than that of glider the glider will lag behind the float at this time the float drags the glider forward so that f c x alternates between positive and negative in values in addition when the float is on the upper wave surface and down wave surface respectively the float still lags behind the glider the glider rises and sinks respectively driving the oscillating hydrofoils to rotate downward and upward respectively which generates thrust therefore f c x curve will have two peaks 3 2 kinematic response analysis of wave driven robot 3 2 1 analysis of velocity and motion the kinematic response of wave driven robot includes v f l o a t the sailing velocity of float and v g l i d e r the sailing velocity of glider heave motion and pitch motion of float taking the wave height of 0 25 m and wavelength of 8 m as an example v f l o a t v g l i d e r and the variation curve of the sailing distances of the float and glider are shown in fig 11 a and fig 11 b the heave motion of float and glider and the pitch motion of float are shown in fig 11 c and d the average value of v f l o a t is 0 516 m s and that of v g l i d e r is 0 511 m s it can be seen from fig 11 a and b that when the wave is transmitted to the float the float will retreat first under the action of the wave force in the x direction and the glider will rise driven by float then the oscillating hydrofoils rotate downward to generate thrust and push the glider to sail forward at this time the float and glider respectively reach the peak of each velocity in the opposite direction resulting in large f c which is the reason for the maximum f c at the initial moment in fig 10 b in the following self propelled process of the wave driven robot v f l o a t and v g l i d e r show periodic changes and the amplitude of the curve of v f l o a t is greater than that of v g l i d e r among them the curve of v g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period which is due to the curve of t g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period it can be seen from fig 11 c that in heave motion of the wave driven robot the amplitude of the heave motion of glider is greater than that of float this is because the connection point between the flexible umbilical and the float is located in front of its gravity centre and the float has pitch motion which results in the amplitude of the heave of glider is larger than that of the float therefore at the same wave height the stronger the pitch of the float is the larger the heave amplitude of glider is and the large t g l i d e r is it can be seen from fig 11 d that in pitching motion of float the amplitude of pitching downward is larger than that of pitching upward this is due to the gravity action of glider and the connection point between the flexible umbilical and float is located in front of its centre of gravity which makes the glider increase the amplitude of pitching downward of float 3 2 2 influence of wave parameters on the velocity of wave driven robot this paper studies the influence of wave parameters on v f l o a t and v g l i d e r and compares the variation laws of velocity under the same wave height and different wavelengths taking the wave height of 0 25 m as an example the v f l o a t under wavelengths of 6 m 8 m and 10 m are shown in fig 12 a and v g l i d e r under the same wavelengths are shown in fig 12 b the average value of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r is shown in table 6 according to fig 12 a and table 6 among the selected wave parameters when the wavelength is 8 m v f l o a t and v g l i d e r are the largest followed by those under the wavelength of 10 m and v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m are the smallest and the numerical difference between the velocities of wave driven robot under the wave length of 8 m and 10 m is small combined with the comparison results of hydrodynamic response in fig 8 a and b it can be seen that the reason for the minimum v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m is that although t g l i d e r is the largest when the wavelength is 6 m at the same wave height r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float is also large and the velocity of wave driven robot is the result of the combined effect of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t so v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m are the smallest this also reflects that under the same wave height with the wavelength increasing the velocity of wave driven robot will increase first reach the peak value at a certain wavelength and then decrease at present the corresponding wavelength of the velocity peak of wave driven robot is 8 m similar to t g l i d e r and r f l o a t the curves of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r also show periodic changes the variation period is proportional to the wavelength the longer the wavelength the longer the periods of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r compared with the variation laws of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the same wavelength and different wave heights taking the wavelength of 8 m as an example the variation curves of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelengths of 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m are shown in fig 13 a and fig 13 b the average value of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r is shown in table 7 it can be seen from fig 13 a and b and table 7 that when the wavelength is fixed the velocity of wave driven robot increases with the increase of wave height in addition as mentioned above the wavelength corresponding to the peak velocity of the wave driven robot is 8 m compared with the data in tables 6 and 7 it is found that v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wave height of 0 2 m and the wavelength of 8 m are less than those under the wave height of 0 25 m and the wavelength of 6 m which shows that the influence of wave height on the velocity of wave driven robot is greater than that of wave length 3 3 self propelled test in water pool in order to verify the accuracy of the numerical results it is necessary to carry out the self propelled test of the wave driven robot in regular waves the test is carried out in the comprehensive test pool of harbin engineering university the test prototype is the ocean rambler wave driven robot developed by harbin engineering university the float of the prototype is equipped with a velocity sensor which can measure v f l o a t the sailing velocity of the float in test by comparing v f l o a t in numerical simulation the effectiveness of the numerical calculation method will be verified the test scene is shown in fig 14 a taking the working condition of 8 m wavelength as an example the comparison between v f l o a t in test and that in numerical simulation under the wave height of 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m is shown in fig 14 b c and d respectively the average velocity is shown in table 8 it can be seen from fig 14 and table 8 that v f l o a t in test is roughly the same as that in numerical simulation when the wave height is 0 2 m and the wavelength is 8 m the error of the numerical simulation result is the smallest which is only 7 48 and the prediction accuracy reaches 92 52 in general v f l o a t in test is slightly less than that in numerical simulation which is mainly because the three dimensional model of the wave driven robot in the numerical simulation is simplified and some local structures of the test prototype such as the rudder of glider which will cause sailing resistance during the self propelled process of wave driven robot are ignored moreover in numerical simulation it is assumed that the float moves completely in xoz plane but in test in water pool there is a small deflection angle between the sailing direction of the float and the wave transmission direction these two directions are not completely parallel which makes the actual upstream area of the float is larger and the sailing resistance larger therefore v f l o a t in test is less than that in numerical simulation 4 conclusions in this paper the self propelled performance of the multi body system of the wave driven robot is studied firstly the flexible multi body dynamic model of the wave driven robot is established secondly the numerical flow field which can simulate the regular wave is established according to the vof method a numerical simulation method of the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is developed the self propelled process of the glider driven by waves is numerically simulated by using overlapping grids and the dynamic and kinematic performances of the wave driven robot are calculated the propulsion performance of the glider the resistance performance of the float the change of the tensile force of the umbilical the heave motion and the sailing velocity of the float and glider are emphatically analysed through the self propelled test in water pool it is found that the prediction accuracy of the method can reach 92 52 the conclusions are as follows 1 in this paper the flexible multi body dynamic model of wave driven robot is established and a numerical simulation method for the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is developed compared with the previous research this method adds the solution of f c the tensile force of the umbilical t g l i d e r the thrust produced by glider and f c demonstrate that in each wave period the rising and sinking of the glider will both produce thrust but t g l i d e r in rising stage is less than that in sinking stage which makes f c x the component along the x direction of tensile force of umbilical appear two peaks in each wave period one of which is larger and the other is smaller 2 compared with the previous research v f l o a t and v g l i d e r the velocities of the float and glider are calculated in the self propelled simulation method of wave driven robot the numerical results show that v f l o a t and v g l i d e r are unsteady and periodic in addition by analysing v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under typical wave parameters it can be seen that the variation curve of v g l i d e r has two peaks in each change period because of the two peaks of t g l i d e r in each wave period furthermore at the same wave height v f l o a t and v g l i d e r will increase with the increase of the wavelength and reach their maximum values at the wavelength of 8 m and then decrease with the increase of the wavelength at the same time the influence of wave height on the speed of wave driven robot is greater than that of wave length 3 by analysing f c the tensile force of umbilical and v f l o a t and v g l i d e r it can be seen that the phenomenon of catching up with each other appears in the self propelled process of the wave driven robot sometimes the glider is in front and sometimes the float is in front which makes f c x alternate between positive and negative in values in each wave period 4 comprehensive analysis of t g l i d e r the thrust generated by glider under the typical wave parameters shows that the heave amplitude of the float near the bow and stern is greater than that at the centre of its gravity due to its pitching motion in the wave therefore setting the connection point between the umbilical and the float in front of the gravity centre of the float and close to the bow will increase the heave motion amplitude of the glider thus increasing t g l i d e r in values in short the increase of the pitch and heave motion amplitude of the float will improve the propulsion performance of the wave driven robot in this paper a coupled method of flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd is developed to study the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot in regular waves on this basis the next stage will carry out the research on the influence of the structure of the wave driven robot such as the length of the flexible chain the weight distribution of the float and glider the distance between the adjacent oscillating hydrofoils and the arrangement of the oscillating hydrofoils moreover the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot in higher sea conditions and irregular waves will be studied

21108,wave driven robot is a flexible multi body dynamic system driven by ocean waves self propelled performance is an important index of wave driven robot which includes propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of wave driven robot as well as its ability to capture and utilize ocean wave energy however the wave driven robot belongs to flexible multi body structure whose

driven robot multi body system computational fluid dynamics self propelled performance 1 introduction wave driven robot is an unmanned surface vehicle driven by ocean waves it is composed of a float body on water surface float a submerged glider underwater glider and a flexible umbilical connecting them both the wave driven robot has a very strong endurance because of the wide range of ocean waves that never disappear compared with the traditional marine exploration equipment the wave driven robot has got rid of the constraints of power energy and marine environment it has strong flexibility and high efficiency and the ability to explore the marine environment in a wide range and all directions morales maqueda et al 2016 dorrell et al 2019 gràcia et al 2019 feseker et al 2014 riedel et al 2018 in 2007 roger hine founded a corporation named liquid robotics at present this corporation has developed a series of wave driven robot including sv2 and sv3 smith et al 2019 during hurricane flossie the researchers dropped a wave driven robot near the eye of the wind the wave driven robot survived in the experiment and got accurate weather data related to the hurricane which demonstrated its ability to survive in extreme environments paull et al 2018 connelly et al 2012 liao et al 2017a in november 2011 four wave driven robots set out from san francisco to carry out an exploration mission across the pacific ocean on december 6 2012 liquid robot announced that after more than one year s voyage the wave driven robot successfully completed the 9000 nautical mile voyage crossing the pacific setting a new world record for the longest autonomous self sailing route of the robot wang et al 2018a hine et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 self propelled performance is an important index of wave driven robot the so called self propelled refers to the process of wave driven robot from static state to self navigation driven by ocean waves it includes propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of wave driven robot as well as the ability to capture and utilize ocean wave energy research on the self propelled performance of wave driven robot is an important link in the development process of wave driven robot in this regard in 2014 tian et al tian and yu 2015 analysed the driving principle of wave driven robot and simplified the calculation formula of driving force combined with the wave theory a motion efficiency analysis model is established according to the principle of energy conversion and the effects of wave height wave period and angles of oscillating hydrofoils on the motion efficiency are analysed the research method is based on the assumption that the float on the water is fully responsive to the wave motion which is inconsistent with the actual wave driven robot navigation state and ignores the influence of wave and other environmental disturbances on the motion of the wave driven robot in 2015 considering the fact that all the energy required for the sailing of the wave driven robot comes from the conversion of wave energy li xiao tao 2014 analysed the overall design parameters of the system from the perspective of wave energy utilization and the force state of oscillating hydrofoils in the process of rising and sinking it is concluded that as long as the wave drives the float to rise and sink the glider will be driven forward thus driving the float to move forward under the assumption that the efficiency of wave energy utilization is 10 the quantitative propulsion force under typical sea conditions is obtained and the overall parameters of float and glider are preliminarily analysed in 2016 yan yan 2016 used cfd method to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of three dimensional models of the float and glider verified that the heave motion of glider was not harmonic motion and proposed the optimal structural scheme of float and glider furthermore a method combining star ccm and aqwa is designed to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot more accurately but during the numerical calculation it is assumed that the float and glider sail at a constant speed which is not in accordance with the actual situation in 2018 based on the fluid solid interaction module of star ccm software and sst k w turbulence model lv lv et al 2018 simulated the passive swing process of oscillating hydrofoils under active heave motion in a cycle and studied the influence of limiting angle wave height wave frequency and other factors on the thrust coefficient of naca0012 hydrofoil the simulation results show that the passive rotation method can effectively simulate the swing process of hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoil is better when the maximum limit angle is around 20 and the average thrust coefficient increases with the increase of wave height and wave frequency in a certain range in the numerical simulation only the thrust performance of a single hydrofoil is studied and the wave driven robot is assumed to sail at a constant speed which is inconsistent with the actual situation in 2019 yang yang 2019 put forward a numerical iterative solution method for hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot combined with fine marine and star ccm the hydrodynamic performance of wave driven robot under regular waves was calculated and the motion law and influencing factors of wave driven robot were analysed the simulation results show that the horizontal wave force on the float in waves and the passive pitching rotation law of oscillating hydrofoils are the important parameters affecting the propulsion performance of the wave driven robot and locating the axis of the hydrofoil at the leading edge can significantly improve the navigation speed of the wave driven robot in the numerical simulation the flow field is assumed to be ideal fluid and the flexible umbilical is equivalent to a spring which is different from the actual situation the above scholars have provided a lot of useful ideas for the research on self propelled performance of wave driven robot but there are some common defects which are due to the following difficulties in the study of self propelled performance of wave driven robot 1 wave driven robot belongs to flexible multi body structure and its dynamic model is complex especially for the dynamic modelling of flexible umbilical 2 usually when the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problems the speed of the vehicle or other motion laws are known however the motion law of wave driven robot driven by waves is completely unpredictable and the initial conditions are only wave parameters which can only be used to solve the hydrodynamic performance and velocity variation of wave driven robot 3 it is necessary to develop a coupling method of flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd the generalized external forces on the flexible multi body dynamics model of wave driven robot are solved by cfd method at each time which requires high accuracy of numerical calculation john finnemore and franzini 2013 wang et al 2018b 2018c 2019a zhou et al 2017 the scholars mentioned above generally avoid these difficulties some scholars consider the float and glider as independent individuals and the dynamic model is incomplete which makes the tensile force of umbilical cannot be solved some scholars assume that the float and glider are both sailing at constant and uniform velocity and are unable to predict the actual kinematic law of wave driven robot when calculating and analysing the propulsion performance of wave driven robot which leads to large calculation error and low reliability of dynamic performance some scholars assume that the fluid environment around the wave driven robot is ideal fluid during hydrodynamic numerical calculation which leads to large error and low reliability of hydrodynamic numerical solution in order to overcome the above difficulties make up for the shortcomings of previous research and predict the dynamics and kinematics of wave driven robot as accurately as possible a numerical method for the self propelled process of wave driven robot coupled with flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd is developed in this paper firstly the flexible multi body dynamic model of the wave driven robot is established and the wave driven robot is regarded as a whole rather than several independent individuals secondly the flow field which can simulate regular waves is established finally the dynamic model is combined with the numerical flow field and the overlapping grid is used to simulate the self propelled process of wave driven robot under typical wave parameters in the initial time of the solution only the wave parameters and the mass parameters of the wave driven robot are given and no artificial assumption is made on the motion of wave driven robot compared with previous research this method has the following advantages 1 the flexible multi body dynamic system of wave driven robot is established and the solution of the tensile force of the umbilical is added 2 the velocities of float and glider in viscous fluid is solved and the prediction accuracy of dynamic and kinematic laws of wave driven robot is greatly improved this method can not only calculate and analyse the propulsion performance resistance performance and rapidity of the wave driven robot under typical wave parameters and provide guidance for the structural optimization design of the wave driven robot but also provide experience for the research and development of other similar marine bionic robot driven by ocean waves and flexible multi body marine vehicles in terms of software development it can be used for reference for the research and development of coupling algorithm of fluid mechanics and multi body dynamics 2 methods 2 1 flexible multi body dynamic model of wave driven robot the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is shown in fig 1 when the float is on the upper wave surface position a in fig 1 the glider is pulled upward by the float at this time the 6 pairs of tandem oscillating hydrofoil installed on the glider rotate downward under the action of hydrodynamic torque generating the thrust in the forward direction and propel the float to sail when the float is on the down wave surface position b in fig 1 the glider is driven downward by its own gravity at this time the tandem oscillating hydrofoil will rotate upward again under the action of hydrodynamic torque which will generate thrust in the forward direction again and propel the float to sail liao et al 2017b wang et al 2019b girard et al 2003 qi et al 2013 kinsey and dumas 2012 the force analysis of wave driven robot overall is shown in fig 2 the forward direction of the wave driven robot is defined as x direction and the direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane is z direction the direction to the port side of float is defined as y direction and the positive direction of the pitch angle of float and the angle of each hydrofoil is specified to be positive when rotating about the positive direction of y axis in this paper the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot is mainly direct navigation only the motion in the xoz plane is studied so the forward direction of the float and glider is always the same as shown in fig 2 g 1 is gravity of the float g 2 is gravity of the glider r f l o a t is sailing

the new generalized coordinates of the multi body system are obtained the solution is completed when the convergence criteria of the following formula are satisfied 9 δ q i ε 1 c q i t ε 2 as for the flexible multi body system the flexible umbilical is suspended between the two ends and bears its own weight caused by the gravity field the length of the flexible umbilical is l the micro element ds

geodetic coordinate system m 1 and m 2 are subjected to the tensile force f 1 and f 2 of the flexible umbilical the directions of f 1 and f 2 are along the tangent direction of the flexible chain at this point whose angles between the horizontal direction and their own directions are α and β the two ends of each unit ds in a flexible umbilical are defined as n i and n i 1 assume that the tensile

flexible umbilical in flexible multi body dynamic system can be solved 2 2 numerical flow field this calculation takes the prototype of ocean rambler wave driven robot developed by harbin engineering university as the research object and the three dimensional models of the float and glider are established there are 6 pairs of oscillating hydrofoils in glider which are named as hydrofoil1 to hydrofoil6 from the stem to stern of glider considering that the size of the equipment installed on the float deck is much smaller than the float itself the air resistance of equipment can be ignored marques et al 2016a greco et al 2014 babaz et al 2016 john et al 2015 shabana 1994 the three dimensional models are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b and the basic parameters of the wave driven robot are shown in table 1 the numerical flow field of two fluid phases including water and air is established the volume vof method is used to simulate the free surface between water and air pappalardo and guida 2018 gerstmayr et al 2013 nachbagauer et al 2013 li et al 2011 the basic principle of vof method is to determine the interface between the two flows according to the proportion v of the volume of fluid in a grid cell so as to divide the free surface vof method has the advantages of fast calculation speed and small calculation memory which can be used for steady and unsteady hydrodynamic calculation geng et al 2016 li et al 2016 marques et al 2016b shen et al 2018 v function satisfies the following equation 20 v t u v x v v y w v z 0 if the volume of the unit fluid is regarded as a standard hexahedron the height of the free surface at the initial moment is h w the grid height in computing domain is z the volume fraction of air can be defined as 21 v f a i r s t e p z h w the volume fraction of water phase is as follows 22 v f w a t e r 1 v f a i r when v f w a t e r 0 it means that the fluid in the region is air when v f w a t e r 1 it means that the fluid in the region is water when v f w a t e r v f a i r 0 5 it means it s free surface that is the wave surface in cfd solver openfoam the cuboid computational domain is established as the numerical flow field in order to make the wave driven robot have enough self propelled space in the forward direction the size of cuboid flow field is set as 50 m long 30 m wide and 15 m high the water surface in is at the position of 10 m high the fluid media above and below the water surface are water and air respectively the front side of the flow field is set as the velocity inlet which is 40 m away from the gravity centre of the float and the back side is set as pressure outlet which is 10 m away from the gravity centre of the float the top and bottom sides are also set as velocity inlet the left and right sides are set as symmetrical planes which are 15 m away from the centre of gravity of the float the surface of the wave driven robot is set as a non slip surface overlapping grid is used to simulate the motion of wave driven robot in the flow field a cuboid region with a length of 2 5 m a width of 0 6 m and a height of 0 5 m is established outside the float and then the cuboid regions of 0 6 m in length 0 2 m in width and 0 16 m in height are set up outside each hydrofoil these regions are regarded as overlapping grid regions in order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation the mesh is encrypted in the overlapping grid area of the bow and stern of the float and each hydrofoil meanwhile the mesh size of the overlapping grid area is consistent with that of the movable range around the area the total number of grids is 15 million fig 5 shows the grid scene the flexible multi body dynamic model is imported into the numerical flow field and the wave parameters are set to simulate the self propelled process of the wave driven robot driven by waves the hydrodynamic performance velocity and other motion parameters of float and glider and the tensile force of flexible umbilical are calculated the time step of the program is 0 0025s the calculation process is shown in fig 6 3 results set typical wave parameters simulate the self propelled process of wave driven robot under different wave parameters in numerical flow field calculate the dynamic and kinematic parameters of wave driven robot and analyse its hydrodynamic performance at the initial moment when t 0s the initial position of the head of wave is just at the front of the bow of float wave parameters are shown in table 2 and each wave height corresponds to three wavelengths the wave period is calculated as follows 23 τ 0 8 λ where τ is the wave period and λ is wavelength when the wavelengths are 6 m 8 m and 10 m the wave periods are 1 96s 2 26s and 2 53s respectively 3 1 dynamic response analysis of wave driven robot firstly the dynamic response of the wave driven robot in the self propelled process is analysed including t g l i d e r the total thrust generated by oscillating hydrofoils installed on the glider r f l o a t the resistance of the float and f c the tensile force of flexible umbilical 3 1 1 hydrodynamic analysis of wave driven robot the hydrodynamic response of wave driven robot includes t g l i d e r the total thrust generated by hydrofoils on the glider and r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float the self propelled scene of wave driven robot driven by wave is shown in fig 7 a firstly taking the working condition of wave parameters of 0 25 m wave height and 8 m wave length as example the rotating angle of six pairs of oscillating hydrofoil and the thrust variation of each pair of oscillating hydrofoil are shown in fig 7 b and c it can be seen from fig 7 b that the rotation laws of the six pairs of oscillating hydrofoils are basically the same in the initial motion stage the downward and upward rotating angles of hydrofoil are 25 and 40 respectively when the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is stable the hydrofoil angle is within 20 and 25 in the stable motion stage the hydrofoil1 has the smallest rotation amplitude and hydrofoil4 and hydrofoil5 have the largest rotation amplitude the average thrust generated by each pair of oscillating hydrofoils is shown in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the thrust generated by hydrofoil1 is the largest the variation curve of t g l i d e r the total thrust of 6 pairs of oscillating hydrofoil and the variation curve of r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float are shown in fig 7 d the average value of t g l i d e r is 9 145 n the average value of r f l o a t is 6 265 n and the wave period is 2 26s it can be seen from fig 7 d that t g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period this is because in each wave period when the float is on the upper wave surface position a in fig 1 the glider rises under the action of f c the tensile force of umbilical driving the oscillating hydrofoils to rotate downward thus generating thrust when the float is on the down wave surface position b in fig 1 the glider moves downward under the action of its own gravity and drives the oscillating hydrofoil to rotate upward and generate thrust again so the variation period of the curve of t g l i d e r is about half of the wave period in addition it can be seen from fig 7 d that the t g l i d e r when the float is on the upper wave surface is less than that when the float is on the down wave surface 3 1 2 influence of wave parameters on hydrodynamics of wave driven robot the influence of wave parameters on r f l o a t and t g l i d e r is studied and the hydrodynamic variation laws under the same wave height and different wavelengths are compared taking the working condition of wave height of 0 25 m as an example the variation curves of t g l i d e r under wavelengths of 6 m 8 m and 10 m are shown in fig 8 a and the variation curves of r f l o a t are shown in fig 8 b the average values of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is shown in table 4 according to the thrust values in fig 8 a and table 4 among the selected wave parameters when the wavelength is 6 m t g l i d e r is the largest followed by t g l i d e r under 8 m wavelength and when the wavelength is 10 m t g l i d e r is the smallest the difference in numerical value between t g l i d e r under 6 m wavelength and that under 8 m wavelength is small which indicates that the wavelength will affect the thrust generated by glider to a certain extent this is because the connection point between the flexible umbilical and the float is not at the centre of gravity of float but near the bow of the float before the centre of gravity because the float has a pitch motion in regular wave the vertical displacement of the connection position between the flexible umbilical and the float are larger and the vertical displacement of glider is larger therefore when the wave height is the same and the wavelength is different the pitching motion response of the float is different and the thrust is also different when the wavelength is 10 m the pitching motion of the float is weaker than those of the 6 m wavelength and 8 m wavelength which leads to the weaker heave response of glider so t g l i d e r under 10 m wavelength is smaller it can be seen from the resistance values in fig 8 b and table 4 that r f l o a t is the largest when the wavelength is 6 m and the minimum when the wavelength is 10 m which indicates that the greater the pitch amplitude of the float the larger the sailing resistance this is because the larger the pitch amplitude of float the larger the upstream area of the float in its sailing direction which makes the sailing resistance of the float increase correspondingly according to the variation period of curves in fig 8 a and b the period of the curves of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is related to wavelength and the longer the wavelength the longer the period of curves of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t compared with the hydrodynamic variation laws under the same wavelength and different wave heights taking the wavelength of 8 m as an example t g l i d e r and r f l o a t under the wavelengths of 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m are shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 b the average values of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t is shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 9 a and b that when the wavelength is fixed t g l i d e r and r f l o a t increase with the increase of the wave height this is mainly because with the increase of the wave height the amplitude of the heave motion of glider increases and the thrust generated by the oscillating hydrofoils increases which makes the velocity of float increase and the resistance of float increases correspondingly 3 1 3 tensile force analysis of flexible umbilical taking the wave height of 0 25 m and wavelength of 8 m as an example the tensile force of flexible umbilical in the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is studied fig 10 a shows f c the tensile force of flexible umbilical and its direction is consistent with that of flexible umbilical at all times fig 10 b and c respectively show f c x the component of the tensile force in forward direction x direction and f c z the component in gravity direction z direction compared with fig 10 a and c it can be seen that there is no significant difference in the numerical value between f c and f c z this is because the pitch angle of the flexible umbilical is small during the self propelled process of the wave driven robot so that f c x is significantly smaller than f c z it can be seen from fig 10 b that in a wave period f c x alternates between positive and negative in values when f c x is positive the f c x curve will have two peaks one of which is larger and the other is smaller the reason for this phenomenon is that during the self propelled process of the wave driven robot the glider is in front of the float and drags the float forward for most of the time in each wave period when the velocity of the float is larger than that of glider the glider will lag behind the float at this time the float drags the glider forward so that f c x alternates between positive and negative in values in addition when the float is on the upper wave surface and down wave surface respectively the float still lags behind the glider the glider rises and sinks respectively driving the oscillating hydrofoils to rotate downward and upward respectively which generates thrust therefore f c x curve will have two peaks 3 2 kinematic response analysis of wave driven robot 3 2 1 analysis of velocity and motion the kinematic response of wave driven robot includes v f l o a t the sailing velocity of float and v g l i d e r the sailing velocity of glider heave motion and pitch motion of float taking the wave height of 0 25 m and wavelength of 8 m as an example v f l o a t v g l i d e r and the variation curve of the sailing distances of the float and glider are shown in fig 11 a and fig 11 b the heave motion of float and glider and the pitch motion of float are shown in fig 11 c and d the average value of v f l o a t is 0 516 m s and that of v g l i d e r is 0 511 m s it can be seen from fig 11 a and b that when the wave is transmitted to the float the float will retreat first under the action of the wave force in the x direction and the glider will rise driven by float then the oscillating hydrofoils rotate downward to generate thrust and push the glider to sail forward at this time the float and glider respectively reach the peak of each velocity in the opposite direction resulting in large f c which is the reason for the maximum f c at the initial moment in fig 10 b in the following self propelled process of the wave driven robot v f l o a t and v g l i d e r show periodic changes and the amplitude of the curve of v f l o a t is greater than that of v g l i d e r among them the curve of v g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period which is due to the curve of t g l i d e r has two peaks in each wave period it can be seen from fig 11 c that in heave motion of the wave driven robot the amplitude of the heave motion of glider is greater than that of float this is because the connection point between the flexible umbilical and the float is located in front of its gravity centre and the float has pitch motion which results in the amplitude of the heave of glider is larger than that of the float therefore at the same wave height the stronger the pitch of the float is the larger the heave amplitude of glider is and the large t g l i d e r is it can be seen from fig 11 d that in pitching motion of float the amplitude of pitching downward is larger than that of pitching upward this is due to the gravity action of glider and the connection point between the flexible umbilical and float is located in front of its centre of gravity which makes the glider increase the amplitude of pitching downward of float 3 2 2 influence of wave parameters on the velocity of wave driven robot this paper studies the influence of wave parameters on v f l o a t and v g l i d e r and compares the variation laws of velocity under the same wave height and different wavelengths taking the wave height of 0 25 m as an example the v f l o a t under wavelengths of 6 m 8 m and 10 m are shown in fig 12 a and v g l i d e r under the same wavelengths are shown in fig 12 b the average value of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r is shown in table 6 according to fig 12 a and table 6 among the selected wave parameters when the wavelength is 8 m v f l o a t and v g l i d e r are the largest followed by those under the wavelength of 10 m and v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m are the smallest and the numerical difference between the velocities of wave driven robot under the wave length of 8 m and 10 m is small combined with the comparison results of hydrodynamic response in fig 8 a and b it can be seen that the reason for the minimum v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m is that although t g l i d e r is the largest when the wavelength is 6 m at the same wave height r f l o a t the sailing resistance of float is also large and the velocity of wave driven robot is the result of the combined effect of t g l i d e r and r f l o a t so v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelength of 6 m are the smallest this also reflects that under the same wave height with the wavelength increasing the velocity of wave driven robot will increase first reach the peak value at a certain wavelength and then decrease at present the corresponding wavelength of the velocity peak of wave driven robot is 8 m similar to t g l i d e r and r f l o a t the curves of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r also show periodic changes the variation period is proportional to the wavelength the longer the wavelength the longer the periods of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r compared with the variation laws of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the same wavelength and different wave heights taking the wavelength of 8 m as an example the variation curves of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wavelengths of 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m 0 25 m and 0 3 m are shown in fig 13 a and fig 13 b the average value of v f l o a t and v g l i d e r is shown in table 7 it can be seen from fig 13 a and b and table 7 that when the wavelength is fixed the velocity of wave driven robot increases with the increase of wave height in addition as mentioned above the wavelength corresponding to the peak velocity of the wave driven robot is 8 m compared with the data in tables 6 and 7 it is found that v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under the wave height of 0 2 m and the wavelength of 8 m are less than those under the wave height of 0 25 m and the wavelength of 6 m which shows that the influence of wave height on the velocity of wave driven robot is greater than that of wave length 3 3 self propelled test in water pool in order to verify the accuracy of the numerical results it is necessary to carry out the self propelled test of the wave driven robot in regular waves the test is carried out in the comprehensive test pool of harbin engineering university the test prototype is the ocean rambler wave driven robot developed by harbin engineering university the float of the prototype is equipped with a velocity sensor which can measure v f l o a t the sailing velocity of the float in test by comparing v f l o a t in numerical simulation the effectiveness of the numerical calculation method will be verified the test scene is shown in fig 14 a taking the working condition of 8 m wavelength as an example the comparison between v f l o a t in test and that in numerical simulation under the wave height of 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m is shown in fig 14 b c and d respectively the average velocity is shown in table 8 it can be seen from fig 14 and table 8 that v f l o a t in test is roughly the same as that in numerical simulation when the wave height is 0 2 m and the wavelength is 8 m the error of the numerical simulation result is the smallest which is only 7 48 and the prediction accuracy reaches 92 52 in general v f l o a t in test is slightly less than that in numerical simulation which is mainly because the three dimensional model of the wave driven robot in the numerical simulation is simplified and some local structures of the test prototype such as the rudder of glider which will cause sailing resistance during the self propelled process of wave driven robot are ignored moreover in numerical simulation it is assumed that the float moves completely in xoz plane but in test in water pool there is a small deflection angle between the sailing direction of the float and the wave transmission direction these two directions are not completely parallel which makes the actual upstream area of the float is larger and the sailing resistance larger therefore v f l o a t in test is less than that in numerical simulation 4 conclusions in this paper the self propelled performance of the multi body system of the wave driven robot is studied firstly the flexible multi body dynamic model of the wave driven robot is established secondly the numerical flow field which can simulate the regular wave is established according to the vof method a numerical simulation method of the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is developed the self propelled process of the glider driven by waves is numerically simulated by using overlapping grids and the dynamic and kinematic performances of the wave driven robot are calculated the propulsion performance of the glider the resistance performance of the float the change of the tensile force of the umbilical the heave motion and the sailing velocity of the float and glider are emphatically analysed through the self propelled test in water pool it is found that the prediction accuracy of the method can reach 92 52 the conclusions are as follows 1 in this paper the flexible multi body dynamic model of wave driven robot is established and a numerical simulation method for the self propelled process of the wave driven robot is developed compared with the previous research this method adds the solution of f c the tensile force of the umbilical t g l i d e r the thrust produced by glider and f c demonstrate that in each wave period the rising and sinking of the glider will both produce thrust but t g l i d e r in rising stage is less than that in sinking stage which makes f c x the component along the x direction of tensile force of umbilical appear two peaks in each wave period one of which is larger and the other is smaller 2 compared with the previous research v f l o a t and v g l i d e r the velocities of the float and glider are calculated in the self propelled simulation method of wave driven robot the numerical results show that v f l o a t and v g l i d e r are unsteady and periodic in addition by analysing v f l o a t and v g l i d e r under typical wave parameters it can be seen that the variation curve of v g l i d e r has two peaks in each change period because of the two peaks of t g l i d e r in each wave period furthermore at the same wave height v f l o a t and v g l i d e r will increase with the increase of the wavelength and reach their maximum values at the wavelength of 8 m and then decrease with the increase of the wavelength at the same time the influence of wave height on the speed of wave driven robot is greater than that of wave length 3 by analysing f c the tensile force of umbilical and v f l o a t and v g l i d e r it can be seen that the phenomenon of catching up with each other appears in the self propelled process of the wave driven robot sometimes the glider is in front and sometimes the float is in front which makes f c x alternate between positive and negative in values in each wave period 4 comprehensive analysis of t g l i d e r the thrust generated by glider under the typical wave parameters shows that the heave amplitude of the float near the bow and stern is greater than that at the centre of its gravity due to its pitching motion in the wave therefore setting the connection point between the umbilical and the float in front of the gravity centre of the float and close to the bow will increase the heave motion amplitude of the glider thus increasing t g l i d e r in values in short the increase of the pitch and heave motion amplitude of the float will improve the propulsion performance of the wave driven robot in this paper a coupled method of flexible multi body dynamics and computational fluid dynamics cfd is developed to study the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot in regular waves on this basis the next stage will carry out the research on the influence of the structure of the wave driven robot such as the length of the flexible chain the weight distribution of the float and glider the distance between the adjacent oscillating hydrofoils and the arrangement of the oscillating hydrofoils moreover the self propelled performance of the wave driven robot in higher sea conditions and irregular waves will be studied

21109,the vortex induced vibration viv of marine risers with large aspect ratio length to diameter ratio is a very complicated fluid structure interaction phenomenon which is the main cause of fatigue failure of marine risers in order for the safe and stable operation of the riser systems it is crucial to investigate the effect of the aspect ratio on the viv response of the risers in this study the cross flow viv characteristics of a top tension riser with different aspect ratios are analyzed using a time domain simulation method first of all a riser model considering the fluid structure interaction was established to calculate the natural vibration characteristics and compare with the theoretical result then the cross flow viv response of the riser model in uniform and shear flows were respectively calculated and compared with the results of an experimental model the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results subsequently the developed riser model can be used to predict the cross flow viv response with different aspect ratios finally the effects of the model scale and aspect ratio on viv response were analyzed the analysis results may provide a basis for selecting appropriate model scale and aspect ratio in establishing the riser simulation model keywords vortex induced vibration top tension riser time domain analysis aspect ratio 1 introduction marine riser is an important part in the offshore oil and gas production system sun et al 2012 the riser is vulnerable to currents because that the induced vortex on both sides of the riser will cause the vortex induced vibration viv to result in the fatigue damage of the riser violette et al 2007 viv is a complex nonlinear multi degree of freedom and self constrained fluid structure interaction phenomenon the aspect ratio of the riser is a key factor to the riser viv as the underwater production system gradually develops from offshore area to deep sea liu et al 2019b the traditional viv prediction methods for offshore risers may be not applicable in deep sea considering that the aspect ratio of the risers in deep sea is much larger than that in offshore area it is difficult impossible to directly calculate the viv response of the deep sea risers via full scale experimental tests at present scaled simulation and experimental models are often used to calculate the viv characteristics of large aspect ratio risers but the similarity between the scaled riser model and the actual riser is still an unresolved issue trim et al 2005 gu et al 2013 huera huarte et al 2014 because long flexible risers have become the development trend in deep sea oil and gas production systems liu et al 2020a it is imperative to build reliable scaled riser models to precisely calculate the viv characteristics in the past decade experimental investigation on deep sea risers has been conducted with very large aspect ratio due to limitations of site size and model materials there is always a certain difference between the experimental and the actual viv response chaplin et al 2005a found that the aspect ratio of the riser model should be as large as possible to ensure a classic ratio between the wavelength and diameter in high order vibration modes however the requirements on equipment and instruments are very high to perform experimental tests for large aspect ratio risers as a result only a few experiments have been carried out in the past for example vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 and morooka and tsukada 2013 carried out experiments with the aspect ratios of 4198 1750 and 940 respectively lie and kaasen 2006 conducted the riser viv experiment with an aspect ratio of 3000 in the shear flow lie et al 2012 investigated the viv response of a riser with an aspect ratio of 3000 and a reynolds number of 130 000 they found that the amplitude of the viv decreased with the reynolds number of the flow field while the viv characteristics of the long flexible riser were similar to those of the elastically mounted short rigid cylinder more recently song et al 2016 calculated the viv response of a flexible riser with an aspect ratio of 263 through experimental test a feasible analytical method was proposed to predict the hydrodynamic force of the riser and the analysis result demonstrated that with the increase of the aspect ratio the viv characteristics become more intense and complex to compensate experimental analysis numerical simulation has been widely used to predict the viv of long flexible risers the numerical simulation methods can be divided into two categories computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical methods chaplin et al 2005b compared the prediction results of eleven different numerical methods with the experimental result they found that the empirical models can predict the amplitude and curvature of the cross flow viv more accurate than the cfd models however neither the empirical models nor the cfd models can predict the in line vibration well the cfd method is widely used to simulate the fluid phenomenon liu et al 2019a bai and qin 2014 established a reduced order model based on the cfd discrete vortex method to simulate the two dimensional viv of a cylinder the in line and cross flow fluid forces were quantified by regulating the vortex intensity with rayleigh oscillator duanmu et al 2017 simulated the viv response of several flexible risers with different aspect ratios in uniform flow and shear flow through the cfd simulation software viv foam sjtu solver they found that the increase in aspect ratio has a significant impact on the amplitude and mode of the viv response which changes the equilibrium position of the in line response of the riser and significantly increases the viv amplitude the semi empirical method usually adopts the wake oscillator and experimental data to predict the viv based on the energy balance theory of rigid cylinders and forced vibration experimental data xue et al 2014 2015 established a semi empirical model to predict the two dimensional viv of a riser in the stepped flow and the shear flow they also analyzed the effects of maximum shear flow velocity top tension internal flow density and structural material on the fatigue damage of the riser aiming at the three dimensional characteristics meng and chen 2012 proposed a model to analyze the three dimensional viv of an inclined retractable steel catenary riser yang et al 2018 established a three dimensional coupled nonlinear dynamic model to analyze the response characteristics of kelvin voigt viscoelasticity and a suitable viscoelastic coefficient was obtain to suppress the nonlinear dynamic response of the marine riser huang et al 2011 proposed a finite difference method and an effective riser motion solver to calculate the three dimensional viv of a riser with a large aspect ratio of 3350 although many numerical simulations have been conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the viv characteristics of the marine risers very limited work has been done to address the effect of the aspect ratio of deep sea risers and little has addressed the model scale effect of the experimental data in the semi empirical models in order to bridge the aforementioned research gap this paper investigates the viv characteristics of a top tension riser with different aspect ratios using a semi empirical time domain model the natural vibration characteristics of a top tension riser model were analyzed by the simulation method then the established model was validated by comparing with the experimental result the influence mechanisms of the model scale and aspect ratio on the cross flow viv of the riser were discussed the contribution of this study is that the established semi empirical time domain model can use a small scaled aspect ratio riser model to simulate the viv of a large aspect ratio riser by setting appropriate end boundary conditions 2 the established numerical model 2 1 structure vibration model a top tension riser can be simplified as a simply supported beam hinged at both ends according to the euler bernoulli beam theory duanmu et al 2018 the x axis is the in line direction the y axis is the cross flow direction and the z axis is the axial direction as shown in fig 1 the motion differential equations of the riser in the in line and cross flow can be respectively expressed as 1 in line m 2 x t 2 c x t e i 4 x z 4 t 2 x z 2 f x 2 cross flow m 2 y t 2 c y t e i 4 y z 4 t 2 y z

hydrodynamic force model the hydrodynamic force model is modified based on the classical model according to the previous research results the influence of the in line vibration velocity is considered besides the influence of the nonlinear damping and inertial force due to the interaction between the structure and the fluid during the vibration of the riser is also considered thorsen et al 2014

method the riser is divided into n units in the axial direction using n 1 nodes the response of each node under the action of the fluid force is calculated and the overall response of the riser can be expressed as 13 in line m x t c x t k x t f x t 14 cross flow m y t c y t k y t f y t where m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrixes x t and y t are the in line and cross flow nodal displacement vectors f x t and f y t are the in line and cross flow hydrodynamic forces because the viv is a nonlinear system the newmark method in time domain integral method is used to solve the established mathematical model based on the newmark method the basic formula of the viv response of the riser at t δ t time can be established eq 15 shows the structural dynamics equation at time t δ t eq 16 and eq 17 shows the update of the position and velocity of a top tension riser at each time step 15 m y t δ t c y t δ t k y t δ t f t δ t 16 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t 17 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t 2 based on the fem and the newmark method a viv solver is developed using matlab software the calculation process is shown in fig 2 3 model validation 3 1 analysis of natural vibration the governing equation of the fluid structure interaction in the viv model can be reduced to an undamped free vibration equation if ignore the damping and hydrodynamics force as described in eq 18 hence the natural vibration frequencies and vibration modes can be calculated from 18 18 k ω 2 m ϕ 0 where ω is the vibration frequency of the riser system the parameters of the riser model are shown in table 1 the natural frequencies of the riser model were calculated and compared with the analytical solution the analytical solution of the natural frequencies of the riser is 19 f n n 2 l t m n 2 π 2 e i l 2 m where n is the mode order m is the mass per unit length and l is the length of the riser the first 10 natural frequencies of the riser model obtained from the numerical simulation and the analytical solution are shown in table 2 by comparing the natural frequencies it can be seen that the calculated result of the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the analytical solution 3 2 analysis of forced vibration 3 2 1 calculation in uniform flow in this section the viv model was simulated in the uniform flow according to previous experiment test by song et al 2016 the simulation parameters were set exactly based on the experiment in song et al 2016 the experiment test was carried out in a 192 m 10 m 4 2 m towed pool both ends of the flexible riser were connected to a trailer through a universal joint the flexible riser model was towed at a constant velocity by moving the trailer to simulate uniform flow as shown in fig 3 the length of the riser model was 7 9 m the aspect ratio of the riser model was 263 the mass ratio of the riser model was 2 5 and the structural damping rate of the riser model was 0 3 the riser model parameters are listed in table 3 the fiber grating sensors are installed in both the cross flow and the in line directions of the 19 observation points on the riser surface to detect the response of the riser in simulation the flow velocity was set as the same as in the experiment i e v 0 4 m s and re 12400 fig 4 compares the experimental and numerical results it can be seen from the comparison that the time and frequency cross flow viv response curves of the developed model fit well with the experimental data although the amplitude predicted by the viv model is slightly larger than the experiment result the safety factor of the predict result can be increase to improve the safety of the riser fig 5 compares the root mean square rms of the viv amplitude it can be seen that the predicted value obtained by the numerical model is similar to the experimental data the maximum rms point of the simulation model exceeds the midpoint of the riser while the maximum rms point of the experimental test is at the midpoint this difference may due to that the uniform flow in the experiment test was simulated by horizontally dragging the riser model so the influence of the self weight of the riser on the axial tension was not considered however in the numerical simulation the self weight of the riser on the tension in the riser is considered for an actual marine riser the self weight of the riser will reduce the tension toward the riser bottom while enlarge the viv intensity consequently maximum amplitude point of viv response is below the midpoint of the riser model the comparison between the simulation and experimental results shows that the viv model established in this paper can be applied to the viv prediction of the riser in a uniform flow field 3 2 2 analysis in shear flow a shear flow simulation investigation was carried out based on the experimental test conducted by lie and kaasen 2006 on the west coast of norway to verify the developed viv model the model parameters were strictly the same as in the experiment the aspect ratio of the riser model was 3000 and the length of the riser was 90 m one end of the riser was connected to the buoyancy device to provide a constant tension of 3700 n and the other end to the floating vessel on the dock initially the riser was arranged obliquely with respect to the water surface the schematic diagram of the experimental device is shown in fig 6 the floating vessel was connected to the motor vehicle by the rope on the dock and the shear flow field was generated by driving the floating vessel to move the riser in a triangular plane table 4 lists the specific parameters based on these experimental parameters the numerical simulation was performed at a towing speed of 0 54 m s and re 16200 fig 7 shows the rms of the viv amplitude of the simulation the numerical result was compared with the results reported in lie and kaasen 2006 and xue et al 2015 and showed good consistence it can be seen that the simulated viv in this paper is in good agreement with the prediction result and trend of xue et al 2015 especially at both ends of the riser model fig 8 shows the frequency spectrum and vibration displacement at the midpoint of the riser when the drag speed is 0 54 m s in the viv experiment and the numerical simulation results in the same conditions are shown in fig 9 by comparing figs 8 a and fig 9 a it can be seen that the dominant frequency of the numerical simulation is very near the experimental one at 2 1 hz the frequency peak of the simulation is much clearer than the experimental result because of less noise and disturbance elements in the simulation when comparing figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can be seen that the numerical simulation results are basically consistent with the experimental data and the vibration displacement is almost within a range of 0 02 0 02 m 4 effect of scale and aspect ratio this section analyzed the effect of the scale and aspect ratio on the viv of the riser model seven sets of scale and aspect ratios were investigated as shown in table 5 the structural properties of the riser model is shown in table 1 as can be seen in table 5 for the same aspect ratio a big difference in the model scale was used to study the effect of model scale on viv of the riser 4 1 effect of model scale fig 10 a shows the rms of the viv amplitude of the riser models with the same length l1 20 m and different aspect ratios in the uniform flow at a velocity of 0 5 m s the reynolds numbers in these working conditions are 10000 13500 20000 and 40000 respectively from small to large it can be seen that when the aspect ratio of the riser gradually increases the overall amplitude of the riser gradually increases the transition period of the vibration phase gradually increases and the vibration mode gradually increases fig 10 b shows the rms of the viv amplitude with the same diameter d2 0 04 m with re 20000 and different aspect ratios at a flow velocity of 0 5 m s it is found that the viv intensity and the aspect ratio show a positive correlation that is the amplitude and frequency of the viv increase with the aspect ratio fig 11 shows the rms of the viv amplitude with different model scales it can be seen that at the same aspect ratio the small scale riser model has higher vibration intensity and more severe time history response moreover both the diameter and the length of the riser can affect the cross flow viv of the riser and the change of the diameter has a greater influence on the cross flow viv of the riser than the length 4 2 effect of aspect ratio different aspect ratios were used to calculate the viv of top tension risers with a length of 20 m fig 12 shows the viv intensity of the riser when the flow velocity increases from 0 1 to 1 0 m s in the uniform flow the ranges of reynolds numbers in the working conditions with aspect ratios of 250 500 750 and 1000 are 8000 80000 4000 40 000 2700 27000 2000 20000 respectively the intensity is qualified by the envelope range of the rms of the viv amplitude it can be clearly seen from the figure that the vibration intensity of four aspect ratios shows a fluctuating upward trend with the increase of the flow velocity when the flow velocity is the same the larger the aspect ratio the stronger the vibration intensity and this trend becomes more obvious with the increase of the flow velocity fig 13 shows the viv response intensity of the riser in the shear flow it can be seen that when the riser aspect ratio is small the vibration intensity does not change much with the increase of the flow velocity when the aspect ratio increases the vibration intensity shows a significant fluctuating upward trend with the increase of the flow velocity when the flow velocity is the same the larger the aspect ratio the stronger the vibration intensity and this trend becomes more and more obvious with the increase of the flow velocity fig 14 compares the amplitude and amplitude envelope of the riser viv response in the uniform flow and the shear flow fig 14 a and fig 14 c show a sudden change in the vibration intensity of the viv in the uniform flow when v 0 3 m s and v 0 1m s respectively according to the spectral density contour in fig 15 the reason for the sudden change is probably that the lock in vibration occurs in these two conditions however in the shear flow case these sudden changes are not observed because the vortex shedding frequency linearly changes along the spanwise of the riser that will hinder the lock in vibration of the riser anyway in fig 14 if neglect the effect of lock in vibration it can be seen that the viv response is close in the uniform flow and shear flow at a small aspect ratio the vibration amplitude does not change much with the increase of the flow velocity at a small aspect ratio while as the aspect ratio increases the viv amplitude of the riser shows an increasing trend with the increase of the flow velocity and the aspect ratio the effect of the aspect ratio on the cross flow viv in the uniform flow is significantly higher than that in the shear flow 5 aspect ratio replacement strategy based on the viv analysis results of the numerical simulation and experimental test for large aspect ratio riser this paper proposes a new method to reduce the aspect ratio of the riser model while ensuring the viv calculation accuracy in this method a small aspect ratio riser replaces the large aspect ratio one by properly setting the model boundary conditions this section uses a 250 aspect ratio to replace a 500 aspect ratio riser model with the same diameter of 0 04 m as an example to illustrate the proposed aspect ratio replacement strategy the structural properties of the riser models are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 16 the end boundary conditions for riser replacement can be categorized into two types the first type is to constrain one end of the rise while the other end is free end and is forced to move as shown in fig 16 a in the second type both ends of the riser are free as shown in fig 16 b the former can be used to simulate the viv response at the end of a large aspect ratio model while the latter can be used to simulate the viv response in the middle part of a large aspect ratio riser 5 1 model replacement using one free end 5 1 1 analysis in uniform flow in the uniform flow the risers with the aspect ratios of 250 and 500 were respectively investigated firstly the cross flow viv response of the riser with the aspect ratio of 500 was simulated then the vibration displacement velocity and acceleration at the middle point of the 500 riser were added to the free end of the 250 riser lastly the cross flow viv response of the 250 riser model was calculated and compared with that of the 500 riser fig 17 shows the displacement of the 500 riser at its midpoint with the flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 which was used as the boundary condition at the free end of the 250 riser the spatial temporal plot of the viv response of the 250 riser was obtained and compared with that of the 500 riser as shown in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that the spatial temporal plot of the viv generated by the small aspect ratio riser provides very similar characteristics to that of the 500 riser the vibration amplitude of the small aspect ratio riser is smaller than that of the large aspect ratio riser which can be compensated through coefficient correction 5 1 2 analysis in shear flow the two riser models were analyzed in the shear flow and the viv calculation results are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 with a highest flow velocity of 0 5 m s and re 0 20000 from bottom to top it can be seen in fig 20 that the viv response results of the two models are basically consistent in time and frequency domains the amplitude of the viv of the replaced 250 riser is smaller than that of the 500 riser the frequency components of the replacement model are the same as the 500 riser although some modal information is lost in fig 20 b these observations are similar to the case of the uniform flow in fig 19 in fig 21 one can note that the phase conversion period in the middle part of the 250 riser is larger than that of the 500 riser however the overall characteristics of the viv response of the two models are completely comparable 5 2 model replacement using two free ends in this replacement strategy both ends of the 250 riser model were forced to move to simulate the viv response of the middle part of the 500 riser firstly the viv response of the 500 riser was simulated and the response data at 1 4 and 3 4 points of the riser were respectively used as the boundary conditions at the two ends of the 250 riser subsequently the viv response of the 250 riser was calculated and compared with that of the riser model with the aspect ratio of 500 5 2 1 analysis in uniform flow fig 22 shows the comparison of the spatial temporal plots of the viv in the middle parts of the two risers in uniform flow at a flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 and fig 23 shows the power spectral density contours it can be seen that the viv spatial temporal plot of the 250 riser is consistent to that of the 500 riser the amplitude of the 250 riser is relatively smaller which can be modified by applying correction coefficients obtained from the 500 riser result in fig 23 it can be seen that one main frequency component is lost in the 250 riser because the other three main frequency components of the two riser models are perfectly consistent the two free ends replacement method can be applied to reducing the aspect ratio in uniform flow analysis 5 2 2 analysis in shear flow fig 24 shows the rms of the viv amplitude and the power spectral density contours in the middle parts of the two riser models in shear flow at a maximum flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 it can be seen that both ends of the rms curves of the two risers are well fitted but the deviation in the middle of the rms is very large the viv response of the two riser models fit well in frequency domain but still a main frequency mode is lost in the 250 riser fig 25 shows the spatial temporal plots of the viv in the middle parts of the two riser models it can be seen that the vibration response of the 250 riser becomes slower than that of the 500 riser and changes from standing wave to traveling wave however the spatial temporal characteristics of the two models present a certain difference as a result the two free ends replacement method is less applicable in the shear flow than that in the uniform flow 5 3 amplitude correction in order to further study the deviation of replacement model in uniform flow the aspect ratio replacement was carried out at the flow velocity of 0 7 and 0 9 m s with re 28000 and 36000 the rms of the cross flow viv amplitude is shown in fig 26 it can be seen that the deviation is observed with the change of the flow velocity in order to correct the deviation an empirical coefficient δ is designed as 20 δ γ 0 1 0 δ n n where n is the number of working condition δ n is the amplitude deviation of each working condition and γ is the safety factor which can be expressed as 21 δ n y r m s 2 n y r m s 5 n γ 3 75 v 2 3 5 v 1 7125 where yrms is the rms amplitude of each working condition and v is the flow velocity the corrected rms is shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the rms of the error corrected 250 riser model is well fitted with that of the 500 riser and the higher the flow velocity the better the correction effect hence the proposed model reduction method is applicable to viv simulation 6 conclusions the viv fluid structure interaction numerical simulation model of a top tension riser is established and verified using experimental data the aspect ratio effect on the cross flow viv of the riser is studied in uniform flow and shear flow the aspect ratio replacement strategy that enables to reduce the model aspect ratio is proposed the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 in the same flow field profile along with the change of diameter or length the cross flow viv intensity of the riser shows a positive correlation with the aspect ratio the stiffness of the riser with a large aspect ratio will be relatively reduced and the natural frequency of the riser will be lower which makes it easier for the riser to have a large vibration under the action of ocean currents when the aspect ratio is the same the viv response intensity of the riser model with smaller external diameter is greater in addition the aspect ratio effect on the viv of the riser in the uniform flow field is higher than that in the shear flow field 2 the influence of the different aspect ratio on viv of the riser is greater than the flow field profile factor in both uniform flow field and shear flow field when the flow velocity is the same the riser with a larger aspect ratio has stronger vibration intensity and this trend becomes more obvious with the increase of aspect ratio and flow velocity in the same way the stiffness of the riser with a large slenderness ratio will be relatively reduced and the natural frequency of the riser will be lower which makes it easier for the riser to have a large vibration under the action of ocean currents when aspect ratio is small viv of riser is slow to respond to the change of flow velocity but becomes more sensitive with the increase of aspect ratio it can be concluded that the inherent property of structure is an important factor determining its viv response 3 the effect of aspect ratio replacement strategy in viv study of large aspect ratio riser in the uniform flow field is better than that of the shear flow field the effect of end part replacement of the large aspect ratio riser is better than that of the middle part replacement the actual application effect of this method needs further experimental research there are still some problems need to be improved and solved in our research in this paper the cross flow vibration is taken to investigate the viv of the riser with different aspect ratios the viv characteristics of in line vibration should be taken into considered in the following study the multiples between the different aspect ratio of riser model in the aspect ratio replacement strategy studied in this paper are twice and the case of higher multiples has not been fully studied in addition the aspect ratio replacement strategy in viv study of large aspect ratio riser should carry out experimental research to verify the correctness of the simulation results in the future credit authorship contribution statement guijie liu conceptualization methodology

21109,the vortex induced vibration viv of marine risers with large aspect ratio length to diameter ratio is a very complicated fluid structure interaction phenomenon which is the main cause of fatigue failure of marine risers in order for the safe and stable operation of the riser systems it is crucial to investigate the effect of the aspect ratio on the viv response of the risers in this study the cross flow viv characteristics of a top tension riser with different aspect ratios are analyzed using a time domain simulation method first of all a riser model considering the fluid structure interaction was established to calculate the natural vibration characteristics and compare with the theoretical result then the cross flow viv response of the riser model in uniform and shear flows were respectively calculated and compared with the results of an experimental model the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results subsequently the developed riser model can be used to predict the cross flow viv response with different aspect ratios finally the effects of the model scale and aspect ratio on viv response were analyzed the analysis results may provide a basis for selecting appropriate model scale and aspect ratio in establishing the riser simulation model keywords vortex induced vibration top tension riser time domain analysis aspect ratio 1 introduction marine riser is an important part in the offshore oil and gas production system sun et al 2012 the riser is vulnerable to currents because that the induced vortex on both sides of the riser will cause the vortex induced vibration viv to result in the fatigue damage of the riser violette et al 2007 viv is a complex nonlinear multi degree of freedom and self constrained fluid structure interaction phenomenon the aspect ratio of the riser is a key factor to the riser viv as the underwater production system gradually develops from offshore area to deep sea liu et al 2019b the traditional viv prediction methods for offshore risers may be not applicable in deep sea considering that the aspect ratio of the risers in deep sea is much larger than that in offshore area it is difficult impossible to directly calculate the viv response of the deep sea risers via full scale experimental tests at present scaled simulation and experimental models are often used to calculate the viv characteristics of large aspect ratio risers but the similarity between the scaled riser model and the actual riser is still an unresolved issue trim et al 2005 gu et al 2013 huera huarte et al 2014 because long flexible risers have become the development trend in deep sea oil and gas production systems liu et al 2020a it is imperative to build reliable scaled riser models to precisely calculate the viv characteristics in the past decade experimental investigation on deep sea risers has been conducted with very large aspect ratio due to limitations of site size and model materials there is always a certain difference between the experimental and the actual viv response chaplin et al 2005a found that the aspect ratio of the riser model should be as large as possible to ensure a classic ratio between the wavelength and diameter in high order vibration modes however the requirements on equipment and instruments are very high to perform experimental tests for large aspect ratio risers as a result only a few experiments have been carried out in the past for example vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 and morooka and tsukada 2013 carried out experiments with the aspect ratios of 4198 1750 and 940 respectively lie and kaasen 2006 conducted the riser viv experiment with an aspect ratio of 3000 in the shear flow lie et al 2012 investigated the viv response of a riser with an aspect ratio of 3000 and a reynolds number of 130 000 they found that the amplitude of the viv decreased with the reynolds number of the flow field while the viv characteristics of the long flexible riser were similar to those of the elastically mounted short rigid cylinder more recently song et al 2016 calculated the viv response of a flexible riser with an aspect ratio of 263 through experimental test a feasible analytical method was proposed to predict the hydrodynamic force of the riser and the analysis result demonstrated that with the increase of the aspect ratio the viv characteristics become more intense and complex to compensate experimental analysis numerical simulation has been widely used to predict the viv of long flexible risers the numerical simulation methods can be divided into two categories computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical methods chaplin et al 2005b compared the prediction results of eleven different numerical methods with the experimental result they found that the empirical models can predict the amplitude and curvature of the cross flow viv more accurate than the cfd models however neither the empirical models nor the cfd models can predict the in line vibration well the cfd method is widely used to simulate the fluid phenomenon liu et al 2019a bai and qin 2014 established a reduced order model based on the cfd discrete vortex method to simulate the two dimensional viv of a cylinder the in line and cross flow fluid forces were quantified by regulating the vortex intensity with rayleigh oscillator duanmu et al 2017 simulated the viv response of several flexible risers with different aspect ratios in uniform flow and shear flow through the cfd simulation software viv foam sjtu solver they found that the increase in aspect ratio has a significant impact on the amplitude and mode of the viv response which changes the equilibrium position of the in line response of the riser and significantly increases the viv amplitude the semi empirical method usually adopts the wake oscillator and experimental data to predict the viv based on the energy balance theory of rigid cylinders and forced vibration experimental data xue et al 2014 2015 established a semi empirical model to predict the two dimensional viv of a riser in the stepped flow and the shear flow they also analyzed the effects of maximum shear flow velocity top tension internal flow density and structural material on the fatigue damage of the riser aiming at the three dimensional characteristics meng and chen 2012 proposed a model to analyze the three dimensional viv of an inclined retractable steel catenary riser yang et al 2018 established a three dimensional coupled nonlinear dynamic model to analyze the response characteristics of kelvin voigt viscoelasticity and a suitable viscoelastic coefficient was obtain to suppress the nonlinear dynamic response of the marine riser huang et al 2011 proposed a finite difference method and an effective riser motion solver to calculate the three dimensional viv of a riser with a large aspect ratio of 3350 although many numerical simulations have been conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the viv characteristics of the marine risers very limited work has been done to address the effect of the aspect ratio of deep sea risers and little has addressed the model scale effect of the experimental data in the semi empirical models in order to bridge the aforementioned research gap this paper investigates the viv characteristics of a top tension riser with different aspect ratios using a semi empirical time domain model the natural vibration characteristics of a top tension riser model were analyzed by the simulation method then the established model was validated by comparing with the experimental result the influence mechanisms of the model scale and aspect ratio on the cross flow viv of the riser were discussed the contribution of this study is that the established semi empirical time domain model can use a small scaled aspect ratio riser model to simulate the viv of a large aspect ratio riser by setting appropriate end boundary conditions 2 the established numerical model 2 1 structure vibration model a top tension riser can be simplified as a simply supported beam hinged at both ends according to the euler bernoulli beam theory duanmu et al 2018 the x axis is the in line direction the y axis is the cross flow direction and the z axis is the axial direction as shown in fig 1 the motion differential equations of the riser in the in line and cross flow can be respectively expressed as 1 in line m 2 x t 2 c x t e i 4 x z 4 t 2 x z 2 f x 2 cross flow m 2 y t 2 c y t e i 4 y z 4 t 2 y z 2 f y where ei is the bending stiffness m is the effective mass of the riser per unit length c is structural damping t is the effective tension fx and f y represent the vortex drag and lift force of the in line and cross flow directions respectively the effective mass can be expressed as 3 m m r m f m a 4 m r ρ r π d 2 d 2 4 5 m f ρ f π d 2 4 6 m a c m ρ d 2 π 4 where m r is the mass of the riser per unit length m f is the mass of the inflow per unit length m a is the additional mass ρ r is the material density of the riser ρ f is the inflow density c m is the additional mass coefficient 2 2 hydrodynamic force model the hydrodynamic force model is modified based on the classical model according to the previous research results the influence of the in line vibration velocity is considered besides the influence of the nonlinear damping and inertial force due to the interaction between the structure and the fluid during the vibration of the riser is also considered thorsen et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 liu et al 2020b the modified expression of the hydrodynamic force model is liu and huang 2013 7 in line f d 1 2 c l ρ d u x 2 cos 2 π f s t 1 2 c d ρ d u x u x c m ρ π d 2 4 x 8 cross

f s is the vortex frequency and liu and huang 2013 9 f s s t u x d where s t is the strouhal number 2 3 viv fluid structure interaction and solution the viv fluid structure interaction prediction model can be calculated from the structural vibration equations 1 and 2 of the top tension riser and the hydrodynamic vortex force model eq 7 and 8 the viv response equations in the in line and cross flow directions can be expressed as 11 in line m r m f 2 x t 2 c x t e i 4 x z 4 t 2 x z 2 1 2 c l ρ d u x 2 cos 2 π f s t 1 2 c d ρ d u x u x 12 cross flow m r m f 2 y t 2 c y t e i 4 y z 4 t 2 y z 2 1 2 c l ρ d u x 2 cos 2 π f s t 1 2 c d ρ d y y in order to solve the viv response equations 11 and 12 they are discretized by the finite element method fem and then solved by the stepwise integration method the riser is divided into n units in the axial direction using n 1 nodes the response of each node under the action of the fluid force is calculated and the overall response of the riser can be expressed as 13 in line m x t c x t k x t f x t 14 cross flow m y t c y t k y t f y t where m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrixes x t and y t are the in line and cross flow nodal displacement vectors f x t and f y t are the in line and cross flow hydrodynamic forces because the viv is a nonlinear system the newmark method in time domain integral method is used to solve the established mathematical model based on the newmark method the basic formula of the viv response of the riser at t δ t time can be established eq 15 shows the structural dynamics equation at time t δ t eq 16 and eq 17 shows the update of the position and velocity of a top tension riser at each time step 15 m y t δ t c y t δ t k y t δ t f t δ t 16 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t 17 y t δ

analysis of natural vibration the governing equation of the fluid structure interaction in the viv model can be reduced to an undamped free vibration equation if ignore the damping and hydrodynamics force as described in eq 18 hence the natural vibration frequencies and vibration modes can be calculated from 18 18 k ω 2 m ϕ 0 where ω is the vibration frequency of the riser system the parameters of the riser model are shown in table 1 the natural frequencies of the riser model were calculated and compared with the analytical solution the analytical solution of the natural frequencies of the riser is 19 f n n 2 l t m n 2 π 2 e i l 2 m where n is the mode order m is the mass per unit length and l is the length of the riser the first 10 natural frequencies of the riser model obtained from the numerical simulation and the analytical solution are shown in table 2 by comparing the natural frequencies it can be seen that the calculated result of the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the analytical solution 3 2 analysis of forced vibration 3 2 1 calculation in uniform flow in this section the viv model was simulated in the uniform flow according to previous experiment test by song et al 2016 the simulation parameters were set exactly based on the experiment in song et al 2016 the experiment test was carried out in a 192 m 10 m 4 2 m towed pool both ends of the flexible riser were connected to a trailer through a universal joint the flexible riser model was towed at a constant velocity by moving the trailer to simulate uniform flow as shown in fig 3 the length of the riser model was 7 9 m the aspect ratio of the riser model was 263 the mass ratio of the riser model was 2 5 and the structural damping rate of the riser model was 0 3 the riser model parameters are listed in table 3 the fiber grating sensors are installed in both the cross flow and the in line directions of the 19 observation points on the riser surface to detect the response of the riser in simulation the flow velocity was set as the same as in the experiment i e v 0 4 m s and re 12400 fig 4 compares the experimental and numerical results it can be seen from the comparison that the time and frequency cross flow viv response curves of the developed model fit well with the experimental data although the amplitude predicted by the viv model is slightly larger than the experiment result the safety factor of the predict result can be increase to improve the safety of the riser fig 5 compares the root mean square rms of the viv amplitude it can be seen that the predicted value obtained by the numerical model is similar to the experimental data the maximum rms point of the simulation model exceeds the midpoint of the riser while the maximum rms point of the experimental test is at the midpoint this difference may due to that the uniform flow in the experiment test was simulated by horizontally dragging the riser model so the influence of the self weight of the riser on the axial tension was not considered however in the numerical simulation the self weight of the riser on the tension in the riser is considered for an actual marine riser the self weight of the riser will reduce the tension toward the riser bottom while enlarge the viv intensity consequently maximum amplitude point of viv response is below the midpoint of the riser model the comparison between the simulation and experimental results shows that the viv model established in this paper can be applied to the viv prediction of the riser in a uniform flow field 3 2 2 analysis in shear flow a shear flow simulation investigation was carried out based on the experimental test conducted by lie and kaasen 2006 on the west coast of norway to verify the developed viv model the model parameters were strictly the same as in the experiment the aspect ratio of the riser model was 3000 and the length of the riser was 90 m one end of the riser was connected to the buoyancy device to provide a constant tension of 3700 n and the other end to the floating vessel on the dock initially the riser was arranged obliquely with respect to the water surface the schematic diagram of the experimental device is shown in fig 6 the floating vessel was connected to the motor vehicle by the rope on the dock and the shear flow field was generated by driving the floating vessel to move the riser in a triangular plane table 4 lists the specific parameters based on these experimental parameters the numerical simulation was performed at a towing speed of 0 54 m s and re 16200 fig 7 shows the rms of the viv amplitude of the simulation the numerical result was compared with the results reported in lie and kaasen 2006 and xue et al 2015 and showed good consistence it can be seen that the simulated viv in this paper is in good agreement with the prediction result and trend of xue et al 2015 especially at both ends of the riser model fig 8 shows the frequency spectrum and vibration displacement at the midpoint of the riser when the drag speed is 0 54 m s in the viv experiment and the numerical simulation results in the same conditions are shown in fig 9 by comparing figs 8 a and fig 9 a it can be seen that the dominant frequency of the numerical simulation is very near the experimental one at 2 1 hz the frequency peak of the simulation is much clearer than the experimental result because of less noise and disturbance elements in the simulation when comparing figs 8 b and fig 9 b it can be seen that the numerical simulation results are basically consistent with the experimental data and the vibration displacement is almost within a range of 0 02 0 02 m 4 effect of scale and aspect ratio this section analyzed the effect of the scale and aspect ratio on the viv of the riser model seven sets of scale and aspect ratios were investigated as shown in table 5 the structural properties of the riser model is shown in table 1 as can be seen in table 5 for the same aspect ratio a big difference in the model scale was used to study the effect of model scale on viv of the riser 4 1 effect of model scale fig 10 a shows the rms of the viv amplitude of the riser models with the same length l1 20 m and different aspect ratios in the uniform flow at a velocity of 0 5 m s the reynolds numbers in these working conditions are 10000 13500 20000 and 40000 respectively from small to large it can be seen that when the aspect ratio of the riser gradually increases the overall amplitude of the riser gradually increases the transition period of the vibration phase gradually increases and the vibration mode gradually increases fig 10 b shows the rms of the viv amplitude with the same diameter d2 0 04 m with re 20000 and different aspect ratios at a flow velocity of 0 5 m s it is found that the viv intensity and the aspect ratio show a positive correlation that is the amplitude and frequency of the viv increase with the aspect ratio fig 11 shows the rms of the viv amplitude with different model scales it can be seen that at the same aspect ratio the small scale riser model has higher vibration intensity and more severe time history response moreover both the diameter and the length of the riser can affect the cross flow viv of the riser and the change of the diameter has a greater influence on the cross flow viv of the riser than the length 4 2 effect of aspect ratio different aspect ratios were used to calculate the viv of top tension risers with a length of 20 m fig 12 shows the viv intensity of the riser when the flow velocity increases from 0 1 to 1 0 m s in the uniform flow the ranges of reynolds numbers in the working conditions with aspect ratios of 250 500 750 and 1000 are 8000 80000 4000 40 000 2700 27000 2000 20000 respectively the intensity is qualified by the envelope range of the rms of the viv amplitude it can be clearly seen from the figure that the vibration intensity of four aspect ratios shows a fluctuating upward trend with the increase of the flow velocity when the flow velocity is the same the larger the aspect ratio the stronger the vibration intensity and this trend becomes more obvious with the increase of the flow velocity fig 13 shows the viv response intensity of the riser in the shear flow it can be seen that when the riser aspect ratio is small the vibration intensity does not change much with the increase of the flow velocity when the aspect ratio increases the vibration intensity shows a significant fluctuating upward trend with the increase of the flow velocity when the flow velocity is the same the larger the aspect ratio the stronger the vibration intensity and this trend becomes more and more obvious with the increase of the flow velocity fig 14 compares the amplitude and amplitude envelope of the riser viv response in the uniform flow and the shear flow fig 14 a and fig 14 c show a sudden change in the vibration intensity of the viv in the uniform flow when v 0 3 m s and v 0 1m s respectively according to the spectral density contour in fig 15 the reason for the sudden change is probably that the lock in vibration occurs in these two conditions however in the shear flow case these sudden changes are not observed because the vortex shedding frequency linearly changes along the spanwise of the riser that will hinder the lock in vibration of the riser anyway in fig 14 if neglect the effect of lock in vibration it can be seen that the viv response is close in the uniform flow and shear flow at a small aspect ratio the vibration amplitude does not change much with the increase of the flow velocity at a small aspect ratio while as the aspect ratio increases the viv amplitude of the riser shows an increasing trend with the increase of the flow velocity and the aspect ratio the effect of the aspect ratio on the cross flow viv in the uniform flow is significantly higher than that in the shear flow 5 aspect ratio replacement strategy based on the viv analysis results of the numerical simulation and experimental test for large aspect ratio riser this paper proposes a new method to reduce the aspect ratio of the riser model while ensuring the viv calculation accuracy in this method a small aspect ratio riser replaces the large aspect ratio one by properly setting the model boundary conditions this section uses a 250 aspect ratio to replace a 500 aspect ratio riser model with the same diameter of 0 04 m as an example to illustrate the proposed aspect ratio replacement strategy the structural properties of the riser models are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 16 the end boundary conditions for riser replacement can be categorized into two types the first type is to constrain one end of the rise while the other end is free end and is forced to move as shown in fig 16 a in the second type both ends of the riser are free as shown in fig 16 b the former can be used to simulate the viv response at the end of a large aspect ratio model while the latter can be used to simulate the viv response in the middle part of a large aspect ratio riser 5 1 model replacement using one free end 5 1 1 analysis in uniform flow in the uniform flow the risers with the aspect ratios of 250 and 500 were respectively investigated firstly the cross flow viv response of the riser with the aspect ratio of 500 was simulated then the vibration displacement velocity and acceleration at the middle point of the 500 riser were added to the free end of the 250 riser lastly the cross flow viv response of the 250 riser model was calculated and compared with that of the 500 riser fig 17 shows the displacement of the 500 riser at its midpoint with the flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 which was used as the boundary condition at the free end of the 250 riser the spatial temporal plot of the viv response of the 250 riser was obtained and compared with that of the 500 riser as shown in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that the spatial temporal plot of the viv generated by the small aspect ratio riser provides very similar characteristics to that of the 500 riser the vibration amplitude of the small aspect ratio riser is smaller than that of the large aspect ratio riser which can be compensated through coefficient correction 5 1 2 analysis in shear flow the two riser models were analyzed in the shear flow and the viv calculation results are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 with a highest flow velocity of 0 5 m s and re 0 20000 from bottom to top it can be seen in fig 20 that the viv response results of the two models are basically consistent in time and frequency domains the amplitude of the viv of the replaced 250 riser is smaller than that of the 500 riser the frequency components of the replacement model are the same as the 500 riser although some modal information is lost in fig 20 b these observations are similar to the case of the uniform flow in fig 19 in fig 21 one can note that the phase conversion period in the middle part of the 250 riser is larger than that of the 500 riser however the overall characteristics of the viv response of the two models are completely comparable 5 2 model replacement using two free ends in this replacement strategy both ends of the 250 riser model were forced to move to simulate the viv response of the middle part of the 500 riser firstly the viv response of the 500 riser was simulated and the response data at 1 4 and 3 4 points of the riser were respectively used as the boundary conditions at the two ends of the 250 riser subsequently the viv response of the 250 riser was calculated and compared with that of the riser model with the aspect ratio of 500 5 2 1 analysis in uniform flow fig 22 shows the comparison of the spatial temporal plots of the viv in the middle parts of the two risers in uniform flow at a flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 and fig 23 shows the power spectral density contours it can be seen that the viv spatial temporal plot of the 250 riser is consistent to that of the 500 riser the amplitude of the 250 riser is relatively smaller which can be modified by applying correction coefficients obtained from the 500 riser result in fig 23 it can be seen that one main frequency component is lost in the 250 riser because the other three main frequency components of the two riser models are perfectly consistent the two free ends replacement method can be applied to reducing the aspect ratio in uniform flow analysis 5 2 2 analysis in shear flow fig 24 shows the rms of the viv amplitude and the power spectral density contours in the middle parts of the two riser models in shear flow at a maximum flow velocity v 0 5 m s and re 20000 it can be seen that both ends of the rms curves of the two risers are well fitted but the deviation in the middle of the rms is very large the viv response of the two riser models fit well in frequency domain but still a main frequency mode is lost in the 250 riser fig 25 shows the spatial temporal plots of the viv in the middle parts of the two riser models it can be seen that the vibration response of the 250 riser becomes slower than that of the 500 riser and changes from standing wave to traveling wave however the spatial temporal characteristics of the two models present a certain difference as a result the two free ends replacement method is less applicable in the shear flow than that in the uniform flow 5 3 amplitude correction in order to further study the deviation of replacement model in uniform flow the aspect ratio replacement was carried out at the flow velocity of 0 7 and 0 9 m s with re 28000 and 36000 the rms of the cross flow viv amplitude is shown in fig 26 it can be seen that the deviation is observed with the change of the flow velocity in order to correct the deviation an empirical coefficient δ is designed as 20 δ γ 0 1 0 δ n n where n is the number of working condition δ n is the amplitude deviation of each working condition and γ is the safety factor which can be expressed as 21 δ n y r m s 2 n y r m s 5 n γ 3 75 v 2 3 5 v 1 7125 where yrms is the rms amplitude of each working condition and v is the flow velocity the corrected rms is shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the rms of the error corrected 250 riser model is well fitted with that of the 500 riser and the higher the flow velocity the better the correction effect hence the proposed model reduction method is applicable to viv simulation 6 conclusions the viv fluid structure interaction numerical simulation model of a top tension riser is established and verified using experimental data the aspect ratio effect on the cross flow viv of the riser is studied in uniform flow and shear flow the aspect ratio replacement strategy that enables to reduce the model aspect ratio is proposed the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 in the same flow field profile along with the change of diameter or length the cross flow viv intensity of the riser shows a positive correlation with the aspect ratio the stiffness of the riser with a large aspect ratio will be relatively reduced and the natural frequency of the riser will be lower which makes it easier for the riser to have a large vibration under the action of ocean currents when the aspect ratio is the same the viv response intensity of the riser model with smaller external diameter is greater in addition the aspect ratio effect on the viv of the riser in the uniform flow field is higher than that in the shear flow field 2 the influence of the different aspect ratio on viv of the riser is greater than the flow field profile factor in both uniform flow field and shear flow field when the flow velocity is the same the riser with a larger aspect ratio has stronger vibration intensity and this trend becomes more obvious with the increase of aspect ratio and flow velocity in the same way the stiffness of the riser with a large slenderness ratio will be relatively reduced and the natural frequency of the riser will be lower which makes it easier for the riser to have a large vibration under the action of ocean currents when aspect ratio is small viv of riser is slow to respond to the change of flow velocity but becomes more sensitive with the increase of aspect ratio it can be concluded that the inherent property of structure is an important factor determining its viv response 3 the effect of aspect ratio replacement strategy in viv study of large aspect ratio riser in the uniform flow field is better than that of the shear flow field the effect of end part replacement of the large aspect ratio riser is better than that of the middle part replacement the actual application effect of this method needs further experimental research there are still some problems need to be improved and solved in our research in this paper the cross flow vibration is taken to investigate the viv of the riser with different aspect ratios the viv characteristics of in line vibration should be taken into considered in the following study the multiples between the different aspect ratio of riser model in the aspect ratio replacement strategy studied in this paper are twice and the case of higher multiples has not been fully studied in addition the aspect ratio replacement strategy in viv study of large aspect ratio riser should carry out experimental research to verify the correctness of the simulation results in the future credit authorship contribution statement guijie liu conceptualization methodology
