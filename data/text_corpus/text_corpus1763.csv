8816,an increasing number of methods have been developed for guiding water risk assessments in different commodity sectors with water being a key sustainability challenge in mining operations these methods may help investors and downstream industries to respond to rising demands for responsible sourcing and investment practices however their fundamental predictive accuracy in the mining sector needs to be resolved this study tests the ability of three assessment methods to adequately reflect water related risks of a mining operation based on a case study approach for six copper mines findings indicate that the methods show potential to support water stewardship strategies however a number of constraints arise from variable degrees of evaluation subjectivity subject generalizations as well as constraints in input data quality recommendations based on these findings include suggestions on the development of a mining specific assessment approach and the refinement of assessment language keywords copper mining water risk risk assessment environmental performance accountability sustainability 1 introduction the value of water to human society is indicated by the acknowledgement of access to safe drinking water as a human right in 2010 sustainable water management also plays a central role for meeting the united nations sustainable development goals aiming to achieve a better and sustainable future for all 1 2 industrial water use accounts for 19 of annual water withdrawals 3 the mining industry a centerpiece to our economy by providing metals and other raw materials to society can be responsible for an important share of industrial water use at a local scale for example in the antofagasta region of chile a key region for global copper production mining accounts for 64 1 of total water use 4 water is both a vital ingredient and a crucial sustainability aspect for mining operations as its use may entail significant environmental and business related risks thus facilitating the sustainable use of water in mining forms an important contribution towards achieving the global sustainable development agenda 5 the high water demand for mining processes is exemplified by copper mining one of the largest commodity sectors and key for infrastructure developments and modern technologies water is required in almost every step of copper production processing one ton of copper ore requires 1 5 3 m3 of water on average 6 7 with billions of tons of copper ore being mined every year the global water footprint of these operations is immense the water use causes significant risks related to water quantity and quality these risks mostly manifest themselves on a local scale where they are influenced by various interdependent factors fig 1 water quantity risks occur due to water abstraction and dewatering activities negatively affecting water availability for ecosystems and water users intense rainfalls may threaten the structural integrity of mine waste management facilities and trigger the discharge of contaminated water from operational sites 8 9 risks related to water quality are governed by site specific conditions centering around the uncontrolled release of sediments metals and metalloids of acute or chronic toxicity in this context the mobilization of contaminants resulting from acid mine drainage due to oxidation of sulfide minerals is a major risk in and around many copper mines 8 10 11 in order to receive approval for constructing a mine and commencing mining activities mining companies are usually required to evaluate water related risks by conducting an environmental impact assessment eia or a more comprehensive environmental and social impact assessment esia 12 an effective esia enables the understanding of social and environmental baseline conditions identify water related impacts and outline effective management procedures 13 it thus forms an important aspect of reducing water related risks at mine sites side specific mitigation measures implemented by mining companies frequently aim to increase water reuse and to avoid the release of contaminated waters or the contact of unimpaired water with mine infrastructure adequate management of mining waste plays a key role in company endeavors to mitigate water risks 8 decreasing average ore grades and increasing copper demand due to economic growth greening economies and new technological developments will put further stress on water resources and require careful management of the associated risks 14 15 negative impacts on water resources threaten not only local communities and ecosystems but also the commercial interests of mining companies and their business partners third party stakeholders such as downstream industries are increasingly being held accountable by policy makers consumers and civil society for the environmental and social impacts created along their upstream commodity supply chains 16 17 similarly banks and investors are facing higher expectations regarding financing standards and ethical investment respectively and water related concerns in mining projects may have significant financial implications relevant to these parties 18 20 using water risk assessment methods may help these third party stakeholders to better understand the water related sustainability performance of mines acting as their raw material suppliers or forming part of their investment portfolio water risk assessment methods were originally designed to assist companies in developing water stewardship strategies understanding water related risks and improving sustainability performance e g 21 22 with the first water risk assessment tool published in 2002 23 however these methods might also be leveraged by downstream and financial industries to follow up on growing societal demands for ensuring sustainable natural resource management making informed engagement decisions and thereby mitigating reputational and financial default risks 24 25 at a broader scale water risk assessment methods may thus help fostering responsible sourcing and investment practices and in turn reinforce a sustainable water resources management at mining sites when considering their potential application to mining projects by interested third parties such as downstream or financial industry the reliability of water risk assessment results is of primary importance as the potential consequences of an inaccurate assessment may be severe for example investors may exclude mining companies from their portfolios due to actual or perceived inadequate or controversial sustainability performance 26 27 the available studies of different water risk assessment methods tend to focus on the method s application without a detailed evaluation of the robustness of risk assessment results moreover they take a general perspective or focus on other industries than mining 28 32 due to the complex set of risk influencing factors characteristic for the mining industry risk evaluations at a general level or from other sectors cannot be readily transferred to the mining context importantly most studies explore the topic from a company s perspective by reporting how these tools are used and what outcomes this generated for the company 28 31 in contrast the methods applications from a third party perspective has not been evaluated in detail due to the asymmetric access to information between companies and third party stakeholders the value of a given method may be fundamentally different for these two parties furthermore methodological approaches mainly rely on literature review and expert interviews to provide an overview and summarize the underlying concepts of the risk assessment methods under evaluation only two studies use actual case studies to test the method s performance both for different industries than mining 30 32 the above observations point to a lack of detailed evaluations of the suitability of water risk assessment methods to be employed by third parties to capture the mine site specific characteristics and risks of water use on this background the present study aims to contribute to the question whether water risk assessment methods represent an opportunity for third party stakeholders such as downstream industries and investors to demonstrate environmental accountability and better understand water related risks at their business partners mining sites for this purpose based on a broad screening of available methods the applicability of three water risk assessment methods is tested against the operational parameters of six copper mines these parameters are captured via a case study approach that allows evaluating the assessment method specific framework with regards to its general suitability strengths and weaknesses when applied in practice at the mine site level in doing so the study identifies common challenges for the application and limitations on the reliability of risk assessment results these observations are then used to develop recommendations for further refinement of water risk assessment methods in the mining context 2 method 2 1 water risk assessment method selection the present study investigates the practical suitability and accuracy of three water risk assessment methods in the operational context of copper mining as a first step a total of 50 methods were identified based on five screening criteria fig 2 using the keywords water risk assessment water risk tool water tools mining and related phrases the keyword search comprised both a general web search as well as an academic literature search from this sample of methods those directly suitable for performing risk assessments were identified and six specific selection criteria were applied in order to model a practical risk evaluation scenario to be employed by interested third party stakeholders fig 2 all methods considered after the first screening step are listed in the electronic appendix table a1 and further details for the selection criteria are shown in the electronic appendix table a2 the three methods satisfying all of the above screening and selection criteria include 1 oekoress or 33 2 the mine the gap framework mtg 34 and 3 the water risk filter wrf 35 initially a fourth method published by bissacot and oliveira 36 satisfied all selection criteria as well however the latter method was not further investigated as its indicators were considered too similar to the wrf detailed information on the three methods are provided in table 1 the first selected method oekoress is a mining specific tool that was developed through a research project commissioned by the german environmental agency 33 the potential target audience of the method includes investors civil society and geological surveys in developing countries the project defines three frameworks for assessing the environmental hazard potential of mining abiotic raw materials only the first of these frameworks targets application at the mine site level and was hence applied for the present study this framework was designed to assess the general environmental hazard potential of mines including but not limited to water related risks the method aims to facilitate a first order rapid identification of risk hot spots of mining projects it aspires to provide reliable indications of the environmental hazard potential of a given mine the second selected method mtg developed by the world resource institute also focusses on the mining sector and is mainly designed to assess business related risks 34 it is intended to help financial actors to start interacting with their clients with regards to water risks in mining a particular challenge for using mtg that only became evident during its application in the present study s case scenario is the lack of clearly defined risk level descriptors for many indicators therefore for the purpose of the present study suitable definitions were developed and attached to all affected descriptors before re applying the method to the case study framework electronic appendix table a 3 in addition the mtg approach does not provide instructions on how to present final risk assessment results for the purpose of the present case study it was therefore decided to present final assessment results as the six categories provided by the method in order to enhance the clarity of presentation table 1 to this end individual mtg risk level descriptors were first grouped thematically under an overarching indicator electronic appendix table a 4 and subsequently aggregated as a single score for a given category the influence of indicator aggregation on final assessment results as delivered by the method was tested by comparing a red flag approach which is common practice in other screening level risk assessments 37 with a general arithmetic mean approach with regards to the former risks for a given category were assigned according to the highest indicator risk identified in that category arithmetic mean values were calculated by quantifying qualitative indicator risks on a relative scale low 1 medium 2 high 3 despite this methodological shortcoming applying the method generated important learning experiences with regards to the study goal as discussed below the third method the wrf developed by the wwf applies to a large range of commodity sectors it focuses on water related business risks and is meant to help companies to either develop a water stewardship and supply chain strategy or to lower financial default risk for investors 35 using a set of differentiated indicators the wrf approach juxtaposes basin related risks such as water availability with company related risks such as water requirements in cases where benchmarking of single wrf indicators was not possible for a given mine due to lack of information or non applicability the method adapts weighting factors for indicator aggregation automatically by adjusting the total weights of the remaining indicators to one hundred percent this implies that data availability has an indirect impact on final risk assessment results using a model case study where complete benchmarking of all indicators was possible the impact of data availability was explored by disregarding either one or two indicators and calculating new assessment results only based on the remaining indicators while noting the maximum deviation from the original assessment results while a new version 5 0 of the wrf is due to be launched in 2019 38 the present study is based on the precursor wrf version available at the time of research as shown in table 1 the methods focus on different types of risks that is environmental and business risks therefore the method evaluation as presented in this study focuses on the methods general practical applicability and accuracy when applied in a mining context in contrast the study does not aim to directly compare specific technical results of the different methods as this would not be supported by the respective methodological framework 2 2 case studies the practical application of each of the three methods described above was modeled for six copper mines through a case study approach a case study approach was chosen as it allows testing the suitability of water risk assessment methods under realistic conditions with direct operational relevance selecting the same commodity that is copper for the six case studies provides for a common denominator as it allows cross examination of the modeled site specific results the common characteristic features of copper mining and the reasons for selecting copper as the commodity of choice for the case studies include 1 mining and processing of copper has a high water demand that can be of critical importance at a local scale 2 copper is a key metal in modern society and its use is likely to further increase with technological developments stressing the importance of understanding the sustainability risks associated with its production and 3 due to their location many copper mines show a high exposure to water scarcity making water resource management a key sustainability challenge at these mines the six copper mines included in the present case study were selected based on a global screening using a commercial mining database 39 in concert with a comprehensive literature review leading to the pre selection of 21 candidate mines necessarily this pre selection of suitable mines reflects publicly accessible data and thus may exclude a number of privately or government owned mining companies with insufficient public reporting of relevant data from the sample of candidates six mines were eventually selected with the goal to cover different production regions regulatory contexts and variable local climate regimes while also considering adequate data availability fig 2 out of the six selected case studies three copper mines have experienced severe water related issues in the last ten years whereas the other three have not publicly reported any major issue an issue is considered to be a legal reputational environmental social or financial problem or any combination of these that the company experienced due to its water use the observation period of ten years was chosen for two reasons first there have been significant improvements in public reporting standards and management practice in mining over the last decade such that an evaluation based on modern day reporting cannot be directly compared to the situation as reported over a decade ago ten years was hence chosen as an upper time limit second as risks describe the relative likelihood of incidents to happen within a certain time period the mine should have been in full operation over a sufficient period of time hence mines less than ten years in operation were excluded from the sample in order to be useful as a tool for downstream industries or financial stakeholders it is expected that the water risk assessment methods demonstrate the capacity to identify mine operations with significant water problems as higher risk projects this qualification requirement relates to the fact that indicators in the regulatory and reputational risk categories especially of the wrf explicitly deal with both past and current problems in addition many of the risk determining factors in the geology technology and local environmental category of the methods are subjected to little or no change and their contribution to past and present water problems and conflicts can also be expected to lead to higher risks in the future in a similar fashion salem 40 shows that the presence of community conflicts in the past as it is the case for all mines with water related issues is the foremost reason for further conflicts in the future even if mitigation measures were emplaced they might come at significant costs posing a risk to investors and a positive outcome is far from certain 41 moreover all mines included as case studies with reported issues have been related to water pollution incidents as outlined by younger 42 this type of issues in a mining project can be long lasting if not perpetual and it represents an important financial liability for the company and therefore a major uncertainty for the investor 43 44 these issues further pose a significant social risk since prevailing environmental impacts are an important factor in increasing the likelihood for social conflicts 45 moreover it is important to keep in mind that water risk assessment methods are most likely to be applied when a mine is already operational rather than in earlier mine development stages table 1 this reflects that except for the or method some indicators of the water risk assessment tools rely on operational data that are not available during earlier development stages however the assessment and management of water risks starts well before mining commences with an eia as a crucial step for permitting and subsequent activities the information generated through an eia is thus important for the risk management and project due diligence employed by investors or lenders involved in financing mine construction the six copper mines selected based on the above methodology are listed in table 2 including a short description of key features and the applicable mine specific water related issues group a comprises the sample of mines without reported water issues whereas group b represents the sample of mines with reported water issues within the ten year observation period in group a neither highland valley copper aitik or lumwana reported any severe problem due to their water use minor incidents such as spills of diesel fuel did occur but these did not result in any significant environmental legal financial or reputational consequences in contrast grasberg nchanga and los pelambres all encountered serious problems due to their water use in grasberg a major issue is the severe environmental degradation with associated international reputational damage the mine encounters due to the riverine disposal of tailings 46 47 the environmental impacts also led to blacklisting of the operator freeport mcmoran in investment portfolios 48 in nchanga severe water pollution has led to a conflict with the local population that has been brought to court in the united kingdom where the operator is stock listed 49 50 a special case study is los pelambres for almost a decade the operation has experienced strong opposition against its el mauro tailings dam due to alleged water quantity and quality deterioration as well as concerns on dam integrity in case of a seismic event 51 52 in the end an ultimate court ruling and a multi stakeholder agreement resolved this conflict 53 54 however to this day there are divergent opinions reflected in publicly available information as to whether or not the concerns have been duly addressed 54 57 therefore for the purpose of the present case study two separate mine water risk profiles were developed in order to test the influence of these diverging perspectives on the computed final risk assessment results in general model case studies of individual mine water risks were developed by compiling and evaluating a dataset of publicly accessible information relevant data on mine operational parameters and water incidents were sourced from company reports official documents peer reviewed publications newspapers articles and reports from non governmental organizations languages considered comprise english spanish and german additionally in order to verify information related to four incidents sourced from english news and reports google translate was used to identify additional local news coverage in the cases of aitik swedish and grasberg indonesian this process served to assess the scale of local media coverage with regards to certain water issues without the need to actually obtain a precise translation of incident details while case study results are expected to be generally accurate two possible constraints should be noted 1 although data collection from public sources was as thorough as possible it cannot be excluded that some relevant information was missed this may be relevant in particular for the two mines operating in sweden and indonesia where reports in the respective local language may provide additional information however given the international prominence of these two mines it is not likely that critical problems would not have been reported in english at some point 2 publicly available information is not always unambiguous which may introduce a degree of evaluation subjectivity as further discussed in section 4 4 of this contribution some of the case studies indicate that this may be a significant challenge for applying certain water risk assessment methods these constraints may be considered as typical for the practical application of mining related water risk assessment methods by third parties therefore the case study results as presented in this contribution should be considered a means to an end to demonstrating the practical relevance of water risk assessments while noting that they are not meant to represent detailed site specific or sector wide evaluations of water risks 3 results 3 1 practical method applicability in order to represent a practical instrument for risk assessments by third parties such as investors or downstream supply chain stakeholders the work time consumption and evaluation expertise required for performing a water risk assessment for a given mining project are relevant factors as lower assessment times will require less working hours to be invested into the assessment this might help incentivizing their application moreover given the diverse range of expertise anticipated for potential third party users from the investment and downstream community it is advantageous for a method s applicability if it can be applied without an expert background in technical disciplines such as mining hydraulic or environmental engineering the method should rather rely on the smallest common denominator and build up on a general educational background with an understanding for potentially relevant data sources and the skills needed to locate and access information therein reflecting the differing levels of technical detail established by the three methods the time required for performing case studies of an individual mine varied considerably with two days on average and only thirteen indicators the or method requires the lowest assessment time input per case study in addition the or method does not include indicators on company management practices and policies therefore it is not necessary for the evaluator to study company documents in detail which is otherwise very time consuming in general the or method is straightforward to apply even without significant expertise in mining hydraulic or environmental engineering this is mainly due to three reasons first the risk indicators and level descriptors are precisely formulated and avoid sophisticated technical language second information is generally easily accessible either from public databases or from company reports and other documents the consideration of technical documents is not required third in cases where the required information is unavailable the method offers an alternative generic risk classification for some of its indicators the mtg method is thematically more extensive it requires the consideration of the mine s management engagement and disclosure practices table 1 this in addition to the definition of risk level descriptors leads to higher assessment time requirements of around five days per case study when applying the method the mtg method partly requires detailed information that is often only available in technical reports such as feasibility studies even in cases where benchmarking data are not very complex e g the size of a mixing zone in a water body locating the right information in these technical documents requires basic knowledge of technical language this is a potential challenge for method users with little mining expertise this aspect is even more pronounced if the benchmarking data for applying individual method indicators gets more technical e g aquifer permeability the wrf method indicators put a strong emphasis on past events management approaches and company policies and requires about eight days of work time input per case study benchmarking management based non technical indicators creates different challenges related to non standardized reporting language that does not directly match indicator language this challenge applies to both the wrf and the mtg methods thus subjective interpretations by the evaluator are required in order to assign risk levels to these indicators in addition although according to the method s developer the wwf the wrf method was also designed for investors and banks some indicators in the questionnaire are challenging to address without access to internal information of the mining company being assessed 35 3 2 mine water risk profiles generated through the case studies copper mine water risk profiles generated with the or and mtg methods do not show any systematic differentiation between case studies of groups a and b fig 3 b and c for the or method the los pelambres and highland valley copper mines are associated with the highest and lowest water risk profiles respectively a good correlation of lower risk profiles for group a case studies compared to group b mines can only be found for the or method indicator on natural disasters applying the mtg method ranks the nchanga and grasberg mines as having the highest and lowest risk profiles respectively a comparison of the influence of aggregation on computed risk assessment results fig 3c and d indicates that absolute risk scores are generally lower for the arithmetic mean approach but relative risks show little change in contrast applying the wrf method resulted in more differentiated risk profiles better in line with the expected outcome according to the mine distribution in groups a and b fig 3e regarding company risks nchanga has the overall highest and aitik the lowest risks with the second lowest risk identified for highland valley copper the high risk modeled for highland valley copper and the low risk for los pelambres in the company water scarcity category may be contrary to the anticipated general risk distribution this is caused by the highly weighted wrf indicator importance of having sufficient amounts of clean fresh water for the operation in combination with subjective company reporting on this issue antofagasta as the operator of los pelambres rates the importance as very low not important at all arguing that while water in general is vital for the mine operation good quality water is only needed for drinking purposes 58 in contrast teck resources as the operator of highland valley copper rates water importance as very high arguing that water of adequate quality is vital for operations 59 as such subjective mining company statements based on differing interpretation of indicator wording may introduce a bias when applying the assessment method the good correlations shown in the wrf company regulatory risks category with the low and high risks expected for group a and group b reflects that legal issues were used as selection criteria to identify mines with or without water related problems respectively fig 3f shows the impact of modeling different perspectives for the water dispute surrounding the los pelambres operation with regards to the wrf results the inner circle models risk profiles constructed based on the perspective of opponents to the mine operation the outer circle reflects the risk according to the mine operator s perspective notable differences between the two perspectives occur for regulatory and pollution risks similar differences do not occur when applying the or or mtg methods to the los pelambres case study the influence of data availability on final assessment results was tested using the highland valley copper case study as noted the wrf adapts its indicator weighting if indicators remain unanswered in fig 4 symbols indicate the original assessment results in the categories water scarcity and water pollution that are obtained with all indicators answered the influence of data availability was then tested by disregarding either one x axis or two y axis indicators and recalculating the category assessment results the error bars indicate the substantial change of up to 50 of the initial category risk and highlight the impact of data availability on risk profiles 4 discussion 4 1 application framework for water risk assessment methods in mining overall the evaluated methods use an indicator and level descriptor formulation that allow their application by users with a general educational background mostly avoiding the use of specified technical language all three water risk assessment methods may therefore be reasonably well applied by interested stakeholders like investors and downstream industries without requiring a specialized mining engineering or hydrological background this observation supports the methods applicability for a broader range of industries or commodities and delivers on investor demand to provide broadly applicable assessment standards 60 from among the investigated water risk assessment methods the or method stands out as being particularly suitable to be applied without having significant mining expertise as it is based on easily accessible factual information with precisely formulated indicators and level descriptors in addition the method s generic risk classification to be applied in case of missing indicator data is appropriate for most mining projects however this ease of use comes at the expense of method precision in terms of resolving individual risks as shown in section 4 3 below a general factor affecting the practical application of water risk assessments by third party stakeholders is the level of investigative detail and the associated research time requirement associated with a given method the higher number of indicators and information requirements on company polices and management practices necessitates higher assessment time input for the mtg and wrf methods with an average of five and eight working days per case study respectively as there are indications that consideration of supply chain sustainability and the associated customer demand is still inhomogeneous among investors it remains an open question whether investors would be motivated to invest this considerable time span 60 61 in the new wrf version 5 0 a rapid assessment option will be integrated which might help overcoming this issue 38 4 2 accuracy of predicted water risks applying the three methods as case studies to a range of copper mines provides insights with regards to the methods accuracy the or method identifies highland valley copper and los pelambres as the copper mines with the lowest and highest environmental hazard potential respectively thus users of the method would identify a project as the most risky one which indeed experienced water related problems 52 additionally the high risk ratings obtained from the group b mine case studies for the indicator on natural disasters accurately highlight an actual risk hot spot for the los pelambres mine an important topic in the long standing conflict is the integrity of the new el mauro tailings dam in case of an earthquake 52 in grasberg the most controversial issue is the riverine tailings disposal 46 which the operator justifies with the local environmental conditions including seismic events and heavy rainfalls 62 63 both the mtg and wrf methods identify nchanga as the mine case study with the highest water risks indeed the project is associated with a history of legal charges environmental degradation and negative reputation e g 49 50 64 however applying the mtg method would also lead its users to infer that the grasberg mine has overall low risks despite the serious water issues that the project has experienced e g 46 65 thus the method successfully identifies some but not all of the anticipated water risk hotspots in general from among the tested risk assessment tools the wrf was the only method that produced differentiated results in line with the expected mine risk distribution pattern the underlying reason for this might be the different thematic approach of the tool in dealing more extensively with company policies and management practices the method evaluates not only whether certain risks exist but how these risks are managed although two of the three investigated water assessment methods or wrf do successfully identify those projects as high risk that are indeed struggling with water issues and assigning lowest risks to projects that do not the quality and reproducibility of the evaluation results is constrained by several factors as shown below 4 3 resolution of risk assessment results the low degree of differentiation in the or and mtg method hampers the effective identification of risk categories to follow up on this is especially pronounced in the or method s geological and technical categories that are mostly rated as high risk however identifying these aspects of a mining operation as risk hotspots does not have direct implications as the geological aspects of a deposit are pre defined and to a certain degree determine the technology that can be used for mining and processing in order to assess the actual environmental hazard potential of the mine measures put in place by the company to manage these risks would need to be evaluated in parallel this is not possible with the or method despite the preferential interest of third party stakeholders in risk mitigation rather than just detecting the presence of risks 24 the optional generic risk rating of the or method can be excluded as an underlying reason for the method s low ability to provide differentiated water assessment results considering all indicators and case studies a generic risk was only assigned six times five times for the method indicator radioactivity for all other ratings company specific information was used instead a reason for the method s low ability to differentiate water risks at the mine level might be its broader scope aiming to assess the environmental hazard potential in general rather than focusing on individual water risks in addition as the method was designed to be a one size fits all solution applicable to different commodities it tends to generalize in order to accommodate the range of possible indicator manifestations into three level descriptors the combination of both factors contributes to the observed homogeneous water risk profiles obtained with the or method in fact these factors indicate that mines evaluated with the or method will always have similar water risk profiles for a given commodity regardless of their actual environmental performance as shown by frederiksen 66 simplifications and generalizations in assessments bear the risk to undermine real efforts to increase water related sustainability performance this is caused by motivating the assessed company to focus only on the well visible simplified issues considered in the respective risk assessment method instead of tackling the underlying more complex causes for water problems applying the mtg method creates similar challenges the method covers a broad range of thematic aspects and assesses risk management and mitigation however it falls short of evaluating these aspects with sufficient granularity and on the backdrop of the local conditions contributing to homogenous risk profiles for different mines in this case the similarity of the results is also influenced by the method s poorly defined aggregation procedure in fact the mtg method leaves it to the user to decide on how to work with the results if a red flag approach is taken this quickly leads to assigning a high risk category rating since already a single high risk indicator triggers a corresponding rating for the whole category on the other hand an arithmetic mean approach might result in the mutual leveling out of high and low risk indicators resulting in a high number of medium risk categories as such the method is not directly suitable to generate differentiated water risk profiles the problem of low resolution is less of an issue with the wrf method 4 4 subjectivity of risk assessment results the absence of guidance provided by the mtg method combined with the high number of undefined risk level descriptors electronic appendix table a3 introduces a high degree of evaluation subjectivity as most practitioners can be expected to approach these issues differently based on their personal subject expertise and experience for example the mtg method leaves it to the user to define what is considered as an aquifer of high permeability the method s evaluation subjectivity considerably lowers the reproducibility of the results and the assessment accuracy challenges of a practitioners subjectivity are also common to other evaluative framework in the mining industry for example environmental impact assessments eia are often an integral part of project permitting in many jurisdictions and a critical aspect for managing water related risks stakeholder consultations an important part of the eia process commonly expose a wide range of perspectives by different stakeholders and as such can never be entirely objective 67 rather as part of a larger eia process social impact assessments are often grounded on personal perception as well as concerns by different stakeholders groups expressed as descriptive indicators which makes them intrinsically subjective 68 69 quantitative methods are advantageous in this context however they are very resource intensive often requiring an extensive database and sophisticated modeling approach an expert judgment approach is therefore often seen as a more practical approach for identifying impacts and their probabilities to manifest as well as adequate mitigation measures 67 nevertheless especially when it comes to estimating the significance of identified impacts different practitioners will commonly arrive at different conclusions based on the contextual background of the operation their personal background and potential conflicts of interest introducing subjectivity into the process 70 71 the problem of subjectivity due to imprecise wording was also encountered in the wrf as shown in table a3 of the electronic appendix for example the difference between advanced contingency plans for all scenarios and high level contingency plans remains unclear aside from the fact that users would have to know all scenarios to evaluate a given question the interpretation of what is considered advanced versus high level might vary among users thus lowering comparability of results a similar point was risen by koch and hobbs 72 for the case of evaluating the success of restoring a former bauxite mining area comparing the influence of different indicator systems to evaluate restoration success and discussing how to deal with deficiencies in fulfilling reclamation goals the authors outline how experts from different disciplines might interpret deficiencies in their respective field of subject as being more serious implying different evaluation outcomes the strikingly low company reputational risk of los pelambres obtained through applying the wrf underlines this aspect the latter was the result of the subjective decision of the authors to rate the on going conflict over the past decade as one single dispute which would seem justified as it mainly centered around the same el mauro dam issue 52 however other practitioners might interpret the situation differently or rather consider the company view instead of its opponents leading to different risk profiles again the subjectivity of risk assessment results limits their reproducibility with its precise indicator definitions this problem is least pronounced for the or method 4 5 data availability one of the greatest obstacles for assessing company risks with the wrf method is currently the availability of data as shown in table 2 certain risk indicators cannot be adequately benchmarked due to lack of data the quality of reporting and availability of mining related data is commonly subject to a certain bias influenced by the size and public listing status of the mining company as well as to the enforcement of a mining regulatory framework in the country of operation 27 this observation is reflected in our dataset during the initial screening step for identifying the case studies a number of projects with small operators had to be excluded due to lack of data this restricts the scope of application of the method to cases with good data availability it should be noted that gaps in data coverage affect intra method weighting factors thus influencing final water risk assessment results there are two workarounds to overcome the challenge of insufficient data first input data from a longer time period can be considered for the present study both data from the past ten years and recent company information were taken into account as a result the case studies create integrated multi year risk profiles rather than reflecting the most recent situation second in addition to data sourced from the mine operator reporting by potential parent companies or other sources can be used as information source however this approach may create other forms of consistency challenges due to differences between reporting standards or the lack of proper local implementation of parental company policies as shown by ruokonena and temmes 73 this may even happen in mature mining jurisdictions or where large mining companies are involved 74 the nchanga mine in zambia is an example which is characterized by a huge discrepancy in data reported by the company e g 75 and information obtained from academia 76 government 77 and non governmental organizations 78 these limitations on accessible data quality and quantity directly affect the reliability of computed water assessment results especially for the wrf and mtg methods where company data is the primary source of information this problem is less pronounced with the or approach as most data required for that method are simple straightforward facts or sourced from open source databases making the method mostly independent from company reporting 4 6 implications and recommendations the reliance of some indicators on operational data renders the investigated methods most suitable to be applied while the mine is active with an earlier application possible for or when evaluating clients and business partners the high level data scope of water risk assessment methods might be a valuable resource to be used before more detailed site specific data as for example presented in eias are taken into account as argued by kunz 79 it may be beneficial to employ a top down approach in water risk evaluation using a generic assessment framework as a first step this may help identifying priority areas to follow up on in a later more comprehensive evaluation otherwise direct consideration of a large number of details can be paralyzing for interested third party stakeholders such as investors especially if they are not familiar with the subject matter in detail in this fashion water risk assessment methods may act as a door opener allowing to start a conversation on safeguarding water resources in this regard the ease of use and broad applicability makes all three water risk assessment methods reviewed oekoress mine the gap and the water risk filter potentially suitable for application by investors or downstream industries at the same time their potential to guide subsequent more detailed investigations is currently limited by a range of factors that preclude the delivery of site specific results of sufficient accuracy risk ratings are particularly prone to being skewed by deliberately optimistic or fragmented company reporting as such third party method users should have a clear understanding of the data sources used for applying a given risk assessment method sourcing data from public instead of or in addition to company reports might help alleviating this potential issue some companies may have procedures for third party verification of their own reporting in place which may also help ensuring a balanced reporting if a third party user employs a risk assessment method to evaluate several mines it is recommended to precisely define all risk level descriptors prior to the assessment in order to reduce subjectivity and facilitate comparability of results method developers can contribute to lowering subjectivity and make their methods more amenable for third party use by striving for a precise and clear assessment language that is aligned with the reporting language used for sourcing information such as company sustainability reports in addition as exemplified by the or method it is beneficial to preferentially rely on factual information that leaves little room for interpretation and that is less prone to being influenced by possibly agenda driven company reporting in addition it is of crucial importance that assessment methods consider risk management and risk mitigation in addition to risk identification as exemplified by the wrf method a mine operating in a high risk environment may have good water management and risk mitigation measures in place whereas a badly managed mine operating in a lower risk environment may still show negative environmental performance combining the individual strengths of the analyzed methods might help to increase the overall value reliability and accuracy of risk assessment results in this regard using the methodological advantages provided by the wrf approach while expanding its scope to a mining specific version of the tool as available for the or and mtg methods would allow better consideration of the special characteristics of mining operations while harnessing the benefits of assessing risks plus their mitigation at the same time to this end the wrf questionnaire could be tailored to the special characteristics and factors influencing water related risks at mine sites to include key sustainability aspects such as mine waste management an additional benefit would arise if the method also allowed an assessment of water related aspects such as mine waste management on the backdrop contextual factors relevant to this aspect including climate and topography both of which could be covered in the wrf method s basin risk category finally relying on an unambiguous formulation of indicators in the mining specific questionnaire as done for the or method would help increasing reproducibility and comparability of risk assessment results considering the growing trend of data disclosure by mining companies 80 there is also potential that the current constraints for applying the wrf due to limitations in data availability will be less significant in the future a method considering these recommendations could act as an entry point to water stewardship efforts for non mining experts and at the same time yield the necessary predictive accuracy and reliability to efficiently prioritize aspects to follow up on in dialogue with the assessed company the recommendations provided in this study are of a general nature and would be expected to apply to other commodity sectors in a similar fashion however owing to the size and structure of the copper sector data availability for copper mines may be expected to be overall higher compared to smaller more specialized commodity sectors therefore future research focusing on other commodities might expose more pronounced constraints on risk assessment results for such commodities 5 conclusions due to its water intensive nature mining is associated with high risks to negatively impact on water resources unless adequate management procedures are put in place in the wake of increasing societal and business demands for responsible sourcing and sustainable investment negative water related impacts in mine operations may trigger reputational and business risks for external stakeholders in downstream industries or in the financial sector this may motivate these third party stakeholders to improve their understanding of the water risks of mining operations associated with their supply chain or investment portfolio focusing on copper mining as a major global commodity sector with good data availability this study explores the use of publicly available water risk assessment methods to guide the evaluation of water risks by third parties the following conclusions may be drawn in this regard two out of three investigated water risk assessment methods succeeded in identifying mines that experience water related problems as higher risk projects compared to projects that do not struggle with prominent water issues combined with the methods relative ease of application this indicates the general suitability of water risk assessment methods to help initiating a conversation on water related sustainability in mining however all of the three investigated methods show consistency challenges with regards to mine site specific integrated water risk profiles these challenges relate to variable degrees of generalizations evaluation subjectivity as well as constraints in accessible data quality and quantity therefore third parties using these methods should be cautious to not over interpret assessment results as the representation of side specific risk influencing factors is limited recommendations for method improvement refer to combining the specific advantages of the individual methods by using a precise assessment language together with a mining sector specific approach that allows the simultaneous consideration of risks and mitigation measures at sufficient granularity this may unlock more value of these methods by enabling them to return a higher degree of accuracy and reliability that would be required to effectively guide subsequent more detailed risk investigations at the mine site in supporting third parties such as downstream industries and investors to introduce and monitor sustainability principles in their supply chains and investment portfolios water risk assessment methods can provide a competitive advantage for mining companies with a strong sustainability agenda and act as an incentive for change at other operations in this regard an increasing uptake in water risk assessment in the mining sector may contribute to achieving the united nations sustainable development agenda author contribution lucas gilsbach

8816,an increasing number of methods have been developed for guiding water risk assessments in different commodity sectors with water being a key sustainability challenge in mining operations these methods may help investors and downstream industries to respond to rising demands for responsible sourcing and investment practices however their fundamental predictive accuracy in the mining sector needs to be resolved this study tests the ability of three assessment methods to adequately reflect water related risks of a mining operation based on a case study approach for six copper mines findings indicate that the methods show potential to support water stewardship strategies however a number of constraints arise from variable degrees of evaluation subjectivity subject generalizations as well as constraints in input data quality recommendations based on these findings include suggestions on the development of a mining specific assessment approach and the refinement of assessment language keywords copper mining water risk risk assessment environmental performance accountability sustainability 1 introduction the value of water to human society is indicated by the acknowledgement of access to safe drinking water as a human right in 2010 sustainable water management also plays a central role for meeting the united nations sustainable development goals aiming to achieve a better and sustainable future for all 1 2 industrial water use accounts for 19 of annual water withdrawals 3 the mining industry a centerpiece to our economy by providing metals and other raw materials to society can be responsible for an important share of industrial water use at a local scale for example in the antofagasta region of chile a key region for global copper production mining accounts for 64 1 of total water use 4 water is both a vital ingredient and a crucial sustainability aspect for mining operations as its use may entail significant environmental and business related risks thus facilitating the sustainable use of water in mining forms an important contribution towards achieving the global sustainable development agenda 5 the high water demand for mining processes is exemplified by copper mining one of the largest commodity sectors and key for infrastructure developments and modern technologies water is required in almost every step of copper production processing one ton of copper ore requires 1 5 3 m3 of water on average 6 7 with billions of tons of copper ore being mined every year the global water footprint of these operations is immense the water use causes significant risks related to water quantity and quality these risks mostly manifest themselves on a local scale where they are influenced by various interdependent factors fig 1 water quantity risks occur due to water abstraction and dewatering activities negatively affecting water availability for ecosystems and water users intense rainfalls may threaten the structural integrity of mine waste management facilities and trigger the discharge of contaminated water from operational sites 8 9 risks related to water quality are governed by site specific conditions centering around the uncontrolled release of sediments metals and metalloids of acute or chronic toxicity in this context the mobilization of contaminants resulting from acid mine drainage due to oxidation of sulfide minerals is a major risk in and around many copper mines 8 10 11 in order to receive approval for constructing a mine and commencing mining activities mining companies are usually required to evaluate water related risks by conducting an environmental impact assessment eia or a more comprehensive environmental and social impact assessment esia 12 an effective esia enables the understanding of social and environmental baseline conditions identify water related impacts and outline effective management procedures 13 it thus forms an important aspect of reducing water related risks at mine sites side specific mitigation measures implemented by mining companies frequently aim to increase water reuse and to avoid the release of contaminated waters or the contact of unimpaired water with mine infrastructure adequate management of mining waste plays a key role in company endeavors to mitigate water risks 8 decreasing average ore grades and increasing copper demand due to economic growth greening economies and new technological developments will put further stress on water resources and require careful management of the associated risks 14 15 negative impacts on water resources threaten not only local communities and ecosystems but also the commercial interests of mining companies and their business partners third party stakeholders such as downstream industries are increasingly being held accountable by policy makers consumers and civil society for the environmental and social impacts created along their upstream commodity supply chains 16 17 similarly banks and investors are facing higher expectations regarding financing standards and ethical investment respectively and water related concerns in mining projects may have significant financial implications relevant to these parties 18 20 using water risk assessment methods may help these third party stakeholders to better understand the water related sustainability performance of mines acting as their raw material suppliers or forming part of their investment portfolio water risk assessment methods were originally designed to assist companies in developing water stewardship strategies understanding water related risks and improving sustainability performance e g 21 22 with the first water risk assessment tool published in 2002 23 however these methods might also be leveraged by downstream and financial industries to follow up on growing societal demands for ensuring sustainable natural resource management making informed engagement decisions and thereby mitigating reputational and financial default risks 24 25 at a broader scale water risk assessment methods may thus help fostering responsible sourcing and investment practices and in turn reinforce a sustainable water resources management at mining sites when considering their potential application to mining projects by interested third parties such as downstream or financial industry the reliability of water risk assessment results is of primary importance as the potential consequences of an inaccurate assessment may be severe for example investors may exclude mining companies from their portfolios due to actual or perceived inadequate or controversial sustainability performance 26 27 the available studies of different water risk assessment methods tend to focus on the method s application without a detailed evaluation of the robustness of risk assessment results moreover they take a general perspective or focus on other industries than mining 28 32 due to the complex set of risk influencing factors characteristic for the mining industry risk evaluations at a general level or from other sectors cannot be readily transferred to the mining context importantly most studies explore the topic from a company s perspective by reporting how these tools are used and what outcomes this generated for the company 28 31 in contrast the methods applications from a third party perspective has not been evaluated in detail due to the asymmetric access to information between companies and third party stakeholders the value of a given method may be fundamentally different for these two parties furthermore methodological approaches mainly rely on literature review and expert interviews to provide an overview and summarize the underlying concepts of the risk assessment methods under evaluation only two studies use actual case studies to test the method s performance both for different industries than mining 30 32 the above observations point to a lack of detailed evaluations of the suitability of water risk assessment methods to be employed by third parties to capture the mine site specific characteristics and risks of water use on this background the present study aims to contribute to the question whether water risk assessment methods represent an opportunity for third party stakeholders such as downstream industries and investors to demonstrate environmental accountability and better understand water related risks at their business partners mining sites for this purpose based on a broad screening of available methods the applicability of three water risk assessment methods is tested against the operational parameters of six copper mines these parameters are captured via a case study approach that allows evaluating the assessment method specific framework with regards to its general suitability strengths and weaknesses when applied in practice at the mine site level in doing so the study identifies common challenges for the application and limitations on the reliability of risk assessment results these observations are then used to develop recommendations for further refinement of water risk assessment methods in the mining context 2 method 2 1 water risk assessment method selection the present study investigates the practical suitability and accuracy of three water risk assessment methods in the operational context of copper mining as a first step a total of 50 methods were identified based on five screening criteria fig 2 using the keywords water risk assessment water risk tool water tools mining and related phrases the keyword search comprised both a general web search as well as an academic literature search from this sample of methods those directly suitable for performing risk assessments were identified and six specific selection criteria were applied in order to model a practical risk evaluation scenario to be employed by interested third party stakeholders fig 2 all methods considered after the first screening step are listed in the electronic appendix table a1 and further details for the selection criteria are shown in the electronic appendix table a2 the three methods satisfying all of the above screening and selection criteria include 1 oekoress or 33 2 the mine the gap framework mtg 34 and 3 the water risk filter wrf 35 initially a fourth method published by bissacot and oliveira 36 satisfied all selection criteria as well however the latter method was not further investigated as its indicators were considered too similar to the wrf detailed information on the three methods are provided in table 1 the first selected method oekoress is a mining specific tool that was developed through a research project commissioned by the german environmental agency 33 the potential target audience of the method includes investors civil society and geological surveys in developing countries the project defines three frameworks for assessing the environmental hazard potential of mining abiotic raw materials only the first of these frameworks targets application at the mine site level and was hence applied for the present study this framework was designed to assess the general environmental hazard potential of mines including but not limited to water related risks the method aims to facilitate a first order rapid identification of risk hot spots of mining projects it aspires to provide reliable indications of the environmental hazard potential of a given mine the second selected method mtg developed by the world resource institute also focusses on the mining sector and is mainly designed to assess business related risks 34 it is intended to help financial actors to start interacting with their clients with regards to water risks in mining a particular challenge for using mtg that only became evident during its application in the present study s case scenario is the lack of clearly defined risk level descriptors for many indicators therefore for the purpose of the present study suitable definitions were developed and attached to all affected descriptors before re applying the method to the case study framework electronic appendix table a 3 in addition the mtg approach does not provide instructions on how to present final risk assessment results for the purpose of the present case study it was therefore decided to present final assessment results as the six categories provided by the method in order to enhance the clarity of presentation table 1 to this end individual mtg risk level descriptors were first grouped thematically under an overarching indicator electronic appendix table a 4 and subsequently aggregated as a single score for a given category the influence of indicator aggregation on final assessment results as delivered by the method was tested by comparing a red flag approach which is common practice in other screening level risk assessments 37 with a general arithmetic mean approach with regards to the former risks for a given category were assigned according to the highest indicator risk identified in that category arithmetic mean values were calculated by quantifying qualitative indicator risks on a relative scale low 1 medium 2 high 3 despite this methodological shortcoming applying the method generated important learning experiences with regards to the study goal as discussed below the third method the wrf developed by the wwf applies to a large range of commodity sectors it focuses on water related business risks and is meant to help companies to either develop a water stewardship and supply chain strategy or to lower financial default risk for investors 35 using a set of differentiated indicators the wrf approach juxtaposes basin related risks such as water availability with company related risks such as water requirements in cases where benchmarking of single wrf indicators was not possible for a given mine due to lack of information or non applicability the method adapts weighting factors for indicator aggregation automatically by adjusting the total weights of the remaining indicators to one hundred percent this implies that data availability has an indirect impact on final risk assessment results using a model case study where complete benchmarking of all indicators was possible the impact of data availability was explored by disregarding either one or two indicators and calculating new assessment results only based on the remaining indicators while noting the maximum deviation from the original assessment results while a new version 5 0 of the wrf is due to be launched in 2019 38 the present study is based on the precursor wrf version available at the time of research as shown in table 1 the methods focus on different types of risks that is environmental and business risks therefore the method evaluation as presented in this study focuses on the methods general practical applicability and accuracy when applied in a mining context in contrast the study does not aim to directly compare specific technical results of the different methods as this would not be supported by the respective methodological framework 2 2 case studies the practical application of each of the three methods described above was modeled for six copper mines through a case study approach a case study approach was chosen as it allows testing the suitability of water risk assessment methods under realistic conditions with direct operational relevance selecting the same commodity that is copper for the six case studies provides for a common denominator as it allows cross examination of the modeled site specific results the common characteristic features of copper mining and the reasons for selecting copper as the commodity of choice for the case studies include 1 mining and processing of copper has a high water demand that can be of critical importance at a local scale 2 copper is a key metal in modern society and its use is likely to further increase with technological developments stressing the importance of understanding the sustainability risks associated with its production and 3 due to their location many copper mines show a high exposure to water scarcity making water resource management a key sustainability challenge at these mines the six copper mines included in the present case study were selected based on a global screening using a commercial mining database 39 in concert with a comprehensive literature review leading to the pre selection of 21 candidate mines necessarily this pre selection of suitable mines reflects publicly accessible data and thus may exclude a number of privately or government owned mining companies with insufficient public reporting of relevant data from the sample of candidates six mines were eventually selected with the goal to cover different production regions regulatory contexts and variable local climate regimes while also considering adequate data availability fig 2 out of the six selected case studies three copper mines have experienced severe water related issues in the last ten years whereas the other three have not publicly reported any major issue an issue is considered to be a legal reputational environmental social or financial problem or any combination of these that the company experienced due to its water use the observation period of ten years was chosen for two reasons first there have been significant improvements in public reporting standards and management practice in mining over the last decade such that an evaluation based on modern day reporting cannot be directly compared to the situation as reported over a decade ago ten years was hence chosen as an upper time limit second as risks describe the relative likelihood of incidents to happen within a certain time period the mine should have been in full operation over a sufficient period of time hence mines less than ten years in operation were excluded from the sample in order to be useful as a tool for downstream industries or financial stakeholders it is expected that the water risk assessment methods demonstrate the capacity to identify mine operations with significant water problems as higher risk projects this qualification requirement relates to the fact that indicators in the regulatory and reputational risk categories especially of the wrf explicitly deal with both past and current problems in addition many of the risk determining factors in the geology technology and local environmental category of the methods are subjected to little or no change and their contribution to past and present water problems and conflicts can also be expected to lead to higher risks in the future in a similar fashion salem 40 shows that the presence of community conflicts in the past as it is the case for all mines with water related issues is the foremost reason for further conflicts in the future even if mitigation measures were emplaced they might come at significant costs posing a risk to investors and a positive outcome is far from certain 41 moreover all mines included as case studies with reported issues have been related to water pollution incidents as outlined by younger 42 this type of issues in a mining project can be long lasting if not perpetual and it represents an important financial liability for the company and therefore a major uncertainty for the investor 43 44 these issues further pose a significant social risk since prevailing environmental impacts are an important factor in increasing the likelihood for social conflicts 45 moreover it is important to keep in mind that water risk assessment methods are most likely to be applied when a mine is already operational rather than in earlier mine development stages table 1 this reflects that except for the or method some indicators of the water risk assessment tools rely on operational data that are not available during earlier development stages however the assessment and management of water risks starts well before mining commences with an eia as a crucial step for permitting and subsequent activities the information generated through an eia is thus important for the risk management and project due diligence employed by investors or lenders involved in financing mine construction the six copper mines selected based on the above methodology are listed in table 2 including a short description of key features and the applicable mine specific water related issues group a comprises the sample of mines without reported water issues whereas group b represents the sample of mines with reported water issues within the ten year observation period in group a neither highland valley copper aitik or lumwana reported any severe problem due to their water use minor incidents such as spills of diesel fuel did occur but these did not result in any significant environmental legal financial or reputational consequences in contrast grasberg nchanga and los pelambres all encountered serious problems due to their water use in grasberg a major issue is the severe environmental degradation with associated international reputational damage the mine encounters due to the riverine disposal of tailings 46 47 the environmental impacts also led to blacklisting of the operator freeport mcmoran in investment portfolios 48 in nchanga severe water pollution has led to a conflict with the local population that has been brought to court in the united kingdom where the operator is stock listed 49 50 a special case study is los pelambres for almost a decade the operation has experienced strong opposition against its el mauro tailings dam due to alleged water quantity and quality deterioration as well as concerns on dam integrity in case of a seismic event 51 52 in the end an ultimate court ruling and a multi stakeholder agreement resolved this conflict 53 54 however to this day there are divergent opinions reflected in publicly available information as to whether or not the concerns have been duly addressed 54 57 therefore for the purpose of the present case study two separate mine water risk profiles were developed in order to test the influence of these diverging perspectives on the computed final risk assessment results in general model case studies of individual mine water risks were developed by compiling and evaluating a dataset of publicly accessible information relevant data on mine operational parameters and water incidents were sourced from company reports official documents peer reviewed publications newspapers articles and reports from non governmental organizations languages considered comprise english spanish and german additionally in order to verify information related to four incidents sourced from english news and reports google translate was used to identify additional local news coverage in the cases of aitik swedish and grasberg indonesian this process served to assess the scale of local media coverage with regards to certain water issues without the need to actually obtain a precise translation of incident details while case study results are expected to be generally accurate two possible constraints should be noted 1 although data collection from public sources was as thorough as possible it cannot be excluded that some relevant information was missed this may be relevant in particular for the two mines operating in sweden and indonesia where reports in the respective local language may provide additional information however given the international prominence of these two mines it is not likely that critical problems would not have been reported in english at some point 2 publicly available information is not always unambiguous which may introduce a degree of evaluation subjectivity as further discussed in section 4 4 of this contribution some of the case studies indicate that this may be a significant challenge for applying certain water risk assessment methods these constraints may be considered as typical for the practical application of mining related water risk assessment methods by third parties therefore the case study results as presented in this contribution should be considered a means to an end to demonstrating the practical relevance of water risk assessments while noting that they are not meant to represent detailed site specific or sector wide evaluations of water risks 3 results 3 1 practical method applicability in order to represent a practical instrument for risk assessments by third parties such as investors or downstream supply chain stakeholders the work time consumption and evaluation expertise required for performing a water risk assessment for a given mining project are relevant factors as lower assessment times will require less working hours to be invested into the assessment this might help incentivizing their application moreover given the diverse range of expertise anticipated for potential third party users from the investment and downstream community it is advantageous for a method s applicability if it can be applied without an expert background in technical disciplines such as mining hydraulic or environmental engineering the method should rather rely on the smallest common denominator and build up on a general educational background with an understanding for potentially relevant data sources and the skills needed to locate and access information therein reflecting the differing levels of technical detail established by the three methods the time required for performing case studies of an individual mine varied considerably with two days on average and only thirteen indicators the or method requires the lowest assessment time input per case study in addition the or method does not include indicators on company management practices and policies therefore it is not necessary for the evaluator to study company documents in detail which is otherwise very time consuming in general the or method is straightforward to apply even without significant expertise in mining hydraulic or environmental engineering this is mainly due to three reasons first the risk indicators and level descriptors are precisely formulated and avoid sophisticated technical language second information is generally easily accessible either from public databases or from company reports and other documents the consideration of technical documents is not required third in cases where the required information is unavailable the method offers an alternative generic risk classification for some of its indicators the mtg method is thematically more extensive it requires the consideration of the mine s management engagement and disclosure practices table 1 this in addition to the definition of risk level descriptors leads to higher assessment time requirements of around five days per case study when applying the method the mtg method partly requires detailed information that is often only available in technical reports such as feasibility studies even in cases where benchmarking data are not very complex e g the size of a mixing zone in a water body locating the right information in these technical documents requires basic knowledge of technical language this is a potential challenge for method users with little mining expertise this aspect is even more pronounced if the benchmarking data for applying individual method indicators gets more technical e g aquifer permeability the wrf method indicators put a strong emphasis on past events management approaches and company policies and requires about eight days of work time input per case study benchmarking management based non technical indicators creates different challenges related to non standardized reporting language that does not directly match indicator language this challenge applies to both the wrf and the mtg methods thus subjective interpretations by the evaluator are required in order to assign risk levels to these indicators in addition although according to the method s developer the wwf the wrf method was also designed for investors and banks some indicators in the questionnaire are challenging to address without access to internal information of the mining company being assessed 35 3 2 mine water risk profiles generated through the case studies copper mine water risk profiles generated with the or and mtg methods do not show any systematic differentiation between case studies of groups a and b fig 3 b and c for the or method the los pelambres and highland valley copper mines are associated with the highest and lowest water risk profiles respectively a good correlation of lower risk profiles for group a case studies compared to group b mines can only be found for the or method indicator on natural disasters applying the mtg method ranks the nchanga and grasberg mines as having the highest and lowest risk profiles respectively a comparison of the influence of aggregation on computed risk assessment results fig 3c and d indicates that absolute risk scores are generally lower for the arithmetic mean approach but relative risks show little change in contrast applying the wrf method resulted in more differentiated risk profiles better in line with the expected outcome according to the mine distribution in groups a and b fig 3e regarding company risks nchanga has the overall highest and aitik the lowest risks with the second lowest risk identified for highland valley copper the high risk modeled for highland valley copper and the low risk for los pelambres in the company water scarcity category may be contrary to the anticipated general risk distribution this is caused by the highly weighted wrf indicator importance of having sufficient amounts of clean fresh water for the operation in combination with subjective company reporting on this issue antofagasta as the operator of los pelambres rates the importance as very low not important at all arguing that while water in general is vital for the mine operation good quality water is only needed for drinking purposes 58 in contrast teck resources as the operator of highland valley copper rates water importance as very high arguing that water of adequate quality is vital for operations 59 as such subjective mining company statements based on differing interpretation of indicator wording may introduce a bias when applying the assessment method the good correlations shown in the wrf company regulatory risks category with the low and high risks expected for group a and group b reflects that legal issues were used as selection criteria to identify mines with or without water related problems respectively fig 3f shows the impact of modeling different perspectives for the water dispute surrounding the los pelambres operation with regards to the wrf results the inner circle models risk profiles constructed based on the perspective of opponents to the mine operation the outer circle reflects the risk according to the mine operator s perspective notable differences between the two perspectives occur for regulatory and pollution risks similar differences do not occur when applying the or or mtg methods to the los pelambres case study the influence of data availability on final assessment results was tested using the highland valley copper case study as noted the wrf adapts its indicator weighting if indicators remain unanswered in fig 4 symbols indicate the original assessment results in the categories water scarcity and water pollution that are obtained with all indicators answered the influence of data availability was then tested by disregarding either one x axis or two y axis indicators and recalculating the category assessment results the error bars indicate the substantial change of up to 50 of the initial category risk and highlight the impact of data availability on risk profiles 4 discussion 4 1 application framework for water risk assessment methods in mining overall the evaluated methods use an indicator and level descriptor formulation that allow their application by users with a general educational background mostly avoiding the use of specified technical language all three water risk assessment methods may therefore be reasonably well applied by interested stakeholders like investors and downstream industries without requiring a specialized mining engineering or hydrological background this observation supports the methods applicability for a broader range of industries or commodities and delivers on investor demand to provide broadly applicable assessment standards 60 from among the investigated water risk assessment methods the or method stands out as being particularly suitable to be applied without having significant mining expertise as it is based on easily accessible factual information with precisely formulated indicators and level descriptors in addition the method s generic risk classification to be applied in case of missing indicator data is appropriate for most mining projects however this ease of use comes at the expense of method precision in terms of resolving individual risks as shown in section 4 3 below a general factor affecting the practical application of water risk assessments by third party stakeholders is the level of investigative detail and the associated research time requirement associated with a given method the higher number of indicators and information requirements on company polices and management practices necessitates higher assessment time input for the mtg and wrf methods with an average of five and eight working days per case study respectively as there are indications that consideration of supply chain sustainability and the associated customer demand is still inhomogeneous among investors it remains an open question whether investors would be motivated to invest this considerable time span 60 61 in the new wrf version 5 0 a rapid assessment option will be integrated which might help overcoming this issue 38 4 2 accuracy of predicted water risks applying the three methods as case studies to a range of copper mines provides insights with regards to the methods accuracy the or method identifies highland valley copper and los pelambres as the copper mines with the lowest and highest environmental hazard potential respectively thus users of the method would identify a project as the most risky one which indeed experienced water related problems 52 additionally the high risk ratings obtained from the group b mine case studies for the indicator on natural disasters accurately highlight an actual risk hot spot for the los pelambres mine an important topic in the long standing conflict is the integrity of the new el mauro tailings dam in case of an earthquake 52 in grasberg the most controversial issue is the riverine tailings disposal 46 which the operator justifies with the local environmental conditions including seismic events and heavy rainfalls 62 63 both the mtg and wrf methods identify nchanga as the mine case study with the highest water risks indeed the project is associated with a history of legal charges environmental degradation and negative reputation e g 49 50 64 however applying the mtg method would also lead its users to infer that the grasberg mine has overall low risks despite the serious water issues that the project has experienced e g 46 65 thus the method successfully identifies some but not all of the anticipated water risk hotspots in general from among the tested risk assessment tools the wrf was the only method that produced differentiated results in line with the expected mine risk distribution pattern the underlying reason for this might be the different thematic approach of the tool in dealing more extensively with company policies and management practices the method evaluates not only whether certain risks exist but how these risks are managed although two of the three investigated water assessment methods or wrf do successfully identify those projects as high risk that are indeed struggling with water issues and assigning lowest risks to projects that do not the quality and reproducibility of the evaluation results is constrained by several factors as shown below 4 3 resolution of risk assessment results the low degree of differentiation in the or and mtg method hampers the effective identification of risk categories to follow up on this is especially pronounced in the or method s geological and technical categories that are mostly rated as high risk however identifying these aspects of a mining operation as risk hotspots does not have direct implications as the geological aspects of a deposit are pre defined and to a certain degree determine the technology that can be used for mining and processing in order to assess the actual environmental hazard potential of the mine measures put in place by the company to manage these risks would need to be evaluated in parallel this is not possible with the or method despite the preferential interest of third party stakeholders in risk mitigation rather than just detecting the presence of risks 24 the optional generic risk rating of the or method can be excluded as an underlying reason for the method s low ability to provide differentiated water assessment results considering all indicators and case studies a generic risk was only assigned six times five times for the method indicator radioactivity for all other ratings company specific information was used instead a reason for the method s low ability to differentiate water risks at the mine level might be its broader scope aiming to assess the environmental hazard potential in general rather than focusing on individual water risks in addition as the method was designed to be a one size fits all solution applicable to different commodities it tends to generalize in order to accommodate the range of possible indicator manifestations into three level descriptors the combination of both factors contributes to the observed homogeneous water risk profiles obtained with the or method in fact these factors indicate that mines evaluated with the or method will always have similar water risk profiles for a given commodity regardless of their actual environmental performance as shown by frederiksen 66 simplifications and generalizations in assessments bear the risk to undermine real efforts to increase water related sustainability performance this is caused by motivating the assessed company to focus only on the well visible simplified issues considered in the respective risk assessment method instead of tackling the underlying more complex causes for water problems applying the mtg method creates similar challenges the method covers a broad range of thematic aspects and assesses risk management and mitigation however it falls short of evaluating these aspects with sufficient granularity and on the backdrop of the local conditions contributing to homogenous risk profiles for different mines in this case the similarity of the results is also influenced by the method s poorly defined aggregation procedure in fact the mtg method leaves it to the user to decide on how to work with the results if a red flag approach is taken this quickly leads to assigning a high risk category rating since already a single high risk indicator triggers a corresponding rating for the whole category on the other hand an arithmetic mean approach might result in the mutual leveling out of high and low risk indicators resulting in a high number of medium risk categories as such the method is not directly suitable to generate differentiated water risk profiles the problem of low resolution is less of an issue with the wrf method 4 4 subjectivity of risk assessment results the absence of guidance provided by the mtg method combined with the high number of undefined risk level descriptors electronic appendix table a3 introduces a high degree of evaluation subjectivity as most practitioners can be expected to approach these issues differently based on their personal subject expertise and experience for example the mtg method leaves it to the user to define what is considered as an aquifer of high permeability the method s evaluation subjectivity considerably lowers the reproducibility of the results and the assessment accuracy challenges of a practitioners subjectivity are also common to other evaluative framework in the mining industry for example environmental impact assessments eia are often an integral part of project permitting in many jurisdictions and a critical aspect for managing water related risks stakeholder consultations an important part of the eia process commonly expose a wide range of perspectives by different stakeholders and as such can never be entirely objective 67 rather as part of a larger eia process social impact assessments are often grounded on personal perception as well as concerns by different stakeholders groups expressed as descriptive indicators which makes them intrinsically subjective 68 69 quantitative methods are advantageous in this context however they are very resource intensive often requiring an extensive database and sophisticated modeling approach an expert judgment approach is therefore often seen as a more practical approach for identifying impacts and their probabilities to manifest as well as adequate mitigation measures 67 nevertheless especially when it comes to estimating the significance of identified impacts different practitioners will commonly arrive at different conclusions based on the contextual background of the operation their personal background and potential conflicts of interest introducing subjectivity into the process 70 71 the problem of subjectivity due to imprecise wording was also encountered in the wrf as shown in table a3 of the electronic appendix for example the difference between advanced contingency plans for all scenarios and high level contingency plans remains unclear aside from the fact that users would have to know all scenarios to evaluate a given question the interpretation of what is considered advanced versus high level might vary among users thus lowering comparability of results a similar point was risen by koch and hobbs 72 for the case of evaluating the success of restoring a former bauxite mining area comparing the influence of different indicator systems to evaluate restoration success and discussing how to deal with deficiencies in fulfilling reclamation goals the authors outline how experts from different disciplines might interpret deficiencies in their respective field of subject as being more serious implying different evaluation outcomes the strikingly low company reputational risk of los pelambres obtained through applying the wrf underlines this aspect the latter was the result of the subjective decision of the authors to rate the on going conflict over the past decade as one single dispute which would seem justified as it mainly centered around the same el mauro dam issue 52 however other practitioners might interpret the situation differently or rather consider the company view instead of its opponents leading to different risk profiles again the subjectivity of risk assessment results limits their reproducibility with its precise indicator definitions this problem is least pronounced for the or method 4 5 data availability one of the greatest obstacles for assessing company risks with the wrf method is currently the availability of data as shown in table 2 certain risk indicators cannot be adequately benchmarked due to lack of data the quality of reporting and availability of mining related data is commonly subject to a certain bias influenced by the size and public listing status of the mining company as well as to the enforcement of a mining regulatory framework in the country of operation 27 this observation is reflected in our dataset during the initial screening step for identifying the case studies a number of projects with small operators had to be excluded due to lack of data this restricts the scope of application of the method to cases with good data availability it should be noted that gaps in data coverage affect intra method weighting factors thus influencing final water risk assessment results there are two workarounds to overcome the challenge of insufficient data first input data from a longer time period can be considered for the present study both data from the past ten years and recent company information were taken into account as a result the case studies create integrated multi year risk profiles rather than reflecting the most recent situation second in addition to data sourced from the mine operator reporting by potential parent companies or other sources can be used as information source however this approach may create other forms of consistency challenges due to differences between reporting standards or the lack of proper local implementation of parental company policies as shown by ruokonena and temmes 73 this may even happen in mature mining jurisdictions or where large mining companies are involved 74 the nchanga mine in zambia is an example which is characterized by a huge discrepancy in data reported by the company e g 75 and information obtained from academia 76 government 77 and non governmental organizations 78 these limitations on accessible data quality and quantity directly affect the reliability of computed water assessment results especially for the wrf and mtg methods where company data is the primary source of information this problem is less pronounced with the or approach as most data required for that method are simple straightforward facts or sourced from open source databases making the method mostly independent from company reporting 4 6 implications and recommendations the reliance of some indicators on operational data renders the investigated methods most suitable to be applied while the mine is active with an earlier application possible for or when evaluating clients and business partners the high level data scope of water risk assessment methods might be a valuable resource to be used before more detailed site specific data as for example presented in eias are taken into account as argued by kunz 79 it may be beneficial to employ a top down approach in water risk evaluation using a generic assessment framework as a first step this may help identifying priority areas to follow up on in a later more comprehensive evaluation otherwise direct consideration of a large number of details can be paralyzing for interested third party stakeholders such as investors especially if they are not familiar with the subject matter in detail in this fashion water risk assessment methods may act as a door opener allowing to start a conversation on safeguarding water resources in this regard the ease of use and broad applicability makes all three water risk assessment methods reviewed oekoress mine the gap and the water risk filter potentially suitable for application by investors or downstream industries at the same time their potential to guide subsequent more detailed investigations is currently limited by a range of factors that preclude the delivery of site specific results of sufficient accuracy risk ratings are particularly prone to being skewed by deliberately optimistic or fragmented company reporting as such third party method users should have a clear understanding of the data sources used for applying a given risk assessment method sourcing data from public instead of or in addition to company reports might help alleviating this potential issue some companies may have procedures for third party verification of their own reporting in place which may also help ensuring a balanced reporting if a third party user employs a risk assessment method to evaluate several mines it is recommended to precisely define all risk level descriptors prior to the assessment in order to reduce subjectivity and facilitate comparability of results method developers can contribute to lowering subjectivity and make their methods more amenable for third party use by striving for a precise and clear assessment language that is aligned with the reporting language used for sourcing information such as company sustainability reports in addition as exemplified by the or method it is beneficial to preferentially rely on factual information that leaves little room for interpretation and that is less prone to being influenced by possibly agenda driven company reporting in addition it is of crucial importance that assessment methods consider risk management and risk mitigation in addition to risk identification as exemplified by the wrf method a mine operating in a high risk environment may have good water management and risk mitigation measures in place whereas a badly managed mine operating in a lower risk environment may still show negative environmental performance combining the individual strengths of the analyzed methods might help to increase the overall value reliability and accuracy of risk assessment results in this regard using the methodological advantages provided by the wrf approach while expanding its scope to a mining specific version of the tool as available for the or and mtg methods would allow better consideration of the special characteristics of mining operations while harnessing the benefits of assessing risks plus their mitigation at the same time to this end the wrf questionnaire could be tailored to the special characteristics and factors influencing water related risks at mine sites to include key sustainability aspects such as mine waste management an additional benefit would arise if the method also allowed an assessment of water related aspects such as mine waste management on the backdrop contextual factors relevant to this aspect including climate and topography both of which could be covered in the wrf method s basin risk category finally relying on an unambiguous formulation of indicators in the mining specific questionnaire as done for the or method would help increasing reproducibility and comparability of risk assessment results considering the growing trend of data disclosure by mining companies 80 there is also potential that the current constraints for applying the wrf due to limitations in data availability will be less significant in the future a method considering these recommendations could act as an entry point to water stewardship efforts for non mining experts and at the same time yield the necessary predictive accuracy and reliability to efficiently prioritize aspects to follow up on in dialogue with the assessed company the recommendations provided in this study are of a general nature and would be expected to apply to other commodity sectors in a similar fashion however owing to the size and structure of the copper sector data availability for copper mines may be expected to be overall higher compared to smaller more specialized commodity sectors therefore future research focusing on other commodities might expose more pronounced constraints on risk assessment results for such commodities 5 conclusions due to its water intensive nature mining is associated with high risks to negatively impact on water resources unless adequate management procedures are put in place in the wake of increasing societal and business demands for responsible sourcing and sustainable investment negative water related impacts in mine operations may trigger reputational and business risks for external stakeholders in downstream industries or in the financial sector this may motivate these third party stakeholders to improve their understanding of the water risks of mining operations associated with their supply chain or investment portfolio focusing on copper mining as a major global commodity sector with good data availability this study explores the use of publicly available water risk assessment methods to guide the evaluation of water risks by third parties the following conclusions may be drawn in this regard two out of three investigated water risk assessment methods succeeded in identifying mines that experience water related problems as higher risk projects compared to projects that do not struggle with prominent water issues combined with the methods relative ease of application this indicates the general suitability of water risk assessment methods to help initiating a conversation on water related sustainability in mining however all of the three investigated methods show consistency challenges with regards to mine site specific integrated water risk profiles these challenges relate to variable degrees of generalizations evaluation subjectivity as well as constraints in accessible data quality and quantity therefore third parties using these methods should be cautious to not over interpret assessment results as the representation of side specific risk influencing factors is limited recommendations for method improvement refer to combining the specific advantages of the individual methods by using a precise assessment language together with a mining sector specific approach that allows the simultaneous consideration of risks and mitigation measures at sufficient granularity this may unlock more value of these methods by enabling them to return a higher degree of accuracy and reliability that would be required to effectively guide subsequent more detailed risk investigations at the mine site in supporting third parties such as downstream industries and investors to introduce and monitor sustainability principles in their supply chains and investment portfolios water risk assessment methods can provide a competitive advantage for mining companies with a strong sustainability agenda and act as an incentive for change at other operations in this regard an increasing uptake in water risk assessment in the mining sector may contribute to achieving the united nations sustainable development agenda author contribution lucas gilsbach

8817,cadmium tungstate cdwo4 is well known semiconducting material which exhibit good photocatalytic properties but its preparation is usually carried out at very high temperature hardly any report is available for its preparation through green route and its application for water treatment therefore the functionalized cadmium tungstate f cdwo4 nanoparticles synthesis through green environmentally benign route using brassica rapa leave extract and sodium tungstate and cadmium iodide was objective of the present work the formation of f cdwo4 was confirmed from ft ir xrd and tem sem and uv visible spectroscopic techniques the average size of the particles was 54 nm as calculated from the xrd analysis 37 23 nm radius was determined from uv visible spectrum whereas average 27 nm breadth and 120 nm length was found from tem imaging showing rod shaped f cdwo4 nanoparticles the f cdwo4 was used for removal of toxic bismarck brown r dye from aqueous solution through adsorption and photocatalytic degradation under sun light irradiation the coloured water containing 10 mgl 1 concentration of dye could be cleaned with 1 5 gl 1 dose of f cdwo4 at optimum condition the adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 for bismarck brown r was found to be 46 5 49 50 and 51 54 mgg 1 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the endothermic adsorption of bismarck brown r followed pseudo second order kinetics the interaction between f cdwo4 and bismarck brown r on molecular level was investigated from ft ir studies clubbed with isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics the f cdwo4 also showed good photocatalytic degradation activity and degraded 82 70 of bismarck brown r in 50 ml solution having 20 mgl 1 dye concentration with 1 5 gl 1 dosage of f cdwo4 therefore f cdwo4 prepared through green route would be efficient for water treatment through both photocatalytic and adsorption activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment bismarck brown f cdwo4 green synthesis adsorption 1 introduction huge quantity of synthetic organic dyes is released by textile industries into rivers and other water resources which ultimately pollute water that prevent the sunlight penetration into the water increases oxidative stress ultimately degrade the water quality 1 4 most of the synthetic dyes contain complex structure having azo groups show severe toxicity when inhaled via drinking dye contaminated water which ultimately causes cancers of various parts of the human body 5 9 disazo dyes having two azo groups like bismarck brown r bbr is highly toxic and carcinogenic the other effects of dyes in water include reduction of oxygen levels retards penetration of sunlight into water which retards the growth of aquatic biota because of reduction in photosynthesis activity therefore their use is banned in many countries and strict regulation has been adopted but is still in use in many countries and being discharged into water bodies 10 12 therefore the remediation of these dyes is very necessary and concerned subject to make water free from these dyes before discharge into water sources like river and ponds there are various methods which are applicable for water treatment among them adsorption has become preferable and is effective at both low and high concentration of dyes the process can be more effective if solid material being used is of low cost and have higher adsorption capacity however only few effective adsorbents are available for disazo dyes because of problematic complex structure 13 14 adsorption the most simple water treatment technology depends on the structural properties of adsorbents that involve surface area shape and size 15 20 the use of nanosized adsorbents is an advance idea in water treatment technology and various types of nanomaterials have been prepared and used however there are several dyes which have large complex structures and therefore not completely removed from water through adsorption such dyes molecules can be degraded photocatalytically using a semiconducting material the degradation of dye molecule leads to less toxic fragments and photocatalytic activity of a particular material depends on its external and internal properties external properties include surface area and morphology while the intrinsic ones are type of crystal and electronic structure the crystal and electronic structure affects the band gap of the photocatalyst and thus responds to the photocatalytic activity 21 for the photocatalytic activity the energy of incident light must be equal or exceed that of the band gap of the photocatalyst during photocatalysis superoxide anions o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh together called ros are generated which causes degradation of dye molecules 22 various advanced nanomaterials like xanthangum titaniumdioxide tio2 nanocomposite 23 polyetherimide membrane with grafted bentonite clay 24 cerium dioxide and its composites 25 polyphenyl sulfone ppsu nanotinoxide sno2 mixed hollow fibre membrane 26 and starch cl poly lactic acid g acrylamide nanohydrogel 27 have been reported as a promising candidate for wastewater treatment as earlier reported nanomaterials like lafeo3 g c3n4 composite 28 wo3 cnt mose2 composites 29 eu tio2 graphene 30 eu wo3 system 31 c wo3 nanostructures 32 carbon nanodots and la gd er doped tungsten oxide nanostructures 33 and graphene wo3 nanostructures 34 have been investigated have shown enhanced photocatalytic activity for various organic compounds cdwo4 is a compound which exhibits good photo catalytic activity due to its physicochemical properties that includes layered structure and self trapped excitons also the band gap of cdwo4 is 3 8 ev and broader band gap provide large redox ability and therefore is good photocatalyst doping heterostructure morphology surface plasmon resonance and substitution may enhance the photo catalytic activity of cdwo4 by reducing the band gap cdwo4 has already generated a great interest in various potential applications such as in photoluminescence optical fibres and humidity sensing medical science scintillations photocatalysis due to their optical magnetic and electronic properties 35 37 numerous methods have been adopted for the synthesis of various forms of cdwo4 which include high temperature solid state reaction for powder form a flux method for whisker growth the czochralski method for single crystal growth pulsed laser ablation and hydrothermal method for nanoparticles 38 42 however all these methods are either expensive or environmentally hazardous and produce huge toxic wastes currently scientists all over the world are engaged in the green synthesis of nanomaterials for water treatment green synthesis involves the use of natural resources like plant leaves flowers fruits that are inexpensive and abundant in nature these natural materials are source of phytochemicals which can act as reducing capping and stabilizing agents moreover in such synthesis water is used as solvent involves low cost shorter time large scale nanomaterial production is possible do not require high energy and thus environmentally hazardous and huge toxic waste production can be stopped various types of materials have been synthesized through environmentally benign routes however hardly any report is available on the synthesis of cdwo4 for water treatment for enhancing adsorption capability the surface of cdwo4 nanoparticles can be functionalized by attaching various phytochemical compounds the synthesis and functionalization of nanomaterials through green rout can reduce the production cost and do not produce toxic waste we herein are reporting synthesis of functionalized cdwo4 nanorods f cdwo4 through eco friendly green method by involving brassica rapa leave extract and the synthesized f cdwo4 nanorods were applied for the photocatalytic degradation and adsorptive removal of a model dye bbr molecules from water the choice of f cdwo4 was based on idea that it has high photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of complex dyes like bbr the adsorption procedure was optimized to check the influence of cdwo4 nanorods dosage ph of dye solution concentration of bbr in solution contact time and water temperature the obtained experimental data was applied to various isotherm and kinetic models the parameters obtained from isotherms and kinetic models were used to propose the mechanism of the adsorption the thermodynamic parameters of the process were also studied to fix the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process the knowledge of all these parameters may be helpful in designing water treatment plant based on adsorbent having photocatalytic activity that can clean water by both adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of toxic organic dyes for complete removal from water 2 experimental 2 1 material and methods precursor chemicals sodium tungstate dihydrate and cadmium iodide used for the preparation of cdwo4 were purchased from merck ltd germany naoh and hcl used to control the ph of reaction mixture during adsorption studies were procured from loba india bismarck brown r dye mw 461 39 gmol 1 λ max 468 nm was procured from sigma aldrich india all these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as such without any purification brassica rapa leaves were collected from the local garden nearby jamia millia islamia new delhi india 2 2 synthesis of f cdwo4 freshly collected green brassica rapa leaves were washed with deionized water several times to remove any sticking dust leachable impurities then grounded to a thick paste by grinding in mortar pestle 10 g of this paste was poured into 100 ml distilled water in 250 ml beaker heated on water bath at 50 c for 2 h and then the resulting extract was filtered using whatman paper to prepare and f cdwo4 60 ml of the extract was added to a solution mixture of 300 ml of 0 2 m sodium tungstate solution to which 100 ml of 0 2 m cadmium iodide solution was added slowly under continues stirring condition the reaction occurred between sodium tungstate and cadmium iodide leading to the formation of cdwo4 and nai the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min dried at 60 c for 8 h and then calcined at 200 c in muffle furnace which was heated at a ramp rate of 30 c 2min rate for 2 h the reports are available in literature which shows that brassica rapa leave contains health friendly flavonoids and non flavonoids that can act as capping agent and react with surface to functionalize the cdwo4 nanoparticles to form f cdwo4 the formation of white precipitate is shown schematically in scheme 1 the calcined material was subjected to characterization for confirming the formation morphology and surface characteristics of f cdwo4 nanoparticles 43 the expected chemical reaction of synthesis of f cdwo4 nanoparticles may be na2wo4 cdi2 plant extract nucleation growth and functionalization of cdwo4 2nai 2 3 instrumentation various techniques including uv vis absorption spectroscopy uv visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edax and transmission electron microscopy tem were used for the characterization of the f cdwo4 nanoparticles the size of the prepared nanoparticles was measured from uv visible absorption spectrum and tem imaging the uv visible absorption spectrum and the band gap of the prepared f cdwo4 nanoparticles was investigated from uv vis spectrophotometer with specifications u 3900 spectrophotometer india and lambda 950 uv vis nir spectrophotometer perkinelmer in the range of 200 800 nm the crystal size and the structural properties of the prepared nanorods were estimated from the powder xrd pattern recorded on a pan analytical expert diffractometer using cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm a cu filter operating at 40 kv generator voltage and 30 ma current and a proportional counter detector the surface morphology of the prepared f cdwo4 was investigated using sem instrument fesem nova nano sem 450 fe1 equipped with edax bruker 127 ev the edax spectrum was analyzed to investigate the elemental composition of f cdwo4 nanorods the size and structure of the f cdwo4 were analyzed using high resolution transmission electron microscope using tem of tecnai t 30 300 kv fegtem operated at 80 kv 2 4 ph point of zero charge phzpc phzpc is a ph value at which a solid submerged in an aqueous medium exhibits zero electrical charge on the surface this charge on the solid surface can be achieved by protonation and deprotonation of the groups on solid surface protonation involves the acceptance of h to give positive charge to the surface at lower ph whereas deprotonation involves dissociation of h ions from the groups at surface to impart negative charge at higher ph the phzpc of f cdwo4 nanoparticles was measured at 27 c by taking 200 mg of cdwo4 in 20 ml of 0 1 m kno3 electrolyte solution in series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flask and the initial ph of these flasks was adjusted in the range 2 10 using 0 1 m hcl naoh solutions afterwards all the flasks were shacken at 160 rpm for 5 h afterwards the final ph was measured and the point of zero charge was determined from the plot between the two phs 8 2 5 determination of adsorption capacity and removal rate bbr adsorption experiments were carried out in batch mode by agitating series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml of bbr solution of certain concentration and fixed amount of f cdwo4 nanoparticles at 30 40 and 50 c ph 2 12 and time 15 120 min the initial concentration c o of bbr solution and the final concentration c e of remained bbr solution after adsorption supernatant in the erlenmeyer flasks were estimated by analyzing their absorbance using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer at 468 nm the initial concentrations of bbr solution and the concentration of supernatant were used to determine the uptake capacity of the f cdwo4 using following equations 8 the uptake of bbr 1 q e c o c e v m where v l is the volume of bbr solution and m g is the amount of f cdwo4 another important indication is percentage of adsorption which was calculated using following relationship 2 the percentage removal c o c e c o 100 the adsorption experiments were carried out in duplicate and the mean values of c e and q e were applied for optimization of bbr adsorption parameters of f cdwo4 in terms of amount of f cdwo4 concentration of bbr ph time and temperature the obtained experimental data was investigated by fitting in various isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic relationships 2 6 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of f cdwo4 nanoparticles was examined by adding 1 5 gl 1 f cdwo4 in 50 ml of bbr solution having 20 mgl 1 concentration of bbr dye under the sunlight irradiation for 15 75 min after the irradiation under sunlight the dye samples were collected at regular interval of 15 min centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed for bbr concentration in the solution using uv vis spectrometer the uv vis absorption spectra were also recorded at regular interval of 15 min for showing the photocatalytic efficiency of f cdwo4 fig 10a which was calculated using the formula 3 d e g r a d a t i o n c o c t c o 100 where c o is the initial concentration of bbr which reached the absorbency balance and c t is the concentration of bbr at irradiation time t 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the diffused reflectance spectrum of the prepared powdered f cdwo4 was recorded for determining the band gap energy fig 1 a the parabolic approximation between the absorption coefficient and band gap energy was used to determine the band gap energy of f cdwo4 using given expression 4a α h ν h ν e g a where eg α and hν are band gap energy absorption coefficient of f cdwo4 nanorods and energy of photon used a is a constant whose value for allowed eg direct transition is 0 5 and that for allowed eg indirect transition is 2 0 respectively the plot fig 1 b between αhv and hv known as tauc plot was used to find the band gap energy of f cdwo4 44 the formation of f cdwo4 nanoparticles were confirmed spectrophotometrically by analysing uv vis spectrum in the wavelength range of 250 550 nm the uv vis spectrum indicated the broad absorption peaks around 265 nm fig 2 which was used to calculate the average size of the prepared nanoparticles by substituting absorption peak value in the following relationship 45 4b r n m 0 2963 40 1970 13620 λ 7 34 2418 6 λ where λ is absorption peak wavelength in nm and r nm is radius of the nanoparticle the radius of the f cdwo4 nanoparticles came out to be 37 23 nm the ft ir spectrum of the f cdwo4 nanoparticles fig 3 showed a broad peak around 3390 cm 1 which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of o h bond of surface adsorbed water on the sample 8 the two peaks appeared around 2968 and 2820 cm 1 were for the stretching vibration of c h of ch3 and ch2 respectively the co stretching frequencies appeared near to 1747 cm 1 and wavenumber 1620 cm 1 appeared for oh bending frequency because of these groups attached to the cdwo4 nanoparticle surface that might have come from the plant extract 8 46 47 the appearance of bands from 950 to 500 cm 1 might be attributed to the intrinsic vibrations for apparently different w o stretching vibrations in f cdwo4 nanoparticles 48 49 these observed wave numbers confirmed the synthesis and functionalization of f cdwo4 nanoparticles using brassica rapa leave extract the phytochemicals present in leave contents act as stabilizing agent functionalization groups scheme i and caused higher adsorption efficiency for bismarck brown r the xrd diffraction profile of the sample fig 4 gave the peaks at 23 21 29 12 29 78 31 18 35 28 40 12 43 44 47 57 51 03 52 62 59 87 60 79 63 36 63 57 and 67 17⁰ 2θ which corresponded to the 101 111 111 002 020 112 121 022 103 212 131 311 123 213 and 014 plane respectively 50 51 the diffraction profile suggested a tetragonal crystalline structure of f cdwo4 jcpds 80 0138 and also an unknown phase an identification of the unknown phase using crystallographic open data base cod indicated that it belongs to the monoclinic phase space group p12 c1 a 5 0289 å b 5 8596 å c 5 0715 å β 91 519 it is known that the tetragonal phase is stable at room temperature while monoclinic phase appeared at higher temperature when cdwo4 nanoparticles was calcined at 200 c however when the sample was cooled down to the room temperature tetragonal structure again retained the tetragonal phase was also stable in air 52 all the diffraction peaks are sharp indicating a highly crystalline structure the monoclinic wolframite type structure contain six o atoms surrounding w atom while in tetragonal scheelite type w atom is surrounded by four o atoms 21 53 the morphology of the prepared f cdwo4 nanoparticles was studied from the sem image fig 5 a which indicated irregular structures of various sizes the average crystallite size of f cdwo4 was also calculated via xrd analysis using debye scherrer s equation 54 5 d k λ β c o s θ where λ is wave length of x ray radiation λ 0 154 nm β is full width at half maxima fwhm and θ is bragg s angle the average particle size was calculated to be 54 nm which was further confirmed from tem the f cdwo4 nanorods appeared in different shapes and the average width of the nanoparticles ranged from 26 to 32 nm and length around 120 nm was obtained from the tem image fig 6 rod shaped morphology of cdwo4 is because of the crystal growth in the direction 100 while rods get assembled and attached with each other to the direction 001 55 the edx equipped with the sem instrument was used to measure the chemical composition of f cdwo4 which gave 20 84 cd 45 32 w and 33 86 o in weight percentage fig 5b thus these results confirmed the preparation of f cdwo4 using brassica rapa leave extract 3 2 phzpc of f cdwo4 the phzpc of f cdwo4 was found to be 6 9 as determined through the salt addition method fig s1 the phzpc value of 6 9 indicated that the f cdwo4 surface did not have charge at nearly neutral ph and above and below this ph point the f cdwo4 surface get charged accordingly the phzpc of the f cdwo4 well explained the trend of adsorption of charged molecules on the ph change as discussed later herein below 3 3 batch adsorption experiments first the effect of amount of f cdwo4 on its uptake capacity for bbr was studied by varying amount of f cdwo4 between 0 3 and 1 6 gl 1 fig s2 the batch mode adsorption experiments were performed with a series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml solution of 10 mgl 1 initial concentration of bbr at room temperature neutral ph and the reaction time of 90 min the percent uptake trends indicated the rapid increase in adsorption of bbr onto f cdwo4 up to 89 7 with increase in f cdwo4 amount in brief the trend of bbr interaction onto the f cdwo4 surface indicated that 0 3 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 could remove about 19 of bbr and reached to maximum of about 90 with 1 6 gl 1 of f cdwo4 and then attained equilibrium fig s2 it is to be noted that small dosage of f cdwo4 could remove higher percentage of bbr the higher uptake capacity of f cdwo4 for bbr might be due to the dense functional sites available on the f cdwo4 8 the influence of others parameters were ascertained with 1 5 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 at which adsorption reached to the equilibrium to obtain the optimum time period for the adsorption process the experiment was performed with 1 5 gl 1 f cdwo4 and 10 mgl 1 concentration of bbr for 15 90 min fig s3 the process was followed after every 15 min time intervals and the obtained results indicated that approximately 80 of bbr could be removed within 15 min the adsorption was fast at initial time period which rapidly reduced bbr concentration and as time passed the rate of removal decreased and the maximum 88 removal could be observed after 90 min the much faster rate in adsorption at starting stage might be due to initially available large numbers of sites at f cdwo4 surface and after a certain period of time partially filled and available active sites decreased and the filling of available sites created complication for upcoming bbr molecules and needed specific way to acquire the limited available sites 56 the effect of change of concentration of bbr on the uptake efficiency of f cdwo4 was also examined by varying its concentration from 10 to 60 mgl 1 at optimum conditions fig s4 the lower concentration of bbr responded to higher adsorption percentage which might be due to availability of active sites at f cdwo4 surface for bbr molecules however with increased concentration of bbr the adsorption percentage gradually decreased and the amount adsorbed per gram of f cdwo4 increased and reached equilibrium after certain level of initial concentration i e 40 mgl 1 this might be due to the filling of all sites available at the f cdwo4 45 however results of investigation showed that f cdwo4 sufficiently removed 87 bbr molecules from 10 mgl 1 to 74 from 60 mgl 1 concentrations the ph of the bbr solution also played an important role in controlling the adsorption behaviour of f cdwo4 the change in ph of bbr solution from 2 to 12 under the other optimum conditions caused decrease in percentage adsorption from 97 43 to 86 32 fig 7 this might be due to the fact that the surface properties of dispersed f cdwo4 nanorods changed with the change in ph of the bbr solution 8 the protonation and deprotonation of the functional groups changed the surface behaviour and thus controlled the overall adsorption process this can be easily understood from phzpc of f cdwo4 at ph below 6 9 the surface of f cdwo4 was positively charged due to the protonation of oxygenous function groups thus largely attracted the anionic bismarck brown r molecules towards its surface and decreased gradually with the increase in ph at ph above the phzpc the surface of f cdwo4 become negatively charged due to deprotonation of oxygenous functional groups which led to the dramatic decrease in adsorption efficiency of f cdwo4 due to the anionic bbr and anionic surface repulsion 54 3 4 adsorption isotherm isotherm studies using four different isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were carried out to get information related to the maximum adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 for bbr affinity of bbr towards f cdwo4 from aqueous solution the interaction behaviour and surface properties of f cdwo4 at three temperatures 30 40 and 50 c langmuir isotherm expressed in the linearized mathematical equation below is applicable for homogeneous solid surface where all the available active sites are energetically equivalent and on which adsorbate chemically form the monolayer 56 6 c e q e c e q o 1 q o b where q e mgg 1 is adsorption capacity at equilibrium q o mgg 1 is monolayer maximum adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 and b is a langmuir constant which is useful to measure the binding energy between bbr and f cdwo4 the q o and b values were determined in the temperature range of 30 50 c from the slope and intercept of langmuir plot c e q e versus c e fig 8 a respectively the value of q o came out in the range 46 51 51 54 mgg 1 table 1 which is higher than the other reported adsorbents and indicated the slightly endothermic process the b value was found in the range 0 089 0 053 lg 1 and being highest at 30 c indicated the best bbr binding to f cdwo4 at 30 c temperature the dimensionless constant called separation factor rl describes the feasibility of the adsorption process was also determined using the equation as follows 57 60 7 r l 1 1 b c e the obtained rl value was 0 rl 1 from 0 052 to 0 065 indicated the feasibility of the adsorption process at all the temperature the freundlich model is applicable to those heterogeneous solid surface system at which each available sites has a specific bond energy and adsorbate physically form multilayer the isotherm is expressed in the linearized mathematical form as given below 60 61 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf mgg 1 lmg 1 1 n and n are freundlich constants and represent the quantity of adsorbed adsorbate onto the heterogeneous surface and measure the heterogeneity of the surface whose value should lies in range 1 10 respectively the freundlich plot of logq e versus logc e fig 8 b gave the values of kf in the range 4 91 3 44 mgg 1 lmg 1 1 n and n from 1 58 to 1 43 in temperature range 30 50 c and are listed in table 1 the value of the regression coefficients r2 obtained for the freundlich model was close to unity 0 99 and better than langmuir 0 86 0 89 the nearly unity value of r2 indicated the best fit of freundlich model to the experimental data obtained for this study suggesting non homogeneous nature of f cdwo4 surface the affinity of bbr with f cdwo4 and adsorption probability of bbr to heterogeneous solid surface of f cdwo4 was also determined using temkin relationship as given below 49 9 q e r t b t ln a t r t b t ln c e where a t and b t are coefficients related to the binding energy and heat of adsorption respectively these coefficients were obtained from the slope and intercept of q e versus lnc e plots at three temperatures fig s5 the temkin plot gave the a t value which increased slightly from 0 147 to 0 158 lg 1 indicating slightly higher binding energy at higher temperature the b t value increased from 0 175 to 0 201 kjmol 1 table 1 which suggested slightly higher heat of adsorption i e higher bonding probability of bbr onto f cdwo4 at 50 c temperature the positive value of b t suggested the slightly endothermic process which was further confirmed from the thermodynamic parameter values dubinin radushkevich isotherm is another one that can be used to find the nature of adsorption the linear form of dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm given below was also used to determine the nature of bonding between bbr and f cdwo4 the maximum d r adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 and the free energy change ed r of interaction between bbr and f cdwo4 at three tested temperature 61 10 ln q e ln q d r β ε 2 where β mol2kj 2 is a constant related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of bbr and q d r mgg 1 is theoretical adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 the ε is a polanyi potential which was calculated by using following expression 60 11 ε r t ln 1 1 c e the β value calculated from the above equation gave the value of free energy change ed r by substituting in the following relationship 12 e d r 2 β 0 5 the β value ranged from 0 660 to 1 223 mol2kj 2 and q d r ranged from 21 03 to 19 85 mgg 1 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot between lnqe versus ε 2 fig s6 respectively and are listed in table 1 the calculated free energy change e d r ranged from 0 869 to 0 639 kjmol 1 and is less than 8 0 kjmol 1 which suggested physical interaction between bbr and f cdwo4 3 5 thermodynamics of bbr adsorption thermodynamic parameters are important to examine the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process and were calculated at 30 40 and 50 c the gibbs free energy change δg was estimated from the following relationship 57 13 δ g o r t ln b where b called langmuir constant was calculated from the langmuir plot and was used to calculate the value of δg which was found to be negative 6 029 6 817 and 7 755 kjmol 1 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the δg in between 0 to 20 confirmed that the sorption of bbr onto the f cdwo4 is thermodynamically favourable and spontaneous and physical process at the tested temperature range the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot δ g o r t versus 1 t fig s7 respectively 54 14 δ g o δ h o t δ s o 15 δ g o r t δ s o r δ h o r t the obtained positive value of δh 22 697 kjmol 1 and δs 0 096 kjmol 1k 1 suggested the endothermic nature of the process associated with good affinity of bbr to f cdwo4 this result was also confirmed from the observation made from temperature effect on the adsorption experiment carried out with the concentration of bbr in the range 10 60 mgl 1 and 1 5 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 at 30 40 and 50 c the adsorption of bbr decreased with increase in temperature which was due to escaping of the adsorbed bbr ions on getting higher temperature or energy indicating physical nature of the adsorption 3 6 adsorption kinetics the knowledge of various kinetic parameters is important tool for designing a water treatment system on practical level moreover these kinetic parameters determine rate and mechanism of the adsorption process these parameters can also decide physical or chemical nature of the process which depends on physiochemical properties of adsorbate as well as adsorbent 61 the rate of reaction also helps to devise mechanism of the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent on molecular level the kinetics for the present study was investigated by interpreting the adsorption data for bbr removal at 15 min time interval 15 90 min using the optimum amount of f cdwo4 1 5 gl 1 for 10 mgl 1 concentration using various well known kinetic relationships namely pseudo first order pfo fig 9 a pseudo second order pso fig 9 b and elovich fig 9 c given below respectively 8 16 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 17 t q t 1 h t q e where h k 2 q e 2 18 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where q t mgg 1 is the adsorption capacity of solid at the time t k 1 min 1 and k 2 gmg 1min 1 are the rate constants for pfo and pso respectively α and β are the coefficients of adsorption and desorption respectively according to the pfo model adsorption rate fluctuates with the vacant sites on the adsorbent surface and the plot of log q e q t versus t gives the pfo kinetic parameters pso model gives the information about the chemical interaction of adsorbate to the solid surface which is the rate limiting step for pso model 54 the plot of t q t versus t gives the pso kinetic quantities elovich model gives information for the heterogeneous adsorbent on which no lateral interaction takes place 61 the fitting of experimental adsorption data to the models was evaluated by comparing the coefficients of determination r2 and other parameters of these models the results are listed in table 2 and the linear plot of pso between t qt versus t fig 9b gave the best fit to the experimental adsorption data in respect to higher r2 and lower difference between the theoretical adsorption capacities and the obtained capacity from the experiment therefore the experimental data fitting showed that the process followed pso kinetic model the value of α 2 958 105 mgg 1min 1 came out to be much higher than β 3 137 gmg 1 which suggested the higher rate of adsorption than desorption at equilibrium table 2 3 7 mechanistic model the physical sorption of bbr molecules from aqueous solution to f cdwo4 nanoparticles surface might either be governed by the film diffusion or intra particle diffusion therefore for confirming the mechanism of the present adsorption process the obtained experimental kinetic data was also applied to the intra particle diffusion and the liquid film diffusion models which are expressed by the following mathematical equations respectively 8 19 q t k i p d t 0 5 c 20 ln 1 f k f d t where k ipd is the intra particle diffusion rate constant k fd is the film diffusion rate constant and f q t q e is the fractional attainment of equilibrium the slope of the linear plot of intra particle diffusion model between q t versus t 0 5 fig 9 d gave the k ipd 0 104 mgg 1 min 0 5 and the intercept value of 4 869 mgg 1 with regression coefficient of 0 98 table 2 the film diffusion linear plot between ln 1 f and t fig s8 gave the k fd 0 155 mgg 1min 1 and the intercept value of 2 656 with regression coefficient of 0 52 table 2 these results indicated that bbr adsorption onto the f cdwo4 was governed by the intraparticle diffusion of bbr molecules into interior of the f cdwo4 surface 54 3 8 ft ir analysis of bbr adsorption onto the f cdwo4 the interaction between f cdwo4 nanorods and bbr can simply be explained from the comparative study of ft ir spectrum of bbr loaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 10 and unloaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 3 the ft ir spectrum of bbr loaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 10 has shown shifting in the peaks obtained for those of unloaded f cdwo4 nanorods the broad spectrum peak contributed to the stretching vibrations of o h bond at 3390 cm 1 has shifted to 3375 cm 1 and the bending frequency at 1620 cm 1 has shifted to 1590 cm 1 whereas the peak around 1747 cm 1 for co group disappeared the appearance of bands in the range 500 950 cm 1 is for the intrinsic vibrations of w o in cdwo4 56 however no significant change was observed for the peaks appeared around 2968 and 2820 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of c h of ch3 and ch2 respectively these shifts disappearance and disturbing in the peaks of unloaded f cdwo4 on bbr loaded f cdwo4 might be due to the weak hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between bbr molecules and f cdwo4 nanorods 8 therefore the higher adsorption efficiency for bbr onto cdwo4 was due to the functionalization of cdwo4 3 9 photocatalytic degradation of bbr dye the photocatalytic degradation of bbr dye molecule using f cdwo4 nanorods was also investigated in terms of time intervals under bright sunlight irradiation the absorption spectrum recorded for photocatalytic activity of f cdwo4 for different time intervals showed a decrease in the intensity of the decomposition curves with the increase in illumination time fig 11 a the decrease in the intensity of the curves indicated the ability of f cdwo4 for degrading the bbr the quantitative analysis has suggested that more than 80 of bbr in the dye solution could be degraded within 75 min of sunlight irradiation fig 11 b this might be the result of photo generation of charge carriers or reactive oxygen species ros during the process which degrade the bbr and led to the formation of co2 and h2o 62 the whole mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of bbr using f cdwo4 can be understood by reaction scheme fig 12 briefly the f cdwo4 is n type semiconductor having band indirect gap energy of 4 0 ev determined from tauc s plot fig 1b and when sunlight fallen on it having energy exceeding its band gap then the electrons from the valence band goes to the conduction band leaving holes in valence band the electrons and holes move towards the surface of f cdwo4 nanorods and electrons combined with adsorbed oxygen to form superoxide anions o2 and the holes react with oh to form hydroxyl radicals oh comes from surface water these ros will react with the dye molecules and responsible for its degradation 22 the reaction mechanism involved in dye degradation is given below 13 14 cdwo4 light radiation h vb e cb h vb oh surface oh h vb h2o h oh e cb o2 o2 o2 h ho2 o2 bbr oxidized product oh bbr reduced product 4 conclusion rod shaped f cdwo4 was prepared and in situ functionalized by using brassica rapa leave extract the formation and functionalization of cdwo4 has been confirmed from xrd sem tem and ft ir techniques the average particle size was found to be 54 nm using xrd and tem image gave the average width of the nanorods ranged from 26 to 32 nm along with length of 120 nm the batch adsorption experiment under the influence of effect of dose initial concentration contact time ph of the solution and temperature were performed 1 5 gl 1 of f cdwo4 could remove 80 of bismarck brown r dye from 10 mgl 1 initial concentration within 15 min the higher adsorption efficiency of f cdwo4 was optimized at acidic ph the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 was found to be 46 5 mgg 1 at 30 c the higher uptake capacity of f cdwo4 for bismarck brown r was due to the functionalization of cdwo4 surface the f cdwo4 also showed the good photocatalytic activity for the bismarck brown r therefore the application of

8817,cadmium tungstate cdwo4 is well known semiconducting material which exhibit good photocatalytic properties but its preparation is usually carried out at very high temperature hardly any report is available for its preparation through green route and its application for water treatment therefore the functionalized cadmium tungstate f cdwo4 nanoparticles synthesis through green environmentally benign route using brassica rapa leave extract and sodium tungstate and cadmium iodide was objective of the present work the formation of f cdwo4 was confirmed from ft ir xrd and tem sem and uv visible spectroscopic techniques the average size of the particles was 54 nm as calculated from the xrd analysis 37 23 nm radius was determined from uv visible spectrum whereas average 27 nm breadth and 120 nm length was found from tem imaging showing rod shaped f cdwo4 nanoparticles the f cdwo4 was used for removal of toxic bismarck brown r dye from aqueous solution through adsorption and photocatalytic degradation under sun light irradiation the coloured water containing 10 mgl 1 concentration of dye could be cleaned with 1 5 gl 1 dose of f cdwo4 at optimum condition the adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 for bismarck brown r was found to be 46 5 49 50 and 51 54 mgg 1 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the endothermic adsorption of bismarck brown r followed pseudo second order kinetics the interaction between f cdwo4 and bismarck brown r on molecular level was investigated from ft ir studies clubbed with isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics the f cdwo4 also showed good photocatalytic degradation activity and degraded 82 70 of bismarck brown r in 50 ml solution having 20 mgl 1 dye concentration with 1 5 gl 1 dosage of f cdwo4 therefore f cdwo4 prepared through green route would be efficient for water treatment through both photocatalytic and adsorption activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment bismarck brown f cdwo4 green synthesis adsorption 1 introduction huge quantity of synthetic organic dyes is released by textile industries into rivers and other water resources which ultimately pollute water that prevent the sunlight penetration into the water increases oxidative stress ultimately degrade the water quality 1 4 most of the synthetic dyes contain complex structure having azo groups show severe toxicity when inhaled via drinking dye contaminated water which ultimately causes cancers of various parts of the human body 5 9 disazo dyes having two azo groups like bismarck brown r bbr is highly toxic and carcinogenic the other effects of dyes in water include reduction of oxygen levels retards penetration of sunlight into water which retards the growth of aquatic biota because of reduction in photosynthesis activity therefore their use is banned in many countries and strict regulation has been adopted but is still in use in many countries and being discharged into water bodies 10 12 therefore the remediation of these dyes is very necessary and concerned subject to make water free from these dyes before discharge into water sources like river and ponds there are various methods which are applicable for water treatment among them adsorption has become preferable and is effective at both low and high concentration of dyes the process can be more effective if solid material being used is of low cost and have higher adsorption capacity however only few effective adsorbents are available for disazo dyes because of problematic complex structure 13 14 adsorption the most simple water treatment technology depends on the structural properties of adsorbents that involve surface area shape and size 15 20 the use of nanosized adsorbents is an advance idea in water treatment technology and various types of nanomaterials have been prepared and used however there are several dyes which have large complex structures and therefore not completely removed from water through adsorption such dyes molecules can be degraded photocatalytically using a semiconducting material the degradation of dye molecule leads to less toxic fragments and photocatalytic activity of a particular material depends on its external and internal properties external properties include surface area and morphology while the intrinsic ones are type of crystal and electronic structure the crystal and electronic structure affects the band gap of the photocatalyst and thus responds to the photocatalytic activity 21 for the photocatalytic activity the energy of incident light must be equal or exceed that of the band gap of the photocatalyst during photocatalysis superoxide anions o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh together called ros are generated which causes degradation of dye molecules 22 various advanced nanomaterials like xanthangum titaniumdioxide tio2 nanocomposite 23 polyetherimide membrane with grafted bentonite clay 24 cerium dioxide and its composites 25 polyphenyl sulfone ppsu nanotinoxide sno2 mixed hollow fibre membrane 26 and starch cl poly lactic acid g acrylamide nanohydrogel 27 have been reported as a promising candidate for wastewater treatment as earlier reported nanomaterials like lafeo3 g c3n4 composite 28 wo3 cnt mose2 composites 29 eu tio2 graphene 30 eu wo3 system 31 c wo3 nanostructures 32 carbon nanodots and la gd er doped tungsten oxide nanostructures 33 and graphene wo3 nanostructures 34 have been investigated have shown enhanced photocatalytic activity for various organic compounds cdwo4 is a compound which exhibits good photo catalytic activity due to its physicochemical properties that includes layered structure and self trapped excitons also the band gap of cdwo4 is 3 8 ev and broader band gap provide large redox ability and therefore is good photocatalyst doping heterostructure morphology surface plasmon resonance and substitution may enhance the photo catalytic activity of cdwo4 by reducing the band gap cdwo4 has already generated a great interest in various potential applications such as in photoluminescence optical fibres and humidity sensing medical science scintillations photocatalysis due to their optical magnetic and electronic properties 35 37 numerous methods have been adopted for the synthesis of various forms of cdwo4 which include high temperature solid state reaction for powder form a flux method for whisker growth the czochralski method for single crystal growth pulsed laser ablation and hydrothermal method for nanoparticles 38 42 however all these methods are either expensive or environmentally hazardous and produce huge toxic wastes currently scientists all over the world are engaged in the green synthesis of nanomaterials for water treatment green synthesis involves the use of natural resources like plant leaves flowers fruits that are inexpensive and abundant in nature these natural materials are source of phytochemicals which can act as reducing capping and stabilizing agents moreover in such synthesis water is used as solvent involves low cost shorter time large scale nanomaterial production is possible do not require high energy and thus environmentally hazardous and huge toxic waste production can be stopped various types of materials have been synthesized through environmentally benign routes however hardly any report is available on the synthesis of cdwo4 for water treatment for enhancing adsorption capability the surface of cdwo4 nanoparticles can be functionalized by attaching various phytochemical compounds the synthesis and functionalization of nanomaterials through green rout can reduce the production cost and do not produce toxic waste we herein are reporting synthesis of functionalized cdwo4 nanorods f cdwo4 through eco friendly green method by involving brassica rapa leave extract and the synthesized f cdwo4 nanorods were applied for the photocatalytic degradation and adsorptive removal of a model dye bbr molecules from water the choice of f cdwo4 was based on idea that it has high photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of complex dyes like bbr the adsorption procedure was optimized to check the influence of cdwo4 nanorods dosage ph of dye solution concentration of bbr in solution contact time and water temperature the obtained experimental data was applied to various isotherm and kinetic models the parameters obtained from isotherms and kinetic models were used to propose the mechanism of the adsorption the thermodynamic parameters of the process were also studied to fix the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process the knowledge of all these parameters may be helpful in designing water treatment plant based on adsorbent having photocatalytic activity that can clean water by both adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of toxic organic dyes for complete removal from water 2 experimental 2 1 material and methods precursor chemicals sodium tungstate dihydrate and cadmium iodide used for the preparation of cdwo4 were purchased from merck ltd germany naoh and hcl used to control the ph of reaction mixture during adsorption studies were procured from loba india bismarck brown r dye mw 461 39 gmol 1 λ max 468 nm was procured from sigma aldrich india all these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as such without any purification brassica rapa leaves were collected from the local garden nearby jamia millia islamia new delhi india 2 2 synthesis of f cdwo4 freshly collected green brassica rapa leaves were washed with deionized water several times to remove any sticking dust leachable impurities then grounded to a thick paste by grinding in mortar pestle 10 g of this paste was poured into 100 ml distilled water in 250 ml beaker heated on water bath at 50 c for 2 h and then the resulting extract was filtered using whatman paper to prepare and f cdwo4 60 ml of the extract was added to a solution mixture of 300 ml of 0 2 m sodium tungstate solution to which 100 ml of 0 2 m cadmium iodide solution was added slowly under continues stirring condition the reaction occurred between sodium tungstate and cadmium iodide leading to the formation of cdwo4 and nai the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min dried at 60 c for 8 h and then calcined at 200 c in muffle furnace which was heated at a ramp rate of 30 c 2min rate for 2 h the reports are available in literature which shows that brassica rapa leave contains health friendly flavonoids and non flavonoids that can act as capping agent and react with surface to functionalize the cdwo4 nanoparticles to form f cdwo4 the formation of white precipitate is shown schematically in scheme 1 the calcined material was subjected to characterization for confirming the formation morphology and surface characteristics of f cdwo4 nanoparticles 43 the expected chemical reaction of synthesis of f cdwo4 nanoparticles may be na2wo4 cdi2 plant extract nucleation growth and functionalization of cdwo4 2nai 2 3 instrumentation various techniques including uv vis absorption spectroscopy uv visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform

nanoparticles the size of the prepared nanoparticles was measured from uv visible absorption spectrum and tem imaging the uv visible absorption spectrum and the band gap of the prepared f cdwo4 nanoparticles was investigated from uv vis spectrophotometer with specifications u 3900 spectrophotometer india and lambda 950 uv vis nir spectrophotometer perkinelmer in the range of 200 800 nm the crystal size and the structural properties of the prepared nanorods were estimated from the powder xrd pattern recorded on a pan analytical expert diffractometer using cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm a cu filter operating at 40 kv generator voltage and 30 ma current and a proportional counter detector the surface morphology of the prepared f cdwo4 was investigated using sem instrument fesem nova nano sem 450 fe1 equipped with edax bruker 127 ev the edax spectrum was analyzed to investigate the elemental composition of f cdwo4 nanorods the size and structure of the f cdwo4 were analyzed using high resolution transmission electron microscope using tem of tecnai t 30 300 kv fegtem operated at 80 kv 2 4 ph point of zero charge phzpc phzpc is a ph value at which a solid submerged in an aqueous medium exhibits zero electrical charge on the surface this charge on the solid surface can be achieved by protonation and deprotonation of the groups on solid surface protonation involves the acceptance of h to give positive charge to the surface at lower ph whereas deprotonation involves dissociation of h ions from the groups at surface to impart negative charge at higher ph the phzpc of f cdwo4 nanoparticles was measured at 27 c by taking 200 mg of cdwo4 in 20 ml of 0 1 m kno3 electrolyte solution in series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flask and the initial ph of these flasks was adjusted in the range 2 10 using 0 1 m hcl naoh solutions afterwards all the flasks were shacken at 160 rpm for 5 h afterwards the final ph was measured and the point of zero charge was determined from the plot between the two phs 8 2 5 determination of adsorption capacity and removal rate bbr adsorption experiments were carried out in batch mode by agitating series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml of bbr solution of certain concentration and fixed amount of f cdwo4 nanoparticles at 30 40 and 50 c ph 2 12 and time 15 120 min the initial concentration c o of bbr solution and the final concentration c e of remained bbr solution after adsorption supernatant in the erlenmeyer flasks were estimated by analyzing their absorbance using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer at 468 nm the initial concentrations of bbr solution and the concentration of supernatant were used to determine the uptake capacity of the f cdwo4 using following equations 8 the uptake of bbr 1 q e c o c e v m where v l is the volume of bbr solution and m g is the amount of f cdwo4 another important indication is percentage of adsorption which was calculated using following relationship 2 the percentage removal c o c e c o 100 the adsorption experiments were carried out in duplicate and the mean values of c e and q e were applied for optimization of bbr adsorption parameters of f cdwo4 in terms of amount of f cdwo4 concentration of bbr ph time and temperature the obtained experimental data was investigated by fitting in various isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic relationships 2 6 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic activity of f cdwo4 nanoparticles was examined by adding 1 5 gl 1 f cdwo4 in 50 ml of bbr solution having 20 mgl 1 concentration of bbr dye under the sunlight irradiation for 15 75 min after the irradiation under sunlight the dye samples were collected at regular interval of 15 min centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed for bbr concentration in the solution using uv vis spectrometer the uv vis absorption spectra were also recorded at regular interval of 15 min for showing the photocatalytic efficiency of f cdwo4 fig 10a which was calculated using the formula 3 d e g r a d a t i o n c o c t c o 100 where c o is the initial concentration of bbr which reached the absorbency balance and c t is the concentration of bbr at irradiation time t 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the diffused reflectance spectrum of the prepared powdered f cdwo4 was recorded for determining the band gap energy fig 1 a the parabolic approximation between the absorption coefficient and band gap energy was used to determine the band gap energy of f cdwo4 using given expression 4a α h ν h ν e g a where eg α and hν are band gap energy absorption coefficient of f cdwo4 nanorods and energy of photon used a is a constant whose value for allowed eg direct transition is 0 5 and that for allowed eg indirect transition is 2 0 respectively the plot fig 1 b between αhv and hv known as tauc plot was used to find the band gap energy of f cdwo4 44 the formation of f cdwo4 nanoparticles were confirmed spectrophotometrically by analysing uv vis spectrum in the wavelength range of 250 550 nm the uv vis spectrum indicated the broad absorption peaks around 265 nm fig 2 which was used to calculate the average size of the prepared nanoparticles by substituting absorption peak value in the following relationship 45 4b r n m 0 2963 40 1970 13620 λ 7 34 2418 6 λ where λ is absorption peak wavelength in nm and r nm is radius of the nanoparticle the radius of the f cdwo4 nanoparticles came out to be 37 23 nm the ft ir spectrum of the f cdwo4 nanoparticles fig 3 showed a broad peak around 3390 cm 1 which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of o h bond of surface adsorbed water on the sample 8 the two peaks appeared around 2968 and 2820 cm 1 were for the stretching vibration of c h of ch3 and ch2 respectively the co stretching frequencies appeared near to 1747 cm 1 and wavenumber 1620 cm 1 appeared for oh bending frequency because of these groups attached to the cdwo4 nanoparticle surface that might have come from the plant extract 8 46 47 the appearance of bands from 950 to 500 cm 1 might be attributed to the intrinsic vibrations for apparently different w o stretching vibrations in f cdwo4 nanoparticles 48 49 these observed wave numbers confirmed the synthesis and functionalization of f cdwo4 nanoparticles using brassica rapa leave extract the phytochemicals present in leave contents act as stabilizing agent functionalization groups scheme i and caused higher adsorption efficiency for bismarck brown r the xrd diffraction profile of the sample fig 4 gave the peaks at 23 21 29 12 29 78 31 18 35 28 40 12 43 44 47 57 51 03 52 62 59 87 60 79 63 36 63 57 and 67 17⁰ 2θ which corresponded to the 101 111 111 002 020 112 121 022 103 212 131 311 123 213 and 014 plane respectively 50 51 the diffraction profile suggested a tetragonal crystalline structure of f cdwo4 jcpds 80 0138 and also an unknown phase an identification of the unknown phase using crystallographic open data base cod indicated that it belongs to the monoclinic phase space group p12 c1 a 5 0289 å b 5 8596 å c 5 0715 å β 91 519 it is known that the tetragonal phase is stable at room temperature while monoclinic phase appeared at higher temperature when cdwo4 nanoparticles was calcined at 200 c however when the sample was cooled down to the room temperature tetragonal structure again retained the tetragonal phase was also stable in air 52 all the diffraction peaks are sharp indicating a highly crystalline structure the monoclinic wolframite type structure contain six o atoms surrounding w atom while in tetragonal scheelite type w atom is surrounded by four o atoms 21 53 the morphology of the prepared f cdwo4 nanoparticles was studied from the sem image fig 5 a which indicated irregular structures of various sizes the average crystallite size of f cdwo4 was also calculated via xrd analysis using debye scherrer s equation 54 5 d k λ β c o s θ where λ is wave length of x ray radiation λ 0 154 nm β is full width at half maxima fwhm and θ is bragg s angle the average particle size was calculated to be 54 nm which was further confirmed from tem the f cdwo4 nanorods appeared in different shapes and the average width of the nanoparticles ranged from 26 to 32 nm and length around 120 nm was obtained from the tem image fig 6 rod shaped morphology of cdwo4 is because of the crystal growth in the direction 100 while rods get assembled and attached with each other to the direction 001 55 the edx equipped with the sem instrument was used to measure the chemical composition of f cdwo4 which gave 20 84 cd 45 32 w and 33 86 o in weight percentage fig 5b thus these results confirmed the preparation of f cdwo4 using brassica rapa leave extract 3 2 phzpc of f cdwo4 the phzpc of f cdwo4 was found to be 6 9 as determined through the salt addition method fig s1 the phzpc value of 6 9 indicated that the f cdwo4 surface did not have charge at nearly neutral ph and above and below this ph point the f cdwo4 surface get charged accordingly the phzpc of the f cdwo4 well explained the trend of adsorption of charged molecules on the ph change as discussed later herein below 3 3 batch adsorption experiments first the effect of amount of f cdwo4 on its uptake capacity for bbr was studied by varying amount of f cdwo4 between 0 3 and 1 6 gl 1 fig s2 the batch mode adsorption experiments were performed with a series of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml solution of 10 mgl 1 initial concentration of bbr at room temperature neutral ph and the reaction time of 90 min the percent uptake trends indicated the rapid increase in adsorption of bbr onto f cdwo4 up to 89 7 with increase in f cdwo4 amount in brief the trend of bbr interaction onto the f cdwo4 surface indicated that 0 3 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 could remove about 19 of bbr and reached to maximum of about 90 with 1 6 gl 1 of f cdwo4 and then attained equilibrium fig s2 it is to be noted that small dosage of f cdwo4 could remove higher percentage of bbr the higher uptake capacity of f cdwo4 for bbr might be due to the dense functional sites available on the f cdwo4 8 the influence of others parameters were ascertained with 1 5 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 at which adsorption reached to the equilibrium to obtain the optimum time period for the adsorption process the experiment was performed with 1 5 gl 1 f cdwo4 and 10 mgl 1 concentration of bbr for 15 90 min fig s3 the process was followed after every 15 min time intervals and the obtained results indicated that approximately 80 of bbr could be removed within 15 min the adsorption was fast at initial time period which rapidly reduced bbr concentration and as time passed the rate of removal decreased and the maximum 88 removal could be observed after 90 min the much faster rate in adsorption at starting stage might be due to initially available large numbers of sites at f cdwo4 surface and after a certain period of time partially filled and available active sites decreased and the filling of available sites created complication for upcoming bbr molecules and needed specific way to acquire the limited available sites 56 the effect of change of concentration of bbr on the uptake efficiency of f cdwo4 was also examined by varying its concentration from 10 to 60 mgl 1 at optimum conditions fig s4 the lower concentration of bbr responded to higher adsorption percentage which might be due to availability of active sites at f cdwo4 surface for bbr molecules however with increased concentration of bbr the adsorption percentage gradually decreased and the amount adsorbed per gram of f cdwo4 increased and reached equilibrium after certain level of initial concentration i e 40 mgl 1 this might be due to the filling of all sites available at the f cdwo4 45 however results of investigation showed that f cdwo4 sufficiently removed 87 bbr molecules from 10 mgl 1 to 74 from 60 mgl 1 concentrations the ph of the bbr solution also played an important role in controlling the adsorption behaviour of f cdwo4 the change in ph of bbr solution from 2 to 12 under the other optimum conditions caused decrease in percentage adsorption from 97 43 to 86 32 fig 7 this might be due to the fact that the surface properties of dispersed f cdwo4 nanorods changed with the change in ph of the bbr solution 8 the protonation and deprotonation of the functional groups changed the surface behaviour and thus controlled the overall adsorption process this can be easily understood from phzpc of f cdwo4 at ph below 6 9 the surface of f cdwo4 was positively charged due to the protonation of oxygenous function groups thus largely attracted the anionic bismarck brown r molecules towards its surface and decreased gradually with the increase in ph at ph above the phzpc the surface of f cdwo4 become negatively charged due to deprotonation of oxygenous functional groups which led to the dramatic decrease in adsorption efficiency of f cdwo4 due to the anionic bbr and anionic surface repulsion 54 3 4 adsorption isotherm isotherm studies using four different isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were carried out to get information related to the maximum adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 for bbr affinity of bbr towards f cdwo4 from aqueous solution the interaction behaviour and surface properties of f cdwo4 at three temperatures 30 40 and 50 c langmuir isotherm expressed in the linearized mathematical equation below is applicable for homogeneous solid surface where all the available active sites are energetically equivalent and on which adsorbate chemically form the monolayer 56 6 c e q e c e q o 1 q o b where q e mgg 1 is adsorption capacity at equilibrium q o mgg 1 is monolayer maximum adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 and b is a langmuir constant which is useful to measure the binding energy between bbr and f cdwo4 the q o and b values were determined in the temperature range of 30 50 c from the slope and intercept of langmuir plot c e q e versus c e fig 8 a respectively the value of q o came out in the range 46 51 51 54 mgg 1 table 1 which is higher than the other reported adsorbents and indicated the slightly endothermic process the b value was found in the range 0 089 0 053 lg 1 and being highest at 30 c indicated the best bbr binding to f cdwo4 at 30 c temperature the dimensionless constant called separation factor rl describes the feasibility of the adsorption process was also determined using the equation as follows 57 60 7 r l 1 1 b c e the obtained rl value was 0 rl 1 from 0 052 to 0 065 indicated the feasibility of the adsorption process at all the temperature the freundlich model is applicable to those heterogeneous solid surface system at which each available sites has a specific bond energy and adsorbate physically form multilayer the isotherm is expressed in the linearized mathematical form as given below 60 61 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf mgg 1 lmg 1 1 n and n are freundlich constants and represent the quantity of adsorbed adsorbate onto the heterogeneous surface and measure the heterogeneity of the surface whose value should lies in range 1 10 respectively the freundlich plot of logq e versus logc e fig 8 b gave the values of kf in the range 4 91 3 44 mgg 1 lmg 1 1 n and n from 1 58 to 1 43 in temperature range 30 50 c and are listed in table 1 the value of the regression coefficients r2 obtained for the freundlich model was close to unity 0 99 and better than langmuir 0 86 0 89 the nearly unity value of r2 indicated the best fit of freundlich model to the experimental data obtained for this study suggesting non homogeneous nature of f cdwo4 surface the affinity of bbr with f cdwo4 and adsorption probability of bbr to heterogeneous solid surface of f cdwo4 was also determined using temkin relationship as given below 49 9 q e r t b t ln a t r t b t ln c e where a t and b t are coefficients related to the binding energy and heat of adsorption respectively these coefficients were obtained from the slope and intercept of q e versus lnc e plots at three temperatures fig s5 the temkin plot gave the a t value which increased slightly from 0 147 to 0 158 lg 1 indicating slightly higher binding energy at higher temperature the b t value increased from 0 175 to 0 201 kjmol 1 table 1 which suggested slightly higher heat of adsorption i e higher bonding probability of bbr onto f cdwo4 at 50 c temperature the positive value of b t suggested the slightly endothermic process which was further confirmed from the thermodynamic parameter values dubinin radushkevich isotherm is another one that can be used to find the nature of adsorption the linear form of dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm given below was also used to determine the nature of bonding between bbr and f cdwo4 the maximum d r adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 and the free energy change ed r of interaction between bbr and f cdwo4 at three tested temperature 61 10 ln q e ln q d r β ε 2 where β mol2kj 2 is a constant related to the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of bbr and q d r mgg 1 is theoretical adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 the ε is a polanyi potential which was calculated by using following expression 60 11 ε r t ln 1 1 c e the β value calculated from the above equation gave the value of free energy change ed r by substituting in the following relationship 12 e d r 2 β 0 5 the β value ranged from 0 660 to 1 223 mol2kj 2 and q d r ranged from 21 03 to 19 85 mgg 1 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot between lnqe versus ε 2 fig s6 respectively and are listed in table 1 the calculated free energy change e d r ranged from 0 869 to 0 639 kjmol 1 and is less than 8 0 kjmol 1 which suggested physical interaction between bbr and f cdwo4 3 5 thermodynamics of bbr adsorption thermodynamic parameters are important to examine the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process and were calculated at 30 40 and 50 c the gibbs free energy change δg was estimated from the following relationship 57 13 δ g o r t ln b where b called langmuir constant was calculated from the langmuir plot and was used to calculate the value of δg which was found to be negative 6 029 6 817 and 7 755 kjmol 1 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the δg in between 0 to 20 confirmed that the sorption of bbr onto the f cdwo4 is thermodynamically favourable and spontaneous and physical process at the tested temperature range the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot δ g o r t versus 1 t fig s7 respectively 54 14 δ g o δ h o t δ s o 15 δ g o r t δ s o r δ h o r t the obtained positive value of δh 22 697 kjmol 1 and δs 0 096 kjmol 1k 1 suggested the endothermic nature of the process associated with good affinity of bbr to f cdwo4 this result was also confirmed from the observation made from temperature effect on the adsorption experiment carried out with the concentration of bbr in the range 10 60 mgl 1 and 1 5 gl 1 amount of f cdwo4 at 30 40 and 50 c the adsorption of bbr decreased with increase in temperature which was due to escaping of the adsorbed bbr ions on getting higher temperature or energy indicating physical nature of the adsorption 3 6 adsorption kinetics the knowledge of various kinetic parameters is important tool for designing a water treatment system on practical level moreover these kinetic parameters determine rate and mechanism of the adsorption process these parameters can also decide physical or chemical nature of the process which depends on physiochemical properties of adsorbate as well as adsorbent 61 the rate of reaction also helps to devise mechanism of the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent on molecular level the kinetics for the present study was investigated by interpreting the adsorption data for bbr removal at 15 min time interval 15 90 min using the optimum amount of f cdwo4 1 5 gl 1 for 10 mgl 1 concentration using various well known kinetic relationships namely pseudo first order pfo fig 9 a pseudo second order pso fig 9 b and elovich fig 9 c given below respectively 8 16 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 17 t q t 1 h t q e where h k 2 q e 2 18 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where q t mgg 1 is the adsorption capacity of solid at the time t k 1 min 1 and k 2 gmg 1min 1 are the rate constants for pfo and pso respectively α and β are the coefficients of adsorption and desorption respectively according to the pfo model adsorption rate fluctuates with the vacant sites on the adsorbent surface and the plot of log q e q t versus t gives the pfo kinetic parameters pso model gives the information about the chemical interaction of adsorbate to the solid surface which is the rate limiting step for pso model 54 the plot of t q t versus t gives the pso kinetic quantities elovich model gives information for the heterogeneous adsorbent on which no lateral interaction takes place 61 the fitting of experimental adsorption data to the models was evaluated by comparing the coefficients of determination r2 and other parameters of these models the results are listed in table 2 and the linear plot of pso between t qt versus t fig 9b gave the best fit to the experimental adsorption data in respect to higher r2 and lower difference between the theoretical adsorption capacities and the obtained capacity from the experiment therefore the experimental data fitting showed that the process followed pso kinetic model the value of α 2 958 105 mgg 1min 1 came out to be much higher than β 3 137 gmg 1 which suggested the higher rate of adsorption than desorption at equilibrium table 2 3 7 mechanistic model the physical sorption of bbr molecules from aqueous solution to f cdwo4 nanoparticles surface might either be governed by the film diffusion or intra particle diffusion therefore for confirming the mechanism of the present adsorption process the obtained experimental kinetic data was also applied to the intra particle diffusion and the liquid film diffusion models which are expressed by the following mathematical equations respectively 8 19 q t k i p d t 0 5 c 20 ln 1 f k f d t where k ipd is the intra particle diffusion rate constant k fd is the film diffusion rate constant and f q t q e is the fractional attainment of equilibrium the slope of the linear plot of intra particle diffusion model between q t versus t 0 5 fig 9 d gave the k ipd 0 104 mgg 1 min 0 5 and the intercept value of 4 869 mgg 1 with regression coefficient of 0 98 table 2 the film diffusion linear plot between ln 1 f and t fig s8 gave the k fd 0 155 mgg 1min 1 and the intercept value of 2 656 with regression coefficient of 0 52 table 2 these results indicated that bbr adsorption onto the f cdwo4 was governed by the intraparticle diffusion of bbr molecules into interior of the f cdwo4 surface 54 3 8 ft ir analysis of bbr adsorption onto the f cdwo4 the interaction between f cdwo4 nanorods and bbr can simply be explained from the comparative study of ft ir spectrum of bbr loaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 10 and unloaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 3 the ft ir spectrum of bbr loaded f cdwo4 nanorods fig 10 has shown shifting in the peaks obtained for those of unloaded f cdwo4 nanorods the broad spectrum peak contributed to the stretching vibrations of o h bond at 3390 cm 1 has shifted to 3375 cm 1 and the bending frequency at 1620 cm 1 has shifted to 1590 cm 1 whereas the peak around 1747 cm 1 for co group disappeared the appearance of bands in the range 500 950 cm 1 is for the intrinsic vibrations of w o in cdwo4 56 however no significant change was observed for the peaks appeared around 2968 and 2820 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of c h of ch3 and ch2 respectively these shifts disappearance and disturbing in the peaks of unloaded f cdwo4 on bbr loaded f cdwo4 might be due to the weak hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between bbr molecules and f cdwo4 nanorods 8 therefore the higher adsorption efficiency for bbr onto cdwo4 was due to the functionalization of cdwo4 3 9 photocatalytic degradation of bbr dye the photocatalytic degradation of bbr dye molecule using f cdwo4 nanorods was also investigated in terms of time intervals under bright sunlight irradiation the absorption spectrum recorded for photocatalytic activity of f cdwo4 for different time intervals showed a decrease in the intensity of the decomposition curves with the increase in illumination time fig 11 a the decrease in the intensity of the curves indicated the ability of f cdwo4 for degrading the bbr the quantitative analysis has suggested that more than 80 of bbr in the dye solution could be degraded within 75 min of sunlight irradiation fig 11 b this might be the result of photo generation of charge carriers or reactive oxygen species ros during the process which degrade the bbr and led to the formation of co2 and h2o 62 the whole mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of bbr using f cdwo4 can be understood by reaction scheme fig 12 briefly the f cdwo4 is n type semiconductor having band indirect gap energy of 4 0 ev determined from tauc s plot fig 1b and when sunlight fallen on it having energy exceeding its band gap then the electrons from the valence band goes to the conduction band leaving holes in valence band the electrons and holes move towards the surface of f cdwo4 nanorods and electrons combined with adsorbed oxygen to form superoxide anions o2 and the holes react with oh to form hydroxyl radicals oh comes from surface water these ros will react with the dye molecules and responsible for its degradation 22 the reaction mechanism involved in dye degradation is given below 13 14 cdwo4 light radiation h vb e cb h vb oh surface oh h vb h2o h oh e cb o2 o2 o2 h ho2 o2 bbr oxidized product oh bbr reduced product 4 conclusion rod shaped f cdwo4 was prepared and in situ functionalized by using brassica rapa leave extract the formation and functionalization of cdwo4 has been confirmed from xrd sem tem and ft ir techniques the average particle size was found to be 54 nm using xrd and tem image gave the average width of the nanorods ranged from 26 to 32 nm along with length of 120 nm the batch adsorption experiment under the influence of effect of dose initial concentration contact time ph of the solution and temperature were performed 1 5 gl 1 of f cdwo4 could remove 80 of bismarck brown r dye from 10 mgl 1 initial concentration within 15 min the higher adsorption efficiency of f cdwo4 was optimized at acidic ph the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of f cdwo4 was found to be 46 5 mgg 1 at 30 c the higher uptake capacity of f cdwo4 for bismarck brown r was due to the functionalization of cdwo4 surface the f cdwo4 also showed the good photocatalytic activity for the bismarck brown r therefore the application of biogenic f cdwo4 can be efficient green technique for water treatment to remove dyes from industrial wastewater declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no conflict of interest about

past decades water pollution caused by organic dyes produced from textile and other industrial processes have been attracted much attention due to a considerable damage to human beings and aquatic animals these organic dyes result in high chemical oxygen demand cod bad smell and mainly are responsible for the colouration of wastewaters 1 2 among many dyes that are applied in manufactured products safranin o so must be highlighted safranin o is a basic dye and is widely used for food coloring additive a dye for silk jute leather wool cotton paper and also in manufacturing of paints and printing inks 3 5 various physical chemical and biological techniques have applied for treatment of dye containing wastewater such as incineration biological treatment ozonation adsorption on solid phases etc 6 11 though the above mentioned methods work well in some instances these methods have some limitations like production of toxic volatiles non degradable sludge and bad smell 12 14 to eliminate these disadvantageous and adverse effects created by in situ products the heterogeneous photocatalysis became an elegant alternative for degradation of organic dyes 15 16 in contrast to the traditional methods photocatalytic technique in wastewater treatment is superior due to quick oxidation no formation of polycyclic products and oxidation of pollutants in the ppb range 17 18 by the way the photocatalysis may be defined as a process in which a semiconductor material absorbs energy of light more than or equal to its band gap thereby generating electrons and holes that can further generate free radicals in the system to oxidize the substrate 19 many photocatalysts have been synthesized and employed to degrade organic pollutants such as zno nb2o5 sno2 ni2o3 bi2o3 al2o3 tio2 etc 20 26 among these catalysts tio2 is widely used as a photocatalyst due to its high potential in reducing environmental contaminant by decomposing organic and inorganic pollutants because of its wide band gap chemical stability nontoxicity and low cost 27 29 however there are several drawbacks associated with the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 a key challenge of photocatalysis in the application of these nanoparticles is the agglomeration which can cause the deactivation of the catalysts and separation furthermore owing to thermally unstable they can undergo phase transformation and crystallite growth at high temperature these process leads to a reduction in the surface area 30 several attempts have been made to overcome these problems by doping with different metals and non metals such as ag pd sn c n etc 31 35 though the doping increased active surface area dramatically the problem of separation of catalyst is still a major concern recently researchers focused on the synthesis of concentric multilayer semiconductor nanoparticles known as core shell nanoparticles 36 core shell nanoparticles have gained great interest due to their improved chemical and physical properties as compared to the counterpart studies moreover the titania morphologies can be tailored by loading titania on inert supports like zeolites glass fibers and beads carbon fibers alumina and silica in the advanced photocatalytic degradation of pollutants among these supporting materials mesoporous silica have recently attracted much attention for promising application such as catalysis separations drug delivery and microelectronics due to its high surface area 37 38 furthermore besides being silica has no absorption in uv range it is easy to synthesize mesoporous silica with a high specific surface area and pore volume the advantages of titania coated silica materials are high specific surface areas large pore volumes and narrow pore size distribution and high thermal stability due to these properties the titania coated silica materials exhibit higher absorption capacity and better photocatalytic oxidation of various organic pollutants in spite of these advantages it is still a challenge to search for new and better techniques for large scale synthesis of sio2 tio2 core shell photocatalysts with high surface area controlled pore size and morphology traditional synthetic methods involves the deposition of metal precursors onto high surface area supports for synthesis of supported nanoparticle catalysts followed by various thermal activation treatments the uniform distribution of nanoparticles and the degree of dispersion of nanoparticles on the support are each highly dependent on the ph and concentration of the precursor solution type of the oxide support and calcination temperature in addition these methods often provide limited control over the composition and structures of supported nanoparticle catalyst which often leads to significant compositional non uniformity from particle to particles in order to address these issues we fabricated titania coated silica nanoparticles following the nanoparticle encapsulation method in this method titania was incorporated into pre synthesized silica nanoparticles by sol gel method this route provides an unconventional method of designing supported nanoparticle catalysts through a rational chemical approach which gives well dispersion of tio2 nanoparticles within high surface area silica supports and good control over the size composition and internal structure of the nanoparticles among the various techniques available for the synthesis of core shell nanoparticle catalysts the process of entrapping the pre synthesized nanoparticles into an inorganic matrix by the sol gel method is an interesting route 39 this method takes advantage of the large number of synthetic solution protocols that have been developed to carefully control nanoparticle size shape and composition so far the synthesis of titania coated silica nanoparticles using the encapsulation method has not been studied in detail the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation depends on several parameters such as the catalyst dose initial dye concentration the reaction time ph of the solution the molecular structure of the dye used etc in the conventional methods experiments were carried out by one at a time sensitivity experiments which leads to unpredictable number of experiments to overcome this problem with considerable accuracy models such as design expert de are employed for obtaining the optimized conditions with the less time and reducing chemical cost among various experimental design methodologies response surface method rsm is efficient and can measure the relationship among the controllable input parameters and to obtain response surfaces 40 rsm has the potential to estimate linear interaction and quadratic effects of the factors and it can predict model for the response it can also analyse the process and gives the results faster than the conventional one factor at a time approach 41 the experimental data required are reliant on the chosen design central composite or box behnken designs 42 the design technique for rsm is as follows i performing a bunch of runs of experiments for adequate and dependable measurement of the response of interest ii emerging a mathematical model of the second order response surface with the best fit iii determining the best set of experimental parameters which can produce a maximum value of response iv representing the interactive effects of process parameters through two and three dimensional plots 43 the present work reports the novel technique for synthesis of titania coated silica nanocomposite with high surface area and high thermal stability 900 c i e nanoparticle encapsulation method which provides better control over nanoparticles size and structure the synthesized novel photocatalyst was used for photodegradation of safranin o dye which is phenazine dye widely used in textile industry this is for the first time the experimental data has been validated by theoretical modeling with response surface methodology rsm to optimize the degradation process of safranin o dye using titania coated silica nanocomposite which has not been studied yet the variable factors investigated were the catalyst dose initial dye concentration and reaction time the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was checked by a uv vis spectrophotometer the results of our optimization demonstrate that the rsm can be used readily to determine the optimal conditions for the degradation of safranin o dye 2 experimental 2 1 materials cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab tetraethyl

titanium precursor and was added to 5ml of freshly dried methanol using hot molecular sieves this was then added to the beaker and gel was formed within 10 15min this was then kept for aging overnight and followed by drying at the temperature between 150 and 200 c for 1 2 h the dried gel was then powdered using mortar and pestle and calcined in air at a temperature of 900 c for 3h 2 4 characterizations the ft ir spectroscopy perkin elmer was used to determine the bonding between titania and silica in nanocomposites the crystal structure of the synthesized catalyst was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd of rigaku japan ultima iv with cukα source the size morphology and structure of the nanoparticle were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem subsequently the chemical composition of the prepared nanoparticle was measured by edx performed in nova nanosem fei the surface area was calculated by using the bet brunauer emmet teller equation in quantachrome autosorb iq model asiqm0000 4 the pore size distribution and pore volume were obtained by applying the bjh barrett joyner halenda method the samples were degassed in vacuum at 150 c all the samples were dispersed into deionized water and the zeta potential measurements were taken by zeta sizer nano malvern zs 90 2 5 photocatalytic study of safranin o dye using titania coated silica nanoparticles the photocatalytic studies were conducted in a reaction chamber 50cm x 50cm x 50cm containing an artificial uv light 15w bulb of philips the distance between the lamp and the surface of the solution was about 15cm the photocatalytic degradation of so dye was measured by adding a known amount of catalyst to the dye solution prepared in di water the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30min to obtain an equilibrium photocatalyst dye solution from this mixture a small quantity was then taken out at regular intervals with a syringe and was centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10min to remove the catalyst the supernatant was taken and filled in a quartz cuvette without dilution and was then studied using uv vis spectroscopy to calculate the concentration of so dye 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology characterization in this work silica nanoparticle was prepared as discussed in the experimental section later on the nanoparticle encapsulation method was employed for the fabrication of titania coated silica nanoparticle the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized material was examined by employing safranin o dye as a model pollutant safranin o dye belongs to quinone imine class which is widely used in textile industry safranin o dye discharged from textile industry poses a big threat to our environment since the dye is known for its carcinogenic nature even in trace amounts the presence of various chemical and physical properties of the catalyst was then characterized by different characterization techniques ft ir spectra of titania coated silica nanoparticles are shown in fig 1 the presence of water is evidenced by the appearance of the oh stretching at 3440cm 1 the peak at 1627cm 1 indicates the bending vibration of si oh bond the presence of hydroxyl ions on the surface of the catalyst is advantageous for the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because it offers higher capacity for oxygen adsorption 44 in fig 1 c new distinct and sharp peaks around 1087cm 1 and 804cm 1 ascribed to asymmetric stretching and symmetric bending of si o si vibration respectively an absorption peak at 955cm 1 is attributed to the si o ti group in titania coated silica nanoparticle indicating the formation of si o ti bond 45 the formation of si o ti bond arises from two possibilities first may be due to the substitution of small amount of ti iv for si iv in the frame work of mesoporous silica and second may be due to the connection of embedded titania particles to the mesoporous silica matrix through the si o ti bonds in the interface between silica and titania 46 the alkyl groups have been removed by calcination and it is evident by the absence of the c h peaks in the ftir spectra of titania coated silica nanoparticles the x ray diffraction patterns xrd of titania coated silica nanoparticles is found to possess a fine nano crystalline titania anatase phase which is shown in fig 2 the diffraction pattern having a peak at 2θ values of 25 3 37 8 48 0 53 9 55 1 62 7 70 2 75 2 correspond respectively to 101 004 200 105 211 204 220 215 crystal planes which can be indexed to the anatase phase of tio2 which matches well to the reported jcpds data card no 71 1166 during hydrothermal treatment tio2 changes its phase to anatase by dissolution and reprecipitation processes in which transiently dissolved titanate species rapidly nucleated to form nanocrystalline structure because of the high reactivity of the hydrothermal system presence of silica improved the thermal stability of titania as a result very few rutile phase has occurred at high calcination temperature 900 c it is observed that the electron transport is faster in the anatase phase of tio2 than the rutile phase of tio2 leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 47 the small hump located at 22 can be assigned to the characteristic peak of amorphous silica jcpds card no 49 1711 in addition the presence of sio2 stabilized the anatase phase of tio2 even at 900 c 48 49 the average crystallite size of tio2 nanoparticles were calculated for 101 crystal plane using the scherer equation r m k λ β1 2 cosθ and is found to be 6nm the detailed size and morphology of the titania coated silica nanoparticle further investigated by the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and corresponding edx spectrum which is shown in fig 3 a c the fesem image fig 3 a shows that the pure silica nanoparticles were intact spheres with the smooth surface without aggregation further it was found from fesem images that the silica particles preserved their particulate form after calcination at 900 c and the sio2 core was successfully coated with a thin layer of tio2 with several nanometers resulting in a rough surface morphology inset fig 3 b a quantitative edx spectrum was taken to determine the elemental composition of titania coated silica nanoparticle which is shown in fig 3 c from the figure it confirmed that there are no other elemental impurities present in the catalyst furthermore the si and ti elements were calculated according to the data of atomic percent and found to be 39 5 and 2 0 respectively fig 4 shows the typical n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of sio2 tio2 nanoparticles the isotherm represents the type iv isotherm according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac nomenclature indicating the presence of mesopores in the composite which is related to capillary condensation associated with the pore channels by analysing the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm it was found that the catalyst has a high surface area of about 725m2 g 1 and pore volume of 0 142ccg 1 the bjh pore size distributions of the titania coated silica nanoparticles is shown in the inset of fig 4 the sample has a narrow pore size distribution and the average pore size is 3nm implying that the catalyst was mesoporous in nature in order to have a proper coating of titania on silica the dispersion stabilities of the silica and titania are of high significance to prevent homo coagulation to achieve hetero coagulation surface charges are needed to be monitored via zeta potential measurements and the results are shown in fig 5 also it can be seen that the zeta potential decrease as the ph of the solution increases and the order of decreases zeta potential is as pure silica nanoparticles titania nanoparticles and titania coated silica nanoparticles when the ph is higher than the isoelectric point iep due to the deprotonation the surface and therefore the zeta potential of all above materials become negative it was observed that the iep of the titania coated silica nanoparticles ranged between those of pure silica nanoparticle iep at ph 3 8 and pure titania nanoparticles iep at ph 6 2 this confirmed that the titania particles got adsorbed on the silica surface and formed a non complete non continuous shell which was previously confirmed by fesem where the surface morphology of titania coated silica nanoparticle is rough due to titania particles a similar type of observation was found in the literature 50 before employing an experimental design it was necessary to study the extents of photocatalytic degradation of safranin o dye fig 6 shows the photocatalytic degradation of the safranin o dye using p25 degussa pure titania and titania coated silica nanoparticles under three different conditions catalyst dose 100mg initial dye concentration 10mg l and reaction time 20min after 20min the concentration of safranin o dye on p25 and pure titania did not decrease much with prolonged uv irradiation whereas titania coated silica nanoparticle showed enhanced degradation efficiency this indicates that the affinity for safranin o dye after deposition of tio2 nanoparticle on silica leads to the higher surface area which could be responsible for the higher catalytic activity of the catalyst 3 2 experimental design response surface methodology is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques which is useful for developing improving and optimizing the processes the use of statistical experimental design techniques in the photocatalytic process can result in the requirement of fewer resources such as time reagents and experimental work in the present study of central composite design which is a widely used form of rsm was used for optimization of photodegradation of safranin o dyes and three main factors chosen were catalyst dose mg g x 1 initial dye concentration mg l x 2 and reaction time min x 3 as shown in table 1 3 3 ccd model and residuals analysis the 3 factor ccd matrix and experimental results obtained from design expert 7 1 software for the photocatalytic degradation of safranin o is given in table 2 the second order polynomial response expression in eq 1 was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables 1 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b 12 x 1 x 2 b 13 x 1 x 3 b 23 x 2 x 3 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 b 33 x 3 2 where y is the response b0 is the constant b1 b2 and b3 are the linear coefficients b12 b13 and b23 are the cross product coefficients b11 b22 and b33 are the quadratic coefficients based on these results an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables parameters are expressed by the second order polynomial equation which consists of 10 statistically significant coefficients 2 y 93 13 8 33 x 1 3 97 x 2 2 28 x 3 0 54 x 1 x 2 0 54 x 1 x 3 0 29 x 2 x 3 9 65 x 1 2 1 11 x 2 2 1 50 x 3 2 where y is the response variable of degradation efficiency of safranin o the x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent three experimental factors viz catalyst dose initial dye concentration and reaction time respectively the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of safranin o by titania coated silica nanoparticles with varied parameters within the selected range has been predicted by eq 1 and the analytical and predicted values are presented in table 2 these results indicated good agreement between the experimental and predicted values of degradation efficiency of dyes this can further be explained by plotting the experimental degradation efficiency versus predicted values which is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is confirmed that all values are well distributed along the straight line indicating that there is no non normality this validates that the established model is appropriate to explain the range of studied moreover the predicted r2 correlation coefficient is very close to the corresponding r2 value of analytical experiments which is shown in table 3 to evaluate the fitness significance and adequacy of the model for this particular study analysis of variance anova has been applied to find the effects of each of the variable and interaction effect of parameters on the response table 3 the f value for the model was calculated to be 638 22 with lower probability 0 0001 indicating that the model is highly significant there was only a 0 01 possibility that the model f value could happen due to noise the model p value was 0 0001 which further confirmed that the model is statistically significant whereas the value greater than 0 1000 indicated the model terms are not significant the lack of fit value of 1 22 implied that the lack of fit is not significant relative to pure error the non significant lack of fit confirmed the good predictability of the model the predicted r squared of 0 9913 was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r squared of 0 9967 confirming good predictability of the model it observed that among the three parameter studied the catalyst dose x 1 had the largest effect on the degradation of safranin o dye to the maximum f value followed in order by initial dye concentration and reaction time 3 4 analysis of contour and response surface plots by using the design expert 7 1 software three dimensional 3d surface can be introduced as graphical representation of the regression equation to determine the optimum values of variables and also their corresponding two dimensional 2d contour plots were fabricated these 3d and 2d plots are widely used to achieve better understandings of the interactions between variables within the range 51 52 the interactions between the three independent variables and the response are shown in fig 10 the circular nature of the contour plots shows that the interaction is negligible whereas the elliptical contour plots shows significant interaction between the corresponding variables 53 in each plot the effects of two parameters were varied within the experimental ranges and the other parameters fixed to zero level fig 8 a shows the effect of catalyst dose and initial dye concentration on the degradation of safranin o dye from aqueous solution catalyst dose is an important factor that significantly influence the photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules from the figure it is concluded that the degradation of dye increases as catalyst dose increases this increase is attributed to several factors such as active sites on the surface of nanoparticle the penetration of uv light into the aqueous solution of mixture of the catalyst and dye 54 for instance the greater amount of photocatalyst creates more number of active radicals by absorbing the larger amount of photons that result in high efficiency of degradation 55 in contrast to catalyst dose photocatalytic degradation decreases with increase in dye concentration the opposite effect is attributed to first more number of dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of catalyst as the concentration of the dye increases second the generation of hydroxyl radicals is reduced as the active sites are occupied by the dye molecules and finally the mean free path of the light in the solution decreases 56 fig 8 b represents the effect of both dye concentration and reaction time on safranin o degradation it is important from both mechanistic and application point of view to predicting the dependence of the photocatalytic reaction rate on the dye concentration it is generally known that the rate of degradation increases with increase in dye concentration to a certain level and further increase in dye concentration leads to opposite effect 57 and it could be due to the lack of available active sites required for the high dye concentration it concludes that as the concentration of the dye increases more number of dye molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst as a result the requirement of the reactive species such as oḣ and o2 needed for the degradation of the dye also increases for a constant catalyst dose and reaction time the formation of oḣ and o2 on the surface of catalyst remains constant hence the available hydroxyl radicals are inadequate for the degradation of the dye at higher concentrations therefore the degradation efficiency decreases with increase in dye concentration furthermore the absorption of photon by safranin o dye itself reduces the production of hydroxyl radicals on the surface of catalyst moreover degradation intensity also related to irradiation intensity as the radiation increases degradation of dye also increase 58 thus at higher dye concentration degradation decreases at sufficiently long distances from the light source due to the retarding of the penetration of light hence it is confirmed that as the initial dye concentration increases the requirement of catalyst surface needed for the degradation also increases 59 in addition degradation of safranin o increases with increase in reaction time fig 8 c finally shows the effect of catalyst dose and reaction time on the degradation of safranin o dye degradation efficiency increases with increase in reaction time whereas it decreases with increase in catalyst dose this may be due to the turbidity of the suspension at a higher amount of catalyst 3 5 determination of optimal condition for photocatalytic degradation of dyes the main objective of the optimization in this work is to effectively obtain the optimum values of variables for photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the dye based on the experimental results by using numerical optimization methods in the design expert 7 1 software the desired goals for all the variables are chosen in the experimental ranges and these are the amount of titania coated silica nanoparticles 50 100mg initial dye concentration 10 40mg l and the reaction time 10 20min the optimum values of the variables for the maximum decolourization efficiency were found to be 89 80mg x 1 17 61mg l x 2 and 12min x 3 respectively shown in table 4 using these values we have degraded the safranin o dye analytically and the degradation was 93 29 these results confirm that the rsm for the decolourization efficiency is validated and can be successfully used in future studies 3 6 reusability study in order to make the degradation process more economical and feasible potentiality of regeneration of and reusability of titania coated silica nanoparticle were studied it is crucial to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst for various applications to verify the reusability of the catalyst repeated experiments were carried out for degradation of safranin o after the completion of every cycle the solution containing dye and catalyst were centrifuged and washed off with deionized water for 3 4 times to regenerate the catalyst the catalyst was dried in an oven at 150 c for 3h and it was kept for reuse in next cycle fig 9 shows the five cycles of degradation of dye using photocatalyst under uv light irradiation for 20min the results indicated that the capacity of the dye decreased with increase in the number of cycles and at the end of the fifth cycle 82 of the degradation was obtained for the dye molecules therefore titania coated silica nanoparticles is a good reusable catalyst and could be successfully used for the degradation of dye molecules from water and wastewater 3 7 reaction mechanism of the photocatalyst pure tio2 nanoparticles exhibited a poor photocatalytic activity under uv light in comparison with titania coated silica nanoparticles for safranin o degradation the activity of photocatalytic decolourization reaction depends on various factors such as the adsorption of dye molecules at the surface of the catalyst specific surface area of the catalyst particles size crystallinity and electron hole recombination rate 60 irradiation of uv light on tio2 particles results in the promotion of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of the particle the consequence of this process is a region of positive charge called as a hole h in the valance band and a free electron e in the conduction band this h can react with surface bound hydroxyl group oh to form hydroxyl radicals oh furthermore the excited electron e then reacts with oxygen molecules to form superoxide o2 the final product of the reduction is commonly hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 hydroxyl radicals and superoxides are known to be powerful oxidizing agents and on this property they can react with organic pollutants adsorbed onto the catalyst surface during the photocatalytic process typical mechanism of the degradation process includes t i o 2 h v h e e o 2 o 2 o 2 2 h e o h o h h 2 o h o h h o h h o h o 2 s o d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s o h s o d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s in this work we found that the degradation of safranin o of pure tio2 was lower as compared to titania coated silica nanoparticles this may be due to the higher surface area of silica nanoparticle the degradation mechanism of the safranin o dye has been shown in fig 10 3 8 comparative study the comparative study for decolourization of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticles and other photocatalyst are given in table 5 from table 5 it was confirmed that the degradation efficiency of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticles are greater than zns tio2 bi2o3 agbr biobr hybrid material and natao3 la powder 61 66 and further implied that the catalyst studied in this work has the potential to degrade the organic pollutants from aqueous solutions 4 conclusions titania coated silica nanoparticles were successfully prepared by a nanoparticle encapsulation method synthesized catalyst was characterized with several characterization techniques such ft ir xrd fesem n2 adsorption desorption and zeta potential measurements for the first time the response surface methodology was applied to optimize the parameters in the photocatalytic degradation of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticle a quadratic model represents the functional relationship between the degradation of dye and three independent variables catalyst dose dye concentration and reaction time among all the parameters in the experimental design the catalyst dose played the most important role to influence the degradation activity meanwhile other two parameters such as dye concentration and reaction time also showed the influence to the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst under the optimized conditions of 89 80mg g catalyst dose 17 61mg l initial dye concentration and 12min the degradation efficiency of safranin o approached 93 29 regression coefficient r2 0 9983 of experimental

past decades water pollution caused by organic dyes produced from textile and other industrial processes have been attracted much attention due to a considerable damage to human beings and aquatic animals these organic dyes result in high chemical oxygen demand cod bad smell and mainly are responsible for the colouration of wastewaters 1 2 among many dyes that are applied in manufactured products safranin o so must be highlighted safranin o is a basic dye and is widely used for food coloring additive a dye for silk jute leather wool cotton paper and also in manufacturing of paints and printing inks 3 5 various physical chemical and biological techniques have applied for treatment of dye containing wastewater such as incineration biological treatment ozonation adsorption on solid phases etc 6 11 though the above mentioned methods work well in some instances these methods have some limitations like production of toxic volatiles non degradable sludge and bad smell 12 14 to eliminate these disadvantageous and adverse effects created by in situ products the heterogeneous photocatalysis became an elegant alternative for degradation of organic dyes 15 16 in contrast to the traditional methods photocatalytic technique in wastewater treatment is superior due to quick oxidation no formation of polycyclic products and oxidation of pollutants in the ppb range 17 18 by the way the photocatalysis may be defined as a process in which a semiconductor material absorbs energy of light more than or equal to its band gap thereby generating electrons and holes that can further generate free radicals in the system to oxidize the substrate 19 many photocatalysts have been synthesized and employed to degrade organic pollutants such as zno nb2o5 sno2 ni2o3 bi2o3 al2o3 tio2 etc 20 26 among these catalysts tio2 is widely used as a photocatalyst due to its high potential in reducing environmental contaminant by decomposing organic and inorganic pollutants because of its wide band gap chemical stability nontoxicity and low cost 27 29 however there are several drawbacks associated with the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 a key challenge of photocatalysis in the application of these nanoparticles is the agglomeration which can cause the deactivation of the catalysts and separation furthermore owing to thermally unstable they can undergo phase transformation and crystallite growth at high temperature these process leads to a reduction in the surface area 30 several attempts have been made to overcome these problems by doping with different metals and non metals such as ag pd sn c n etc 31 35 though the doping increased active surface area dramatically the problem of separation of catalyst is still a major concern recently researchers focused on the synthesis of concentric multilayer semiconductor nanoparticles known as core shell nanoparticles 36 core shell nanoparticles have gained great interest due to their improved chemical and physical properties as compared to the counterpart studies moreover the titania morphologies can be tailored by loading titania on inert supports like zeolites glass fibers and beads carbon fibers alumina and silica in the advanced photocatalytic degradation of pollutants among these supporting materials mesoporous silica have recently attracted much attention for promising application such as catalysis separations drug delivery and microelectronics due to its high surface area 37 38 furthermore besides being silica has no absorption in uv range it is easy to synthesize mesoporous silica with a high specific surface area and pore volume the advantages of titania coated silica materials are high specific surface areas large pore volumes and narrow pore size distribution and high thermal stability due to these properties the titania coated silica materials exhibit higher absorption capacity and better photocatalytic oxidation of various organic pollutants in spite of these advantages it is still a challenge to search for new and better techniques for large scale synthesis of sio2 tio2 core shell photocatalysts with high surface area controlled pore size and morphology traditional synthetic methods involves the deposition of metal precursors onto high surface area supports for synthesis of supported nanoparticle catalysts followed by various thermal activation treatments the uniform distribution of nanoparticles and the degree of dispersion of nanoparticles on the support are each highly dependent on the ph and concentration of the precursor solution type of the oxide support and calcination temperature in addition these methods often provide limited control over the composition and structures of supported nanoparticle catalyst which often leads to significant compositional non uniformity from particle to particles in order to address these issues we fabricated titania coated silica nanoparticles following the nanoparticle encapsulation method in this method titania was incorporated into pre synthesized silica nanoparticles by sol gel method this route provides an unconventional method of designing supported nanoparticle catalysts through a rational chemical approach which gives well dispersion of tio2 nanoparticles within high surface area silica supports and good control over the size composition and internal structure of the nanoparticles among the various techniques available for the synthesis of core shell nanoparticle catalysts the process of entrapping the pre synthesized nanoparticles into an inorganic matrix by the sol gel method is an interesting route 39 this method takes advantage of the large number of synthetic solution protocols that have been developed to carefully control nanoparticle size shape and composition so far the synthesis of titania coated silica nanoparticles using the encapsulation method has not been studied in detail the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation depends on several parameters such as the catalyst dose initial dye concentration the reaction time ph of the solution the molecular structure of the dye used etc in the conventional methods experiments were carried out by one at a time sensitivity experiments which leads to unpredictable number of experiments to overcome this problem with considerable accuracy models such as design expert de are employed for obtaining the optimized conditions with the less time and reducing chemical cost among various experimental design methodologies response surface method rsm is efficient and can measure the relationship among the controllable input parameters and to obtain response surfaces 40 rsm has the potential to estimate linear interaction and quadratic effects of the factors and it can predict model for the response it can also analyse the process and gives the results faster than the conventional one factor at a time approach 41 the experimental data required are reliant on the chosen design central composite or box behnken designs 42 the design technique for rsm is as follows i performing a bunch of runs of experiments for adequate and dependable measurement of the response of interest ii emerging a mathematical model of the second order response surface with the best fit iii determining the best set of experimental parameters which can produce a maximum value of response iv representing the interactive effects of process parameters through two and three dimensional plots 43 the present work reports the novel technique for synthesis of titania coated silica nanocomposite with high surface area and high thermal stability 900 c i e nanoparticle encapsulation method which provides better control over nanoparticles size and structure the synthesized novel photocatalyst was used for photodegradation of safranin o dye which is phenazine dye widely used in textile industry this is for the first time the experimental data has been validated by theoretical modeling with response surface methodology rsm to optimize the degradation process of safranin o dye using titania coated silica nanocomposite which has not been studied yet the variable factors investigated were the catalyst dose initial dye concentration and reaction time the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was checked by a uv vis spectrophotometer the results of our optimization demonstrate that the rsm can be used readily to determine the optimal conditions for the degradation of safranin o dye 2 experimental 2 1 materials cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab tetraethyl orthosilicate teos and titanium tetraisopropoxide ti och ch3 2 4 were obtained from sigma aldrich whereas degussa p25 methanol ethanol sodium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide ammonium nitrate and safranin o so were obtained from himedia all chemicals employed for this experiments are of analytical grade and were used without any further purification 2 2 synthesis of silica nanoparticles in this synthesis 0 29g of ctab was dissolved in 0 512m 150ml of ammonium hydroxide solution at 40 c then 2 5ml of 0 88m ethanolic teos was added to the solution under vigorous stirring after 1h the solution was aged at 40 c for 18h in static conditions so it has become colloid the synthesized colloid then washed off the ctab with 50ml of ethanolic ammonium nitrate solution twice to make sure the complete removal 2 3 synthesis of titania coated silica nanoparticles 0 25ml 5vol of water was added to the prepared silica nanoparticles in a beaker and stirred 2 02ml of ti och ch3 2 4 is taken as the titanium precursor and was added to 5ml of freshly dried methanol using hot molecular sieves this was then added to the beaker and gel was formed within 10 15min this was then kept for aging overnight and followed by drying at the temperature between 150 and 200 c for 1 2 h the dried gel was then powdered using mortar and pestle and calcined in air at a temperature of 900 c for 3h 2 4 characterizations the ft ir spectroscopy perkin elmer was used to determine the bonding between titania and silica in nanocomposites the crystal structure of the synthesized catalyst was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd of rigaku japan ultima iv with cukα source the size morphology and structure of the nanoparticle were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem subsequently the chemical composition of the prepared nanoparticle was measured by edx performed in nova nanosem fei the surface area was calculated by using the bet brunauer emmet teller equation in quantachrome autosorb iq model asiqm0000 4 the pore size distribution and pore volume were obtained by applying the bjh barrett joyner halenda method the samples were degassed in vacuum at 150 c all the samples were dispersed into deionized water and the zeta potential measurements were taken by zeta sizer nano malvern zs 90 2 5 photocatalytic study of safranin o dye using titania coated silica nanoparticles the photocatalytic studies were conducted in a reaction chamber 50cm x 50cm x 50cm containing an artificial uv light 15w bulb of philips the distance between the lamp and the surface of the solution was about 15cm the photocatalytic degradation of so dye was measured by adding a known amount of catalyst to the dye solution prepared in di water the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30min to obtain an equilibrium photocatalyst dye solution from this mixture a small quantity was then taken out at regular intervals with a syringe and was centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10min to remove the catalyst the supernatant was taken and filled in a quartz cuvette without dilution and was then studied using uv vis spectroscopy to calculate the concentration of so dye 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology characterization in this work silica nanoparticle was prepared as discussed in the experimental section later on the nanoparticle encapsulation method was employed for the fabrication of titania coated silica nanoparticle the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized material was examined by employing safranin o dye as a model pollutant safranin o dye belongs to quinone imine class which is widely used in textile industry safranin o dye discharged from textile industry poses a big threat to our environment since the dye is known for its carcinogenic nature even in trace amounts the presence of various chemical and physical properties of the catalyst was then characterized by different characterization techniques ft ir spectra of titania coated silica nanoparticles are shown in fig 1 the presence of water is evidenced by the appearance of the oh stretching at 3440cm 1 the peak at 1627cm 1 indicates the bending vibration of si oh bond the presence of hydroxyl ions on the surface of the catalyst is advantageous for the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because it offers higher capacity for oxygen adsorption 44 in fig 1 c new distinct and sharp peaks around 1087cm 1 and 804cm 1 ascribed to asymmetric stretching and symmetric bending of si o si vibration respectively an absorption peak at 955cm 1 is attributed to the si o ti group in titania coated silica nanoparticle indicating the formation of si o ti bond 45 the formation of si o ti bond arises from two possibilities first may be due to the substitution of small amount of ti iv for si iv in the frame work of mesoporous silica and second may be due to the connection of embedded titania particles to the mesoporous silica matrix through the si o ti bonds in the interface between silica and titania 46 the alkyl groups have been removed by calcination and it is evident by the absence of the c h peaks in the ftir spectra of titania coated silica nanoparticles the x ray diffraction patterns xrd of titania coated silica nanoparticles is found to possess a fine nano crystalline titania anatase phase which is shown in fig 2 the diffraction pattern having a peak at 2θ values of 25 3 37 8 48 0 53 9 55 1 62 7 70 2 75 2 correspond respectively to 101 004 200 105 211 204 220 215 crystal planes which can be indexed to the anatase phase of tio2 which matches well to the reported jcpds data card no 71 1166 during hydrothermal treatment tio2 changes its phase to anatase by dissolution and reprecipitation processes in which transiently dissolved titanate species rapidly nucleated to form nanocrystalline structure because of the high reactivity of the hydrothermal system presence of silica improved the thermal stability of titania as a result very few rutile phase has occurred at high calcination temperature 900 c it is observed that the electron transport is faster in the anatase phase of tio2 than the rutile phase of tio2 leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance 47 the small hump located at 22 can be assigned to the characteristic peak of amorphous silica jcpds card no 49 1711 in addition the presence of sio2 stabilized the anatase phase of tio2 even at 900 c 48 49 the average crystallite size of tio2 nanoparticles were calculated for 101 crystal plane using the scherer equation r m k λ β1 2 cosθ and is found to be 6nm the detailed size and morphology of the titania coated silica nanoparticle further investigated by the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and corresponding edx spectrum which is shown in fig 3 a c the fesem image fig 3 a shows that the pure silica nanoparticles were intact spheres with the smooth surface without aggregation further it was found from fesem images that the silica particles preserved their particulate form after calcination at 900 c and the sio2 core was successfully coated with a thin layer of tio2 with several nanometers resulting in a rough surface morphology inset fig 3 b a quantitative edx spectrum was taken to determine the elemental composition of titania coated silica nanoparticle which is shown in fig 3 c from the figure it confirmed that there are no other elemental impurities present in the catalyst furthermore the si and ti elements were calculated according to the data of atomic percent and found to be 39 5 and 2 0 respectively fig 4 shows the typical n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of sio2 tio2 nanoparticles the isotherm represents the type iv isotherm according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac nomenclature indicating the presence of mesopores in the composite which is related to capillary condensation associated with the pore channels by analysing the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm it was found that the catalyst has a high surface area of about 725m2 g 1 and pore volume of 0 142ccg 1 the bjh pore size distributions of the titania coated silica nanoparticles is shown in the inset of fig 4 the sample has a narrow pore size distribution and the average pore size is 3nm implying that the catalyst was mesoporous in nature in order to have a proper coating of titania on silica the dispersion stabilities of the silica and titania are of high significance to prevent homo coagulation to achieve hetero coagulation surface charges are needed to be monitored via zeta potential measurements and the results are shown in fig 5 also it can be seen that the zeta potential decrease as the ph of the solution increases and the order of decreases zeta potential is as pure silica nanoparticles titania nanoparticles and titania coated silica nanoparticles when the ph is higher than the isoelectric point iep due to the deprotonation the surface and therefore the zeta potential of all above materials become negative it was observed that the iep of the titania coated silica nanoparticles ranged between those of pure silica nanoparticle iep at ph 3 8 and pure titania nanoparticles iep at ph 6 2 this confirmed that the titania particles got adsorbed on the silica surface and formed a non complete non continuous shell which was previously confirmed by fesem where the surface morphology of titania coated silica nanoparticle is rough due to titania particles a similar type of observation was found in the literature 50 before employing an experimental design it was necessary to study the extents of photocatalytic degradation of safranin o dye fig 6 shows the photocatalytic degradation of the safranin o dye using p25 degussa pure titania and titania coated silica nanoparticles under three different conditions catalyst dose 100mg initial dye concentration 10mg l and reaction time 20min after 20min the concentration of safranin o dye on p25 and pure titania did not decrease much with prolonged uv irradiation whereas titania coated silica nanoparticle showed enhanced degradation efficiency this indicates that the affinity for safranin o dye after deposition of tio2 nanoparticle on silica leads to the higher surface area which could be responsible for the higher catalytic activity of the catalyst 3 2 experimental design response surface methodology is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques which is useful for developing improving and optimizing the processes the use of statistical experimental design techniques in the photocatalytic process can result in the requirement of fewer resources such as time reagents and experimental work in the present study of central composite design which is a widely used form of rsm was used for optimization of photodegradation of safranin o dyes and three main factors chosen were catalyst dose mg g x 1 initial dye concentration mg l x 2 and reaction time min x 3 as shown in table 1 3 3 ccd model and residuals analysis the 3 factor ccd matrix and experimental results obtained from design expert 7 1 software for the photocatalytic degradation of safranin o is given in table 2 the second order polynomial response expression in eq 1 was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables 1 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b 12 x 1 x 2 b 13 x 1 x 3 b 23 x 2 x 3 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 b 33 x 3 2 where y is the response b0 is the constant b1 b2 and b3 are the linear coefficients b12 b13 and b23 are the cross product coefficients b11 b22 and b33 are the quadratic coefficients based on these results an empirical relationship between the response and independent variables parameters are expressed by the second order polynomial equation which consists of 10 statistically significant coefficients 2 y 93 13 8 33 x 1 3 97 x 2 2 28 x 3 0 54 x 1 x 2 0 54 x 1 x 3 0 29 x 2 x 3 9 65 x 1 2 1 11 x 2 2 1 50 x 3 2 where y is the response variable of degradation efficiency of safranin o the x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent three experimental factors viz catalyst dose initial dye concentration and reaction time respectively the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of safranin o by titania coated silica nanoparticles with varied parameters within the selected range has been predicted by eq 1 and the analytical and predicted values are presented in table 2 these results indicated good agreement between the experimental and predicted values of degradation efficiency of dyes this can further be explained by plotting the experimental degradation efficiency versus predicted values which is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is confirmed that all values are well distributed along the straight line indicating that there is no non normality this validates that the established model is appropriate to explain the range of studied moreover the predicted r2 correlation coefficient is very close to the corresponding r2 value of analytical experiments which is shown in table 3 to evaluate the fitness significance and adequacy of the model for this particular study analysis of variance anova has been applied to find the effects of each of the variable and interaction effect of parameters on the response table 3 the f value for the model was calculated to be 638 22 with lower probability 0 0001 indicating that the model is highly significant there was only a 0 01 possibility that the model f value could happen due to noise the model p value was 0 0001 which further confirmed that the model is statistically significant whereas the value greater than 0 1000 indicated the model terms are not significant the lack of fit value of 1 22 implied that the lack of fit is not significant relative to pure error the non significant lack of fit confirmed the good predictability of the model the predicted r squared of 0 9913 was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r squared of 0 9967 confirming good predictability of the model it observed that among the three parameter studied the catalyst dose x 1 had the largest effect on the degradation of safranin o dye to the maximum f value followed in order by initial dye concentration and reaction time 3 4 analysis of contour and response surface plots by using the design expert 7 1 software three dimensional 3d surface can be introduced as graphical representation of the regression equation to determine the optimum values of variables and also their corresponding two dimensional 2d contour plots were fabricated these 3d and 2d plots are widely used to achieve better understandings of the interactions between variables within the range 51 52 the interactions between the three independent variables and the response are shown in fig 10 the circular nature of the contour plots shows that the interaction is negligible whereas the elliptical contour plots shows significant interaction between the corresponding variables 53 in each plot the effects of two parameters were varied within the experimental ranges and the other parameters fixed to zero level fig 8 a shows the effect of catalyst dose and initial dye concentration on the degradation of safranin o dye from aqueous solution catalyst dose is an important factor that significantly influence the photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules from the figure it is concluded that the degradation of dye increases as catalyst dose increases this increase is attributed to several factors such as active sites on the surface of nanoparticle the penetration of uv light into the aqueous solution of mixture of the catalyst and dye 54 for instance the greater amount of photocatalyst creates more number of active radicals by absorbing the larger amount of photons that result in high efficiency of degradation 55 in contrast to catalyst dose photocatalytic degradation decreases with increase in dye concentration the opposite effect is attributed to first more number of dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of catalyst as the concentration of the dye increases second the generation of hydroxyl radicals is reduced as the active sites are occupied by the dye molecules and finally the mean free path of the light in the solution decreases 56 fig 8 b represents the effect of both dye concentration and reaction time on safranin o degradation it is important from both mechanistic and application point of view to predicting the dependence of the photocatalytic reaction rate on the dye concentration it is generally known that the rate of degradation increases with increase in dye concentration to a certain level and further increase in dye concentration leads to opposite effect 57 and it could be due to the lack of available active sites required for the high dye concentration it concludes that as the concentration of the dye increases more number of dye molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst as a result the requirement of the reactive species such as oḣ and o2 needed for the degradation of the dye also increases for a constant catalyst dose and reaction time the formation of oḣ and o2 on the surface of catalyst remains constant hence the available hydroxyl radicals are inadequate for the degradation of the dye at higher concentrations therefore the degradation efficiency decreases with increase in dye concentration furthermore the absorption of photon by safranin o dye itself reduces the production of hydroxyl radicals on the surface of catalyst moreover degradation intensity also related to irradiation intensity as the radiation increases degradation of dye also increase 58 thus at higher dye concentration degradation decreases at sufficiently long distances from the light source due to the retarding of the penetration of light hence it is confirmed that as the initial dye concentration increases the requirement of catalyst surface needed for the degradation also increases 59 in addition degradation of safranin o increases with increase in reaction time fig 8 c finally shows the effect of catalyst dose and reaction time on the degradation of safranin o dye degradation efficiency increases with increase in reaction time whereas it decreases with increase in catalyst dose this may be due to the turbidity of the suspension at a higher amount of catalyst 3 5 determination of optimal condition for photocatalytic degradation of dyes the main objective of the optimization in this work is to effectively obtain the optimum values of variables for photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the dye based on the experimental results by using numerical optimization methods in the design expert 7 1 software the desired goals for all the variables are chosen in the experimental ranges and these are the amount of titania coated silica nanoparticles 50 100mg initial dye concentration 10 40mg l and the reaction time 10 20min the optimum values of the variables for the maximum decolourization efficiency were found to be 89 80mg x 1 17 61mg l x 2 and 12min x 3 respectively shown in table 4 using these values we have degraded the safranin o dye analytically and the degradation was 93 29 these results confirm that the rsm for the decolourization efficiency is validated and can be successfully used in future studies 3 6 reusability study in order to make the degradation process more economical and feasible potentiality of regeneration of and reusability of titania coated silica nanoparticle were studied it is crucial to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst for various applications to verify the reusability of the catalyst repeated experiments were carried out for degradation of safranin o after the completion of every cycle the solution containing dye and catalyst were centrifuged and washed off with deionized water for 3 4 times to regenerate the catalyst the catalyst was dried in an oven at 150 c for 3h and it was kept for reuse in next cycle fig 9 shows the five cycles of degradation of dye using photocatalyst under uv light irradiation for 20min the results indicated that the capacity of the dye decreased with increase in the number of cycles and at the end of the fifth cycle 82 of the degradation was obtained for the dye molecules therefore titania coated silica nanoparticles is a good reusable catalyst and could be successfully used for the degradation of dye molecules from water and wastewater 3 7 reaction mechanism of the photocatalyst pure tio2 nanoparticles exhibited a poor photocatalytic activity under uv light in comparison with titania coated silica nanoparticles for safranin o degradation the activity of photocatalytic decolourization reaction depends on various factors such as the adsorption of dye molecules at the surface of the catalyst specific surface area of the catalyst particles size crystallinity and electron hole recombination rate 60 irradiation of uv light on tio2 particles results in the promotion of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of the particle the consequence of this process is a region of positive charge called as a hole h in the valance band and a free electron e in the conduction band this h can react with surface bound hydroxyl group oh to form hydroxyl radicals oh furthermore the excited electron e then reacts with oxygen molecules to form superoxide o2 the final product of the reduction is commonly hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 hydroxyl radicals and superoxides are known to be powerful oxidizing agents and on this property they can react with organic pollutants adsorbed onto the catalyst surface during the photocatalytic process typical mechanism of the degradation process includes t i o 2 h v h e e o 2 o 2 o 2 2 h e o h o h h 2 o h o h h o h h o h o 2 s o d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s o h s o d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s in this work we found that the degradation of safranin o of pure tio2 was lower as compared to titania coated silica nanoparticles this may be due to the higher surface area of silica nanoparticle the degradation mechanism of the safranin o dye has been shown in fig 10 3 8 comparative study the comparative study for decolourization of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticles and other photocatalyst are given in table 5 from table 5 it was confirmed that the degradation efficiency of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticles are greater than zns tio2 bi2o3 agbr biobr hybrid material and natao3 la powder 61 66 and further implied that the catalyst studied in this work has the potential to degrade the organic pollutants from aqueous solutions 4 conclusions titania coated silica nanoparticles were successfully prepared by a nanoparticle encapsulation method synthesized catalyst was characterized with several characterization techniques such ft ir xrd fesem n2 adsorption desorption and zeta potential measurements for the first time the response surface methodology was applied to optimize the parameters in the photocatalytic degradation of safranin o using titania coated silica nanoparticle a quadratic model represents the functional relationship between the degradation of dye and three independent variables catalyst dose dye concentration and reaction time among all the parameters in the experimental design the catalyst dose played the most important role to influence the degradation activity meanwhile other two parameters such as dye concentration and reaction time also showed the influence to the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst under the optimized conditions of 89 80mg g catalyst dose 17 61mg l initial dye concentration and 12min the degradation efficiency of safranin o approached 93 29 regression coefficient r2 0 9983 of experimental

8819,the advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies however there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures to address this we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines the quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time although opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non existent flows e g discharges initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals use efficiency and discharges between mining operations further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale keywords mining corporate sustainability reporting water withdrawals water consumption water recycling water discharge 1 introduction the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs provide an ambitious set of targets for improving environmental sustainability economic development social cohesion and human development by 2030 42 meeting these goals will require improvements in the way that water resources are utilised managed and protected for instance sdg6 is focused on clean water and sanitation and within this there are targets for improving access to safe drinking water improving water quality increasing water use efficiency capacity building and involving local communities in water management issues there are many opportunities for the mining industry to contribute towards this 43 such as through implementing sustainable water management practices that ensure shared benefits for local communities 46 however understanding these contributions requires the development of rigorous assessment methods and data sources so that rates of progress in the mining industry can be measured mining and mineral processing operations have the potential to substantially impact local hydrology and water quality the magnitude and nature of these impacts are highly site specific due to a variety of underlying factors 30 mining and mineral processing operations must adapt their mineral separation and metal production processes based upon the physical and geochemical nature of the ore being mined resulting in differences in the water required for ore processing the approaches adopted for storing and managing large scale mine waste e g waste rock and tailings can significantly alter mine site water balances and the optimal approach is dependent upon local factors such as site topography furthermore the hydrological and climate contexts that the mining industry operates within and must adapt to are diverse 31 33 this requires further tailoring of site processes and infrastructure to manage associated risks such as flooding or the potential for water shortages 8 18 additionally the regulatory environments that dictate the ability of mining operations to access use and discharge water as well as transparency requirements related to this are also diverse across countries and states 20 40 41 the combination of these factors results in large variability in the water use efficiency of mining operations and their hydrological impacts 25 because of this variability it is very difficult to fairly benchmark water use efficiency in the mining industry and to determine what is an acceptable level of water use or water use impact for any individual mining and mineral processing operation given the potential for significant hydrological impacts mining companies will often invest considerable resources into developing water and environmental management strategies so that potential impacts to surrounding industry and community stakeholders as well as the environment are reduced or avoided when mining companies fail to effectively implement or communicate these strategies then a mining project may lose its so called social license to operate resulting in substantial opposition to the mining project by communities governments or competing sectors such as agriculture 14 37 45 to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders and government regulatory authorities mining companies have become more transparent regarding their water management practices over the past two decades the mining industry has increasingly made public disclosures of water use as part of environmental management and corporate sustainability reporting these disclosures represent a valuable data source to improve understanding of the interactions between the mining industry and water resources the reporting of water use in the mining industry has become increasingly standardised over time through the development of industry specific water accounting schemes the minerals council of australia mca developed the water accounting framework for the minerals industry wafmi to provide greater rigour and consistency for mines that report to schemes such as the global reporting initiative 21 more recently the international council on mining metals icmm has provided additional guidance particularly as it relates to assessment and reporting of local water risks 15 as this guidance and standardisation is implemented throughout the mining industry it is anticipated that there will be an improvement in the transparency quality and consistency of mining industry water use disclosures through time previously some compilation and quantitative analysis of the water use data reported by the mining industry has been undertaken by several authors mudd 25 conducted a preliminary assessment of water use disclosures within sustainability reporting and confirmed that lower ore grades are generally associated with higher water requirements per unit of production additionally it was observed that there was considerable inconsistency in the metrics and communication of water use data between mining companies glaister and mudd 9 assessed water use disclosures of platinum group metal mining companies northey et al 28 compiled data from sustainability reporting to evaluate the variability in water use requirements of copper operations gunson 12 also compiled a dataset of reported mine water use to evaluate the water use intensity and global water withdrawals associated with non fuel mineral production for the years 2006 2009 buchspies et al 3 compiled water withdrawal and recycling data for platinum group element production in south africa beyond this several authors have performed assessments of the types of water use information being disclosed by the mining industry and the general compliance of the mining industry with sustainability reporting standards such as the global reporting initiative 1 2 20 although these studies have assessed various aspects of mining company water use reporting and the data contained therein the scope of analysis and the extent of industry coverage included within these studies has been limited many studies have been limited to assessing only a geographic or commodity sub sector of the mining industry additionally many studies have only compiled data for a single aspect of mine water interactions most commonly water abstractions or withdrawals by mining operations thus the large amount of data publicly reported by mining companies on other aspects of water use such as internal reuse efficiency or discharges has largely remained unassessed efforts to more systematically compile and analyse this data would provide a significant opportunity to improve our understanding of how water use varies across the mining industry the overall magnitude and impacts of this water use and the potential opportunities for improving water management outcomes in the mining industry to facilitate improved compilation of this data this study aimed to 1 establish a database structure to enable systematic compilation of public water use disclosures by the mining industry 2 test the database structure through the compilation of an initial dataset 3 analyse compiled data to understand trends in industry reporting and the variability of mine site water balances and 4 provide recommendations for further work to better understand and evaluate the interactions of the mining industry with water resources 2 methods and data sources to support future assessments of water use efficiency in the mining industry and the potential environmental or societal impacts of this we have compiled a comprehensive database of publicly disclosed water use statistics for the mining industry the reported water use database was developed in two stages first water accounting standards for the minerals industry were reviewed to identify suitable data categories for describing water flows between mining operations and surrounding environments as well as possible internal flows within mining operations secondly these data categories were used to classify data reported in mining company sustainability and environmental compliance management reporting enabling a detailed database of mine water disclosures to be developed finally an assessment of reporting trends and the temporal variability of mine site water balances was performed to better understand data availability and the potential applications of this data to advance research and industry understanding 2 1 water use reporting in the mining industry the mining industry has increasingly reported water use statistics within corporate sustainability and environmental management reporting 36 these disclosures may include mandatory reporting such as environmental compliance reporting to regulatory authorities that may be made public in some jurisdictions in other cases mining companies voluntarily disclose water use data through initiatives such as corporate sustainability reporting and market disclosures 20 most existing studies that assess these activities have focused upon the degree of compliance with the various reporting standards that guide these disclosures such as the global reporting initiative 7 17 however there has been limited analysis of the actual water use data being communicated within these reports the global reporting initiative gri provides a framework for corporate sustainability reporting to aide in the communication of a company s social economic and environmental performance 10 despite being a voluntary initiative there has been strong uptake of gri based sustainability reporting by major mining companies 7 36 the gri has evolved over time to meet the needs of stakeholders and to improve the meaningfulness or requirements of reporting indicators as a result reporting supplements specifically for the mining industry have been made available to improve the quality of disclosures being made by the sector 11 the main indicators of relevance to water related issues under the reporting standard gri4 include 10 g4 en8 total water withdrawal by source g4 en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water g4 en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused g4 en22 en21 in gri3 total water discharge by quality and destination g4 en26 identity size protected status and biodiversity value of water bodies and related habitats significantly affected by the organisations discharges of water and runoff typically mining operations will be subject to environmental and permitting regulations that require them to submit compliance planning or management reports to government authorities and regulatory bodies in some jurisdictions these reports are made public either voluntarily by the company or as a requirement of their permitting 20 the contents of this reporting are often highly site specific as they are tailored heavily to understanding the impacts of the mine in the context of the surrounding natural or regulatory environment often these reports contain information on water quality monitoring groundwater abstractions and impacts to aquifers surface water withdrawals or the management of major site infrastructure such as tailings dams in this article and the compiled database these forms of reporting are referred to as environmental management reports previously there have been weaknesses and inconsistencies identified in mining industry water related gri disclosures 25 to address this the mining industry has developed industry specific water accounting and reporting standards to improve the consistency and rigour of information being communicated through gri based sustainability reporting and other stakeholder engagement processes the water accounting framework for the minerals industry wafmi was developed by the sustainable minerals institute university of queensland for the minerals council of australia 21 the wafmi provides a framework for mining and mineral processing operations to enable consistent estimation and recording of water flows throughout the site and to from surrounding environments this accounting framework enables more standardised communication of water use data by mining companies and is sufficiently flexible to enable implementation by a mining operation regardless of local hydrologic or climatic factors 5 mca member companies were required to adopt the wafmi by 1 july 2015 22 more recently the international council on mining metals icmm released another guidance document for the industry a practical guide to consistent water reporting which is required to be implemented by icmm member companies by november 2018 15 the icmm s guidance document was heavily modelled upon the earlier wafmi although with some minor alterations of terminology and significant additional guidance on the assessment and communication of local water contexts and risks 2 2 database structure the database was structured to provide a flexible and accurate depiction of public water use disclosures made by the mining industry the database structure was developed through review of the data categories and water quality classifications provided by the wafmi 21 and the icmm s 15 guidance document as a significant proportion of mining industry water use reporting predates the development of these water accounting frameworks non complying reported data has been mapped to the closest equivalent data category given the historic variability and often unclear water use reporting practices of mining companies some data points required considerable judgement of the authors to assign a suitable data category in these cases the authors endeavoured to cross validate data points through comparison with data available for other data categories or time periods explanatory comments explaining decisions made were incorporated into the database as necessary 2 2 1 data categories there are a range of ways that mining and mineral processing operations interact with water resources the flows of water through an operation can be quite site specific depending upon the local hydrology management practices and processes employed on the site fortunately the wafmi and the icmm s guidance document outlines flexible water accounting categories that can be used by mining companies to consistently report water use data the various water use categories and definitions provided have been adapted to determine the main data categories included in our database the data categories used are shown in fig 1 with definitions for each data category provided in appendix a as can be seen there are four major classes of data categories defined to describe the interactions between mining mineral processing operations and water resources these are withdrawals internal use consumption and discharge within each of these major data classes an aggregation hierarchy exists reflecting the fact that reported data may only reflect a specific aspect of a mine s hydrological interactions so further sub classes are also used that reflect either the aggregate water flows to from a specific source or sink i e groundwater surface water marine water or third parties or that reflect a sub set of flows to each sources or sinks e g aquifer reinjection or seepage in this case an important distinction is made between water consumption and water use water consumption is the mode by which water is made unavailable to be returned to surrounding environments whereas water use is simply a reflection of the water inputs to site processes both consumptive and non consumptive uses of water are possible depending upon if the water is returned to the surrounding water sources the consumption categories reflect the ultimate destination of water that is not reused or discharged back into water resources or third parties 2 2 2 water quality categories water quality categories have been assigned in situations where the definitions provided by the mca 21 or icmm 15 s reporting standards were used further detail is provided in appendix a where reporting specifically makes a qualitative distinction between water quality such as potable fresh brackish impounded or poor quality then a judgement was made to assign a category based upon the likely equivalent water quality category under the mca 21 or icmm 15 reporting standards it should be noted that most of data reported by the industry does not indicate a water quality description or parameters specifically therefore in these cases the default water quality category applied to the data point is t total indicating that the data point is believed to represent all flow or volumes rather than a subset alternative water quality classification approaches are also possible which may be more relevant for an individual mine site s operation an example is provided by cocks et al 4 who describe a hierarchical classification approach developed for kalgoorlie consolidated gold mines kcgm the superpit and the boddington gold mine in australia in this case the potential water source and quality categories are highly tailored to the regional context of those mines and so there is detailed descriptors provided for different aquifer and water source characteristics however to ensure consistency with future industry reporting the water quality categories defined by the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 reporting standards were adopted 3 results and discussion the compiled database which we refer to as database of publicly reported water data by the mining industry v1 0 is available in the electronic supplementary material accompanying this article 3 1 extent and types of captured water use reporting from the water use reporting surveyed in this study it is clear that there are substantial amounts of water related data being disclosed by the mining industry in total 8314 data points were compiled from 359 mining company reports several examples of database entries are provided in table 1 table 2 shows the number of data points that were compiled for each data category the sources of these data i e environmental management reports or sustainability reports and the degree to which water quality classification was possible the breakdown of data sources was table 2 29 2451 of 8314 from environmental management reports 67 5587 of 8314 from gri based sustainability reports 3 277 of 8314 from non gri based sustainability reports when comparing the number of data points compiled for each data category substantially more data is reported by the industry for water withdrawals and the water inputs to processes both raw and worked water comparatively substantially less data is reported for volumes of water discharges modes of consumption i e evaporation tailings entrainment etc or other related metrics such as changes in on site water storage or local climatic factors due to this it is currently not possible to describe the complete water balance of most mining operations using publicly reported data generally this is only possible when companies have fully adopted and comply with either the wafmi mca 2014 or the icmm s water accounting guidelines newcrest mining ltd was one of the earliest adopters of the wafmi and this has resulted in consistent long term reporting of water balances for their mines in australia and papua new guinea which includes classification of water flows into discrete water quality categories as well as some assessment of data confidence or uncertainty it s unexpected that water discharge volumes were far more commonly reported in sustainability reports rather than environmental compliance reporting this appears to be because environmental compliance reports place a much greater emphasis on monitoring compliance with water quality targets at specified locations downstream of discharge points rather than the actual volumes of discharged water by comparison companies and sustainability reporting standards such as the gri appear to prioritise communicating volumetric measures with emphasis on water inputs rather than discharges or specific modes of consumption possibly this could be due to mining companies having a better understanding of their compliance with water withdrawal limits and water inputs to processes however they may have more limited understanding of the ultimate destination of water on their site and the specific modes of water consumption or losses occurring i e evaporation tailings entrainment seepage etc water quality classifications were also assigned to data points where possible the breakdown of assigned water quality classification was table 2 7 6 629 of 8314 were assigned category 1 near potable 5 4 447 of 8314 were assigned category 2 suitable for some uses 0 4 39 of 8314 were assigned category 3 unsuitable for most uses 0 9 76 of 8314 were assigned category n not applicable 83 7 6958 of 8314 were assigned category t total 2 0 166 of 8314 were assigned category u unknown the high proportion of data being assigned the default category t total is indicative of the fact that most companies don t specify water quality categories when reporting rather the presented data can just be assumed to be the total water flows volumes with no segmentation based upon quality however in several cases mining companies have defined their own water quality classifications that make interpretation more difficult for instance in rio tinto s reporting from 1997 to 2003 the term freshwater is defined as water with total dissolved solids tds of less than 1500 mg l some rio tinto reports from this era also specify impounded water and poor quality water however some reports don t specifically include reporting according to these additional classifications in these cases it is difficult to determine based upon the reporting whether the water use data being reported reflects that only fresh water was being used or whether there was also poorer quality water being used that went unreported most of the data captured was for individual mining operations however it is also very common for aggregated divisional or company totals to be reported often without the more detailed data for the individual operations the breakdown of data aggregation was table 3 12 9 1074 of 8314 were company totals 20 1 1673 of 8314 were divisional totals 67 0 5568 of 8314 were operational totals important information on the local context and potential impacts of water use are lost when aggregating water use data to divisional and company totals especially when a company s operations are not co located in the same hydrological region aggregation of data appears to be more common for larger companies that have mines located in multiple countries in these cases divisional totals commonly reflect either a commodity grouping e g iron ore copper or grouping by countries or regions e g north america there were also instances where data was reported for a mining operation however due to company mergers or asset sales a mine would subsequently be included in aggregated divisional reporting in these cases there can be discontinuities in the availability of water use data for mines due to the different reporting practices of the various operating companies the presentation of data and the ability to accurately record data points is dependent upon how the information is presented in company reports the breakdown of data disclosure type or estimation method was table 3 88 8 7380 of 8314 were directly reported values 7 3 606 of 8314 were reported within graphs without data labels 3 8 319 of 8314 were inferred or calculated from other data in the report 0 1 10 of 8314 were best estimates based upon the authors judgement graph readings inferences and estimates could be considered to have a slightly lower data quality than the data points sourced from numeric values in the text or tables of a report most of the reported data are for annual time periods and there are substantially less data available for sub annual timescales tables 3 and 4 the split was that 87 4 7270 of 8314 were reported for annual time periods 12 6 1045 of 8314 were reported for sub annual mostly monthly time periods in fact a large proportion of sub annual data are monthly data for bhp billiton s olympic dam mine site in south australia where bore water withdrawals wgb from the great artesian basin are reported on a monthly timescale monthly rainfall data was also reported for some mines over long periods of time some monthly data for rio tinto s oyu tolgoi mine in mongolia was also available for raw water use um worked water use uw evaporation vp and groundwater withdrawals wg the total water use by major data category over time are shown in table 4 and fig 2 most of the pre 2000 data are water use data it is quite possible that for this period water withdrawals were being reported as water use by several companies however it was not possible for authors to further distinguish between reported values and so the data descriptions presented by companies must be taken on face value table 5 provides an indication of the data coverage across countries and companies and the commodity groups represented coverage not shown due to limitations in reporting for aggregated divisions and minor co by production the initial data collection had a bias towards copper producing companies and those with operations in australia substantial additional data are available in the public reporting of mining and mineral production companies not included in this list it is therefore anticipated that the industry coverage of the water reporting dataset could be expanded considerably in the future by further surveying the reporting of additional mining companies the authors note that compiling data directly from industry reporting is an extremely time consuming task particularly due to the frequency of mergers and acquisitions in the industry that break reporting for individual mine sites across multiple companies so considerable effort and care is required to develop consistent long term datasets for individual mining operations 3 2 water use statistics the reported data provides a strong basis for establishing a deeper understanding of how the global mining industry interacts with and impacts water resources this includes developing an improved understanding of the potential magnitude of water consumption and use impacts how water balances of mining operations vary across regions and how the water consumption of mining operations can vary through time in response to changing mine conditions management decisions and local hydrology or climate water withdrawals use and discharges at mine sites over time are shown in fig 3 with summary statistics shown in table 6 these were developed through combination of the water related data with mine site production statistics that the authors have previously compiled e g 26 with some minor updates to increase coverage water withdrawals when normalised per tonne of ore mined or processed display several orders of magnitude of variability between mining operations with 90 of mining operations withdrawing between 0 13 and 17 29 m3 per tonne of ore processed even for the same mine site there can be significant variation in water withdrawals through time as shown in fig 4 where data has is expressed relative to the first year of reported data for each mine site this intra annual variability can also range to an order or two of magnitude mining operations can vary considerably in terms of their source of water therefore the variability shown for total water withdrawals is also reflected in the data available for surface water groundwater and third party water withdrawals fig 5 shows rates of groundwater withdrawals in relation to surface water withdrawals demonstrating that mines are very diverse in terms of their reliance on either surface water or groundwater withdrawals further investigation is required to determine whether the exact drivers of this but it is likely due to the substantial differences in local climates and groundwater and surface water availability in different mining regions the water use required for mining and mineral processing operations are constrained by the required processing conditions and ore throughput rates which is reflected in the lower apparent variability of total water use water use varies between 0 34 and 6 27 m3 per tonne ore processed for 90 of mining operations table 6 however the components of the total water use raw water and worked water display a much greater degree of variability figs 3 and 4 a key contributor to this variability is likely the influence of variability in local hydrology on the mining operations water balance as year to year variations in rainfall on site storage and regional water availability can significantly alter the potential water reuse or recycling rates achievable or desirable for instance during periods of low rainfall a mining operation may be forced to rely less on external water sources and draw down reserves of worked water from tailings storage facilities or worked water stores alternatively during periods of high rainfall a mining operation may have easier access to external surface water sources or be able to divert rainfall and surface run off to water storages for subsequent uses in site processes there are many potential variations to this depending upon local climate site water management objectives and infrastructure and site operation strategies 18 due to these factors water reuse efficiency varies substantially between mining operations as shown in fig 6 mining operations vary from sourcing process water almost entirely from reused or recycled water whereas other mine sites have very limited reuse of water and are sourcing water from external sources or the interception of rainfall or ground water on site although there is less discharge data available for mining operations mine sites specifically reporting zero discharges were excluded from figs 3 and 4 the data that are available suggest very high intra annual variability in discharge requirements again this is likely to be coupled to both operational and climatic factors throughout the life of a mining operation the morphology of tailings storage facilities may change considerably due to the cumulative disposal of tailings which may alter water storage capacity and the water balance of the facility over time alternatively the expansion of tailings storage facilities to accommodate further tailings deposition may significantly increase water storage capacity this has considerable implications for potential rates of impounded water reuse as well as evaporation rates and discharge requirements additionally variability in groundwater infiltration rainfall runoff and evaporation over the life of a mine may also translate into substantial variability in discharge requirements some complex examples exist such as the lihir gold mine in papua new guinea where more than 200 gl of saline infiltration from louise harbour towards the pit is discharged continually back into the marine environment 3 3 limitations and inconsistencies in existing water use reporting a range of limitations and inconsistencies were identified in the historic water reporting practices of the industry for instance there is considerable inconsistency in accounting for surface water withdrawals between operations or companies and even at the same operation over time what is reported as surface water withdrawals in many cases will simply be the active withdrawal from nearby rivers or lakes that are metered for which there may be a formal water allocation license that needs to be complied with in other cases what is reported as surface water withdrawals may exclude precipitation and runoff that has been intercepted in site water storage infrastructure or within open pits in yet other cases what has been reported as a surface water withdrawal may simply be the surface water used in processing operations rather than the total surface water withdrawals associated with the site which is not typically known by mine site personnel i e a full site wide water balance will often be unavailable there have also been a range of different ways that water reuse or recycling have been accounted for by the industry the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 standards state that water reuse metrics should exclude the additional rainfall or surface runoff intercepted by worked water stores or tailings storage facilities however reporting for many mining operations particularly older reporting prior to the adoption of these standards are likely to simply reflect the total water transfers from either tailings storage facilities tailings thickeners or worked water stores the presentation of raw water and worked water use efficiency as percentages has also been inconsistent historically the recommended definition of water reuse efficiency by current reporting standards is worked water use divided by total water use raw worked whereas historically several mining companies have reported water use metrics based upon raw water use divided by worked water use when developing the database the basis of water reuse efficiency calculations were validated and some percentage based values were recalculated to meet the current accepted definitions examples exist in the reporting of companies recognising these issues when reporting water use and reuse for instance in 2012 2013 vedanta restated water use values from 2011 to 2012 to represent total water use rather than raw fresh water use in addition vedanta changed from reporting recycled water values based on reused water divided by raw water to instead report reused water divided by total water use other potential inconsistencies with reporting exist for instance xstrata north queensland reporting in 2010 indicated that the reported total water use excluded water used from groundwater and aquifer dewatering therefore it is important to consider the potential for inconsistencies in the reporting definitions between companies and through time when analysing water use data for the industry many mines and mineral processing facilities are effectively zero discharge operations as evaporation from dams and water storages may be sufficient to prevent the accumulation of water on site as a result many mining operations may not have reportable discharges however the absence of water discharges is still a valuable piece of information to communicate to stakeholders where a mine does not report any information on discharges then stakeholders are unable to evaluate whether no discharges from with are occurring or whether the discharges do occur but the company isn t reporting these therefore it is recommended that companies report against all major water categories even when these flows are zero as this provides stakeholders with a more complete understanding of site water balances it is also possible to evaluate how reporting changes when a mining operation is bought sold or incorporated into another mining company examples of this include reporting changes associated with transfer of operations between oxiana oz minerals and mmg in these cases there are periods of time where only half year reported data was available for mining operations whose ownership was being transferred the merger of xstrata and glencore also provides another opportunity to understand the influence of company structure and reporting practices on the disclosure of data for individual mine sites water use data was available for xstrata at various levels of aggregation generally a lot of data were available for individual operations and divisional aggregations however upon merger with glencore the reporting practices largely took on those of glencore and much of the site based data reporting subsequently ceased in both these cases presumably the same detail of water flow monitoring and metering was being undertaken by the mine site personnel merely the type of public disclosures changed due to corporate transitions very few companies or operations report detailed information on the ultimate destination or sinks of water being consumed previous analyses have shown that the rates and balance between different modes of water consumption e g evaporation tailings entrainment etc can vary significantly between operations and is heavily influenced by local climate ore characteristics processing conditions tailings characteristics water storage and waste management practices 6 8 13 16 18 23 24 29 44 the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 water accounting standards provide guidelines for the reporting of specific modes of water consumption the implementation of these appears to be responsible for the increased reporting of water consumption categories in recent years table 4 measurement of water flows and losses can be difficult in practice and so the standards also provide guidance on communicating the confidence levels associated with reported flows i e high medium or low and their quantification method i e measured estimated or simulated as part of an accuracy statement only limited reporting to date has included accuracy statements alongside reported data some additional data was also collected for process variables such as ore moisture contents and tailings thickener underflow solids densities which are important for understanding internal rates of water reuse and the amount of water entering tailings storage facilities tables 2 and 3 there is limited public reporting of these variables in environmental management and sustainability reporting partially because mining companies may view these as having limited value for external stakeholders and measurements can be highly very variable through time 3 4 types of water disclosures not captured in the database there are significant additional data on water related aspects of mining operations that were not captured in the data compilation efforts large quantities of water quality monitoring data are available for some mining operations available as part of environmental management and regulation compliance reporting the water quality implications of mining operations are highly site specific and so monitoring activities must be tailored to the local situation this monitoring may be quite varied but will commonly include monitoring of upstream or downstream surface water quality bore water levels and quality and sediment samples the exact monitoring requirements will depend heavily upon local environmental regulation and the specific risks associated with the operation which is a dependent upon a range of factors such as mine type geochemistry climate and site management practices due to this the water quality parameters reported by mining companies vary considerably but will generally include ph total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss conductivity ferric or ferrous ions or specific metal cations or anions relevant to the risks of the project and downstream ecology generally specific water quality targets at particular locations or points downstream of a mining operation are defined by environment regulatory authorities and so mining operations conduct monitoring to ensure compliance with these targets historically this monitoring has been manually conducted and often with limited frequency however approaches and instrumentation to enable more frequent and automated capture of water quality data are increasingly being implemented in the industry long term water quality baseline data for periods prior to commencement of mining may not be available in all cases as a result it can be difficult to determine how individual mining operations are influencing regional water quality this then complicates efforts to attribute observed water quality impacts to a mining operation especially when there are cumulative impacts from other nearby mining operations land uses changes or competing water users such as agriculture limited data on local water contexts is included within mining company sustainability reporting the most notable example is from rio tinto s reporting in the late 1990s and early 2000s where reported water consumption by operations was grouped according to climate zones this lack of local context in sustainability reporting is being addressed by the icmm s 15 recent water reporting guidelines which outline approaches for evaluating and reporting the local catchment setting and water risks facing mining operations in recent years studies have begun to report on how the global mining industry is distributed in relation to a range of climatic and water risks such as water scarcity 31 33 it is anticipated that this type of information will increasingly be communicated by the mining industry 3 5 implications for water footprint and life cycle assessment studies water footprint and life cycle assessment based studies of the mining industry have sought to understand the magnitude in terms of volumetric consumption and potential impacts of water consumption associated with producing mined products 27 29 30 35 38 however santero and hendry 39 determined that water scarcity impacts should not be reported for life cycle assessment studies of metal production due to limitations in inventory data and impact assessment methods therefore there is a need for improved data sources to enable adequate assessment of water consumption occurring throughout the global mining industry there is also a need to develop models that reliably determine environmental impact the data collected by this study provides a starting point for improving water consumption data present in life cycle inventories of mined products additional work is required to improve the industry coverage incorporate production and co production data and to translate the water source and water quality categories of this study into the equivalent data categories that are used by lca recent assessments of the spatial distribution of mining operations in relation to water use impact characterisation factors demonstrate the value of watershed based impact assessment 31 32 therefore water use inventories for the mining industry should ideally be developed and presented on a site by site basis however if inventory developers are required to aggregate mine site inventories to avoid disclosing commercially sensitive information then we strongly encourage that watershed rather than national boundaries of aggregation are utilised this is due to a bias for existing national average water use impact characterisation factors to on average overestimate water use impacts for the mining industry when compared with watershed based assessment 32 in addition inventory data to determine indirect water use impacts should also be developed and additional life cycle impact categories e g climate change toxicity etc should also be assessed and presented alongside water use impacts 3 6 further work the current research has only captured a fraction of the available water related data being publicly reported by the mining industry further work could be undertaken to expand the industry coverage of the dataset to include the reporting of a greater number of mining companies these data compilation efforts are highly time consuming however once compiled the data is very valuable for future research efforts considerable reported data also exists for other aspects of relevance to sustainable development oriented research that is yet to be compiled and analysed in detail this includes material and reagent consumption data waste generation land occupancy and transformations i e disturbance rehabilitation additionally there is significant amounts of information being reported by the industry at mining industry conferences and in technical literature more generally that if compiled in a systematic way would be a very valuable data source for understanding technology deployment resource efficiency and the impacts of the mining industry we encourage other researchers to compile and analyse data contained within mining industry reporting so that the data limitations faced by many current analyses of the industry can be overcome any researchers who wish to collaborate to extend the database to include greater industry coverage additional data categories or perform derivative analyses are encouraged to contact the authors substantial amounts of water use data are also available for the mining industry that have been aggregated to the level of national or state economic sectors e g 47 with further data compilation for mining operations in individual regions this highly aggregated data for economic sub sectors could potentially be used in conjunction with mine by mine data to better understand the magnitude of water use data that is not being publicly reported by the industry data is available suggesting improvements to water use efficiency overtime in the chilean copper sector 19 however there is limited understanding of whether similar trends would be observed in other regions based upon the compiled dataset additional work is required to 1 combine the dataset with production statistics e g ore throughputs production rates recovery factors etc and climate data 2 classify mine site processing routes and waste management techniques and 3 use this to develop a nuanced understand of the drivers and trends of water use efficiency in the industry these drivers are diverse and may include process related constraints local weather and climatic factors water stress and availability in regions drought and flood recurrence frequency regulatory factors or societal pressures systematic evaluation of how water use in the industry varies in relation to these drivers would enable the development of meaningful schemes for benchmarking water use efficiency in the industry this would also aide in the assessment of regional water use allocations and the economic value generated by water use in the mining industry 34 4 conclusions effective management of water resources requires a firm understanding of how water is used and consumed in different sectors of the economy despite the importance of the mining industry to many regional and national economies there is still limited understanding of the magnitude and variability of water consumption between mining regions due to this limitation it is difficult to determine what is an appropriate or acceptable level of water consumption for any individual mining operation assessing progress in water use efficiency in the mining industry requires the development of benchmark statistics to enable fair and meaningful comparison of water use at different mine sites in this article we have demonstrated that considerable amounts of water use data are being publicly reported by the mining industry research efforts to compile and analyse these forms of water use disclosures have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how the mining industry interacts with water resources both at an individual site level and across regions and industry sub sectors for instance it was identified that all major components of individual mining operation water balances can vary significantly between both operations and through time opportunities exist for further work to improve industry coverage to develop datasets suitable for water footprinting and life cycle assessment and to develop water use efficiency benchmarking schemes for the mining industry further implementation of the water accounting and reporting schemes available for the mining industry is encouraged to improve the comprehensiveness and consistency of industry reporting increased public disclosure of mine water interactions has value for investors communities regulators and the mining industry itself compilation and analysis of these disclosures can provide valuable insights

8819,the advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies however there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures to address this we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines the quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time although opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non existent flows e g discharges initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals use efficiency and discharges between mining operations further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale keywords mining corporate sustainability reporting water withdrawals water consumption water recycling water discharge 1 introduction the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs provide an ambitious set of targets for improving environmental sustainability economic development social cohesion and human development by 2030 42 meeting these goals will require improvements in the way that water resources are utilised managed and protected for instance sdg6 is focused on clean water and sanitation and within this there are targets for improving access to safe drinking water improving water quality increasing water use efficiency capacity building and involving local communities in water management issues there are many opportunities for the mining industry to contribute towards this 43 such as through implementing sustainable water management practices that ensure shared benefits for local communities 46 however understanding these contributions requires the development of rigorous assessment methods and data sources so that rates of progress in the mining industry can be measured mining and mineral processing operations have the potential to substantially impact local hydrology and water quality the magnitude and nature of these impacts are highly site specific due to a variety of underlying factors 30 mining and mineral processing operations must adapt their mineral separation and metal production processes based upon the physical and geochemical nature of the ore being mined resulting in differences in the water required for ore processing the approaches adopted for storing and managing large scale mine waste e g waste rock and tailings can significantly alter mine site water balances and the optimal approach is dependent upon local factors such as site topography furthermore the hydrological and climate contexts that the mining industry operates within and must adapt to are diverse 31 33 this requires further tailoring of site processes and infrastructure to manage associated risks such as flooding or the potential for water shortages 8 18 additionally the regulatory environments that dictate the ability of mining operations to access use and discharge water as well as transparency requirements related to this are also diverse across countries and states 20 40 41 the combination of these factors results in large variability in the water use efficiency of mining operations and their hydrological impacts 25 because of this variability it is very difficult to fairly benchmark water use efficiency in the mining industry and to determine what is an acceptable level of water use or water use impact for any individual mining and mineral processing operation given the potential for significant hydrological impacts mining companies will often invest considerable resources into developing water and environmental management strategies so that potential impacts to surrounding industry and community stakeholders as well as the environment are reduced or avoided when mining companies fail to effectively implement or communicate these strategies then a mining project may lose its so called social license to operate resulting in substantial opposition to the mining project by communities governments or competing sectors such as agriculture 14 37 45 to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders and government regulatory authorities mining companies have become more transparent regarding their water management practices over the past two decades the mining industry has increasingly made public disclosures of water use as part of environmental management and corporate sustainability reporting these disclosures represent a valuable data source to improve understanding of the interactions between the mining industry and water resources the reporting of water use in the mining industry has become increasingly standardised over time through the development of industry specific water accounting schemes the minerals council of australia mca developed the water accounting framework for the minerals industry wafmi to provide greater rigour and consistency for mines that report to schemes such as the global reporting initiative 21 more recently the international council on mining metals icmm has provided additional guidance particularly as it relates to assessment and reporting of local water risks 15 as this guidance and standardisation is implemented throughout the mining industry it is anticipated that there will be an improvement in the transparency quality and consistency of mining industry water use disclosures through time previously some compilation and quantitative analysis of the water use data reported by the mining industry has been undertaken by several authors mudd 25 conducted a preliminary assessment of water use disclosures within sustainability reporting and confirmed that lower ore grades are generally associated with higher water requirements per unit of production additionally it was observed that there was considerable inconsistency in the metrics and communication of water use data between mining companies glaister and mudd 9 assessed water use disclosures of platinum group metal mining companies northey et al 28 compiled data from sustainability reporting to evaluate the variability in water use requirements of copper operations gunson 12 also compiled a dataset of reported mine water use to evaluate the water use intensity and global water withdrawals associated with non fuel mineral production for the years 2006 2009 buchspies et al 3 compiled water withdrawal and recycling data for platinum group element production in south africa beyond this several authors have performed assessments of the types of water use information being disclosed by the mining industry and the general compliance of the mining industry with sustainability reporting standards such as the global reporting initiative 1 2 20 although these studies have assessed various aspects of mining company water use reporting and the data contained therein the scope of analysis and the extent of industry coverage included within these studies has been limited many studies have been limited to assessing only a geographic or commodity sub sector of the mining industry additionally many studies have only compiled data for a single aspect of mine water interactions most commonly water abstractions or withdrawals by mining operations thus the large amount of data publicly reported by mining companies on other aspects of water use such as internal reuse efficiency or discharges has largely remained unassessed efforts to more systematically compile and analyse this data would provide a significant opportunity to improve our understanding of how water use varies across the mining industry the overall magnitude and impacts of this water use and the potential opportunities for improving water management outcomes in the mining industry to facilitate improved compilation of this data this study aimed to 1 establish a database structure to enable systematic compilation of public water use disclosures by the mining industry 2 test the database structure through the compilation of an initial dataset 3 analyse compiled data to understand trends in industry reporting and the variability of mine site water balances and 4 provide recommendations for further work to better understand and evaluate the interactions of the mining industry with water resources 2 methods and data sources to support future assessments of water use efficiency in the mining industry and the potential environmental or societal impacts of this we have compiled a comprehensive database of publicly disclosed water use statistics for the mining industry the reported water use database was developed in two stages first water accounting standards for the minerals industry were reviewed to identify suitable data categories for describing water flows between mining operations and surrounding environments as well as possible internal flows within mining operations secondly these data categories were used to classify data reported in mining company sustainability and environmental compliance management reporting enabling a detailed database of mine water disclosures to be developed finally an assessment of reporting trends and the temporal variability of mine site water balances was performed to better understand data availability and the potential applications of this data to advance research and industry understanding 2 1 water use reporting in the mining industry the mining industry has increasingly reported water use statistics within corporate sustainability and environmental management reporting 36 these disclosures may include mandatory reporting such as environmental compliance reporting to regulatory authorities that may be made public in some jurisdictions in other cases mining companies voluntarily disclose water use data through initiatives such as corporate sustainability reporting and market disclosures 20 most existing studies that assess these activities have focused upon the degree of compliance with the various reporting standards that guide these disclosures such as the global reporting initiative 7 17 however there has been limited analysis of the actual water use data being communicated within these reports the global reporting initiative gri provides a framework for corporate sustainability reporting to aide in the communication of a company s social economic and environmental performance 10 despite being a voluntary initiative there has been strong uptake of gri based sustainability reporting by major mining companies 7 36 the gri has evolved over time to meet the needs of stakeholders and to improve the meaningfulness or requirements of reporting indicators as a result reporting supplements specifically for the mining industry have been made available to improve the quality of disclosures being made by the sector 11 the main indicators of relevance to water related issues under the reporting standard gri4 include 10 g4 en8 total water withdrawal by source g4 en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water g4 en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused g4 en22 en21 in gri3 total water discharge by quality and destination g4 en26 identity size protected status and biodiversity value of water bodies and related habitats significantly affected by the organisations discharges of water and runoff typically mining operations will be subject to environmental and permitting regulations that require them to submit compliance planning or management reports to government authorities and regulatory bodies in some jurisdictions these reports are made public either voluntarily by the company or as a requirement of their permitting 20 the contents of this reporting are often highly site specific as they are tailored heavily to understanding the impacts of the mine in the context of the surrounding natural or regulatory environment often these reports contain information on water quality monitoring groundwater abstractions and impacts to aquifers surface water withdrawals or the management of major site infrastructure such as tailings dams in this article and the compiled database these forms of reporting are referred to as environmental management reports previously there have been weaknesses and inconsistencies identified in mining industry water related gri disclosures 25 to address this the mining industry has developed industry specific water accounting and reporting standards to improve the consistency and rigour of information being communicated through gri based sustainability reporting and other stakeholder engagement processes the water accounting framework for the minerals industry wafmi was developed by the sustainable minerals institute university of queensland for the minerals council of australia 21 the wafmi provides a framework for mining and mineral processing operations to enable consistent estimation and recording of water flows throughout the site and to from surrounding environments this accounting framework enables more standardised communication of water use data by mining companies and is sufficiently flexible to enable implementation by a mining operation regardless of local hydrologic or climatic factors 5 mca member companies were required to adopt the wafmi by 1 july 2015 22 more recently the international council on mining metals icmm released another guidance document for the industry a practical guide to consistent water reporting which is required to be implemented by icmm member companies by november 2018 15 the icmm s guidance document was heavily modelled upon the earlier wafmi although with some minor alterations of terminology and significant additional guidance on the assessment and communication of local water contexts and risks 2 2 database structure the database was structured to provide a flexible and accurate depiction of public water use disclosures made by the mining industry the database structure was developed through review of the data categories and water quality classifications provided by the wafmi 21 and the icmm s 15 guidance document as a significant proportion of mining industry water use reporting predates the development of these water accounting frameworks non complying reported data has been mapped to the closest equivalent data category given the historic variability and often unclear water use reporting practices of mining companies some data points required considerable judgement of the authors to assign a suitable data category in these cases the authors endeavoured to cross validate data points through comparison with data available for other data categories or time periods explanatory comments explaining decisions made were incorporated into the database as necessary 2 2 1 data categories there are a range of ways that mining and mineral processing operations interact with water resources the flows of water through an operation can be quite site specific depending upon the local hydrology management practices and processes employed on the site fortunately the wafmi and the icmm s guidance document outlines flexible water accounting categories that can be used by mining companies to consistently report water use data the various water use categories and definitions provided have been adapted to determine the main data categories included in our database the data categories used are shown in fig 1 with definitions for each data category provided in appendix a as can be seen there are four major classes of data categories defined to describe the interactions between mining mineral processing operations and water resources these are withdrawals internal use consumption and discharge within each of these major data classes an aggregation hierarchy exists reflecting the fact that reported data may only reflect a specific aspect of a mine s hydrological interactions so further sub classes are also used that reflect either the aggregate water flows to from a specific source or sink i e groundwater surface water marine water or third parties or that reflect a sub set of flows to each sources or sinks e g aquifer reinjection or seepage in this case an important distinction is made between water consumption and water use water consumption is the mode by which water is made unavailable to be returned to surrounding environments whereas water use is simply a reflection of the water inputs to site processes both consumptive and non consumptive uses of water are possible depending upon if the water is returned to the surrounding water sources the consumption categories reflect the ultimate destination of water that is not reused or discharged back into water resources or third parties 2 2 2 water quality categories water quality categories have been assigned in situations where the definitions provided by the mca 21 or icmm 15 s reporting standards were used further detail is provided in appendix a where reporting specifically makes a qualitative distinction between water quality such as potable fresh brackish impounded or poor quality then a judgement was made to assign a category based upon the likely equivalent water quality category under the mca 21 or icmm 15 reporting standards it should be noted that most of data reported by the industry does not indicate a water quality description or parameters specifically therefore in these cases the default water quality category applied to the data point is t total indicating that the data point is believed to represent all flow or volumes rather than a subset alternative water quality classification approaches are also possible which may be more relevant for an individual mine site s operation an example is provided by cocks et al 4 who describe a hierarchical classification approach developed for kalgoorlie consolidated gold mines kcgm the superpit and the boddington gold mine in australia in this case the potential water source and quality categories are highly tailored to the regional context of those mines and so there is detailed descriptors provided for different aquifer and water source characteristics however to ensure consistency with future industry reporting the water quality categories defined by the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 reporting standards were adopted 3 results and discussion the compiled database which we refer to as database of publicly reported water data by the mining industry v1 0 is available in the electronic supplementary material accompanying this article 3 1 extent and types of captured water use reporting from the water use reporting surveyed in this study it is clear that there are substantial amounts of water related data being disclosed by the mining industry in total 8314 data points were compiled from 359 mining company reports several examples of database entries are provided in table 1 table 2 shows the number of data points that were compiled for each data category the sources of these data i e environmental management reports or sustainability reports and the degree to which water quality classification was possible the breakdown of data sources was table 2 29 2451 of 8314 from environmental management reports 67 5587 of 8314 from gri based sustainability reports 3 277 of 8314 from non gri based sustainability reports when comparing the number of data points compiled for each data category substantially more data is reported by the industry for water withdrawals and the water inputs to processes both raw and worked water comparatively substantially less data is reported for volumes of water discharges modes of consumption i e evaporation tailings entrainment etc or other related metrics such as changes in on site water storage or local climatic factors due to this it is currently not possible to describe the complete water balance of most mining operations using publicly reported data generally this is only possible when companies have fully adopted and comply with either the wafmi mca 2014 or the icmm s water accounting guidelines newcrest mining ltd was one of the earliest adopters of the wafmi and this has resulted in consistent long term reporting of water balances for their mines in australia and papua new guinea which includes classification of water flows into discrete water quality categories as well as some assessment of data confidence or uncertainty it s unexpected that water discharge volumes were far more commonly reported in sustainability reports rather than environmental compliance reporting this appears to be because environmental compliance reports place a much greater emphasis on monitoring compliance with water quality targets at specified locations downstream of discharge points rather than the actual volumes of discharged water by comparison companies and sustainability reporting standards such as the gri appear to prioritise communicating volumetric measures with emphasis on water inputs rather than discharges or specific modes of consumption possibly this could be due to mining companies having a better understanding of their compliance with water withdrawal limits and water inputs to processes however they may have more limited understanding of the ultimate destination of water on their site and the specific modes of water consumption or losses occurring i e evaporation tailings entrainment seepage etc water quality classifications were also assigned to data points where possible the breakdown of assigned water quality classification was table 2 7 6 629 of 8314 were assigned category 1 near potable 5 4 447 of 8314 were assigned category 2 suitable for some uses 0 4 39 of 8314 were assigned category 3 unsuitable for most uses 0 9 76 of 8314 were assigned category n not applicable 83 7 6958 of 8314 were assigned category t total 2 0 166 of 8314 were assigned category u unknown the high proportion of data being assigned the default category t total is indicative of the fact that most companies don t specify water quality categories when reporting rather the presented data can just be assumed to be the total water flows volumes with no segmentation based upon quality however in several cases mining companies have defined their own water quality classifications that make interpretation more difficult for instance in rio tinto s reporting from 1997 to 2003 the term freshwater is defined as water with total dissolved solids tds of less than 1500 mg l some rio tinto reports from this era also specify impounded water and poor quality water however some reports don t specifically include reporting according to these additional classifications in these cases it is difficult to determine based upon the reporting whether the water use data being reported reflects that only fresh water was being used or whether there was also poorer quality water being used that went unreported most of the data captured was for individual mining operations however it is also very common for aggregated divisional or company totals to be reported often without the more detailed data for the individual operations the breakdown of data aggregation was table 3 12 9 1074 of 8314 were company totals 20 1 1673 of 8314 were divisional totals 67 0 5568 of 8314 were operational totals important information on the local context and potential impacts of water use are lost when aggregating water use data to divisional and company totals especially when a company s operations are not co located in the same hydrological region aggregation of data appears to be more common for larger companies that have mines located in multiple countries in these cases divisional totals commonly reflect either a commodity grouping e g iron ore copper or grouping by countries or regions e g north america there were also instances where data was reported for a mining operation however due to company mergers or asset sales a mine would subsequently be included in aggregated divisional reporting in these cases there can be discontinuities in the availability of water use data for mines due to the different reporting practices of the various operating companies the presentation of data and the ability to accurately record data points is dependent upon how the information is presented in company reports the breakdown of data disclosure type or estimation method was table 3 88 8 7380 of 8314 were directly reported values 7 3 606 of 8314 were reported within graphs without data labels 3 8 319 of 8314 were inferred or calculated from other data in the report 0 1 10 of 8314 were best estimates based upon the authors judgement graph readings inferences and estimates could be considered to have a slightly lower data quality than the data points sourced from numeric values in the text or tables of a report most of the reported data are for annual time periods and there are substantially less data available for sub annual timescales tables 3 and 4 the split was that 87 4 7270 of 8314 were reported for annual time periods 12 6 1045 of 8314 were reported for sub annual mostly monthly time periods in fact a large proportion of sub annual data are monthly data for bhp billiton s olympic dam mine site in south australia where bore water withdrawals wgb from the great artesian basin are reported on a monthly timescale monthly rainfall data was also reported for some mines over long periods of time some monthly data for rio tinto s oyu tolgoi mine in mongolia was also available for raw water use um worked water use uw evaporation vp and groundwater withdrawals wg the total water use by major data category over time are shown in table 4 and fig 2 most of the pre 2000 data are water use data it is quite possible that for this period water withdrawals were being reported as water use by several companies however it was not possible for authors to further distinguish between reported values and so the data descriptions presented by companies must be taken on face value table 5 provides an indication of the data coverage across countries and companies and the commodity groups represented coverage not shown due to limitations in reporting for aggregated divisions and minor co by production the initial data collection had a bias towards copper producing companies and those with operations in australia substantial additional data are available in the public reporting of mining and mineral production companies not included in this list it is therefore anticipated that the industry coverage of the water reporting dataset could be expanded considerably in the future by further surveying the reporting of additional mining companies the authors note that compiling data directly from industry reporting is an extremely time consuming task particularly due to the frequency of mergers and acquisitions in the industry that break reporting for individual mine sites across multiple companies so considerable effort and care is required to develop consistent long term datasets for individual mining operations 3 2 water use statistics the reported data provides a strong basis for establishing a deeper understanding of how the global mining industry interacts with and impacts water resources this includes developing an improved understanding of the potential magnitude of water consumption and use impacts how water balances of mining operations vary across regions and how the water consumption of mining operations can vary through time in response to changing mine conditions management decisions and local hydrology or climate water withdrawals use and discharges at mine sites over time are shown in fig 3 with summary statistics shown in table 6 these were developed through combination of the water related data with mine site production statistics that the authors have previously compiled e g 26 with some minor updates to increase coverage water withdrawals when normalised per tonne of ore mined or processed display several orders of magnitude of variability between mining operations with 90 of mining operations withdrawing between 0 13 and 17 29 m3 per tonne of ore processed even for the same mine site there can be significant variation in water withdrawals through time as shown in fig 4 where data has is expressed relative to the first year of reported data for each mine site this intra annual variability can also range to an order or two of magnitude mining operations can vary considerably in terms of their source of water therefore the variability shown for total water withdrawals is also reflected in the data available for surface water groundwater and third party water withdrawals fig 5 shows rates of groundwater withdrawals in relation to surface water withdrawals demonstrating that mines are very diverse in terms of their reliance on either surface water or groundwater withdrawals further investigation is required to determine whether the exact drivers of this but it is likely due to the substantial differences in local climates and groundwater and surface water availability in different mining regions the water use required for mining and mineral processing operations are constrained by the required processing conditions and ore throughput rates which is reflected in the lower apparent variability of total water use water use varies between 0 34 and 6 27 m3 per tonne ore processed for 90 of mining operations table 6 however the components of the total water use raw water and worked water display a much greater degree of variability figs 3 and 4 a key contributor to this variability is likely the influence of variability in local hydrology on the mining operations water balance as year to year variations in rainfall on site storage and regional water availability can significantly alter the potential water reuse or recycling rates achievable or desirable for instance during periods of low rainfall a mining operation may be forced to rely less on external water sources and draw down reserves of worked water from tailings storage facilities or worked water stores alternatively during periods of high rainfall a mining operation may have easier access to external surface water sources or be able to divert rainfall and surface run off to water storages for subsequent uses in site processes there are many potential variations to this depending upon local climate site water management objectives and infrastructure and site operation strategies 18 due to these factors water reuse efficiency varies substantially between mining operations as shown in fig 6 mining operations vary from sourcing process water almost entirely from reused or recycled water whereas other mine sites have very limited reuse of water and are sourcing water from external sources or the interception of rainfall or ground water on site although there is less discharge data available for mining operations mine sites specifically reporting zero discharges were excluded from figs 3 and 4 the data that are available suggest very high intra annual variability in discharge requirements again this is likely to be coupled to both operational and climatic factors throughout the life of a mining operation the morphology of tailings storage facilities may change considerably due to the cumulative disposal of tailings which may alter water storage capacity and the water balance of the facility over time alternatively the expansion of tailings storage facilities to accommodate further tailings deposition may significantly increase water storage capacity this has considerable implications for potential rates of impounded water reuse as well as evaporation rates and discharge requirements additionally variability in groundwater infiltration rainfall runoff and evaporation over the life of a mine may also translate into substantial variability in discharge requirements some complex examples exist such as the lihir gold mine in papua new guinea where more than 200 gl of saline infiltration from louise harbour towards the pit is discharged continually back into the marine environment 3 3 limitations and inconsistencies in existing water use reporting a range of limitations and inconsistencies were identified in the historic water reporting practices of the industry for instance there is considerable inconsistency in accounting for surface water withdrawals between operations or companies and even at the same operation over time what is reported as surface water withdrawals in many cases will simply be the active withdrawal from nearby rivers or lakes that are metered for which there may be a formal water allocation license that needs to be complied with in other cases what is reported as surface water withdrawals may exclude precipitation and runoff that has been intercepted in site water storage infrastructure or within open pits in yet other cases what has been reported as a surface water withdrawal may simply be the surface water used in processing operations rather than the total surface water withdrawals associated with the site which is not typically known by mine site personnel i e a full site wide water balance will often be unavailable there have also been a range of different ways that water reuse or recycling have been accounted for by the industry the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 standards state that water reuse metrics should exclude the additional rainfall or surface runoff intercepted by worked water stores or tailings storage facilities however reporting for many mining operations particularly older reporting prior to the adoption of these standards are likely to simply reflect the total water transfers from either tailings storage facilities tailings thickeners or worked water stores the presentation of raw water and worked water use efficiency as percentages has also been inconsistent historically the recommended definition of water reuse efficiency by current reporting standards is worked water use divided by total water use raw worked whereas historically several mining companies have reported water use metrics based upon raw water use divided by worked water use when developing the database the basis of water reuse efficiency calculations were validated and some percentage based values were recalculated to meet the current accepted definitions examples exist in the reporting of companies recognising these issues when reporting water use and reuse for instance in 2012 2013 vedanta restated water use values from 2011 to 2012 to represent total water use rather than raw fresh water use in addition vedanta changed from reporting recycled water values based on reused water divided by raw water to instead report reused water divided by total water use other potential inconsistencies with reporting exist for instance xstrata north queensland reporting in 2010 indicated that the reported total water use excluded water used from groundwater and aquifer dewatering therefore it is important to consider the potential for inconsistencies in the reporting definitions between companies and through time when analysing water use data for the industry many mines and mineral processing facilities are effectively zero discharge operations as evaporation from dams and water storages may be sufficient to prevent the accumulation of water on site as a result many mining operations may not have reportable discharges however the absence of water discharges is still a valuable piece of information to communicate to stakeholders where a mine does not report any information on discharges then stakeholders are unable to evaluate whether no discharges from with are occurring or whether the discharges do occur but the company isn t reporting these therefore it is recommended that companies report against all major water categories even when these flows are zero as this provides stakeholders with a more complete understanding of site water balances it is also possible to evaluate how reporting changes when a mining operation is bought sold or incorporated into another mining company examples of this include reporting changes associated with transfer of operations between oxiana oz minerals and mmg in these cases there are periods of time where only half year reported data was available for mining operations whose ownership was being transferred the merger of xstrata and glencore also provides another opportunity to understand the influence of company structure and reporting practices on the disclosure of data for individual mine sites water use data was available for xstrata at various levels of aggregation generally a lot of data were available for individual operations and divisional aggregations however upon merger with glencore the reporting practices largely took on those of glencore and much of the site based data reporting subsequently ceased in both these cases presumably the same detail of water flow monitoring and metering was being undertaken by the mine site personnel merely the type of public disclosures changed due to corporate transitions very few companies or operations report detailed information on the ultimate destination or sinks of water being consumed previous analyses have shown that the rates and balance between different modes of water consumption e g evaporation tailings entrainment etc can vary significantly between operations and is heavily influenced by local climate ore characteristics processing conditions tailings characteristics water storage and waste management practices 6 8 13 16 18 23 24 29 44 the mca s 21 and icmm s 15 water accounting standards provide guidelines for the reporting of specific modes of water consumption the implementation of these appears to be responsible for the increased reporting of water consumption categories in recent years table 4 measurement of water flows and losses can be difficult in practice and so the standards also provide guidance on communicating the confidence levels associated with reported flows i e high medium or low and their quantification method i e measured estimated or simulated as part of an accuracy statement only limited reporting to date has included accuracy statements alongside reported data some additional data was also collected for process variables such as ore moisture contents and tailings thickener underflow solids densities which are important for understanding internal rates of water reuse and the amount of water entering tailings storage facilities tables 2 and 3 there is limited public reporting of these variables in environmental management and sustainability reporting partially because mining companies may view these as having limited value for external stakeholders and measurements can be highly very variable through time 3 4 types of water disclosures not captured in the database there are significant additional data on water related aspects of mining operations that were not captured in the data compilation efforts large quantities of water quality monitoring data are available for some mining operations available as part of environmental management and regulation compliance reporting the water quality implications of mining operations are highly site specific and so monitoring activities must be tailored to the local situation this monitoring may be quite varied but will commonly include monitoring of upstream or downstream surface water quality bore water levels and quality and sediment samples the exact monitoring requirements will depend heavily upon local environmental regulation and the specific risks associated with the operation which is a dependent upon a range of factors such as mine type geochemistry climate and site management practices due to this the water quality parameters reported by mining companies vary considerably but will generally include ph total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss conductivity ferric or ferrous ions or specific metal cations or anions relevant to the risks of the project and downstream ecology generally specific water quality targets at particular locations or points downstream of a mining operation are defined by environment regulatory authorities and so mining operations conduct monitoring to ensure compliance with these targets historically this monitoring has been manually conducted and often with limited frequency however approaches and instrumentation to enable more frequent and automated capture of water quality data are increasingly being implemented in the industry long term water quality baseline data for periods prior to commencement of mining may not be available in all cases as a result it can be difficult to determine how individual mining operations are influencing regional water quality this then complicates efforts to attribute observed water quality impacts to a mining operation especially when there are cumulative impacts from other nearby mining operations land uses changes or competing water users such as agriculture limited data on local water contexts is included within mining company sustainability reporting the most notable example is from rio tinto s reporting in the late 1990s and early 2000s where reported water consumption by operations was grouped according to climate zones this lack of local context in sustainability reporting is being addressed by the icmm s 15 recent water reporting guidelines which outline approaches for evaluating and reporting the local catchment setting and water risks facing mining operations in recent years studies have begun to report on how the global mining industry is distributed in relation to a range of climatic and water risks such as water scarcity 31 33 it is anticipated that this type of information will increasingly be communicated by the mining industry 3 5 implications for water footprint and life cycle assessment studies water footprint and life cycle assessment based studies of the mining industry have sought to understand the magnitude in terms of volumetric consumption and potential impacts of water consumption associated with producing mined products 27 29 30 35 38 however santero and hendry 39 determined that water scarcity impacts should not be reported for life cycle assessment studies of metal production due to limitations in inventory data and impact assessment methods therefore there is a need for improved data sources to enable adequate assessment of water consumption occurring throughout the global mining industry there is also a need to develop models that reliably determine environmental impact the data collected by this study provides a starting point for improving water consumption data present in life cycle inventories of mined products additional work is required to improve the industry coverage incorporate production and co production data and to translate the water source and water quality categories of this study into the equivalent data categories that are used by lca recent assessments of the spatial distribution of mining operations in relation to water use impact characterisation factors demonstrate the value of watershed based impact assessment 31 32 therefore water use inventories for the mining industry should ideally be developed and presented on a site by site basis however if inventory developers are required to aggregate mine site inventories to avoid disclosing commercially sensitive information then we strongly encourage that watershed rather than national boundaries of aggregation are utilised this is due to a bias for existing national average water use impact characterisation factors to on average overestimate water use impacts for the mining industry when compared with watershed based assessment 32 in addition inventory data to determine indirect water use impacts should also be developed and additional life cycle impact categories e g climate change toxicity etc should also be assessed and presented alongside water use impacts 3 6 further work the current research has only captured a fraction of the available water related data being publicly reported by the mining industry further work could be undertaken to expand the industry coverage of the dataset to include the reporting of a greater number of mining companies these data compilation efforts are highly time consuming however once compiled the data is very valuable for future research efforts considerable reported data also exists for other aspects of relevance to sustainable development oriented research that is yet to be compiled and analysed in detail this includes material and reagent consumption data waste generation land occupancy and transformations i e disturbance rehabilitation additionally there is significant amounts of information being reported by the industry at mining industry conferences and in technical literature more generally that if compiled in a systematic way would be a very valuable data source for understanding technology deployment resource efficiency and the impacts of the mining industry we encourage other researchers to compile and analyse data contained within mining industry reporting so that the data limitations faced by many current analyses of the industry can be overcome any researchers who wish to collaborate to extend the database to include greater industry coverage additional data categories or perform derivative analyses are encouraged to contact the authors substantial amounts of water use data are also available for the mining industry that have been aggregated to the level of national or state economic sectors e g 47 with further data compilation for mining operations in individual regions this highly aggregated data for economic sub sectors could potentially be used in conjunction with mine by mine data to better understand the magnitude of water use data that is not being publicly reported by the industry data is available suggesting improvements to water use efficiency overtime in the chilean copper sector 19 however there is limited understanding of whether similar trends would be observed in other regions based upon the compiled dataset additional work is required to 1 combine the dataset with production statistics e g ore throughputs production rates recovery factors etc and climate data 2 classify mine site processing routes and waste management techniques and 3 use this to develop a nuanced understand of the drivers and trends of water use efficiency in the industry these drivers are diverse and may include process related constraints local weather and climatic factors water stress and availability in regions drought and flood recurrence frequency regulatory factors or societal pressures systematic evaluation of how water use in the industry varies in relation to these drivers would enable the development of meaningful schemes for benchmarking water use efficiency in the industry this would also aide in the assessment of regional water use allocations and the economic value generated by water use in the mining industry 34 4 conclusions effective management of water resources requires a firm understanding of how water is used and consumed in different sectors of the economy despite the importance of the mining industry to many regional and national economies there is still limited understanding of the magnitude and variability of water consumption between mining regions due to this limitation it is difficult to determine what is an appropriate or acceptable level of water consumption for any individual mining operation assessing progress in water use efficiency in the mining industry requires the development of benchmark statistics to enable fair and meaningful comparison of water use at different mine sites in this article we have demonstrated that considerable amounts of water use data are being publicly reported by the mining industry research efforts to compile and analyse these forms of water use disclosures have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how the mining industry interacts with water resources both at an individual site level and across regions and industry sub sectors for instance it was identified that all major components of individual mining operation water balances can vary significantly between both operations and through time opportunities exist for further work to improve industry coverage to develop datasets suitable for water footprinting and life cycle assessment and to develop water use efficiency benchmarking schemes for the mining industry further implementation of the water accounting and reporting schemes available for the mining industry is encouraged to improve the comprehensiveness and consistency of industry reporting increased public disclosure of mine water interactions has value for investors communities regulators and the mining industry itself compilation and analysis of these disclosures can provide valuable insights
