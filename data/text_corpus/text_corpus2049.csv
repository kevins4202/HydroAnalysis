10245,film mulched drip irrigation fmdi has clear benefits for saving water and promoting cotton production in xinjiang china due to the complicated transport processes for soil water and salt under fmdi it is still challenging to systematically answer the questions such as the soil water and salt balance in the root zone cotton yield and water productivity wp under typical planting modes and irrigation schedules previously we proposed a hydrus 2d model with modified root water uptake rwu function and simulated the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in cotton fields under fmdi but we ignored the effects of the cotton yield and wp from the perspective of smart irrigation it is necessary to evaluate the effects of irrigation on crop production wp and soil environments thus in the present study our hydrus 2d model coupled with a validated crop water production function was applied to evaluate the effects of typical irrigation schedules and the antecedent soil salinity distributions on the soil water salt balance and plant water status and leaching fraction as well as the cotton yield and wp under fmdi in 36 scenarios these scenarios included two antecedent soil salinity distributions as six irrigation amounts ia and three irrigation intervals if compared with the lower as scenarios the higher as scenarios obtained lower cotton transpiration and evapotranspiration but higher evaporation drainage and soil water storage and the crop water status and leaching fraction were also increased due to the soil salt stress restricting rwu the salt balance results indicated the current irrigation scheduling under fmdi leads to desalination processes in different scenarios moreover the cotton yield and the corresponding wp for cotton wp eta and irrigation wp i were estimated under different as scenarios binary quadratic regression equations were developed based on ia and if data to predict the cotton yield wp eta and wp i appropriate irrigation strategies are recommended based on the results our results could provide a scientific basis for optimizing irrigation schedules and improving the understanding of irrigation management under fmdi among local farmers in xinjiang keywords cotton evapotranspiration components film mulched drip irrigation irrigation practices leaching fraction soil water and salt management 1 introduction water scarcity and soil salinity are two major threats to global agricultural production and sustainable development especially in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2010 in the xinjiang region of china due to the arid desert climate and widespread requirement for agricultural irrigation in saline soils the film mulched drip irrigation fmdi technique has been adopted widely to replace traditional surface flood irrigation for saving more water and leaching salts away from the shallow root zone and increasing crop s yields xinjiang is the largest cotton planting region in china with about 58 5 of planted area and 71 of the yield and more than 2 106 hm2 of the cotton is grown under fmdi tuerxun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 almost half of local farm laborers are engaged in cotton growing ning et al 2013 up until now several typical planting and management modes have been developed for cotton based on research and practices experience for example a traditional wide narrow row spacing mode conventionally referred to as one film two tapes and four rows is often employed in cotton cultivation ning et al 2013 2014 2015 2019 as for the irrigation schedule the recommended irrigation amount is about 370 mm at a frequency of once every 5 10 d in northern xinjiang liu et al 2011 2013 wu et al 2014 however an extensive survey was conducted based on 228 cotton producing farms in xinjiang with water shortages and great differences were found in terms of the cotton production and water use efficiency wue where most were at low levels feike et al 2017 these results may be attributed to the lack of systematic guidance regarding water management for cotton producers kang et al 2012 and the inappropriate typical irrigation schedules recommended for different actual conditions li et al 2013 wang et al 2019 from the perspective of smart irrigation we need to maximize our understanding or predictions of the effects of irrigation on crop production wue and even environments nevertheless it is still very difficult to systematically and clearly answer questions regarding the soil water and salt balance in the root zone plant water deficit status leaching fraction yield and water productivity wp under the typical planting modes and irrigation schedules employed for cotton production under fmdi in northern xinjiang based on field experiment results or numerical simulations the possible reasons for these practical difficulties include the following 1 the actual cotton cultivation environments are usually very complicated and they differ from each other in many ways thus experimental results obtained in specific field situations are not readily applied under other conditions numerical simulation is used increasingly frequently to simulate the two dimensional soil water and salt dynamics in the soil cotton system and to estimate wp for cotton under fmdi but it is still a tremendous challenging task to obtain accurately and timely roots distribution for simulating root water uptake rwu of cotton during the numerical simulation process hence the root distribution is often assumed to be a fixed or unchanging function chuan et al 2008 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 z h wang et al 2014 z m wang et al 2014 which obviously fails to represent the actual situation thereby leading to errors such as underestimating evapotranspiration and these errors will affect the soil water salt balance calculations and the estimated crop yields according to the simulation results roberts et al 2009 wei et al 2015 he et al 2018 2 frankly speaking the current typical irrigation schedules in northern xinjiang were basically determined based on cotton fields with low soil salinity chen et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 however large variations in the soil salinity are observed in the cotton fields under fmdi in northern xinjiang where the mean electrical conductivities of the saturated soil extracts ece in the root zone range from a lower value of 2 33 ds m 1 chen et al 2010 to values higher than 30 ds m 1 wang et al 2012 these variations in the soil salinity will inevitably affect the soil water and salt transport in the soil cotton system and result in differences in the cotton yield and wp thus further attention should be paid to the effects of different initial soil salinity distributions on the soil water and salt balance in the root zone and wp under the typical irrigation schedules 3 the presence of salt in the root zone lowers down the soil water potential and thus decreases rwu i e transpiration which may result in some of the irrigated water is not consumed by crops in the arid xinjiang the surplus water that exceeds the root uptake capacity will be transported downward and carry salt away from the root zone to the deeper soil layer therefore fmdi has functions of supplying water for roots uptake and leaching salt from the root zone accurate evaluations and improvements of the current typical irrigation schedules may be facilitated if the leaching effect could be quantified based on the soil water and salt balance especially for highly saline cotton fields recently the normalized root length density nrld distribution of cotton under fmdi was generalized as an exponential function independent of the soil environment cotton species planting modes and growing stages ning et al 2015 2019 with known changing rooting depth which is much more easily to be obtained than root length density rld distribution zuo et al 2004 2013 the generalized nrld function can describe the dynamic rld distributions for cotton under fmdi in order to successfully simulate the two dimensional soil water flow and salt transport in a soil cotton system under fmdi ning et al 2015 it would be useful to evaluate the soil water salt balance and wp under the typical irrigation schedules employed for cotton under fmdi in northern xinjiang using the numerical simulation method however a single model is not adequate for simultaneously estimating the crop yield wp and the soil water salt balance in the root zone for cotton under fmdi wang et al 2017 roy et al 2019 especially under soil salt stress thus in the present study we established a validated hydrological model coupled with a crop water production function to address this problem the objectives of this study were to systematically assess the impacts of the typical irrigation schedules and antecedent soil salinity as distributions on the soil water and salt balance plant water status leaching fraction yield and wp for cotton under fmdi in northern xinjiang by using a numerical simulation method this approach helps to understand irrigation management and to optimize the irrigation schedules for use in future practical applications in order to increase the yield and wp under fmdi in northern xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were conducted at the manas cotton breeding station of xinjiang academy of agricultural sciences 44 18 n 86 22 e altitude 438 m during 2011 and 2012 the station located in the eastern manas river valley and southern alluvial plain of junggar basin local climate is temperate continental dry with average annual temperature of 6 6 annual precipitation of 147 mm and evaporation of 1500 2100 mm and the groundwater table depth is more than 4 m below the soil surface li and wang 2009 cotton gossypium hirsutum l cv 07 5 under fmdi was planted on 28 apr 118 doy day of year using a traditional wide narrow row spacing mode viz one film two tapes and four rows mode which has the longest spreading time and it is applied most extensively in xinjiang cai et al 2002 chen et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 wang et al 2019 the harvest commenced on 2 sept 245 doy in 2011 in moderately severely salt affected soils four treatments with three replicate plots each covered 64 m2 were conducted including two irrigation water amounts of 300 and 375 mm and two fertilizer application rates of 255 and 417 5 kg hm 2 in 2012 cotton under fmdi was sowed on 28 april using the super wide ﬁlm mulch spacing mode viz one film three tapes and six rows mode and harvested on 3 september four treatments comprising f3n3 f4n3 b3n3 and b4n3 were replicated three times in 12 plots each with an area of 70 5 m2 where the symbols f3 f4 b3 b4 and n3 denote fresh water with 450 and 500 mm amounts brackish water with 450 and 500 mm and urea supplied at 600 kg hm 2 respectively each experimental plot was irrigated 10 times in total and every 6 9 d further details of the field experiment were reported by ning et al 2015 2 2 numerical modelling and model calibration based on the field experiment we developed the hydrus 2d model with modified rwu function by considering dynamic rld distribution and the effect of soil water and salt stress and simulated the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in the cotton field under fmdi where this model was used successfully in a previous study by ning et al 2015 during the irrigation season the simulated soil moisture results agreed well with the field measurements where the root mean square error rmse was consistently less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 65 the simulated and measured soil salinity distributions were also in good agreement with a maximal rmse of 8 84 ds m 1 and minimal r2 of 0 65 the results indicated that the hydrus 2d model with soil hydraulic parameters boundary conditions and the modified rwu function was well calibrated and suitable for simulating the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in a cotton ﬁeld under fmdi the simulated rectangular ﬂow domain included the soil proﬁle from the middle of the ﬁlm to the center of bare soil surface and the vertical distances were 150 cm in the ﬂow domain the upper boundary was separated by the ﬁlm into the mulched soil surface and bare soil surface the time variable flux boundary representing drip irrigation was imposed in the surface saturated zone of the mulched soil surface the rest mulch covered upper regions were considered as a zero flux boundary the time dependent atmospheric boundary condition was used to represent the soil surface without mulch cover zero ﬂux boundary conditions were set through the vertical edges of the ﬂow domain a free drainage boundary was specified at the base of the ﬂow region because the water table was deeper than 4 m below the soil surface in the case of solute transport the third type cauchy with the daily evaporation rate boundary conditions were assumed at the soil surface and at the free drainage boundary for solute transport and a no flux boundary was applied to the sides of the domain the measured irrigation water salinity eciw 0 38 ds m 1 was used as a time variable input for soil salinity prediction 2 3 irrigation schedule and as distribution scenarios after comprehensively considering the impacts of irrigation schedules irrigation amounts ia and intervals if and as distributions in the shihezi region 36 simulation scenarios were tested in this study these scenarios were deﬁned as combinations of two different as distributions with six ias and three ifs the recommended regional irrigation amount of 370 mm is equal to 70 cotton evapotranspiration 70etc in shihezi liu et al 2011 2013 so six irrigation amount gradients were set as 60etc 70etc 80etc 90etc 100etc and 110etc yang et al 2015 the ifs in cotton growing area of shihezi are usually 5 10 d liu et al 2011 2013 and thus three irrigation frequencies were set as 5 7 and 10 d moreover the two common as distributions is shown in fig 1 the lower as profile was reported by chen et al 2010 and the higher as profile was measured on 11 jun 2011 ning et al 2015 the soil moisture distributions on 11 jun 2011 were used as the initial conditions all simulations were performed from 11 jun to 2 sept 2011 the scenarios were shown in table 1 2 4 soil water and salt balance the water balance and salt balance are based on the law of conservation of mass the salt balances were founded on the water balances 2 4 1 water balance components the water balance in a given time interval plays a crucial role in the management of the soil water and irrigation system under field as an important water balance component the actual evapotranspiration et a mm of cotton was estimated using the water balance approach as follow kaddah and rhoades 1976 khatri et al 2003 phogat et al 2013 kisekka et al 2019 1 e t a i p δ s d where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm δs is the change of soil water storage in the root zone from 0 to 100 cm mm and d is the drainage mm moreover et a consists of the actual evaporation of soil e a and the actual transpiration of plant t a 2 4 2 salt balance components the salt balance in the root zone of an irrigated field over a certain time interval is related to the salt inputs and outputs the simplified salt balance can be represented by the following equation tanji and kielen 2002 2 δ s s s w s d where δss is the change of salt storage in the root zone g m 2 and s w and s d are the quantities of salts added in irrigation water and leached by the percolation water g m 2 it should be noted that the salt storage is in equilibrium when δss equals 0 and the soil salt is accumulated in the root zone when δss 0 whereas more salt is leaving the root zone when the δss 0 moreover the ratio of salt storage changes in the root zone can be expressed as follow 3 r s δ s s s 1 100 where rs is the ratio of salt accumulated or desalinated in the root zone and s 1 is the initial stage of soil salt storage in the root zone g m 2 2 5 estimation of cotton yield and wp from the farmer s viewpoint the crop yield y kg hm 2 is a crucial factor when adopting an irrigation schedule the crop evapotranspiration et a mm is related to the yield in the general case a second order polynomial relationship between the cotton yield and et a based on observation data for the water production function was reported by jia 2008 for an adjacent study under fmdi 4 y 1 48 1 0 2 e t a 2 21 566 e t a 2639 5 the wp of cotton wp eta is the cotton yield y produced per et a the irrigation wp wp i is y produced per unit amount of irrigation water applied i the common equations for estimating wp eta and wp i are given as follows perry et al 2009 molden et al 2010 phogat et al 2017 5 w p e t a y e t a 6 w p i y i 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components the water balance components obtained from the hydrus 2d model simulations in different scenarios are shown in appendix a 3 1 1 actual et components 3 1 1 1 actual evaporation e a under lower as scenarios fig 2a the average e a increased from 91 3 to 91 4 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a ranged from 22 71 to 21 73 under different ifs as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc as if prolonged from 5 to 10 d the mean e a reduced from 91 6 to 91 0 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a ranged from 22 01 to 21 89 under different ia treatments in scenarios 19 36 fig 2b the average e a increased from 95 2 to 96 6 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a reduced from 35 80 to 28 89 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the mean e a reduced slightly from 104 8 to 102 7 mm and the average ratios of e a to et a ranged from 31 22 to 32 20 as if elongated from 5 to 10 d the results above indicate that relatively insignificant effects were found for the ifs on e a and the ratios of e a to et a and the higher soil salt stress makes soil surface evaporation stronger 21 58 22 86 and 28 49 36 80 of et a occurred at the bare soil surface under the lower and higher as scenarios respectively 3 1 1 2 actual transpiration t a in scenarios 1 18 the mean t a flux increased from 310 6 to 328 4 mm and the average percentage of applied water extracted by plant transpiration decreased from 97 05 to 57 35 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the average t a flux decreased from 325 0 to 323 3 mm and the average ratios of t a to ia ranged from 75 20 to 75 75 as if increased from 5 to 10 d ia and if had similar effects on plant transpiration in scenarios 19 36 the mean t a flux increased from 170 7 to 237 8 mm and the average percentage of applied water extracted by plant transpiration decreased from 53 34 to 41 72 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the average t a flux decreased from 212 9 to 200 7 mm and the average ratio of t a to ia ranged from 48 73 to 45 76 as if increased from 5 to 10 d patel and rajput 2007 also reported similar results through 3 year field experiments that the transpiration decreased as the drip irrigation water decreased and the high frequency water application by drip irrigation positively affected the rwu segal et al 2006 under the same ia and if the t a values in scenarios 19 36 were lower than those in scenarios 1 18 fig 2 the reduced rwu in scenarios 19 36 was due to the higher as scenarios with greater soil salt stresses besides ia significantly influenced the plant transpiration under the higher as scenarios compared with the lower as scenarios set 5 d of if as an example the plant transpiration improved by 28 23 and 4 99 under the higher and lower as scenarios respectively as ia raised from 60etc to 110etc moreover crops growth has a self regulation function under salt stressed condition dudley et al 2008 the large amount of salt in the root zone may decrease the availability of soil water to crops by exerting osmotic stress and reduced transpiration 3 1 1 3 actual evapotranspiration et a for the lower and higher as scenarios the average et a varied from 401 8 to 419 9 mm and 265 9 334 4 mm respectively as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc fig 3 the mean values of et a reduced from 414 5 to 416 6 mm and 309 5 296 1 mm as if prolonged from 5 to 10 d respectively cai et al 2002 and wu et al 2014 also reported similar cotton evapotranspiration of 277 438 mm under fmdi in an adjacent area moreover the et a to et p varied from 79 78 to 84 46 and 51 47 67 82 under lower and higher as distributions scenarios respectively fig 2 fig 3 shows the linear relationship between ia and eta where the values of eta increased as ia increased regression analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of ia on eta the linear regression equations are described in fig 3 which shows the relationship between ia and eta was significant p 0 01 compared with the lower as scenarios eta increased significantly as ia increased under the higher as scenarios 3 1 1 4 crop water status crop water deficit index ω can be expressed as the ratio of the water deficit to the water need woli et al 2012 shi et al 2015 and thus it was employed to quantify the extent of the water deficit under soil water and salt stresses during the simulated periods as expected the average ω value was 17 66 under the as scenarios the value of ω decreased as ia increased the average ω values were 21 67 for 60etc 18 44 for 70etc 16 75 for 80etc 16 20 for 90etc 16 28 for 100etc and 16 62 for 110etc furthermore the value of ω increased as if prolonged the average ω were 17 08 for the 5 d if and 17 48 for the 7 d if and 18 43 for the 10 d if as stated above the average ω was 46 97 higher under the higher as scenarios the value of ω decreased as ia increased for a given ia the average ω were 56 85 for 60etc 51 93 for 70etc 47 93 for 80etc 44 41 for 90etc 41 49 for 100etc and 39 20 for 110etc moreover ω raised as if prolonged the mean ω were 45 50 for the 5 d if and 45 98 for 7 d if and 49 44 for 10 d if in general ω increased in a linear manner as ia increased under the different as scenarios figs 2 4 and 5 show that the effects of the higher as profiles on ω were more distinct than those of the lower as profiles 3 1 2 drainage and leaching fraction 3 1 2 1 drainage d accurately quantifying the leaching losses is highly challenging under field conditions van der laan et al 2014 especially under drip irrigation hanson et al 2008 a larger average d with 184 mm 98 8 288 5 mm occurred in scenarios 19 36 than scenarios 1 18 with a mean d with 97 3 mm 29 7 201 8 mm this comparison shows the higher soil salt stress severely limited rwu so some of the irrigation water subsequently drained away and the crop water deficit index decreased as the drainage increased fig 5 hanson et al 2008 evaluated that considerable leaching occurred under drip irrigation by using a numerical model where 7 7 11 3 of the irrigation water was leached from the root zone after the application of 60 of the potential et severe deﬁcit irrigation similar phenomena were also reported by dudley et al 2008 and phogat et al 2011 it is worth noting that the different if and ia treatments had significant impacts on d fig 5 where the d raised as ia increased or if prolonged the linear functional relationships between ia and d are shown in fig 4 in scenarios 19 36 the mean d values were 104 5 131 5 162 2 197 0 234 5 and 274 3 mm for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with the drainage amount with 60etc there were increases of 25 78 55 19 88 46 124 33 and 162 42 for ia with the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc for a given if the mean values of d were 179 0 mm for 5 d and 174 7 mm for 7 d and 198 4 mm for 10 d where the relative decrease was 2 40 for 7 d and the relative increase was 10 84 for 10 d compared with 5 d if similar trends were also found under the lower as profiles these results suggest that most of d occurred under a high ia especially with the longest if e g 10 d 3 1 2 2 leaching fraction lf the leaching fraction was used to quantify the leaching rate wu et al 2017 and it was found to be greatly influenced by the soil salinity distribution in the root zone ning et al 2020 as illustrated in figs 2 and 5 the lf ranged from 9 26 to 35 40 mean 20 17 in scenarios 1 18 and from 30 88 to 50 62 mean 40 33 in scenarios 19 36 lf raised as ia increased specifically the mean lfs under the lower as scenarios were 10 08 11 15 55 21 74 28 33 and 34 33 for each ia ranging from 60etc to 110etc the relative increases compared with 60etc were 9 21 54 31 115 81 181 20 and 240 75 for ia ranging from 70etc to 110etc for a given if the mean values of lf were 19 81 for 5 d 19 54 for 7 d and 21 16 for 10 d when compared with the 5 d if the relative decrease was 1 37 for the 7 d and relative increase was 6 82 for 10 d similar phenomena were also obtained in scenarios 19 36 3 1 3 soil water storage δs the δs values increased and compensated by irrigation water under scenarios 5 and 7 36 and the δs values were in deficit under scenarios 1 4 and 6 the soil water storage deficits ranged from 2 4 to 50 3 mm 1 91 10 76 of the applied irrigation water in scenarios 1 4 and 6 and the increase in δs ranged from 2 4 to 45 5 mm 0 65 8 of the applied irrigation water in scenarios 5 and 7 18 the δs ranged from 28 5 to 50 3 mm 5 90 10 93 of the applied irrigation water in scenarios 19 36 3 2 salt balance components the salt balance components obtained from the hydrus 2d model simulations for each scenario are shown in appendix a overall the initial soil salt storage s 1 values in the root zone were 1080 8 g m 2 for scenarios 1 18 and 13 601 7 g m 2 for scenarios 19 36 it should be noted that the salts s w added with the ia increased by 64 74 84 94 104 and 114 g m 2 from 60etc to 110etc 3 2 1 salts leached by percolation water s d as ia increased the amount of s d increased with the rise in percolation under different as scenarios two clearly linear functional relationships between ia and s d and d and s d are shown in fig 6 the s d values varied from 75 99 to 345 56 g m 2 in scenarios 1 18 the mean amounts of salt leached ranged from 81 5 to 337 8 g m 2 for 60etc to 110etc compared with the mean salt amounts leached under 60etc s d increased by 25 25 87 35 166 82 246 01 and 314 58 for 70etc to 110etc the mean s d values were 193 4 190 2 and 203 2 g m 2 at if of 5 7 and 10 d respectively compared with the 5 d if the mean s d decreased by 1 65 with the 7 d if and increased by 5 08 with 10 d if these results indicate that decreasing if and increasing ia could promote the leaching of salts zeng et al 2014 also reported that increases in ia could accelerate soil salt leaching similarly s d also increased rapidly from 2803 7 to 5405 9 g m 2 under scenarios 19 36 the mean amounts of s d were 2919 7 3490 8 4031 7 4529 0 4951 2 and 5303 6 g m 2 under the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the mean values of s d increased by 19 56 38 08 55 12 69 58 and 81 65 with the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean s d values were 4160 8 g m 2 for the 5 d if and 4055 9 g m 2 for the 7 d if and 4396 4 g m 2 for 10 d if compared with 5 d if s d decreased by 2 52 with 7 d if and increased by 5 66 for 10 d if 3 2 2 changes in salt storage in the root zone δss δss reflects the leaching or accumulation of salt during the irrigation season overall the desalination amount were 12 0 234 6 g m 2 under the lower as profiles during the irrigation season the mean desalination amounts were 17 5 28 1 68 7 123 4 178 0 and 223 8 g m 2 with the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc and the mean desalination amounts were 104 4 101 2 and 114 2 g m 2 with the if of 5 7 and 10 d respectively the desalination processes occurred in the root zone during the irrigation season in scenarios 19 36 the average amounts of salt leaving from the root zone were 2855 7 3416 8 3947 7 4435 1 4847 2 and 5189 6 g m 2 for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the amounts of salt leached from the root zone increased by 19 64 38 24 55 30 69 74 and 81 73 under the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean amounts of salt leached from the root zone were 4071 8 g m 2 with the 5 d if 3966 9 g m 2 with the 7 d if and 4307 4 g m 2 with the 10 d if natural desalination processes occurred in the root zone when using the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under the lower and higher as profiles li et al 2012 the results also showed increasing ia and prolonging if e g 10 d could greatly promote soil desalination during the irrigation season similar conclusions also observed that salt leaching was promoted by increasing ia by wang et al 2013 and prolonging if with the same ia by li and wang 2009 in cotton fields under fmdi luo 2014 conducted an extensive field survey in a nearby region and reported a desalination trend 1182 6 g m 2 per year in the root zone in cotton fields with high salinity and their results were basically consistent with those obtained in the present study 3 2 3 salt storage change ratio under lower as scenarios the mean desalination ratios were 1 62 2 60 6 35 11 42 16 47 and 20 71 under the scenarios ranging from 60etc to 110etc and mean desalination ratios were 9 66 9 36 and 10 57 with the if with the 5 7 and 10 d respectively in scenarios 19 36 the desalination ratios ranged from 21 14 to 38 91 the mean desalinated ratios in the root zone increased from 21 to 38 15 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc and from 29 94 to 31 67 as if extended 3 3 cotton yield and wp the et a values for different treatments in the ﬁeld experiment of 2012 were estimated with the water balance approach eq 1 fig 7 shows the relationship between cotton yield and et a obtained by jia 2008 in an adjacent area under the same cotton planting mode the measured cotton yield and corresponding et a for the ﬁeld experiment conducted in 2012 are also plotted in fig 7 on the whole the curve for the function obtained by jia 2008 agreed well with the measured cotton yield and the corresponding et a for different treatments conducted in the field experiment of 2012 thus we coupled the hydrus 2d model by considered dynamic rld distribution and soil water and salt stresses for accurately assessing et a with the water production function for cotton obtained by jia 2008 in order to evaluate the cotton yield under fmdi for each scenario based on the verified relationship between the crop yield and et a 3 3 1 cotton yield y the different values of ia and if had little effect on the cotton yields 3608 3828 kg hm 2 in scenarios 1 18 fig 8a however fig 8b shows that the cotton yields clearly differed under the higher as scenarios specifically the mean yields were 2048 2309 2501 2673 2811 and 2917 kg hm 2 for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the mean yields increased by 11 78 22 14 30 54 37 29 and 42 47 for the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean yields were 2610 kg hm 2 with the 5 d if and 2580 kg hm 2 with the 7 d if and 2439 kg hm 2 with the 10 d if compared with the 5 d if the cotton yield decreased by 1 15 with the 7 d and by 6 54 with the 10 d as shown in fig 8 a higher cotton yield could be gained with a larger ia or shorter if and cotton yield decreased significantly under the longest if e g 10 d with the same ia especially under the higher as distribution conditions the cotton yields calculated 1931 2971 kg hm 2 under the higher as profile scenarios were close to the cotton yields measured in the field 2100 2685 kg hm 2 under a severely high salinity soil 8 g salt per kg of soil as reported by zhang et al 2004 in the same study area similarly the cotton yields estimated 3608 3828 kg hm 2 under lower as profile scenarios ranged between the cotton yields measured in the field in the same area by wang et al 2016 with 2620 3367 kg hm 2 and by zhang et al 2004 with 4815 4920 kg hm 2 in a low salinity soil 0 8 g salt per kg of soil moreover the cotton yield from the severely high salinity soil with a high frequency of irrigation was 28 higher compared with that using low frequency irrigation under fmdi but there were no significant differences in the cotton yields with high and low frequency irrigation treatment in a low salinity soil in the same region zhang et al 2004 segal et al 2006 reported that high frequency drip irrigation was positively enhanced the crop yield 3 3 2 water productivity wp wp eta varied within a narrow range from 0 90 to 0 91 kg m 3 in scenarios 1 18 and from 0 75 to 0 88 kg m 3 in scenarios 19 36 in the same region similar wp eta values were reported for cotton under fmdi with 0 89 1 04 kg m 3 by ning et al 2013 and 0 81 1 13 kg m 3 under different drip irrigation regimes by kang et al 2012 a clear significant relationship was identified where wp i increased as ia decreased specifically the minimum wp i of 0 66 in scenarios 16 and 17 reduced significantly by 42 46 compared with the maximum wp i of 1 15 in scenario 1 under the lower as scenarios similarly the minimum wp i of 0 50 in scenario 36 reduced significantly by 14 41 compared with the maximum wp i of 0 67 in scenario 19 under scenarios 19 36 similarly a mean cotton wp i of 1 0 0 3 kg m 3 was determined in the same region during the last 34 years by wang et al 2015 3 4 recommend irrigation practices for cotton under fmdi due to a lack of precise guidance on irrigation management cotton production by farmers and the water productivity still remain at a low level kang et al 2012 feike et al 2017 thus by treating ia and if as the independent variables y wp eta and wp i were employed as the response variables several binary quadratic regression equations were developed using multiple nonlinear regression based on the ia and if data to predict y wp eta and wp i table 2 these binary quadratic regression equations were used to calculate the ia and if values required to maximize the parameters for the yield wp eta and wp i however it was difficult to simultaneously obtain the maximum values for the yield wp eta and wp i the maximum cotton yields of 3821 and 2956 kg hm 2 were achieved with 474 mm of irrigation water under 5 d if in scenarios 1 18 and 570 mm of irrigation water under 6 5 87 d if in scenarios 19 36 the largest wp eta values of 0 91 and 0 87 kg m 3 were achieved with 478 mm of ia under 5 d interval in scenarios 1 18 and 570 mm of ia with an if close to 7 6 63 days in scenarios 19 36 the wp i values were maximized at 1 14 and 0 67 kg m 3 by the application of 320 mm of ia with 5 d if table 3 under different simulation scenarios as expected high frequency irrigation e g 5 7 d was beneficial for simultaneously increasing the cotton yield and wp under fmdi 4 conclusions the aims of this study were to understand the effects of the as distributions and irrigation management factors on the soil water salt balance crop water status and leaching fraction we also evaluated the effects of different as distributions and irrigation management methods on the cotton yield and wp the soil salt stress restricted root water uptake so the higher as scenarios obtained lower t a and et a values but higher e a d and δs values than the lower as distributions t a et a d and δs were significantly affected by the irrigation application the effects of the higher as profiles on ω were more distinct than those of the lower as profiles ω decreased in a linear manner as ia increased and ω increased as if prolonged lf ranged from 9 26 to 35 40 in scenarios 1 18 and 30 88 50 62 in scenarios 19 36 under the lower and higher as scenarios the amounts of salt leached below the root zone were 76 0 345 6 and 2803 7 5405 9 g m 2 respectively during the irrigation season the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under fmdi led to natural desalination processes of 12 0 231 6 g m 2 and 2739 7 5291 9 g m 2 under the lower and higher as scenarios respectively higher cotton yields could be gained with a larger ia or shorter if the wp eta and wp i values were greater with the lower as profiles than the higher as profiles under the same ia and if scenarios recommended irrigation practices were proposed to achieve the maximum values for the yield wp eta and wp i thus in general the as distribution and irrigation schedule will have substantial effects on the soil water salt balance and wp under fmdi moreover the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under fmdi has multiple effects in terms of supplying water for roots uptake and leaching salt from the root zone as well as increasing the cotton yield the

10245,film mulched drip irrigation fmdi has clear benefits for saving water and promoting cotton production in xinjiang china due to the complicated transport processes for soil water and salt under fmdi it is still challenging to systematically answer the questions such as the soil water and salt balance in the root zone cotton yield and water productivity wp under typical planting modes and irrigation schedules previously we proposed a hydrus 2d model with modified root water uptake rwu function and simulated the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in cotton fields under fmdi but we ignored the effects of the cotton yield and wp from the perspective of smart irrigation it is necessary to evaluate the effects of irrigation on crop production wp and soil environments thus in the present study our hydrus 2d model coupled with a validated crop water production function was applied to evaluate the effects of typical irrigation schedules and the antecedent soil salinity distributions on the soil water salt balance and plant water status and leaching fraction as well as the cotton yield and wp under fmdi in 36 scenarios these scenarios included two antecedent soil salinity distributions as six irrigation amounts ia and three irrigation intervals if compared with the lower as scenarios the higher as scenarios obtained lower cotton transpiration and evapotranspiration but higher evaporation drainage and soil water storage and the crop water status and leaching fraction were also increased due to the soil salt stress restricting rwu the salt balance results indicated the current irrigation scheduling under fmdi leads to desalination processes in different scenarios moreover the cotton yield and the corresponding wp for cotton wp eta and irrigation wp i were estimated under different as scenarios binary quadratic regression equations were developed based on ia and if data to predict the cotton yield wp eta and wp i appropriate irrigation strategies are recommended based on the results our results could provide a scientific basis for optimizing irrigation schedules and improving the understanding of irrigation management under fmdi among local farmers in xinjiang keywords cotton evapotranspiration components film mulched drip irrigation irrigation practices leaching fraction soil water and salt management 1 introduction water scarcity and soil salinity are two major threats to global agricultural production and sustainable development especially in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2010 in the xinjiang region of china due to the arid desert climate and widespread requirement for agricultural irrigation in saline soils the film mulched drip irrigation fmdi technique has been adopted widely to replace traditional surface flood irrigation for saving more water and leaching salts away from the shallow root zone and increasing crop s yields xinjiang is the largest cotton planting region in china with about 58 5 of planted area and 71 of the yield and more than 2 106 hm2 of the cotton is grown under fmdi tuerxun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 almost half of local farm laborers are engaged in cotton growing ning et al 2013 up until now several typical planting and management modes have been developed for cotton based on research and practices experience for example a traditional wide narrow row spacing mode conventionally referred to as one film two tapes and four rows is often employed in cotton cultivation ning et al 2013 2014 2015 2019 as for the irrigation schedule the recommended irrigation amount is about 370 mm at a frequency of once every 5 10 d in northern xinjiang liu et al 2011 2013 wu et al 2014 however an extensive survey was conducted based on 228 cotton producing farms in xinjiang with water shortages and great differences were found in terms of the cotton production and water use efficiency wue where most were at low levels feike et al 2017 these results may be attributed to the lack of systematic guidance regarding water management for cotton producers kang et al 2012 and the inappropriate typical irrigation schedules recommended for different actual conditions li et al 2013 wang et al 2019 from the perspective of smart irrigation we need to maximize our understanding or predictions of the effects of irrigation on crop production wue and even environments nevertheless it is still very difficult to systematically and clearly answer questions regarding the soil water and salt balance in the root zone plant water deficit status leaching fraction yield and water productivity wp under the typical planting modes and irrigation schedules employed for cotton production under fmdi in northern xinjiang based on field experiment results or numerical simulations the possible reasons for these practical difficulties include the following 1 the actual cotton cultivation environments are usually very complicated and they differ from each other in many ways thus experimental results obtained in specific field situations are not readily applied under other conditions numerical simulation is used increasingly frequently to simulate the two dimensional soil water and salt dynamics in the soil cotton system and to estimate wp for cotton under fmdi but it is still a tremendous challenging task to obtain accurately and timely roots distribution for simulating root water uptake rwu of cotton during the numerical simulation process hence the root distribution is often assumed to be a fixed or unchanging function chuan et al 2008 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 z h wang et al 2014 z m wang et al 2014 which obviously fails to represent the actual situation thereby leading to errors such as underestimating evapotranspiration and these errors will affect the soil water salt balance calculations and the estimated crop yields according to the simulation results roberts et al 2009 wei et al 2015 he et al 2018 2 frankly speaking the current typical irrigation schedules in northern xinjiang were basically determined based on cotton fields with low soil salinity chen et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 however large variations in the soil salinity are observed in the cotton fields under fmdi in northern xinjiang where the mean electrical conductivities of the saturated soil extracts ece in the root zone range from a lower value of 2 33 ds m 1 chen et al 2010 to values higher than 30 ds m 1 wang et al 2012 these variations in the soil salinity will inevitably affect the soil water and salt transport in the soil cotton system and result in differences in the cotton yield and wp thus further attention should be paid to the effects of different initial soil salinity distributions on the soil water and salt balance in the root zone and wp under the typical irrigation schedules 3 the presence of salt in the root zone lowers down the soil water potential and thus decreases rwu i e transpiration which may result in some of the irrigated water is not consumed by crops in the arid xinjiang the surplus water that exceeds the root uptake capacity will be transported downward and carry salt away from the root zone to the deeper soil layer therefore fmdi has functions of supplying water for roots uptake and leaching salt from the root zone accurate evaluations and improvements of the current typical irrigation schedules may be facilitated if the leaching effect could be quantified based on the soil water and salt balance especially for highly saline cotton fields recently the normalized root length density nrld distribution of cotton under fmdi was generalized as an exponential function independent of the soil environment cotton species planting modes and growing stages ning et al 2015 2019 with known changing rooting depth which is much more easily to be obtained than root length density rld distribution zuo et al 2004 2013 the generalized nrld function can describe the dynamic rld distributions for cotton under fmdi in order to successfully simulate the two dimensional soil water flow and salt transport in a soil cotton system under fmdi ning et al 2015 it would be useful to evaluate the soil water salt balance and wp under the typical irrigation schedules employed for cotton under fmdi in northern xinjiang using the numerical simulation method however a single model is not adequate for simultaneously estimating the crop yield wp and the soil water salt balance in the root zone for cotton under fmdi wang et al 2017 roy et al 2019 especially under soil salt stress thus in the present study we established a validated hydrological model coupled with a crop water production function to address this problem the objectives of this study were to systematically assess the impacts of the typical irrigation schedules and antecedent soil salinity as distributions on the soil water and salt balance plant water status leaching fraction yield and wp for cotton under fmdi in northern xinjiang by using a numerical simulation method this approach helps to understand irrigation management and to optimize the irrigation schedules for use in future practical applications in order to increase the yield and wp under fmdi in northern xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were conducted at the manas cotton breeding station of xinjiang academy of agricultural sciences 44 18 n 86 22 e altitude 438 m during 2011 and 2012 the station located in the eastern manas river valley and southern alluvial plain of junggar basin local climate is temperate continental dry with average annual temperature of 6 6 annual precipitation of 147 mm and evaporation of 1500 2100 mm and the groundwater table depth is more than 4 m below the soil surface li and wang 2009 cotton gossypium hirsutum l cv 07 5 under fmdi was planted on 28 apr 118 doy day of year using a traditional wide narrow row spacing mode viz one film two tapes and four rows mode which has the longest spreading time and it is applied most extensively in xinjiang cai et al 2002 chen et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 wang et al 2019 the harvest commenced on 2 sept 245 doy in 2011 in moderately severely salt affected soils four treatments with three replicate plots each covered 64 m2 were conducted including two irrigation water amounts of 300 and 375 mm and two fertilizer application rates of 255 and 417 5 kg hm 2 in 2012 cotton under fmdi was sowed on 28 april using the super wide ﬁlm mulch spacing mode viz one film three tapes and six rows mode and harvested on 3 september four treatments comprising f3n3 f4n3 b3n3 and b4n3 were replicated three times in 12 plots each with an area of 70 5 m2 where the symbols f3 f4 b3 b4 and n3 denote fresh water with 450 and 500 mm amounts brackish water with 450 and 500 mm and urea supplied at 600 kg hm 2 respectively each experimental plot was irrigated 10 times in total and every 6 9 d further details of the field experiment were reported by ning et al 2015 2 2 numerical modelling and model calibration based on the field experiment we developed the hydrus 2d model with modified rwu function by considering dynamic rld distribution and the effect of soil water and salt stress and simulated the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in the cotton field under fmdi where this model was used successfully in a previous study by ning et al 2015 during the irrigation season the simulated soil moisture results agreed well with the field measurements where the root mean square error rmse was consistently less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 65 the simulated and measured soil salinity distributions were also in good agreement with a maximal rmse of 8 84 ds m 1 and minimal r2 of 0 65 the results indicated that the hydrus 2d model with soil hydraulic parameters boundary conditions and the modified rwu function was well calibrated and suitable for simulating the two dimensional soil water flow and solute transport in a cotton ﬁeld under fmdi the simulated rectangular ﬂow domain included the soil proﬁle from the middle of the ﬁlm to the center of bare soil surface and the vertical distances were 150 cm in the ﬂow domain the upper boundary was separated by the ﬁlm into the mulched soil surface and bare soil surface the time variable flux boundary representing drip irrigation was imposed in the surface saturated zone of the mulched soil surface the rest mulch covered upper regions were considered as a zero flux boundary the time dependent atmospheric boundary condition was used to represent the soil surface without mulch cover zero ﬂux boundary conditions were set through the vertical edges of the ﬂow domain a free drainage boundary was specified at the base of the ﬂow region because the water table was deeper than 4 m below the soil surface in the case of solute transport the third type cauchy with the daily evaporation rate boundary conditions were assumed at the soil surface and at the free drainage boundary for solute transport and a no flux boundary was applied to the sides of the domain the measured irrigation water salinity eciw 0 38 ds m 1 was used as a time variable input for soil salinity prediction 2 3 irrigation schedule and as distribution scenarios after comprehensively considering the impacts of irrigation schedules irrigation amounts ia and intervals if and as distributions in the shihezi region 36 simulation scenarios were tested in this study these scenarios were deﬁned as combinations of two different as distributions with six ias and three ifs the recommended regional irrigation amount of 370 mm is equal to 70 cotton evapotranspiration 70etc in shihezi liu et al 2011 2013 so six irrigation amount gradients were set as 60etc 70etc 80etc 90etc 100etc and 110etc yang et al 2015 the ifs in cotton growing area of shihezi are usually 5 10 d liu et al 2011 2013 and thus three irrigation frequencies were set as 5 7 and 10 d moreover the two common as distributions is shown in fig 1 the lower as profile was reported by chen et al 2010 and the higher as profile was measured on 11 jun 2011 ning et al 2015 the soil moisture distributions on 11 jun 2011 were used as the initial conditions all simulations were performed from 11 jun to 2 sept 2011 the scenarios were shown in table 1 2 4 soil water and salt balance the water balance and salt balance are based on the law of conservation of mass the salt balances were founded on the water balances 2 4 1 water balance components the water balance in a given time interval plays a crucial role in the management of the soil water and irrigation system under field as an important water balance component the actual evapotranspiration et a mm of cotton was estimated using the water balance approach as follow kaddah and rhoades 1976 khatri et al 2003 phogat et al 2013 kisekka et al 2019 1 e t a i p δ s d where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm δs is the change of soil water storage in the root zone from 0 to 100 cm mm and d is the drainage mm moreover et a consists of the actual evaporation of soil e a and the actual transpiration of plant t a 2 4 2 salt balance components the salt balance in the root zone of an irrigated field over a certain time interval is related to the salt inputs and outputs the simplified salt balance can be represented by the following equation tanji and kielen 2002 2 δ s s s w s d where δss is the change of salt storage in the root zone g m 2 and s w and s d are the quantities of salts added in irrigation water and leached by the percolation water g m 2 it should be noted that the salt storage is in equilibrium when δss equals 0 and the soil salt is accumulated in the root zone when δss 0 whereas more salt is leaving the root zone when the δss 0 moreover the ratio of salt storage changes in the root zone can be expressed as follow 3 r s δ s s s 1 100 where rs is the ratio of salt accumulated or desalinated in the root zone and s 1 is the initial stage of soil salt storage in the root zone g m 2 2 5 estimation of cotton yield and wp from the farmer s viewpoint the crop yield y kg hm 2 is a crucial factor when adopting an irrigation schedule the crop evapotranspiration et a mm is related to the yield in the general case a second order polynomial relationship between the cotton yield and et a based on observation data for the water production function was reported by jia 2008 for an adjacent study under fmdi 4 y 1 48 1 0 2 e t a 2 21 566 e t a 2639 5 the wp of cotton wp eta is the cotton yield y produced per et a the irrigation wp wp i is y produced per unit amount of irrigation water applied i the common equations for estimating wp eta and wp i are given as follows perry et al 2009 molden et al 2010 phogat et al 2017 5 w p e t a y e t a 6 w p i y i 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components the water balance components obtained from the hydrus 2d model simulations in different scenarios are shown in appendix a 3 1 1 actual et components 3 1 1 1 actual evaporation e a under lower as scenarios fig 2a the average e a increased from 91 3 to 91 4 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a ranged from 22 71 to 21 73 under different ifs as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc as if prolonged from 5 to 10 d the mean e a reduced from 91 6 to 91 0 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a ranged from 22 01 to 21 89 under different ia treatments in scenarios 19 36 fig 2b the average e a increased from 95 2 to 96 6 mm and the mean ratios of e a to et a reduced from 35 80 to 28 89 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the mean e a reduced slightly from 104 8 to 102 7 mm and the average ratios of e a to et a ranged from 31 22 to 32 20 as if elongated from 5 to 10 d the results above indicate that relatively insignificant effects were found for the ifs on e a and the ratios of e a to et a and the higher soil salt stress makes soil surface evaporation stronger 21 58 22 86 and 28 49 36 80 of et a occurred at the bare soil surface under the lower and higher as scenarios respectively 3 1 1 2 actual transpiration t a in scenarios 1 18 the mean t a flux increased from 310 6 to 328 4 mm and the average percentage of applied water extracted by plant transpiration decreased from 97 05 to 57 35 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the average t a flux decreased from 325 0 to 323 3 mm and the average ratios of t a to ia ranged from 75 20 to 75 75 as if increased from 5 to 10 d ia and if had similar effects on plant transpiration in scenarios 19 36 the mean t a flux increased from 170 7 to 237 8 mm and the average percentage of applied water extracted by plant transpiration decreased from 53 34 to 41 72 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc the average t a flux decreased from 212 9 to 200 7 mm and the average ratio of t a to ia ranged from 48 73 to 45 76 as if increased from 5 to 10 d patel and rajput 2007 also reported similar results through 3 year field experiments that the transpiration decreased as the drip irrigation water decreased and the high frequency water application by drip irrigation positively affected the rwu segal et al 2006 under the same ia and if the t a values in scenarios 19 36 were lower than those in scenarios 1 18 fig 2 the reduced rwu in scenarios 19 36 was due to the higher as scenarios with greater soil salt stresses besides ia significantly influenced the plant transpiration under the higher as scenarios compared with the lower as scenarios set 5 d of if as an example the plant transpiration improved by 28 23 and 4 99 under the higher and lower as scenarios respectively as ia raised from 60etc to 110etc moreover crops growth has a self regulation function under salt stressed condition dudley et al 2008 the large amount of salt in the root zone may decrease the availability of soil water to crops by exerting osmotic stress and reduced transpiration 3 1 1 3 actual evapotranspiration et a for the lower and higher as scenarios the average et a varied from 401 8 to 419 9 mm and 265 9 334 4 mm respectively as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc fig 3 the mean values of et a reduced from 414 5 to 416 6 mm and 309 5 296 1 mm as if prolonged from 5 to 10 d respectively cai et al 2002 and wu et al 2014 also reported similar cotton evapotranspiration of 277 438 mm under fmdi in an adjacent area moreover the et a to et p varied from 79 78 to 84 46 and 51 47 67 82 under lower and higher as distributions scenarios respectively fig 2 fig 3 shows the linear relationship between ia and eta where the values of eta increased as ia increased regression analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of ia on eta the linear regression equations are described in fig 3 which shows the relationship between ia and eta was significant p 0 01 compared with the lower as scenarios eta increased significantly as ia increased under the higher as scenarios 3 1 1 4 crop water status crop water deficit index ω can be expressed as the ratio of the water deficit to the water need woli et al 2012 shi et al 2015 and thus it was employed to quantify the extent of the water deficit under soil water and salt stresses during the simulated periods as expected the average ω value was 17 66 under the as scenarios the value of ω decreased as ia increased the average ω values were 21 67 for 60etc 18 44 for 70etc 16 75 for 80etc 16 20 for 90etc 16 28 for 100etc and 16 62 for 110etc furthermore the value of ω increased as if prolonged the average ω were 17 08 for the 5 d if and 17 48 for the 7 d if and 18 43 for the 10 d if as stated above the average ω was 46 97 higher under the higher as scenarios the value of ω decreased as ia increased for a given ia the average ω were 56 85 for 60etc 51 93 for 70etc 47 93 for 80etc 44 41 for 90etc 41 49 for 100etc and 39 20 for 110etc moreover ω raised as if prolonged the mean ω were 45 50 for the 5 d if and 45 98 for 7 d if and 49 44 for 10 d if in general ω increased in a linear manner as ia increased under the different as scenarios figs 2 4 and 5 show that the effects of the higher as profiles on ω were more distinct than those of the lower as profiles 3 1 2 drainage and leaching fraction 3 1 2 1 drainage d accurately quantifying the leaching losses is highly challenging under field conditions van der laan et al 2014 especially under drip irrigation hanson et al 2008 a larger average d with 184 mm 98 8 288 5 mm occurred in scenarios 19 36 than scenarios 1 18 with a mean d with 97 3 mm 29 7 201 8 mm this comparison shows the higher soil salt stress severely limited rwu so some of the irrigation water subsequently drained away and the crop water deficit index decreased as the drainage increased fig 5 hanson et al 2008 evaluated that considerable leaching occurred under drip irrigation by using a numerical model where 7 7 11 3 of the irrigation water was leached from the root zone after the application of 60 of the potential et severe deﬁcit irrigation similar phenomena were also reported by dudley et al 2008 and phogat et al 2011 it is worth noting that the different if and ia treatments had significant impacts on d fig 5 where the d raised as ia increased or if prolonged the linear functional relationships between ia and d are shown in fig 4 in scenarios 19 36 the mean d values were 104 5 131 5 162 2 197 0 234 5 and 274 3 mm for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with the drainage amount with 60etc there were increases of 25 78 55 19 88 46 124 33 and 162 42 for ia with the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc for a given if the mean values of d were 179 0 mm for 5 d and 174 7 mm for 7 d and 198 4 mm for 10 d where the relative decrease was 2 40 for 7 d and the relative increase was 10 84 for 10 d compared with 5 d if similar trends were also found under the lower as profiles these results suggest that most of d occurred under a high ia especially with the longest if e g 10 d 3 1 2 2 leaching fraction lf the leaching fraction was used to quantify the leaching rate wu et al 2017 and it was found to be greatly

scenario are shown in appendix a overall the initial soil salt storage s 1 values in the root zone were 1080 8 g m 2 for scenarios 1 18 and 13 601 7 g m 2 for scenarios 19 36 it should be noted that the salts s w added with the ia increased by 64 74 84 94 104 and 114 g m 2 from 60etc to 110etc 3 2 1 salts leached by percolation water s d as ia increased the amount of s d increased with the rise in percolation under different as scenarios two clearly linear functional relationships between ia and s d and d and s d are shown in fig 6 the s d values varied from 75 99 to 345 56 g m 2 in scenarios 1 18 the mean amounts of salt leached ranged from 81 5 to 337 8 g m 2 for 60etc to 110etc compared with the mean salt amounts leached under 60etc s d increased by 25 25 87 35 166 82 246 01

increased by 5 08 with 10 d if these results indicate that decreasing if and increasing ia could promote the leaching of salts zeng et al 2014 also reported that increases in ia could accelerate soil salt leaching similarly s d also increased rapidly from 2803 7 to 5405 9 g m 2 under scenarios 19 36 the mean amounts of s d were 2919 7 3490 8 4031 7 4529 0 4951 2 and 5303 6 g m 2 under the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the mean values of s d increased by 19 56 38 08 55 12 69 58 and 81 65 with the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean s d values were 4160 8 g m 2 for the 5 d if and 4055 9 g m 2 for the 7 d if and 4396 4 g m 2 for 10 d if compared with 5 d if s d decreased by 2 52 with 7 d if and increased by 5 66 for 10 d if 3 2 2 changes in salt storage in the root zone δss δss reflects the leaching or accumulation of salt during the irrigation season overall the desalination amount were 12 0 234 6 g m 2 under the lower as profiles during the irrigation season the mean desalination amounts were 17 5 28 1 68 7 123 4 178 0 and 223 8 g m 2 with the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc and the mean desalination amounts were 104 4 101 2 and 114 2 g m 2 with the if of 5 7 and 10 d respectively the desalination processes occurred in the root zone during the irrigation season in scenarios 19 36 the average amounts of salt leaving from the root zone were 2855 7 3416 8 3947 7 4435 1 4847 2 and 5189 6 g m 2 for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the amounts of salt leached from the root zone increased by 19 64 38 24 55 30 69 74 and 81 73 under the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean amounts of salt leached from the root zone were 4071 8 g m 2 with the 5 d if 3966 9 g m 2 with the 7 d if and 4307 4 g m 2 with the 10 d if natural desalination processes occurred in the root zone when using the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under the lower and higher as profiles li et al 2012 the results also showed increasing ia and prolonging if e g 10 d could greatly promote soil desalination during the irrigation season similar conclusions also observed that salt leaching was promoted by increasing ia by wang et al 2013 and prolonging if with the same ia by li and wang 2009 in cotton fields under fmdi luo 2014 conducted an extensive field survey in a nearby region and reported a desalination trend 1182 6 g m 2 per year in the root zone in cotton fields with high salinity and their results were basically consistent with those obtained in the present study 3 2 3 salt storage change ratio under lower as scenarios the mean desalination ratios were 1 62 2 60 6 35 11 42 16 47 and 20 71 under the scenarios ranging from 60etc to 110etc and mean desalination ratios were 9 66 9 36 and 10 57 with the if with the 5 7 and 10 d respectively in scenarios 19 36 the desalination ratios ranged from 21 14 to 38 91 the mean desalinated ratios in the root zone increased from 21 to 38 15 as ia increased from 60etc to 110etc and from 29 94 to 31 67 as if extended 3 3 cotton yield and wp the et a values for different treatments in the ﬁeld experiment of 2012 were estimated with the water balance approach eq 1 fig 7 shows the relationship between cotton yield and et a obtained by jia 2008 in an adjacent area under the same cotton planting mode the measured cotton yield and corresponding et a for the ﬁeld experiment conducted in 2012 are also plotted in fig 7 on the whole the curve for the function obtained by jia 2008 agreed well with the measured cotton yield and the corresponding et a for different treatments conducted in the field experiment of 2012 thus we coupled the hydrus 2d model by considered dynamic rld distribution and soil water and salt stresses for accurately assessing et a with the water production function for cotton obtained by jia 2008 in order to evaluate the cotton yield under fmdi for each scenario based on the verified relationship between the crop yield and et a 3 3 1 cotton yield y the different values of ia and if had little effect on the cotton yields 3608 3828 kg hm 2 in scenarios 1 18 fig 8a however fig 8b shows that the cotton yields clearly differed under the higher as scenarios specifically the mean yields were 2048 2309 2501 2673 2811 and 2917 kg hm 2 for the treatments ranging from 60etc to 110etc compared with 60etc the mean yields increased by 11 78 22 14 30 54 37 29 and 42 47 for the treatments ranging from 70etc to 110etc the mean yields were 2610 kg hm 2 with the 5 d if and 2580 kg hm 2 with the 7 d if and 2439 kg hm 2 with the 10 d if compared with the 5 d if the cotton yield decreased by 1 15 with the 7 d and by 6 54 with the 10 d as shown in fig 8 a higher cotton yield could be gained with a larger ia or shorter if and cotton yield decreased significantly under the longest if e g 10 d with the same ia especially under the higher as distribution conditions the cotton yields calculated 1931 2971 kg hm 2 under the higher as profile scenarios were close to the cotton yields measured in the field 2100 2685 kg hm 2 under a severely high salinity soil 8 g salt per kg of soil as reported by zhang et al 2004 in the same study area similarly the cotton yields estimated 3608 3828 kg hm 2 under lower as profile scenarios ranged between the cotton yields measured in the field in the same area by wang et al 2016 with 2620 3367 kg hm 2 and by zhang et al 2004 with 4815 4920 kg hm 2 in a low salinity soil 0 8 g salt per kg of soil moreover the cotton yield from the severely high salinity soil with a high frequency of irrigation was 28 higher compared with that using low frequency irrigation under fmdi but there were no significant differences in the cotton yields with high and low frequency irrigation treatment in a low salinity soil in the same region zhang et al 2004 segal et al 2006 reported that high frequency drip irrigation was positively enhanced the crop yield 3 3 2 water productivity wp wp eta varied within a narrow range from 0 90 to 0 91 kg m 3 in scenarios 1 18 and from 0 75 to 0 88 kg m 3 in scenarios 19 36 in the same region similar wp eta values were reported for cotton under fmdi with 0 89 1 04 kg m 3 by ning et al 2013 and 0 81 1 13 kg m 3 under different drip irrigation regimes by kang et al 2012 a clear significant relationship was identified where wp i increased as ia decreased specifically the minimum wp i of 0 66 in scenarios 16 and 17 reduced significantly by 42 46 compared with the maximum wp i of 1 15 in scenario 1 under the lower as scenarios similarly the minimum wp i of 0 50 in scenario 36 reduced significantly by 14 41 compared with the maximum wp i of 0 67 in scenario 19 under scenarios 19 36 similarly a mean cotton wp i of 1 0 0 3 kg m 3 was determined in the same region during the last 34 years by wang et al 2015 3 4 recommend irrigation practices for cotton under fmdi due to a lack of precise guidance on irrigation management cotton production by farmers and the water productivity still remain at a low level kang et al 2012 feike et al 2017 thus by treating ia and if as the independent variables y wp eta and wp i were employed as the response variables several binary quadratic regression equations were developed using multiple nonlinear regression based on the ia and if data to predict y wp eta and wp i table 2 these binary quadratic regression equations were used to calculate the ia and if values required to maximize the parameters for the yield wp eta and wp i however it was difficult to simultaneously obtain the maximum values for the yield wp eta and wp i the maximum cotton yields of 3821 and 2956 kg hm 2 were achieved with 474 mm of irrigation water under 5 d if in scenarios 1 18 and 570 mm of irrigation water under 6 5 87 d if in scenarios 19 36 the largest wp eta values of 0 91 and 0 87 kg m 3 were achieved with 478 mm of ia under 5 d interval in scenarios 1 18 and 570 mm of ia with an if close to 7 6 63 days in scenarios 19 36 the wp i values were maximized at 1 14 and 0 67 kg m 3 by the application of 320 mm of ia with 5 d if table 3 under different simulation scenarios as expected high frequency irrigation e g 5 7 d was beneficial for simultaneously increasing the cotton yield and wp under fmdi 4 conclusions the aims of this study were to understand the effects of the as distributions and irrigation management factors on the soil water salt balance crop water status and leaching fraction we also evaluated the effects of different as distributions and irrigation management methods on the cotton yield and wp the soil salt stress restricted root water uptake so the higher as scenarios obtained lower t a and et a values but higher e a d and δs values than the lower as distributions t a et a d and δs were significantly affected by the irrigation application the effects of the higher as profiles on ω were more distinct than those of the lower as profiles ω decreased in a linear manner as ia increased and ω increased as if prolonged lf ranged from 9 26 to 35 40 in scenarios 1 18 and 30 88 50 62 in scenarios 19 36 under the lower and higher as scenarios the amounts of salt leached below the root zone were 76 0 345 6 and 2803 7 5405 9 g m 2 respectively during the irrigation season the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under fmdi led to natural desalination processes of 12 0 231 6 g m 2 and 2739 7 5291 9 g m 2 under the lower and higher as scenarios respectively higher cotton yields could be gained with a larger ia or shorter if the wp eta and wp i values were greater with the lower as profiles than the higher as profiles under the same ia and if scenarios recommended irrigation practices were proposed to achieve the maximum values for the yield wp eta and wp i thus in general the as distribution and irrigation schedule will have substantial effects on the soil water salt balance and wp under fmdi moreover the current irrigation scheduling for freshwater under fmdi has multiple effects in terms of supplying water for roots uptake and leaching salt from the root zone as well as increasing the cotton yield the results obtained in this study provided insights into the response of the soil cotton system to different as distributions and irrigation practices during cotton production under fmdi declaration of

suggested that film mulching reduced available energy r n g and crop evapotranspiration et in some crop growth stages it was unclear how film mulching would influence energy partition crop et and crop coefficient k c during the entire growing season a two year field experiment in a mulched fm and a non mulched nm seed maize field under drip irrigation was conducted in shiyang river basin of northwest china to quantify the effects of fm on energy balance components et and k c by measuring the net radiation r n the soil heat flux g the evaporation e on ground surface the transpiration t and the soil water content along the soil profile in particular et was obtained by a water balance method and a three temperature 3t model combined with remote sensing results showed that fm significantly decreased daily r n and daily g before jointing stage i e the initial stage which caused 19 0 reduction of the daily r n g the effects of fm on r n g and r n g diminished after jointing stage i e the crop development middle and late stages the reduction of r n g under fm treatment during the initial stage was accompanied with the decrease of et during the initial stage consequently 6 2 less total et in the entire seed maize growing season was recorded compared with nm treatment fm had a significant effect on the partition of et components and e and t were 0 52 and 1 10 times of those under nm treatment respectively fm significantly reduced k c during the initial stage k c ini by 55 3 while in the middle k c mid and late k c end stages it decreased by 5 7 and 9 7 respectively compared with nm treatment the k c varied with the leaf area index lai following the parabolic relationship for both treatments a structural equation model sem showed that among the soil and crop factors fm and soil temperature st were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c during the initial stage while during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were the main factors affecting r n g and et and k c was mainly affected by lai sem further confirmed that the fm impact was more significant during the initial stage than during the crop development middle and late stages

both with full irrigation each plot was 24 5 m long and 5 6 m wide because the experiment area is limited and to ensure the plot was large enough to meet the requirements of net radiometer layout no

farmland two tailed significance tests were used the significance test results of every pathway and the standardized total effects were derived from the output of the sem statistical analysis was conducted with spss 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa and amos 25 0 amos development corporation chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface albedo α surface albedo is an index of the absorption and reflection ability of ground surface to solar radiation the surface albedo of transparent plastic film generally appeared to be higher than that of the soil surface liakatas et al 1986 ham and kluitenberg 1994 the surface albedo of fm and nm based on the monitored incoming and outcoming radiations during the entire growing season of seed maize is shown in fig 1 during the initial stage the ground surface for nm or plastic film for fm was exposed to the solar radiation because of the small canopy cover of seed maize fig 1 the surface albedo of fm was significantly higher than that of nm the average surface albedo of fm and nm was 0 26 and 0 21 in 2018 and 0 26 and 0 19 in 2019 with the increase of canopy cover the underlying crop canopy received more solar radiation there was no significant difference between the surface albedo of fm and nm during the crop development middle and late stages 3 2 net radiation r n 3 2 1 daily variation of rn fm affected the r n by altering surface albedo absorptivity and temperature campbell and norman 1998 the daily r n r ns r nl under fm and nm treatments in 2018 and 2019 are listed in fig 2 where positive values indicate downward direction and negative values indicate upward direction the results showed that the effects of fm on the daily r n r ns and r nl were obvious mainly during the initial stage the lower downward r ns and higher upward r nl fig 2 a c resulted in the lower downward r n fig 2 b d under fm treatment and the r n of fm was 21 2 and 22 9 lower than that of nm in 2018 and 2019 respectively specifically the lower downward r ns of fm was attributed to the higher surface albedo fig 1 and the higher upward r nl of fm was due to the higher film temperature and soil surface temperature underneath plastic film fig 3a during the initial stage however during the crop development middle and late stages there was no significant difference between the r n r ns r nl of fm and nm due to the similar surface albedos fig 1 and canopy temperatures between fm and nm in these stages linear regression for both years indicated that the r n of fm was about 0 77 and 0 97 times of that of nm during the initial stage fig 4a and the entire growing season respectively fig 4b and the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 89 and 0 92 respectively previous research showed similar results that the r n of film mulching was 0 80 times of that of non mulching during the initial stage li et al 2016 and 0 90 0 95 times during the entire growing season zhang et al 2018 3 2 2 hourly variation of rn the hourly variations of r n r ns r nl under fm and nm treatments during the initial stage for example may 12 may 18 2018 and may 14 may 20 2019 are shown in fig 5 the hourly changes of r n were influenced by solar altitude cloud cover crop growth status and surface albedo zhang et al 2016a the hourly r n presented a single peak curve and was positive downward during the day and negative upward during the night during the day 7 00 19 00 the downward r n increased rapidly after sunrise until noon and then decreased the downward r n of fm was lower than that of nm which was mainly caused by the lower downward r ns and higher upward r nl during the day fig 5 a c during the night 19 00 7 00 the next day the upward r n was stable and the upward r n of fm was higher than that of nm which was mainly because there was no r ns during the night while fm increased the upward r nl therefore the lower downward r n of fm during the initial stage was caused by the lower downward r ns during the day and the higher upward r nl in all day under fm treatment 3 3 soil heat flux g 3 3 1 hourly variation of g during the entire growing season during the day the soil heat flowed from the soil surface to deeper soil showing a downward positive g while it was opposite during the night the fluctuation amplitude of the hourly g reduced along the growing period fig 6a which was mainly because the temperature fluctuation of soil surface weakened with the increase of canopy cover fig 6b in addition the fluctuation amplitude of the hourly g under fm treatment during the growing season was less than that of nm and g was 73 5 185 9 w m 2 for fm 94 3 222 9 w m 2 for nm fig 6a this was because fm slowed down the temperature fluctuation in soil surface as shown in fig 6b 3 3 2 hourly variation of g in specific period hourly variations of g under fm and nm treatments from may 14 to may 20 2019 are shown in fig 7b the hourly variations of g showed a similar pattern with hourly r n and presented a single peak curve feng et al 2017 wang et al 2019 there was significant difference in the hourly g between fm and nm in all day the 7 day average g was 58 77 and 82 90 w m 2 downward during the day 34 42 and 43 83 w m 2 upward during the night for fm and nm respectively the 7 day average g of fm was 29 1 and 21 5 lower than that of nm during the day and night respectively a negative peak g appeared at about 19 00 for nm while the g of fm was almost unchanged from about 19 00 4 00 the next day fm could postpone the direction alternation of g in the afternoon for about 1 h li et al 2016 and the time of peak g for 0 5 2 h fan et al 2016 our study confirmed that at sunrise the direction of heat flow shifted from upward to downward between 6 00 and 7 00 a m for nm while 8 00 and 9 00 a m for fm with a lag of about 1 2 h in the afternoon the direction of heat flow shifted from downward to upward between 15 00 and 16 00 for nm and 17 00 and 18 00 for fm also with a lag of 1 3 h 3 3 3 daily variation of g according to beer s law of radiation absorption sunlight reaching the soil surface decreased along with the increase of lai gong et al 2017 therefore g in the soil surface could decrease with the advancement of growth period because most of solar radiations were intercepted by crop canopy li et al 2016 feng et al 2017 our study confirmed that the daily average g declined along with the growing period fig 7a the result also showed fm decreased the daily average g for the entire growing season and the decrease of the daily average g under fm treatment weakened with the growing period the daily average g of fm was 9 9 lower than that of nm on average during the entire growing season the slope of the linear regression of the daily average g between fm and nm during the entire growing season was 0 72 with r2 of 0 60 fig 4c generally the monthly or staged average g accounted for a small proportion of r n which was not more than 10 and may even be negative values kool et al 2016 tian et al 2017 feng et al 2017 in our study the ratio of the staged average g to the staged average r n g r n was 3 2 1 5 0 3 and 1 7 during the initial crop development middle and late stages respectively it showed that the g r n decreased with the growing season feng et al 2017 previous researches at the same experimental site showed similar results that g r n in a maize field was between 0 9 and 5 2 in monthly average jiao et al 2018 and between 3 3 and 5 0 in staged average li 2009 3 4 available energy r n g the difference of both daily r n and g between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the crop development middle and late stages figs 2 b d and 7a therefore the daily r n g for fm was 19 0 lower than that of nm during the initial stage however no significant differences were observed during the crop development middle and late stages fig 8a the daily r n g of fm was 0 76 times of that of nm during the initial stage fig 4d and 0 97 times during the entire growing season fig 4e the hourly variation for r n g from may 14 to may 20 2019 is presented in fig 8b and varied in a single peak curve during the day the average r n g of fm 205 55 w m 2 was lower than that of nm 210 32 w m 2 during the night the average upward r n g of fm 28 58 w m 2 was higher than that of nm 22 54 w m 2 therefore during the initial stage the decrease of r n g under fm treatment was mainly due to the lower r n g during the day downward and the higher r n g during the night upward during the day the higher surface albedo under fm treatment decreased the solar radiation income although the existence of plastic film could reflect back longwave radiation from the soil and reduce its loss fig 5 a c showed that there was more longwave radiation loss in the soil film system because of the higher temperature of soil surface underneath plastic film fig 3b and the emission of longwave radiation from the film itself therefore fm obviously reduced the income of ground energy in addition although the decrease of g generally positive during the day i e heat flux from soil surface to deeper soil in ground surface under fm treatment fig 7b could buffer the reduction effect of ground energy income to some extent the g r n was extremely small wang et al 2019 thus it resulted in the lower available energy during the day under fm treatment during the night the longwave radiation emitted from the ground was the source of ground energy loss and the g generally negative during night i e heat flux from deeper soil to the soil surface was the source of ground energy income therefore the instantaneous available energy during the night could be negative or positive while in our study the average available energy was negative during the night fig 8b under fm treatment the higher soil surface temperature and film temperature during the night fig 3b resulted in more longwave radiation loss and lower g i e lower heat flux from deeper soil to soil surface fig 7b meant less energy income than nm treatment both effects could aggravate the loss of r n g and eventually lead to a lower r n g note because it is negative actually it showed a higher r n g under fm treatment during the night the r n g was consumed by λet and h which directly affected the partition of the available energy and et li et al 2008 previous studies fan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 concluded film mulching decreased the r n g during the maize growing season and our study proved that film mulching only reduced the r n g during the initial stage and had no obvious effect on the r n g during the crop development middle and late stages which resulted in 2 5 reduction during the entire growing season it demonstrated that both plastic film mulching and crop canopy could affect the available energy the significant difference of available energy between fm and nm during the initial stage was mainly due to the effect of plastic film mulching however with the development of crop canopy the effect of film mulching on energy budget was weakened the similar surface albedos fig 1 soil surface temperatures and soil profile temperatures zhao et al 2020b between the fm and nm treatments led to similar energy budget 3 5 evapotranspiration et and its components 3 5 1 soil water evaporation e during the initial stage the e was large due to the small canopy cover of seed maize and the average e for both years was 1 05 and 1 58 mm d 1 under fm and nm treatments respectively fig 9 with the development of seed maize canopy the e decreased because of the decrease of energy reaching ground surface unger et al 2012 and the average e for both years was 0 39 and 0 67 mm d 1 during the crop development middle and late stages under fm and nm treatments respectively the most direct effect of plastic film was to work as a barrier to reduce soil water evaporation the e of fm and nm were 0 01 1 80 and 0 11 2 29 mm d 1 respectively the e of fm was significantly 47 1 lower than that of nm during the growing season p 0 01 fig 9 there was a significant linear relationship for the e between fm and nm treatments and the ratio of the e under fm to that under nm was 0 52 for the two growing seasons fig 10a a strong linear correlation between the e under fm and nm was also found by zhang et al 2018 such relationship could provide a reference to estimate water balance for modeling hydrological process in mulched farmland 3 5 2 validation of t3t and et3t estimated by the 3t model in this study comparison was conducted between the et 3t estimated by the 3t model and the et wb estimated by the wb method in order to investigate the reliability of et estimation by the 3t model the difference in the staged et 3t and et wb was small and the relative error re ranged between 14 4 and 23 0 table 2 the linear regression curve of et 3t and et wb was basically consistent with the 1 1 curve and the slope was 1 01 with r2 of 0 91 fig 10b it showed that the staged et 3t was highly correlated with staged et wb consistent with tian et al 2013 previous study hou 2019 in an adjacent seed maize field from the same experimental station also compared the et 3t with the et estimated by an eddy covariance system et ec and a large scale weighing lysimeter et lwl the result showed a good agreement between the et ec et lwl and et 3t with the root mean square error rmse of 0 13 0 14 mm h 1 and r2 of 0 95 0 92 hou 2019 compared the t 3t i e the t estimated by the 3t model with the t ec i e the t computed by the et ec and t et t et was determined by the method of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes the result showed that the accuracy of the t 3t was high with rmse and r2 of 0 10 mm h 1 and 0 94 respectively the high reliability of the 3t model to estimate transpiration was also verified by other published studies hou et al 2018 2019 tian et al 2020 from the experimental station in this research therefore 3t model was a reliable method in estimating t and et in our experimental area 3 5 3 instantaneous transpiration the daytime variations of t 3t obtained by the 3t model under fm and nm treatments in 2018 are shown in fig 11 the daytime t 3t under fm and nm treatments showed similar variation patterns the daytime variation of t 3t mostly presented a single peak curve and generally reached peak t 3t between 12 30 and 14 30 the t 3t rate occasionally appeared as a bimodal curve which might be caused by the sudden change of some environmental factors at peak and valley time hou et al 2018 selecting july 29 as an example there was a valley in t 3t at 14 30 the meteorological factors including solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed on july 29 are listed in fig 12 we could see that the sudden drop in solar radiation and wind speed at 14 30 led to the valley in t 3t at 14 30 the daytime t 3t was affected by the crop growth before june 15 the maximum daytime t 3t ranged from 0 44 to 0 78 mm h 1 after june 15 the t 3t rate enhanced and the maximum daytime t 3t ranged between 0 55 and 1 92 mm h 1 primarily due to the vigorous seed maize growth compared with the nm t 3t of fm was higher during may 29 july 24 while lower during july 29 august 18 this was because fm could advance the growing period of seed maize table 1 and from the end of july the seed maize of fm had reached filling period while the seed maize of nm was in the most vigorous heading period there was a significant linear correlation between the daytime t 3t of fm and nm treatments during the observation period and the daytime t 3t of fm was 1 10 times that of nm with r2 0 92 fig 10c it indicated that although t 3t of fm might be higher or lower than that of nm in general it was higher because the ratio was greater than 1 3 5 4 evapotranspiration et in 2018 and 2019 the total et wb for the entire growing season from wb method was 411 9 and 408 2 mm under fm treatment while 429 1 and 430 0 mm under nm treatment the averaged et wb of the two years under fm treatment was significantly 4 6 lower than that under nm treatment p 0 05 table 3 zhang et al 2018 also reported the total et was reduced by 2 8 5 2 under fm treatment compared with nm one of the reasons for the total et wb reduction under fm treatment was that fm decreased e and the ratio of e to et wb the daily e of fm in all stages was lower than that of nm fig 9 which could lead to significant lower total e of fm p 0 01 table 3 and lower ratio of the daily e to the daily et under fm treatment in all stages than that of nm gong et al 2017 therefore the ratio of the total e to the total et wb e et wb under fm and nm treatments was 15 0 and 29 5 respectively and was consistent with that reported in literature kang et al 2003 ding et al 2013a shen et al 2019 another reason for the decrease in et wb under fm treatment was that fm promoted the seed maize growth fig 1 and shortened the growth periods table 1 it could be explained that although the total et wb of fm was lower the daily average et wb of fm for the entire growing season 2 86 and 2 72 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 was higher than that of nm 2 79 and 2 70 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 although fm reduced the total et wb of the growing season it did not always reduce the et during the crop development and middle stages due to the larger t fig 11 which was also confirmed by gong et al 2017 the daily et 3t of clear sunny days estimated by the 3t model during the crop development and middle stages under fm and nm treatments are presented in fig 13 the daily et 3t of fm was higher before mid july while lower after mid july in both years than that of nm for the two year observation period a significant linear correlation was found between the daily et 3t of fm and nm and the slope was 0 98 with r2 of 0 80 fig 10d 3 6 crop coefficient k c and its relationship with lai the k c obtained by the wb 3t model and fao56 methods under fm and nm treatments for the different stages k c ini k c mid k c end are shown in table 4 compared with the wb method the k c mid by the 3t model was slightly higher with an average of 3 7 and 8 0 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively however the k c ini k c mid k c end by the fao56 method was lower except that the k c ini of nm by the fao56 method was higher than that of wb method which was because the k c ini of nm by the fao56 method was given under the conditions of no water stress good cultivation and water management conditions and maximum harvest allen et al 1998 the k c mid and k c end by the fao56 method were 9 7 and 20 4 lower in 2018 and 3 1 and 14 0 lower in 2019 than those of the wb method on average under fm and nm treatments the mean k c for the entire growing season by the wb method and the fao56 method were 0 72 0 02 and 0 70 0 04 while the error between the two methods was 4 1 errors among the three methods were acceptable for the estimation of k c ini k c mid k c end and mean k c the k c ini k c mid k c end and k c of fm were lower than those of nm for the three methods the mean k c ini k c mid k c end and k c for the three methods under fm treatment were 55 3 5 7 9 7 and 6 2 lower than that under nm treatment it can be seen that the difference of k c between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the middle and late stages our k c values were slightly different from the other published studies kang et al 2003 gong et al 2017 mainly due to the differences in local atmospheric condition varieties and planting densities of maize soil type and mulching conditions li et al 2008 balwinder singh et al 2011 the relationship between the k c and lai in maize field could be described as the exponential al kaisi et al 1989 jiang et al 2014 logarithmic li et al 2008 zhang et al 2016b quadratic parabola wang et al 2019 or step functions kang et al 2003 gong et al 2017 in this study a quadratic parabola correlation was found between the k c and lai with k c 0 028lai 2 0 320lai 0 181 under fm treatment and k c 0 026lai 2 0 302lai 0 255 under nm treatment and r2 was 0 96 for both fm and nm treatments fig 14 3 7 quantification of interactions among water energy and crops in farmland the interactions of water energy and plant process for seed maize were investigated using sem at a daily scale and quantified by the standardized path coefficient fig 15 results showed that significant reduction effect of fm on e significant increase effects of soil temperature st on g r n g on et and et on k c and significant interaction between st and lai were reflected during both the initial stage and the crop development middle and late stages p 0 001 however some process showed significant effects only at a certain stage p 0 001 e g significant increase effect of fm on surface albedo α only during the initial stage significant increase effects of lai on et and lai on k c and reduction effect of t on soil water storage sws only during the crop development middle and late stages etc the r2 values in fig 15 represent the proportion of variation explained by the relationships constructed with other variables the results showed that during the initial stage 92 63 and 52 variation of r n g et and k c could be explained by other variables while 99 89 and 90 for the crop development middle and late stages it indicated that r n g et and k c could be well explained by other variables in the sem especially during the crop development middle and late stages in addition to the direct pathway shown in fig 15 standardized total effects of soil factors e g fm sws and st and crop factor e g lai on r n g et and k c were investigated table 5 the results showed that during the initial stage st and fm were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c and the effects of st were greater than those of fm however during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were main factors affecting r n g and et lai had greater influence on et than st while lai had less effect on r n g than st the main factor affecting k c was lai while the other factors had little effect the effects of fm on all the variables were more significant during the initial stage than during the crop development middle and late stages as shown in table 6 fm showed significant reduction effect on e p 0 001 and non significant effect on t during the entire growing season the decrease effects of fm on r n p 0 001 g p 0 01 r n g p 0 001 et p 0 001 and k c were significant during the initial stage while not during the crop development middle and late stages these results were in agreement with those shown in figs 2b d 7a 8a 9 tables 3 and 4 4 conclusion the effects of fm on energy balance components et and k c were investigated in seed maize fields with drip irrigation in shiyang river basin of northwest china during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 the main conclusions were as follows 1 fm significantly decreased the daily net radiation r n and the daily soil heat flux g during the initial stage which caused a significant reduction 19 0 of the daily available energy rn g during the initial stage fm decreased the daily r n mainly due to the lower downward r ns during the day and the higher upward r nl in all day under fm treatment with the development of crop canopy the effects of fm on r n g and r n g greatly diminished during the crop development middle and late stages 2 fm reduced e for the entire growing season increased the t during vigorous crop growth stage and decreased the total et of the growing season by 6 2 fm had a significant effect on the partition of et and the e and t under fm were 0 52 and 1 10 times of those under nm respectively 3 the difference of k c between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the middle and late stages fm reduced k c ini by 55 3 and k c mid and k c end by 5 7 and 9 7 respectively the k c varied with lai following a quadratic relationship for both treatments 4 the sem analysis showed that film mulching fm and soil temperature st were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c during the initial stage while during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were main factors affecting r n g and et and k c was mainly affected by lai the sem also confirmed that the fm impact was more significant

10246,plastic film mulching has been widely applied in farmland around the world which could complicate the mass and energy exchange between soil surface and atmosphere although previous studies suggested that film mulching reduced available energy r n g and crop evapotranspiration et in some crop growth stages it was unclear how film mulching would influence energy partition crop et and crop coefficient k c during the entire growing season a two year field experiment in a mulched fm and a non mulched nm seed maize field under drip irrigation was conducted in shiyang river basin of northwest china to quantify the effects of fm on energy balance components et and k c by measuring the net radiation r n the soil heat flux g the evaporation e on ground surface the transpiration t and the soil water content along the soil profile in particular et was obtained by a water balance method and a three temperature 3t model combined with remote sensing results showed that fm significantly decreased daily r n and daily g before jointing stage i e the initial stage which caused 19 0 reduction of the daily r n g the effects of fm on r n g and r n g diminished after jointing stage i e the crop development middle and late stages the reduction of r n g under fm treatment during the initial stage was accompanied with the decrease of et during the initial stage consequently 6 2 less total et in the entire seed maize growing season was recorded compared with nm treatment fm had a significant effect on the partition of et components and e and t were 0 52 and 1 10 times of those under nm treatment respectively fm significantly reduced k c during the initial stage k c ini by 55 3 while in the middle k c mid and late k c end stages it decreased by 5 7 and 9 7 respectively compared with nm treatment the k c varied with the leaf area index lai following the parabolic relationship for both treatments a structural equation model sem showed that among the soil and crop factors fm and soil temperature st were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c during the initial stage while during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were the main factors affecting r n g and et and k c was mainly affected by lai sem further confirmed that the fm impact was more significant during the initial stage than during the crop development middle and late stages

gu et al 2005 hao et al 2007 wever et al 2002 λet is a critical factor of both energy and water budgets in farmland fan et al 2016 which accounts for 60 80 of net radiation in maize growing season and is the largest consumer of available solar energy burba and verma 2005 suyker and verma 2008 feng et al 2017 both λet and h are driven by the turbulent diffusion of air near the land surface where the bowen ratio i e h λet is usually assumed to be a constant to calculate the et if the available energy r n g is known borges et al 2015 accurate estimation of et is critical for understanding hydrological processes and water resources management plastic film mulching has been widely applied in farmland in arid and semi arid areas around the world for saving irrigation water and enhancing the crop yield ran et al 2017 wang et al 2017 he et al 2018 the plastic film on the soil surface changes soil water condition by blocking the rainfall infiltration into the soil and inhibiting soil water evaporation it also modifies the land surface energy balance and water heat exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere yang et al 2012 li et al 2013 plastic film mulching affects soil temperature and surface energy balance by modifying the surface reflectance and absorptivity and the microclimate environment around crops oebker and hopen 1974 tarara 2000 fan et al 2016 demonstrated that transparent plastic film mulching decreased r n during maize growing season and increased g in the early stage thus reduced r n g in the early stage which resulted in a lower et li et al 2016 concluded that g of transparent plastic film mulching was lower than that of non mulching in the middle and late stages zhang et al 2017 reported that transparent plastic film mulching significantly decreased r n in the early stage and slightly increased r n in the late stage while increased g during the entire growing season thus there are no consistent conclusions regarding the role of transparent plastic film mulching on r n g and et during different growth stages crop coefficient k c used for irrigation water allocation is influenced by weather condition crop type irrigation regime and field management allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 plastic film mulching was generally assumed to decrease k c allen et al 1998 however how its impact varies during different crop growth stages is not yet confirmed zhang et al 2018 concluded that k c under film mulching was significantly lower than that under non mulching in the initial and late stages while slightly higher in the middle stage gong et al 2017 suggested that film mulching decreased k c during the entire growing season film mulching practices under drip irrigation are widely used in northwest china it is crucial to investigate how film mulching affects k c during different crop growth stages for precision irrigation planning design and management et estimation is essential to obtain k c which mainly includes

both with full irrigation each plot was 24 5 m long and 5 6 m wide because the experiment area is limited and to ensure the plot was large enough to meet the requirements of net radiometer layout no replicates were set in this experiment however many samples were collected at different locations inside the plot in order to cover the spatial heterogeneity in future research more plot replicates should be considered to improve the reliability of research results under fm treatment the soil surface was fully covered by 85 cm wide and 0 004 cm thick transparent polyethylene plastic film the

conducted with spss 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa and amos 25 0 amos development corporation chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface albedo α surface albedo is an index of the absorption and reflection ability of ground surface to solar radiation the surface albedo of transparent plastic film generally appeared to be higher than that of the soil surface liakatas et al 1986 ham and kluitenberg 1994 the surface albedo of fm and nm based on the monitored incoming and outcoming radiations during the entire growing season of seed maize is shown in fig 1 during the initial stage the ground surface for nm or plastic film for fm was exposed to the solar radiation because of the small canopy cover of seed maize fig 1 the surface albedo of fm was significantly higher than that of nm the average surface albedo of fm and nm was 0 26 and 0 21 in 2018 and 0 26 and 0 19 in 2019 with the increase of canopy cover the underlying crop canopy received more solar radiation there was no significant difference between the surface albedo of fm and nm during the crop development middle and late stages 3 2 net radiation r n 3 2 1 daily variation of rn fm affected the r n by altering surface albedo absorptivity and temperature campbell and norman 1998 the daily r n r ns r nl under fm and nm treatments in 2018 and 2019 are listed in fig 2 where positive values indicate downward direction and negative values indicate upward direction the results showed that the effects of fm on the daily r n r ns and r nl were obvious mainly during the initial stage the lower downward r ns and higher upward r nl fig 2 a c resulted in the lower downward r n fig 2 b d under fm treatment and the r n of fm was 21 2 and 22 9 lower than that of nm in 2018 and 2019 respectively specifically the lower downward r ns of fm was attributed to the higher surface albedo fig 1 and the higher upward r nl of fm was due to the higher film temperature and soil surface temperature underneath plastic film fig 3a during the initial stage however during the crop development middle and late stages there was no significant difference between the r n r ns r nl of fm and nm due to the similar surface albedos fig 1 and canopy temperatures between fm and nm in these stages linear regression for both years indicated that the r n of fm was about 0 77 and 0 97 times of that of nm during the initial stage fig 4a and the entire growing season respectively fig 4b and the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 89 and 0 92 respectively previous research showed similar results that the r n of film mulching was 0 80 times of that of non mulching during the initial stage li et al 2016 and 0 90 0 95 times during the entire growing season zhang et al 2018 3 2 2 hourly variation of rn the hourly variations of r n r ns r nl under fm and nm treatments during the initial stage for example may 12 may 18 2018 and may 14 may 20 2019 are shown in fig 5 the hourly changes of r n were influenced by solar altitude cloud cover crop growth status and surface albedo zhang et al 2016a the hourly r n presented a single peak curve and was positive downward during the day and negative upward during the night during the day 7 00 19 00 the downward r n increased rapidly after sunrise until noon and then decreased the downward r n of fm was lower than that of nm which was mainly caused by the lower downward r ns and higher upward r nl during the day fig 5 a c during the night 19 00 7 00 the next day the upward r n was stable and the upward r n of fm was higher than that of nm which was mainly because there was no r ns during the night while fm increased the upward r nl therefore the lower downward r n of fm during the initial stage was caused by the lower downward r ns during the day and the higher upward r nl in all day under fm treatment 3 3 soil heat flux g 3 3 1 hourly variation of g during the entire growing season during the day the soil heat flowed from the soil surface to deeper soil showing a downward positive g while it was opposite during the night the fluctuation amplitude of the hourly g reduced along the growing period fig 6a which was mainly because the temperature fluctuation of soil surface weakened with the increase of canopy cover fig 6b in addition the fluctuation amplitude of the hourly g under fm treatment during the growing season was less than that of nm and g was 73 5 185 9 w m 2 for fm 94 3 222 9 w m 2 for nm fig 6a this was because fm slowed down the temperature fluctuation in soil surface as shown in fig 6b 3 3 2 hourly variation of g in specific period hourly variations of g under fm and nm treatments from may 14 to may 20 2019 are shown in fig 7b the hourly variations of g showed a similar pattern with hourly r n and presented a single peak curve feng et al 2017 wang et al 2019 there was significant difference in the hourly g between fm and nm in all day the 7 day average g was 58 77 and 82 90 w m 2 downward during the day 34 42 and 43 83 w m 2 upward during the night for fm and nm respectively the 7 day average g of fm was 29 1 and 21 5 lower than that of nm during the day and night respectively a negative peak g appeared at about 19 00 for nm while the g of fm was almost unchanged from about 19 00 4 00 the next day fm could postpone the direction alternation of g in the afternoon for about 1 h li et al 2016 and the time of peak g for 0 5 2 h fan et al 2016 our study confirmed that at sunrise the direction of heat flow shifted from upward to downward between 6 00 and 7 00 a m for nm while 8 00 and 9 00 a m for fm with a lag of about 1 2 h in the afternoon the direction of heat flow shifted from downward to upward between 15 00 and 16 00 for nm and 17 00 and 18 00 for fm also with a lag of 1 3 h 3 3 3 daily variation of g according to beer s law of radiation absorption sunlight reaching the soil surface decreased along with the increase of lai gong et al 2017 therefore g in the soil surface could decrease with the advancement of growth period because most of solar radiations were intercepted by crop canopy li et al 2016 feng et al 2017 our study confirmed that the daily average g declined along with the growing period fig 7a the result also showed fm decreased the daily average g for the entire growing season and the decrease of the daily average g under fm treatment weakened with the growing period the daily average g of fm was 9 9 lower than that of nm on average during the entire growing season the slope of the linear regression of the daily average g between fm and nm during the entire growing season was 0 72 with r2 of 0 60 fig 4c generally the monthly or staged average g accounted for a small proportion of r n which was not more than 10 and may even be negative values kool et al 2016 tian et al 2017 feng et al 2017 in our study the ratio of the staged average g to the staged average r n g r n was 3 2 1 5 0 3 and 1 7 during the initial crop development middle and late stages respectively it showed that the g r n decreased with the growing season feng et al 2017 previous researches at the same experimental site showed similar results that g r n in a maize field was between 0 9 and 5 2 in monthly average jiao et al 2018 and between 3 3 and 5 0 in staged average li 2009 3 4 available energy r n g the difference of both daily r n and g between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the crop development middle and late stages figs 2 b d and 7a therefore the daily r n g for fm was 19 0 lower than that of nm during the initial stage however no significant differences were observed during the crop development middle and late stages fig 8a the daily r n g of fm was 0 76 times of that of nm during the initial stage fig 4d and 0 97 times during the entire growing season fig 4e the hourly variation for r n g from may 14 to may 20 2019 is presented in fig 8b and varied in a single peak curve during the day the average r n g of fm 205 55 w m 2 was lower than that of nm 210 32 w m 2 during the night the average upward r n g of fm 28 58 w m 2 was higher than that of nm 22 54 w m 2 therefore during the initial stage the decrease of r n g under fm treatment was mainly due to the lower r n g during the day downward and the higher r n g during the night upward during the day the higher surface albedo under fm treatment decreased the solar radiation income although the existence of plastic film could reflect back longwave radiation from the soil and reduce its loss fig 5 a c showed that there was more longwave radiation loss in the soil film system because of the higher temperature of soil surface underneath plastic film fig 3b and the emission of longwave radiation from the film itself therefore fm obviously reduced the income of ground energy in addition although the decrease of g generally positive during the day i e heat flux from soil surface to deeper soil in ground surface under fm treatment fig 7b could buffer the reduction effect of ground energy income to some extent the g r n was extremely small wang et al 2019 thus it resulted in the lower available energy during the day under fm treatment during the night the longwave radiation emitted from the ground was the source of ground energy loss and the g generally negative during night i e heat flux from deeper soil to the soil surface was the source of ground energy income therefore the instantaneous available energy during the night could be negative or positive while in our study the average available energy was negative during the night fig 8b under fm treatment the higher soil surface temperature and film temperature during the night fig 3b resulted in more longwave radiation loss and lower g i e lower heat flux from deeper soil to soil surface fig 7b meant less energy income than nm treatment both effects could aggravate the loss of r n g and eventually lead to a lower r n g note because it is negative actually it showed a higher r n g under fm treatment during the night the r n g was consumed by λet and h which directly affected the partition of the available energy and et li et al 2008 previous studies fan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 concluded film mulching decreased the r n g during the maize growing season and our study proved that film mulching only reduced the r n g during the initial stage and had no obvious effect on the r n g during the crop development middle and late stages which resulted in 2 5 reduction during the entire growing season it demonstrated that both plastic film mulching and crop canopy could affect the available energy the significant difference of available energy between fm and nm during the initial stage was mainly due to the effect of plastic film mulching however with the development of crop canopy the effect of film mulching on energy budget was weakened the similar surface albedos fig 1 soil surface temperatures and soil profile temperatures zhao et al 2020b between the fm and nm treatments led to similar energy budget 3 5 evapotranspiration et and its components 3 5 1 soil water evaporation e during the initial stage the e was large due to the small canopy cover of seed maize and the average e for both years was 1 05 and 1 58 mm d 1 under fm and nm treatments respectively fig 9 with the development of seed maize canopy the e decreased because of the decrease of energy reaching ground surface unger et al 2012 and the average e for both years was 0 39 and 0 67 mm d 1 during the crop development middle and late stages under fm and nm treatments respectively the most direct effect of plastic film was to work as a barrier to reduce soil water evaporation the e of fm and nm were 0 01 1 80 and 0 11 2 29 mm d 1 respectively the e of fm was significantly 47 1 lower than that of nm during the growing season p 0 01 fig 9 there was a significant linear relationship for the e between fm and nm treatments and the ratio of the e under fm to that under nm was 0 52 for the two growing seasons fig 10a a strong linear correlation between the e under fm and nm was also found by zhang et al 2018 such relationship could provide a reference to estimate water balance for modeling hydrological process in mulched farmland 3 5 2 validation of t3t and et3t estimated by the 3t model in this study comparison was conducted between the et 3t estimated by the 3t model and the et wb estimated by the wb method in order to investigate the reliability of et estimation by the 3t model the difference in the staged et 3t and et wb was small and the relative error re ranged between 14 4 and 23 0 table 2 the linear regression curve of et 3t and et wb was basically consistent with the 1 1 curve and the slope was 1 01 with r2 of 0 91 fig 10b it showed that the staged et 3t was highly correlated with staged et wb consistent with tian et al 2013 previous study hou 2019 in an adjacent seed maize field from the same experimental station also compared the et 3t with the et estimated by an eddy covariance system et ec and a large scale weighing lysimeter et lwl the result showed a good agreement between the et ec et lwl and et 3t with the root mean square error rmse of 0 13 0 14 mm h 1 and r2 of 0 95 0 92 hou 2019 compared the t 3t i e the t estimated by the 3t model with the t ec i e the t computed by the et ec and t et t et was determined by the method of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes the result showed that the accuracy of the t 3t was high with rmse and r2 of 0 10 mm h 1 and 0 94 respectively the high reliability of the 3t model to estimate transpiration was also verified by other published studies hou et al 2018 2019 tian et al 2020 from the experimental station in this research therefore 3t model was a reliable method in estimating t and et in our experimental area 3 5 3 instantaneous transpiration the daytime variations of t 3t obtained by the 3t model under fm and nm treatments in 2018 are shown in fig 11 the daytime t 3t under fm and nm treatments showed similar variation patterns the daytime variation of t 3t mostly presented a single peak curve and generally reached peak t 3t between 12 30 and 14 30 the t 3t rate occasionally appeared as a bimodal curve which might be caused by the sudden change of some environmental factors at peak and valley time hou et al 2018 selecting july 29 as an example there was a valley in t 3t at 14 30 the meteorological factors including solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed on july 29 are listed in fig 12 we could see that the sudden drop in solar radiation and wind speed at 14 30 led to the valley in t 3t at 14 30 the daytime t 3t was affected by the crop growth before june 15 the maximum daytime t 3t ranged from 0 44 to 0 78 mm h 1 after june 15 the t 3t rate enhanced and the maximum daytime t 3t ranged between 0 55 and 1 92 mm h 1 primarily due to the vigorous seed maize growth compared with the nm t 3t of fm was higher during may 29 july 24 while lower during july 29 august 18 this was because fm could advance the growing period of seed maize table 1 and from the end of july the seed maize of fm had reached filling period while the seed maize of nm was in the most vigorous heading period there was a significant linear correlation between the daytime t 3t of fm and nm treatments during the observation period and the daytime t 3t of fm was 1 10 times that of nm with r2 0 92 fig 10c it indicated that although t 3t of fm might be higher or lower than that of nm in general it was higher because the ratio was greater than 1 3 5 4 evapotranspiration et in 2018 and 2019 the total et wb for the entire growing season from wb method was 411 9 and 408 2 mm under fm treatment while 429 1 and 430 0 mm under nm treatment the averaged et wb of the two years under fm treatment was significantly 4 6 lower than that under nm treatment p 0 05 table 3 zhang et al 2018 also reported the total et was reduced by 2 8 5 2 under fm treatment compared with nm one of the reasons for the total et wb reduction under fm treatment was that fm decreased e and the ratio of e to et wb the daily e of fm in all stages was lower than that of nm fig 9 which could lead to significant lower total e of fm p 0 01 table 3 and lower ratio of the daily e to the daily et under fm treatment in all stages than that of nm gong et al 2017 therefore the ratio of the total e to the total et wb e et wb under fm and nm treatments was 15 0 and 29 5 respectively and was consistent with that reported in literature kang et al 2003 ding et al 2013a shen et al 2019 another reason for the decrease in et wb under fm treatment was that fm promoted the seed maize growth fig 1 and shortened the growth periods table 1 it could be explained that although the total et wb of fm was lower the daily average et wb of fm for the entire growing season 2 86 and 2 72 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 was higher than that of nm 2 79 and 2 70 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 although fm reduced the total et wb of the growing season it did not always reduce the et during the crop development and middle stages due to the larger t fig 11 which was also confirmed by gong et al 2017 the daily et 3t of clear sunny days estimated by the 3t model during the crop development and middle stages under fm and nm treatments are presented in fig 13 the daily et 3t of fm was higher before mid july while lower after mid july in both years than that of nm for the two year observation period a significant linear correlation was found between the daily et 3t of fm and nm and the slope was 0 98 with r2 of 0 80 fig 10d 3 6 crop coefficient k c and its relationship with lai the k c obtained by the wb 3t model and fao56 methods under fm and nm treatments for the different stages k c ini k c mid k c end are shown in table 4 compared with the wb method the k c mid by the 3t model was slightly higher with an average of 3 7 and 8 0 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively however the k c ini k c mid k c end by the fao56 method was lower except that the k c ini of nm by the fao56 method was higher than that of wb method which was because the k c ini of nm by the fao56 method was given under the conditions of no water stress good cultivation and water management conditions and maximum harvest allen et al 1998 the k c mid and k c end by the fao56 method were 9 7 and 20 4 lower in 2018 and 3 1 and 14 0 lower in 2019 than those of the wb method on average under fm and nm treatments the mean k c for the entire growing season by the wb method and the fao56 method were 0 72 0 02 and 0 70 0 04 while the error between the two methods was 4 1 errors among the three methods were acceptable for the estimation of k c ini k c mid k c end and mean k c the k c ini k c mid k c end and k c of fm were lower than those of nm for the three methods the mean k c ini k c mid k c end and k c for the three methods under fm treatment were 55 3 5 7 9 7 and 6 2 lower than that under nm treatment it can be seen that the difference of k c between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the middle and late stages our k c values were slightly different from the other published studies kang et al 2003 gong et al 2017 mainly due to the differences in local atmospheric condition varieties and planting densities of maize soil type and mulching conditions li et al 2008 balwinder singh et al 2011 the relationship between the k c and lai in maize field could be described as the exponential al kaisi et al 1989 jiang et al 2014 logarithmic li et al 2008 zhang et al 2016b quadratic parabola wang et al 2019 or step functions kang et al 2003 gong et al 2017 in this study a quadratic parabola correlation was found between the k c and lai with k c 0 028lai 2 0 320lai 0 181 under fm treatment and k c 0 026lai 2 0 302lai 0 255 under nm treatment and r2 was 0 96 for both fm and nm treatments fig 14 3 7 quantification of interactions among water energy and crops in farmland the interactions of water energy and plant process for seed maize were investigated using sem at a daily scale and quantified by the standardized path coefficient fig 15 results showed that significant reduction effect of fm on e significant increase effects of soil temperature st on g r n g on et and et on k c and significant interaction between st and lai were reflected during both the initial stage and the crop development middle and late stages p 0 001 however some process showed significant effects only at a certain stage p 0 001 e g significant increase effect of fm on surface albedo α only during the initial stage significant increase effects of lai on et and lai on k c and reduction effect of t on soil water storage sws only during the crop development middle and late stages etc the r2 values in fig 15 represent the proportion of variation explained by the relationships constructed with other variables the results showed that during the initial stage 92 63 and 52 variation of r n g et and k c could be explained by other variables while 99 89 and 90 for the crop development middle and late stages it indicated that r n g et and k c could be well explained by other variables in the sem especially during the crop development middle and late stages in addition to the direct pathway shown in fig 15 standardized total effects of soil factors e g fm sws and st and crop factor e g lai on r n g et and k c were investigated table 5 the results showed that during the initial stage st and fm were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c and the effects of st were greater than those of fm however during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were main factors affecting r n g and et lai had greater influence on et than st while lai had less effect on r n g than st the main factor affecting k c was lai while the other factors had little effect the effects of fm on all the variables were more significant during the initial stage than during the crop development middle and late stages as shown in table 6 fm showed significant reduction effect on e p 0 001 and non significant effect on t during the entire growing season the decrease effects of fm on r n p 0 001 g p 0 01 r n g p 0 001 et p 0 001 and k c were significant during the initial stage while not during the crop development middle and late stages these results were in agreement with those shown in figs 2b d 7a 8a 9 tables 3 and 4 4 conclusion the effects of fm on energy balance components et and k c were investigated in seed maize fields with drip irrigation in shiyang river basin of northwest china during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 the main conclusions were as follows 1 fm significantly decreased the daily net radiation r n and the daily soil heat flux g during the initial stage which caused a significant reduction 19 0 of the daily available energy rn g during the initial stage fm decreased the daily r n mainly due to the lower downward r ns during the day and the higher upward r nl in all day under fm treatment with the development of crop canopy the effects of fm on r n g and r n g greatly diminished during the crop development middle and late stages 2 fm reduced e for the entire growing season increased the t during vigorous crop growth stage and decreased the total et of the growing season by 6 2 fm had a significant effect on the partition of et and the e and t under fm were 0 52 and 1 10 times of those under nm respectively 3 the difference of k c between fm and nm was significant during the initial stage while not during the middle and late stages fm reduced k c ini by 55 3 and k c mid and k c end by 5 7 and 9 7 respectively the k c varied with lai following a quadratic relationship for both treatments 4 the sem analysis showed that film mulching fm and soil temperature st were the main factors affecting r n g et and k c during the initial stage while during the crop development middle and late stages st and lai were main factors affecting r n g and et and k c was mainly affected by lai the sem also confirmed that the fm impact was more significant

10247,reducing water use and mitigating greenhouse gas ghg emissions are two major challenges faced by paddy rice oryza sativa l cultivation water saving technologies including controlled irrigation ci plastic film mulching fm and straw mulching sm have been increasingly adopted to improve rice production efficiency however few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effects of these practices on grain yield water consumption and ghg emissions relative to current farmer s practice fp the objective of this two year field experiment performed in southwestern china was to quantify the effects of ci fm and sm compared with the fp control on rice grain yield irrigation water input water productivity methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi the fm treatment produced grain yield similar to the fp treatment but it significantly decreased the irrigation water input by 69 6 and then markedly increased the water productivity from 5 9 to 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 9 13 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 furthermore the fm treatment significantly reduced ch4 emissions 91 0 95 0 resulting in a great decrease in gwp 36 7 51 4 and ghgi 36 5 51 9 although it markedly increased n2o emissions 90 9 206 9 compared with the fp treatment the ci and sm treatments also significantly increased water productivity and decreased ch4 emissions by reducing irrigation but they caused yield reductions 9 5 and 14 5 on average respectively and showed no benefit to ghgi mitigation compared with the fp treatment these results suggest that there is still great potential to further optimize the current fp practice and fm is a preferable management option to save irrigation water and mitigate ghg emissions while maintaining grain yield in rice production keywords controlled irrigation plastic film mulching straw mulching methane nitrous oxide greenhouse gas intensity 1 introduction rice is the second most important staple crop in the world occupying approximately 11 of the global arable land and providing dietary calories for about 50 of the world s population alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the growth rate of rice yield has decreased over the past two decades and now is not sufficient to meet the fast rising demand dogara and jumare 2014 by the year 2035 global rice production must increase by 116 million mg more than is currently being produced to feed growing populations seck et al 2012 as a consequence an enormous increase in water demand is projected because 75 of the world s rice is produced in irrigated lowlands lampayan et al 2015 nevertheless with climate change population growth and urban and industrial development water is becoming increasingly scarce dalin et al 2015 this scarcity particularly threatens the productivity and sustainability of the traditional irrigated rice system bouman et al 2007 another great challenge faced by irrigated rice cultivation is mitigation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as almost 50 of cropland methane ch4 emissions and 10 of cropland nitrous oxide n2o emissions are from rice fields carlson et al 2017 kritee et al 2018 moreover it is predicted that ghg intensity ghgi of rice production will increase under future climate conditions van groenigen et al 2013 given these severe situations finding ways to maintain or increase rice yield with less water use and low ghg emissions is crucial to ensure food security water productivity as well as ch4 and n2o emissions related to rice production are strongly associated with water management practices feng et al 2013 linquist et al 2015 increasingly great efforts that aim to develop water efficient technologies have been made worldwide kudo et al 2014 devkota et al 2015 xu et al 2016 reis et al 2018 the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd also referred to as intermittent irrigation and midseason drainage md have been widely adopted in global rice production itoh et al 2011 yao et al 2012 lampayan et al 2015 kim et al 2016 compared with continuous flooding these two techniques reportedly decrease irrigation water input enhance water productivity and mitigate ghg emissions li et al 2005 xu et al 2016 carrijo et al 2017 with increasing or little effects on rice yield li et al 2005 lampayan et al 2015 in practice farmers usually integrate these two techniques to achieve the maximum benefits minamikawa et al 2014 and thus continuous flooding has been gradually replaced by the integrated technique zou et al 2009 pan et al 2017 with increasing demand for water saving technologies new water management strategies such as controlled irrigation ci and non flooded mulching cultivation have been tested and applied in some regions bouman and tuong 2001 zhang et al 2008 studies indicated that ci could dramatically decrease water input and ghg emissions without sacrificing rice yield hou et al 2012 reis et al 2018 however some studies also reported that rice yield was reduced under ci conditions compared with continuous flooding bouman and tuong 2001 in the non flooded mulching cultivation system plastic film and crop straw are common materials that have been used by farmers plastic film mulching fm could markedly decrease soil evaporation increase soil temperature and inhibit weed growth thus greatly promoting crop growth and ultimately increasing rice yield and water productivity fan et al 2005 tao et al 2015 recent studies indicated that fm also displayed great potential for reducing ghg emissions yao et al 2014 2017 similar to fm straw mulching sm was effective in reducing irrigation and ghg emissions fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 but most of the studies have reported that sm resulted in yield reductions relative to the traditional flooding production method fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 nevertheless some research has shown that sm did not affect rice yield while fm caused yield losses compared with traditional flooding zhang et al 2008 the different responses of rice yield to water saving practices observed in different studies and sites were probably due to the differences in climate conditions and soil properties as well as to some difference in agricultural management in some cases gwp was even reported to increase rather than decrease under water saving practices kreye et al 2007 sun et al 2016 therefore it remains a serious challenge to simultaneously reduce irrigation and ghg emissions while increasing grain yield in rice production china is the largest rice producer in the world and paddy rice consumes about 70 of its total agricultural water resources bouman et al 2007 by the year 2050 water deficit in china is projected to reach 400 billion m3 tso 2004 moreover increases in the frequency and duration of extreme drought would constitute a greater limitation for rice production qian et al 2011 although some studies have evaluated the effects of water saving technologies on rice production water productivity and ghg emissions the majority of the studies investigated these aspects separately and generally compared results with those obtained under continuous flooding rather than with current farmer s practice fp hou et al 2012 jabran et al 2016 pan et al 2017 reis et al 2018 this leaves great uncertainties in exactly assessing the application effects and prospects of water saving practices a direct comparison between the water saving practices and fp is more meaningful and thus an integrated assessment considering rice yield water consumption water productivity and ghg emissions of various water saving technologies with fp as a reference is urgently required to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly rice production systems we therefore performed a 2 year field study in southwestern china to simultaneously quantify the effects of different water management technologies ci fm and sm with fp as the control on rice grain yield water use water productivity ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi the primary objectives of this study were to i assess the effects of different water management practices on rice grain yield water productivity and ghg emissions and ii identify a preferable management option for maximizing rice yield and irrigation water savings while minimizing the negative climate effects we hypothesized that i rice grain yield can be further increased under ci fm and sm practices compared with fp ii higher water productivity and lower ghg emissions can be achieved under ci fm and sm practices compared with fp and iii fm is more effective than ci and sm in promoting the sustainable development of rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted over two years 2015 and 2016 at the shifang agricultural and ecological research station 31 13 n 104 37 e and 530 m elevation in the sichuan province china the area has a subtropical climate with a mean annual air temperature of 16 5 c and a mean annual precipitation of 860 mm 73 5 of which 632 mm falls between june and september in the two experimental seasons the mean air temperature was 24 1 and 25 2 c and the precipitation was 555 and 403 mm during the rice growing season respectively in 2015 and 2016 fig 1 the main cropping system in the study region is a paddy rice winter wheat rotation with rice from late may to september the soil at this site is classified as hydragric anthrosols by the fao soil classification system the soil properties in the top 20 cm prior to the experiment were as follows bulk density 1 1 g cm 3 ph 5 9 organic carbon 16 9 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 6 g kg 1 available phosphorus 33 6 mg kg 1 and available potassium 57 0 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design and field management in this study four treatments were examined during the rice growing season fig 2 fp ci fm and sm in the fp treatment water management followed the regional farming practice the plots were irrigated to maintain a 2 3 cm water layer for approximately 20 days after transplanting followed by a drainage period of about one month to suppress excessive tillers table 1 fields were then treated with intermittent irrigation until they were drained approximately five weeks before harvest in the other three treatments irrigation was provided to maintain a water layer of 2 3 cm for 7 days after transplanting to ensure the survival of seedlings thereafter limited irrigation was supplied in the ci treatment to keep soil moist but with no permanent water layer observed on the soil surface during the rest of the growing season except for the drying periods as performed in the fp treatment the experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates plot size was 42 m2 6 m 7 m adjacent plots were separated by 80 cm wide ridges with buried plastic film into the soil to a depth of 60 cm after ridging the treatment plots irrigation was supplied to saturate the soil and was followed by puddling before transplanting all fertilizers 150 kg n ha 1 as urea 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 80 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate were broadcast and incorporated into the soil in a single application at puddling because the mulching film in the fm treatment did not permit a late topdressing application the rice hybrid y liangyou 7 is widely used in this area and was selected for use in this experiment rice seedlings were transplanted at a hill spacing of 20 cm 25 cm with two seedlings per hill in the fm treatment transparent polyethylene plastic film 0 01 mm thickness and 2 m width was used to cover the soil after puddling and the rice seedlings were transplanted by punching holes in the film wheat straw harvested from the preceding season in the same field averaging 8 3 mg dry matter ha 1 in the two seasons was used to cover the soil uniformly in the sm treatment the nitrogen and carbon content of the wheat straw was 4 3 and 282 0 g kg 1 respectively the rice seedlings were transplanted on 3 june and 28 may and were harvested on 2 october and 24 september in 2015 and 2016 respectively during the rice growing season pests and diseases were controlled in accordance with local practices after rice harvest the plastic film in the fm treatment and rice straw in all plots were completely removed whereas the undecomposed wheat straw residues in the sm treatment still remained in the fields and were plowed into the soil prior to wheat planting 2 3 determination of grain yield and yield components grain yield was determined by manually harvesting a 6 m2 area in the middle of each plot and yield was adjusted to a 14 moisture content basis in addition six adjacent hills of plants in the same row were selected randomly to determine the yield components i e panicle numbers per m2 spikelet numbers per panicle percentage filled grains and 1 000 grain weight 2 4 determination of water input and water productivity for each plot the amount of irrigation was recorded by a water flow meter connected to the polyethylene distribution pipes the daily precipitation was recorded by an automatic weather station that was located approximately 60 m from the experimental field the water productivity was calculated as the grain yield divided by total water input including irrigation and precipitation 2 5 measurement of ch4 and n2o fluxes the ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured using the closed static chamber technique the stainless steel base frames 50 50 and 15 cm in length width and height respectively were inserted into the soil to a depth of 15 cm prior to transplanting for lateral water movement and root growth several small holes were drilled in each side of the frame beneath the soil surface a water filled groove was located at the top of the frame to seal the upper chamber airtight during the period of sampling the stainless steel upper chambers were 50 cm length 50 cm width 100 cm height and two circulating fans were mounted at opposite angles of the chamber headspace to evenly mix the air inside the chamber to minimize the air temperature changes inside the chamber each side of the chamber was wrapped with a layer of styrofoam removable boardwalks were used to access the chambers during flux measurements to prevent soil compaction four hills with two rice seedlings a hill were transplanted inside each chamber area the ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured every other day for 12 days after transplanting and then every 4 days on each sampling day the gas samples were collected from the chamber headspace between 8 30 a m and 11 30 a m using 30 ml polypropylene syringes fitted with 3 way stopcocks at 0 15 30 and 45 min after chamber closure and subsequently were transited into sealed and pre evacuated glass vials the air temperature inside the chambers was measured simultaneously using portable digital thermometers jm624 jinming instrument ltd tianjin china at the first and fourth gas sampling the gas samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a shanghai china equipped with a flame ionization detector fid for detecting ch4 and an electronic capture detector ecd for detecting n2o the temperatures for the fid and ecd detectors were 250 and 300 c respectively and the temperature for the column oven was 60 c the carrier gas was pure n2 99 999 the ch4 and n2o fluxes were calculated using the linear regression method the flux on non sampling days was estimated by linear interpolation between every two adjacent intervals of the measurements mosier et al 2006 and the seasonal cumulative fluxes were calculated by summing the daily fluxes the total gwp of ch4 and n2o fluxes was calculated as co2 equivalents co2 eq over a 100 year time horizon using the radioactive forcing potential of 34 for ch4 and 298 for n2o ipcc 2013 the ghgi was calculated as the gwp divided by grain yield 2 6 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using sas software version 9 1 the differences between the treatment means were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance anova and were considered significant based on the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rice grain yield and yield components grain yields for the fp and fm treatments were the same in both seasons but these yields were significantly higher than the yield of the sm treatment fig 3 the ci treatment produced significantly lower grain yield in 2015 but in 2016 the ci treatment yielded the same as the fp treatment in the two experimental seasons grain yields in 2015 average 11 2 mg ha 1 were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in 2016 average 10 0 mg ha 1 in both seasons the highest values of panicles m 2 were obtained with the fm treatment though no significant differences were observed among the fm fp and ci treatments table 2 however the sm treatment had significantly fewer panicles m 2 in both seasons compared with the fm treatment the spikelets panicle 1 were not different between the treatments in 2015 but were significantly lower in the sm treatment than in the fm treatment in 2016 the percentage of filled grains was similar in all treatments the 1 000 grain weight was significantly lower in the ci treatment than in the sm treatment in 2015 but no significant difference was observed among the sm fp and fm treatments in 2016 the 1 000 grain weight was similar in the four treatments the yield components varied between the two seasons with significantly p 0 05 lower values of 1 000 grain weight but significantly p 0 05 higher values of spikelets panicle 1 and percentage filled grains in 2015 3 2 water input and water productivity the irrigation water input was significantly different among the four treatments with the highest value observed in the fp treatment followed by the ci treatment table 3 the water inputs in the fm and sm treatments were similar in the two seasons but these values were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments compared with the fp treatment the irrigation water input was reduced by an average of 665 mm or 52 2 in ci 891 mm or 69 6 in fm and 892 mm or 69 7 in sm across the two seasons the irrigation water inputs varied in the two seasons with significantly higher values observed in 2016 736 mm on average than in 2015 599 mm on average water productivity was significantly different among the treatments with the highest value observed in the fm treatment table 3 compared with the fp treatment the water productivity was 1 4 1 9 and 1 6 times higher in 2015 and 1 5 2 2 and 1 8 times higher in 2016 for the ci fm and sm treatments respectively averaged across the four treatments water productivity was significantly p 0 05 higher by 6 6 in 2015 than that in 2016 3 3 ghg emissions gwp and ghgi the ch4 emissions from the treatments were highly dependent on the irrigation regimes fig 4 the ch4 emissions exhibited more or less similar temporal trends for the treatments with markedly increased emissions after transplanting and peak emissions occurring at approximately the end of the flooding periods the flux rates then gradually decreased along with the floodwater drainage and remained at relatively low levels thereafter however the magnitude of emissions differed between the treatments and fluctuations were observed during the drainage and intermittent irrigation periods in 2015 the ch4 flux rate for the fp treatment ranged from 146 2 153 μg c m 2 h 1 with an average of 319 μg c m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than the flux rate for the ci treatment average 125 μg c m 2 h 1 the fm and sm treatments further reduced the average ch4 flux rate to 33 and 43 μg c m 2 h 1 respectively the sm treatment presented a high emission peak of 2 487 μg c m 2 h 1 in 2016 which was comparable to the peak value of the fp treatment 2 321 μg c m 2 h 1 however the average ch4 flux rate was significantly lower with the sm treatment 219 μg c m 2 h 1 than with the fp treatment 362 μg c m 2 h 1 for the ci treatment the ch4 flux rate average 159 μg c m 2 h 1 was not significantly different from the flux rate for the sm treatment but it was significantly higher than observed flux rate for the fm treatment 40 μg c m 2 h 1 notably negative ch4 emissions were observed during the drainage periods in both seasons especially with the mulching treatments the seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions was highest with the fp treatment and it was significantly reduced by 62 5 95 0 and 91 8 in 2015 and by 57 0 91 0 and 50 7 in 2016 with the ci fm and sm treatments respectively table 4 the n2o emissions varied between the treatments fig 4 for the fp treatment the n2o emissions were relatively low over the entire growing season except for several small pulses during the drainage and intermittent irrigation periods compared with the fp treatment the ci treatment exhibited slightly increased n2o emissions and a moderate emission peak was observed at approximately 8 10 days after transplanting in 2015 the n2o emissions for the fm and sm treatments were significantly higher than for the fp treatment with emission peaks occurring at approximately 8 15 days after transplanting nevertheless negative n2o emissions were also detected e g for the fp treatment during the flooding period across the growing season the average n2o flux rates for the fp ci fm and sm treatments were 6 2 19 2 34 8 and 22 4 μg n m 2 h 1 in 2015 and 10 6 16 2 23 2 and 22 7 μg n m 2 h 1 in 2016 respectively the seasonal cumulative n2o emissions were similar in the ci fm and sm treatments but a significant difference was observed between the fp and the mulching treatments table 4 the variations in ch4 and n2o emissions between the treatments were closely associated with the irrigation water input fig 5 the regression analysis indicated that the ch4 emissions increased linearly with the increasing irrigation amount in contrast n2o emissions decreased exponentially with increasing irrigation amount changes in irrigation water input explained 88 3 p 0 001 and 92 9 p 0 001 of the variation in ch4 and n2o emissions respectively the total gwp of ch4 and n2o emissions ranged from 327 to 569 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2015 and from 311 to 640 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2016 fig 6 the ci and mulching treatments tended to decrease gwp with significantly lower values observed with the sm treatment in 2015 and with the ci and fm treatments in 2016 compared with the fp treatment the gwp of the ci fm and sm treatments was decreased by 27 4 36 7 and 42 5 in 2015 and by 33 3 51 4 and 20 7 in 2016 respectively compared with the fp treatment seasonal gwp was primarily attributable to ch4 emissions in the fp treatment with an average contribution of 79 5 over the two seasons fig 6 conversely the contribution of n2o emissions to gwp was much higher than contribution of ch4 emissions with the fm and sm treatments only in 2015 the gwp with the ci treatment was almost equally attributable to the ch4 and n2o emissions and a similar result was also observed with the sm treatment in 2016 the ghgi of the fp treatment was 47 3 and 60 8 kg co2 eq mg 1 grain in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 6 the ci and mulching treatments tended to decrease ghgi with a significant difference observed between the fp and fm treatments in both seasons the ghgi values with the ci fm and sm treatments were 16 2 36 5 and 32 6 lower respectively than the values observed with the fp treatment in 2015 and 29 3 51 9 and 8 5 lower in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield rice grain yield ranged from 9 0 to 12 0 mg ha 1 in the present study table 2 which was higher than the reported yields 5 3 8 0 mg ha 1 of previous studies in the sichuan basin fan et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 probably because a high yielding hybrid rice and a higher transplanting density were adopted in this study wu et al 2010 an et al 2018 furthermore the grain yields were also much higher than the average yields 7 0 mg ha 1 observed in farmers fields chen et al 2014 and were comparable to the attainable potential yield 10 2 mg ha 1 for single rice in china an et al 2018 these results indicate that there is a substantial potential for farmers to increase rice yield by adopting precision management practices e g appropriate varieties plant densities and advanced water management rice is highly sensitive to reduction in water availability and thus water management strongly affected rice yield fig 3 which was in agreement with previous studies jiao et al 2018 reis et al 2018 rice grain yield was reduced in both seasons with the ci and sm treatments fig 3 other studies have also reported that ci and sm usually caused yield losses bouman and tuong 2001 fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 owing to negative impacts on yield components table 2 zhang et al 2008 however jiao et al 2018 reported that ci did not decrease but rather increased rice yield compared with traditional flooding probably because precipitation was high at their study site in this study precipitation was relatively low during the two growing seasons fig 1 such that the water requirement of rice plants was not met under the reduced irrigation condition these results indicate that climatic conditions are important factors that should be considered when applying new production techniques in different regions on the other hand although the sm practice could promote plant growth during the middle and late portions of the growing season by increasing soil organic carbon and nitrogen content fan et al 2005 it would not be an attractive technology for farmers because this practice restricted plant growth during the early season as indicated by the reduced tiller numbers table 2 and ultimately reduced rice yield in contrast to the ci and sm treatments the fm treatment produced similar grain yield as the fp treatment fig 3 this result was in agreement with previous studies fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 yao et al 2017 this finding was most likely because plastic mulching can keep soil moist by restricting percolation and evaporation reis et al 2018 while at the same time increasing soil temperature during the early growing season qu et al 2012 the more favorable moisture and temperature environment for rice growth and development resulted in no significant differences in yield components between the fm and fp treatments table 2 however zhang et al 2008 reported that rice yield was reduced under fm conditions due to decreased percentage of filled grains and grain weight this was mainly because the fm practice promoted tillering and caused heavy lodging during the late grain filling period which consequently negatively affected accumulation and translocation of photosynthate zhang et al 2008 in this study we also observed more rapid growth of rice plants during the early growing season and more tillers as indicated by the increased number of panicles in the fm treatment than in the other treatments table 2 the duration of the rice tillering phase has been reported to be affected by soil water status liang et al 2016 therefore an appropriate irrigation regime that considers soil water status is crucial in order to optimize tiller number and quality and to achieve a high yield overall these results do not support our first hypothesis and indicate that the studied water saving practices have few advantages regarding grain production to support replacement of the current widely used cultivation practice in future studies efforts should be made to develop more efficient water saving technologies by considering soil plant and climate conditions to further increase rice yield 4 2 water input and water productivity rice is the greatest consumer of freshwater among all crops because it is mostly grown under submerged conditions however studies have indicated that continuous flooding is not necessary for rice growth and yield formation miniotti et al 2016 zhuang et al 2019 in this study the irrigation water inputs in the fp treatment were 1 170 1 391 mm table 3 which were lower than the reported values around 1 300 3 750 mm for irrigated rice in asia bouman et al 2007 kreye et al 2007 this was primarily attributed to the md and awd practices adopted in this study as these practices could markedly reduce irrigation water requirement by decreasing seepage percolation and evaporation belder et al 2005 liang et al 2016 notably the irrigation water input was further reduced by 49 7 54 7 with the ci treatment and by 68 7 70 8 with the two mulching treatments compared with the fp treatment table 3 this was mainly due to decreased percolation and evaporation aziz et al 2018 because the duration of unsubmerged and unsaturated soil conditions was longer under these three treatments than under the fp treatment furthermore the two mulching practices were more effective in reducing soil evaporation by restricting water vapor exchange between the soil and air zhang et al 2008 such that the fm and sm treatments had a greater potential than the ci treatment to reduce irrigation table 3 enhancing crop water productivity is an essential requirement for producing water sustainability and food security brauman et al 2013 in this study the water productivity ranged from 5 9 to 13 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 3 which was averagely higher than the values of 3 6 12 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 reported by previous researchers liang et al 2016 aziz et al 2018 reis et al 2018 moreover the water productivity was further markedly increased under the three water saving practices and this result supports our second hypothesis regarding water use compared with the fp treatment water productivity with the fm treatment was increased by 89 1 118 3 table 3 this increase was due to the great reduction in irrigation water input table 3 as the grain yield was not significantly different between these two treatments in line with our results other studies have also reported that water productivity was remarkably increased by 52 0 102 3 with fm compared with continuous flooding liu et al 2005 tao et al 2015 similarly the ci and sm treatments increased water productivity significantly by reducing irrigation compared with the fp treatment table 3 which was similarly reported previously liu et al 2005 reis et al 2018 however these two practices caused yield reductions indicating that ci and sm probably are not advisable water management strategies for rice production in the study region these results indicate that there is still a great potential to further increase the water productivity in farmer s fields by adopting more efficient water saving practices e g fm 4 3 ghg emissions gwp and ghgi paddy fields are a major source of ch4 and mitigating ch4 emissions by optimizing management practices is a great challenge that needs to be addressed urgently for the sustainability of rice production in this study the seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions ranged from 10 13 to 11 04 kg c ha 1 for the fp treatment table 4 comparable results were reported in previous studies linquist et al 2015 gupta et al 2016 which indicated that the cumulative ch4 emissions ranged from 1 7 to 71 4 kg c ha 1 in rice fields however these results are clearly lower than the reported values 145 7 346 5 kg c ha 1 of other studies skinner et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 water management has been recognized as one of the most important factors influencing ch4 emissions from paddy fields kudo et al 2014 liang et al 2016 and this was also observed in our study where 88 3 of the variation in cumulative ch4 emissions was explained by the irrigation amount fig 5 there are five likely reasons for the relatively low ch4 emissions in this study first the md and awd practices used in the fp treatment prolonged the duration of aerobic conditions in the soil which inhibited ch4 production but stimulated ch4 oxidation linquist et al 2015 second the flooding period after transplanting was approximately 20 days in this study shorter than the expected time about 30 60 days required for ch4 emissions to reach peak values zhou et al 2015 sun et al 2016 third the water depth during the flooding period was 2 3 cm in this study which was much shallower than the depth 8 cm in the study of zhou et al 2015 the ch4 flux rate has been shown to be positively correlated with water depth meijide et al 2017 fourth the soil cracked during the md period and this caused rapid infiltration of irrigation water therefore the ch4 emissions remained at relatively low levels during the awd period fig 4 fifth the low precipitation during the growing seasons probably restricted ch4 production in agreement zhang et al 2018 reported that the higher the precipitation the greater the ch4 emissions observed water saving technologies produced a significant impact on ch4 emissions and the treatments with reduced irrigation significantly decreased the cumulative ch4 emissions compared with the fp treatment table 4 this result agreed with previous studies kreye et al 2007 hou et al 2012 yao et al 2017 the large decrease in ch4 emissions was mainly due to the markedly reduced irrigation amounts for the ci and mulching treatments table 3 which created aerobic environments and prevented the development of anaerobic conditions in the soil hou et al 2012 yao et al 2017 as a result these three treatments inhibited ch4 production by methanogens and stimulated ch4 oxidation by methanotrophs conrad 2007 the cumulative ch4 emissions were further reduced in the fm treatment in both seasons and in the sm treatment in 2015 compared with the ci treatment table 4 most likely because the mulching treatments further decreased irrigation amounts in a recent study zhang et al 2018 reported that ch4 emissions from a field with plastic mulching were similar to those of a rain fed rice field these results indicate that mulching has a greater potential for mitigating ch4 emissions than use of ci however for the sm treatment the cumulative ch4 emission value in 2016 was 6 6 times higher than observed in 2015 table 4 the activity of methanogens is related to the availability of organic matter peyron et al 2016 in the sm treatment the undecomposed wheat straw residues during the 2015 rice season were plowed into the soil which probably provided additional carbon substrates for ch4 production and consequently high diurnal emissions were observed during the flooding period in 2016 fig 4 other studies also reported that straw incorporation into paddy fields dramatically increased ch4 emissions ma et al 2009 peyron et al 2016 therefore apart from adopting water saving technologies reducing carbon input by optimizing residue management may be another promising option to mitigate ch4 emissions in rice production in this study the rice fields acted as an n2o source irrespective of irrigation amount and mulching method table 4 this was consistent with previous studies zou et al 2007 skinner et al 2014 which demonstrated that the seasonal n2o emissions ranged from 0 14 to 6 17 kg n ha 1 from paddy fields however it should be noted that water management plays an important role in regulating n2o emissions cumulative n2o emissions were increased in the three water saving treatments compared with the fp treatment especially for the two mulching treatments table 4 similar results were reported by other studies kreye et al 2007 hou et al 2012 the increase in n2o emissions under water saving practices was primarily attributed to the aerobic and moist soil conditions that resulted from reduced irrigation which allowed nitrification and denitrification processes to produce n2o peyron et al 2016 thus high diurnal n2o emissions were observed in the fm and sm treatments after the initial flooding period fig 4 the basal n fertilization also contributed to the increased n2o emissions during that period zhou et al 2015 surprisingly only a small pulse of n2o emissions was detected with the ci treatment and negative values were even observed with certain treatments during the initial flooding and middle growing seasons this phenomenon was also reported by other studies meijide et al 2017 chen et al 2018 and it was probably because the anaerobic conditions resulting from irrigation or mulching and high temperature facilitated the denitrification process thereby n2o was further reduced to n2 butterbach bahl et al 2013 in the fp treatment gwp was dominated by ch4 emissions fig 6 and this result was in agreement with previous studies linquist et al 2015 gupta et al 2016 due to the lower ch4 emissions table 4 gwp tended to decrease in the ci and mulching treatments fig 6 similarly studies have reported that gwp decreased by 27 3 in the ci treatment hou et al 2012 and by 63 3 in the fm treatment yao et al 2017 compared with a traditional irrigation production practice moreover the decrease in gwp could be greater under water saving practices when considering electricity generation for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 these results confirmed our second hypothesis and demonstrated that the cultivation practice currently used by farmers can be further optimized by integrating mulching or reducing irrigation to further decrease ghg emissions notably for the ci and mulching treatments the gwp was decreased by 20 7 51 4 compared with the fp treatment fig 6 which was lower than the corresponding decrease 50 7 95 0 in cumulative ch4 emissions table 4 this result was primarily because the decrease in ch4 emissions was partially offset by an increase in n2o emissions in these treatments in some cases gwp was even higher in the fields with non flooded mulching or reduced irrigation than gwp in the traditional lowland rice fields due to the great increase in n2o emissions kreye et al 2007 sun et al 2016 therefore reducing n2o emissions by optimizing nitrogen management e g split application deep placement as well as use of controlled release fertilizer nitrification and urease inhibitors is crucial to further decrease the gwp for rice grown under water saving conditions xia et al 2017 changes in climate and increases in food demand will require management practices that can minimize negative environmental effects while maximizing crop productivity chen et al 2014 the ghgi is an indicator that integrates the impacts of management practices on ghg emissions and crop yield thus ghgi can better express the ghg efficiency of a cropping system and can be used to improve cropping technique selection and innovation van groenigen et al 2010 feng et al 2013 in this study the ghgi for the fp treatment ranged from 47 3 to 60 8 kg co2 eq mg 1 fig 6 which was within the low range of reported values 14 2 122 kg co2 eq mg 1 for rice linquist et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 most likely because of the relatively high grain yield and low ch4 emissions observed in this study the fm treatment significantly reduced ghgi by 36 5 51 9 compared with the fp treatment fig 6 owing to the lower gwp a similar result has been reported by other researchers yao et al 2014 2017 who indicated that the ghgi was significantly lower by 50 3 67 0 in plastic mulching fields than in conventional paddy fields although the ci and sm treatments tended to decrease gwp they also caused yield losses and ultimately the ghgi of these two treatments showed no significant difference compared with the fp treatment fig 6 these results confirmed our third hypothesis and suggested that the fm practice is superior to the current fp practice and is a preferable management option for rice production and ghg mitigation 5 conclusions the water saving practices investigated in this study produced significant effects on water productivity and ghg emissions compared with the fp treatment the ci fm and sm treatments significantly increased water productivity by reducing irrigation amounts furthermore the gwp tended to decrease in the ci and two mulching treatments because the reduction in ch4 emissions was greater than the increase in n2o emissions with these treatments however the three water saving practices showed different effects on grain yield with fm producing a similar grain yield to that observed with fp in contrast to ci and sm that both caused yield reductions as a result the ghgi was significantly decreased with the fm treatment but the ci and sm treatments showed no significant effect on ghgi compared with the fp treatment these findings contribute to our understanding of the various effects of different water management practices on rice yield water productivity and ghg mitigation considering the future potential water crisis fm is

10247,reducing water use and mitigating greenhouse gas ghg emissions are two major challenges faced by paddy rice oryza sativa l cultivation water saving technologies including controlled irrigation ci plastic film mulching fm and straw mulching sm have been increasingly adopted to improve rice production efficiency however few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effects of these practices on grain yield water consumption and ghg emissions relative to current farmer s practice fp the objective of this two year field experiment performed in southwestern china was to quantify the effects of ci fm and sm compared with the fp control on rice grain yield irrigation water input water productivity methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi the fm treatment produced grain yield similar to the fp treatment but it significantly decreased the irrigation water input by 69 6 and then markedly increased the water productivity from 5 9 to 7 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 9 13 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 furthermore the fm treatment significantly reduced ch4 emissions 91 0 95 0 resulting in a great decrease in gwp 36 7 51 4 and ghgi 36 5 51 9 although it markedly increased n2o emissions 90 9 206 9 compared with the fp treatment the ci and sm treatments also significantly increased water productivity and decreased ch4 emissions by reducing irrigation but they caused yield reductions 9 5 and 14 5 on average respectively and showed no benefit to ghgi mitigation compared with the fp treatment these results suggest that there is still great potential to further optimize the current fp practice and fm is a preferable management option to save irrigation water and mitigate ghg emissions while maintaining grain yield in rice production keywords controlled irrigation plastic film mulching straw mulching methane nitrous oxide greenhouse gas intensity 1 introduction rice is the second most important staple crop in the world occupying approximately 11 of the global arable land and providing dietary calories for about 50 of the world s population alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the growth rate of rice yield has decreased over the past two decades and now is not sufficient to meet the fast rising demand dogara and jumare 2014 by the year 2035 global rice production must increase by 116 million mg more than is currently being produced to feed growing populations seck et al 2012 as a consequence an enormous increase in water demand is projected because 75 of the world s rice is produced in irrigated lowlands lampayan et al 2015 nevertheless with climate change population growth and urban and industrial development water is becoming increasingly scarce dalin et al 2015 this scarcity particularly threatens the productivity and sustainability of the traditional irrigated rice system bouman et al 2007 another great challenge faced by irrigated rice cultivation is mitigation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as almost 50 of cropland methane ch4 emissions and 10 of cropland nitrous oxide n2o emissions are from rice fields carlson et al 2017 kritee et al 2018 moreover it is predicted that ghg intensity ghgi of rice production will increase under future climate conditions van groenigen et al 2013 given these severe situations finding ways to maintain or increase rice yield with less water use and low ghg emissions is crucial to ensure food security water productivity as well as ch4 and n2o emissions related to rice production are strongly associated with water management practices feng et al 2013 linquist et al 2015 increasingly great efforts that aim to develop water efficient technologies have been made worldwide kudo et al 2014 devkota et al 2015 xu et al 2016 reis et al 2018 the alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd also referred to as intermittent irrigation and midseason drainage md have been widely adopted in global rice production itoh et al 2011 yao et al 2012 lampayan et al 2015 kim et al 2016 compared with continuous flooding these two techniques reportedly decrease irrigation water input enhance water productivity and mitigate ghg emissions li et al 2005 xu et al 2016 carrijo et al 2017 with increasing or little effects on rice yield li et al 2005 lampayan et al 2015 in practice farmers usually integrate these two techniques to achieve the maximum benefits minamikawa et al 2014 and thus continuous flooding has been gradually replaced by the integrated technique zou et al 2009 pan et al 2017 with increasing demand for water saving technologies new water management strategies such as controlled irrigation ci and non flooded mulching cultivation have been tested and applied in some regions bouman and tuong 2001 zhang et al 2008 studies indicated that ci could dramatically decrease water input and ghg emissions without sacrificing rice yield hou et al 2012 reis et al 2018 however some studies also reported that rice yield was reduced under ci conditions compared with continuous flooding bouman and tuong 2001 in the non flooded mulching cultivation system plastic film and crop straw are common materials that have been used by farmers plastic film mulching fm could markedly decrease soil evaporation increase soil temperature and inhibit weed growth thus greatly promoting crop growth and ultimately increasing rice yield and water productivity fan et al 2005 tao et al 2015 recent studies indicated that fm also displayed great potential for reducing ghg emissions yao et al 2014 2017 similar to fm straw mulching sm was effective in reducing irrigation and ghg emissions fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 but most of the studies have reported that sm resulted in yield reductions relative to the traditional flooding production method fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 nevertheless some research has shown that sm did not affect rice yield while fm caused yield losses compared with traditional flooding zhang et al 2008 the different responses of rice yield to water saving practices observed in different studies and sites were probably due to the differences in climate conditions and soil properties as well as to some difference in agricultural management in some cases gwp was even reported to increase rather than decrease under water saving practices kreye et al 2007 sun et al 2016 therefore it remains a serious challenge to simultaneously reduce irrigation and ghg emissions while increasing grain yield in rice production china is the largest rice producer in the world and paddy rice consumes about 70 of its total agricultural water resources bouman et al 2007 by the year 2050 water deficit in china is projected to reach 400 billion m3 tso 2004 moreover increases in the frequency and duration of extreme drought would constitute a greater limitation for rice production qian et al 2011 although some studies have evaluated the effects of water saving technologies on rice production water productivity and ghg emissions the majority of the studies investigated these aspects separately and generally compared results with those obtained under continuous flooding rather than with current farmer s practice fp hou et al 2012 jabran et al 2016 pan et al 2017 reis et al 2018 this leaves great uncertainties in exactly assessing the application effects and prospects of water saving practices a direct comparison between the water saving practices and fp is more meaningful and thus an integrated assessment considering rice yield water consumption water productivity and ghg emissions of various water saving technologies with fp as a reference is urgently required to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly rice production systems we therefore performed a 2 year field study in southwestern china to simultaneously quantify the effects of different water management technologies ci fm and sm with fp as the control on rice grain yield water use water productivity ch4 and n2o emissions gwp and ghgi the primary objectives of this study were to i assess the effects of different water management practices on rice grain yield water productivity and ghg emissions and ii identify a preferable management option for maximizing rice yield and irrigation water savings while minimizing the negative climate effects we hypothesized that i rice grain yield can be further increased under ci fm and sm practices compared with fp ii higher water productivity and lower ghg emissions can be achieved under ci fm and sm practices compared with fp and iii fm is more effective than ci and sm in promoting the sustainable development of rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted over two years 2015 and 2016 at the shifang agricultural and ecological research station 31 13 n 104 37 e and 530 m elevation in the sichuan province china the area has a subtropical climate with a mean annual air temperature of 16 5 c and a mean annual precipitation of 860 mm 73 5 of which 632 mm falls between june and september in the two experimental seasons the mean air temperature was 24 1 and 25 2 c and the precipitation was 555 and 403 mm during the rice growing season respectively in 2015 and 2016 fig 1 the main cropping system in the study region is a paddy rice winter wheat rotation with rice from late may to september the soil at this site is classified as hydragric anthrosols by the fao soil classification system the soil properties in the top 20 cm prior to the experiment were as follows bulk density 1 1 g cm 3 ph 5 9 organic carbon 16 9 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 6 g kg 1 available phosphorus 33 6 mg kg 1 and available potassium 57 0 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design and field management in this study four treatments were examined during the rice growing season fig 2 fp ci fm and sm in the fp treatment water management followed the regional farming practice the plots were irrigated to maintain a 2 3 cm water layer for approximately 20 days after transplanting followed by a drainage period of about one month to suppress excessive tillers table 1 fields were then treated with intermittent irrigation until they were drained approximately five weeks before harvest in the other three treatments irrigation was provided to maintain a water layer of 2 3 cm for 7 days after transplanting to ensure the survival of seedlings thereafter limited irrigation was supplied in the ci treatment to keep soil moist but with no permanent water layer observed on the soil surface during the rest of the growing season except for the drying periods as performed in the fp treatment the experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates plot size was 42 m2 6 m 7 m adjacent plots were separated by 80 cm wide ridges with buried plastic film into the soil to a depth of 60 cm after ridging the treatment plots irrigation was supplied to saturate the soil and was followed by puddling before transplanting all fertilizers 150 kg n ha 1 as urea 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 80 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate were broadcast and incorporated into the soil in a single application at puddling because the mulching film in the fm treatment did not permit a late topdressing application the rice hybrid y liangyou 7 is widely used in this area and was selected for use in this experiment rice seedlings were transplanted at a hill spacing of 20 cm 25 cm with two seedlings per hill in the fm treatment transparent polyethylene plastic film 0 01 mm thickness and 2 m width was used to cover the soil after puddling and the rice seedlings were transplanted by punching holes in the film wheat straw harvested from the preceding season in the same field averaging 8 3 mg dry matter ha 1 in the two seasons was used to cover the soil uniformly in the sm treatment the nitrogen and carbon content of the wheat straw was 4 3 and 282 0 g kg 1 respectively the rice seedlings were transplanted on 3 june and 28 may and were harvested on 2 october and 24 september in 2015 and 2016 respectively during the rice growing season pests and diseases were controlled in accordance with local practices after rice harvest the plastic film in the fm treatment and rice straw in all plots were completely removed whereas the undecomposed wheat straw residues in the sm treatment still remained in the fields and were plowed into the soil prior to wheat planting 2 3 determination of grain yield and yield components grain yield was determined by manually harvesting a 6 m2 area in the middle of each plot and yield was adjusted to a 14 moisture content basis in addition six adjacent hills of plants in the same row were selected randomly to determine the yield components i e panicle numbers per m2 spikelet numbers per panicle percentage filled grains and 1 000 grain weight 2 4 determination of water input and water productivity for each plot the amount of irrigation was recorded by a water flow meter connected to the polyethylene distribution pipes the daily precipitation was recorded by an automatic weather station that was located approximately 60 m from the experimental field the water productivity was calculated as the grain yield divided by total water input including irrigation and precipitation 2 5 measurement of ch4 and n2o fluxes the ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured using the closed static chamber technique the stainless steel base frames 50 50 and 15 cm in length width and height respectively were inserted into the soil to a depth of 15 cm prior to transplanting for lateral water movement and root growth several small holes were drilled in each side of the frame beneath the soil surface a water filled groove was located at the top of the frame to seal the upper chamber airtight during the period of sampling the stainless steel upper chambers were 50 cm length 50 cm width 100 cm height and two circulating fans were mounted at opposite angles of the chamber headspace to evenly mix the air inside the chamber to minimize the air temperature changes inside the chamber each side of the chamber was wrapped with a layer of styrofoam removable boardwalks were used to access the chambers during flux measurements to prevent soil compaction four hills with two rice seedlings a hill were transplanted inside each chamber area the ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured every other day for 12 days after transplanting and then every 4 days on each sampling day the gas samples were collected from the chamber headspace between 8 30 a m and 11 30 a m using 30 ml polypropylene syringes fitted with 3 way stopcocks at 0 15 30 and 45 min after chamber closure and subsequently were transited into sealed and pre evacuated glass vials the air temperature inside the chambers was measured simultaneously using portable digital thermometers jm624 jinming instrument ltd tianjin china at the first and fourth gas sampling the gas samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a shanghai china equipped with a flame ionization detector fid for detecting ch4 and an electronic capture detector ecd for detecting n2o the temperatures for the fid and ecd detectors were 250 and 300 c respectively and the temperature for the column oven was 60 c the carrier gas was pure n2 99 999 the ch4 and n2o fluxes were calculated using the linear regression method the flux on non sampling days was estimated by linear interpolation between every two adjacent intervals of the measurements mosier et al 2006 and the seasonal cumulative fluxes were calculated by summing the daily fluxes the total gwp of ch4 and n2o fluxes was calculated as co2 equivalents co2 eq over a 100 year time horizon using the radioactive forcing potential of 34 for ch4 and 298 for n2o ipcc 2013 the ghgi was calculated as the gwp divided by grain yield 2 6 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using sas software version 9 1 the differences between the treatment means were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance anova and were considered significant based on the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rice grain yield and yield components grain yields for the fp and fm treatments were the same in both seasons but these yields were significantly higher than the yield of the sm treatment fig 3 the ci treatment produced significantly lower grain yield in 2015 but in 2016 the ci treatment yielded the same as the fp treatment in the two experimental seasons grain yields in 2015 average 11 2 mg ha 1 were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in 2016 average 10 0 mg ha 1 in both seasons the highest values of panicles m 2 were obtained with the fm treatment though no significant differences were observed among the fm fp and ci treatments table 2 however the sm treatment had significantly fewer panicles m 2 in both seasons compared with the fm treatment the spikelets panicle 1 were not different between the treatments in 2015 but were significantly lower in the sm treatment than in the fm treatment in 2016 the percentage of filled grains was similar in all treatments the 1 000 grain weight was significantly lower in the ci treatment than in the sm treatment in 2015 but no significant difference was observed among the sm fp and fm treatments in 2016 the 1 000 grain weight was similar in the four treatments the yield components varied between the two seasons with significantly p 0 05 lower values of 1 000 grain weight but significantly p 0 05 higher values of spikelets panicle 1 and percentage filled grains in 2015 3 2 water input and water productivity the irrigation water input was significantly different among the four treatments with the highest value observed in the fp treatment followed by the ci treatment table 3 the water inputs in the fm and sm treatments were similar in the two seasons but these values were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments compared with the fp treatment the irrigation water input was reduced by an average of 665 mm or 52 2 in ci 891 mm or 69 6 in fm and 892 mm or 69 7 in sm across the two seasons the irrigation water inputs varied in the two seasons with significantly higher values observed in 2016 736 mm on average than in 2015 599 mm on average water productivity was significantly different among the treatments with the highest value observed in the fm treatment table 3 compared with the fp treatment the water productivity was 1 4 1 9 and 1 6 times higher in 2015 and 1 5 2 2 and 1 8 times higher in 2016 for the ci fm and sm treatments respectively averaged across the four treatments water productivity was significantly p 0 05 higher by 6 6 in 2015 than that in 2016 3 3 ghg emissions gwp and ghgi the ch4 emissions from the treatments were highly dependent on the irrigation regimes fig 4 the ch4 emissions exhibited more or less similar temporal trends for the treatments with markedly increased emissions after transplanting and peak emissions occurring at approximately the end of the flooding periods the flux rates then gradually decreased along with the floodwater drainage and remained at relatively low levels thereafter however the magnitude of emissions differed between the treatments and fluctuations were observed during the drainage and intermittent irrigation periods in 2015 the ch4 flux rate for the fp treatment ranged from 146 2 153 μg c m 2 h 1 with an average of 319 μg c m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than the flux rate for the ci treatment average 125 μg c m 2 h 1 the fm and sm treatments further reduced the average ch4 flux rate to 33 and 43 μg c m 2 h 1 respectively the sm treatment presented a high emission peak of 2 487 μg c m 2 h 1 in 2016 which was comparable to the peak value of the fp treatment 2 321 μg c m 2 h 1 however the average ch4 flux rate was significantly lower with the sm treatment 219 μg c m 2 h 1 than with the fp treatment 362 μg c m 2 h 1 for the ci treatment the ch4 flux rate average 159 μg c m 2 h 1 was not significantly different from the flux rate for the sm treatment but it was significantly higher than observed flux rate for the fm treatment 40 μg c m 2 h 1 notably negative ch4 emissions were observed during the drainage periods in both seasons especially with the mulching treatments the seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions was highest with the fp treatment and it was significantly reduced by 62 5 95 0 and 91 8 in 2015 and by 57 0 91 0 and 50 7 in 2016 with the ci fm and sm treatments respectively table 4 the n2o emissions varied between the treatments fig 4 for the fp treatment the n2o emissions were relatively low over the entire growing season except for several small pulses during the drainage and intermittent irrigation periods compared with the fp treatment the ci treatment exhibited slightly increased n2o emissions and a moderate emission peak was observed at approximately 8 10 days after transplanting in 2015 the n2o emissions for the fm and sm treatments were significantly higher than for the fp treatment with emission peaks occurring at approximately 8 15 days after transplanting nevertheless negative n2o emissions were also detected e g for the fp treatment during the flooding period across the growing season the average n2o flux rates for the fp ci fm and sm treatments were 6 2 19 2 34 8 and 22 4 μg n m 2 h 1 in 2015 and 10 6 16 2 23 2 and 22 7 μg n m 2 h 1 in 2016 respectively the seasonal cumulative n2o emissions were similar in the ci fm and sm treatments but a significant difference was observed between the fp and the mulching treatments table 4 the variations in ch4 and n2o emissions between the treatments were closely associated with the irrigation water input fig 5 the regression analysis indicated that the ch4 emissions increased linearly with the increasing irrigation amount in contrast n2o emissions decreased exponentially with increasing irrigation amount changes in irrigation water input explained 88 3 p 0 001 and 92 9 p 0 001 of the variation in ch4 and n2o emissions respectively the total gwp of ch4 and n2o emissions ranged from 327 to 569 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2015 and from 311 to 640 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2016 fig 6 the ci and mulching treatments tended to decrease gwp with significantly lower values observed with the sm treatment in 2015 and with the ci and fm treatments in 2016 compared with the fp treatment the gwp of the ci fm and sm treatments was decreased by 27 4 36 7 and 42 5 in 2015 and by 33 3 51 4 and 20 7 in 2016 respectively compared with the fp treatment seasonal gwp was primarily attributable to ch4 emissions in the fp treatment with an average contribution of 79 5 over the two seasons fig 6 conversely the contribution of n2o emissions to gwp was much higher than contribution of ch4 emissions with the fm and sm treatments only in 2015 the gwp with the ci treatment was almost equally attributable to the ch4 and n2o emissions and a similar result was also observed with the sm treatment in 2016 the ghgi of the fp treatment was 47 3 and 60 8 kg co2 eq mg 1 grain in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 6 the ci and mulching treatments tended to decrease ghgi with a significant difference observed between the fp and fm treatments in both seasons the ghgi values with the ci fm and sm treatments were 16 2 36 5 and 32 6 lower respectively than the values observed with the fp treatment in 2015 and 29 3 51 9 and 8 5 lower in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield rice grain yield ranged from 9 0 to 12 0 mg ha 1 in the present study table 2 which was higher than the reported yields 5 3 8 0 mg ha 1 of previous studies in the sichuan basin fan et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 probably because a high yielding hybrid rice and a higher transplanting density were adopted in this study wu et al 2010 an et al 2018 furthermore the grain yields were also much higher than the average yields 7 0 mg ha 1 observed in farmers fields chen et al 2014 and were comparable to the attainable potential yield 10 2 mg ha 1 for single rice in china an et al 2018 these results indicate that there is a substantial potential for farmers to increase rice yield by adopting precision management practices e g appropriate varieties plant densities and advanced water management rice is highly sensitive to reduction in water availability and thus water management strongly affected rice yield fig 3 which was in agreement with previous studies jiao et al 2018 reis et al 2018 rice grain yield was reduced in both seasons with the ci and sm treatments fig 3 other studies have also reported that ci and sm usually caused yield losses bouman and tuong 2001 fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 owing to negative impacts on yield components table 2 zhang et al 2008 however jiao et al 2018 reported that ci did not decrease but rather increased rice yield compared with traditional flooding probably because precipitation was high at their study site in this study precipitation was relatively low during the two growing seasons fig 1 such that the water requirement of rice plants was not met under the reduced irrigation condition these results indicate that climatic conditions are important factors that should be considered when applying new production techniques in different regions on the other hand although the sm practice could promote plant growth during the middle and late portions of the growing season by increasing soil organic carbon and nitrogen content fan et al 2005 it would not be an attractive technology for farmers because this practice restricted plant growth during the early season as indicated by the reduced tiller numbers table 2 and ultimately reduced rice yield in contrast to the ci and sm treatments the fm treatment produced similar grain yield as the fp treatment fig 3 this result was in agreement with previous studies fan et al 2005 jabran et al 2016 yao et al 2017 this finding was most likely because plastic mulching can keep soil moist by restricting percolation and evaporation reis et al 2018 while at the same time increasing soil temperature during the early growing season qu et al 2012 the more favorable moisture and temperature environment for rice growth and development resulted in no significant differences in yield components between the fm and fp treatments table 2 however zhang et al 2008 reported that rice yield was reduced under fm conditions due to decreased percentage of filled grains and grain weight this was mainly because the fm practice promoted tillering and caused heavy lodging during the late grain filling period which consequently negatively affected accumulation and translocation of photosynthate zhang et al 2008 in this study we also observed more rapid growth of rice plants during the early growing season and more tillers as indicated by the increased number of panicles in the fm treatment than in the other treatments table 2 the duration of the rice tillering phase has been reported to be affected by soil water status liang et al 2016 therefore an appropriate irrigation regime that considers soil water status is crucial in order to optimize tiller number and quality and to achieve a high yield overall these results do not support our first hypothesis and indicate that the studied water saving practices have few advantages regarding grain production to support replacement of the current widely used cultivation practice in future studies efforts should be made to develop more efficient water saving technologies by considering soil plant and climate conditions to further increase rice yield 4 2 water input and water productivity rice is the greatest consumer of freshwater among all crops because it is mostly grown under submerged conditions however studies have indicated that continuous flooding is not necessary for rice growth and yield formation miniotti et al 2016 zhuang et al 2019 in this study the irrigation water inputs in the fp treatment were 1 170 1 391 mm table 3 which were lower than the reported values around 1 300 3 750 mm for irrigated rice in asia bouman et al 2007 kreye et al 2007 this was primarily attributed to the md and awd practices adopted in this study as these practices could markedly reduce irrigation water requirement by decreasing seepage percolation and evaporation belder et al 2005 liang et al 2016 notably the irrigation water input was further reduced by 49 7 54 7 with the ci treatment and by 68 7 70 8 with the two mulching treatments compared with the fp treatment table 3 this was mainly due to decreased percolation and evaporation aziz et al 2018 because the duration of unsubmerged and unsaturated soil conditions was longer under these three treatments than under the fp treatment furthermore the two mulching practices were more effective in reducing soil evaporation by restricting water vapor exchange between the soil and air zhang et al 2008 such that the fm and sm treatments had a greater potential than the ci treatment to reduce irrigation table 3 enhancing crop water productivity is an essential requirement for producing water sustainability and food security brauman et al 2013 in this study the water productivity ranged from 5 9 to 13 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 3 which was averagely higher than the values of 3 6 12 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 reported by previous researchers liang et al 2016 aziz et al 2018 reis et al 2018 moreover the water productivity was further markedly increased under the three water saving practices and this result supports our second hypothesis regarding water use compared with the fp treatment water productivity with the fm treatment was increased by 89 1 118 3 table 3 this increase was due to the great reduction in irrigation water input table 3 as the grain yield was not significantly different between these two treatments in line with our results other studies have also reported that water productivity was remarkably increased by 52 0 102 3 with fm compared with continuous flooding liu et al 2005 tao et al 2015 similarly the ci and sm treatments increased water productivity significantly by reducing irrigation compared with the fp treatment table 3 which was similarly reported previously liu et al 2005 reis et al 2018 however these two practices caused yield reductions indicating that ci and sm probably are not advisable water management strategies for rice production in the study region these results indicate that there is still a great potential to further increase the water productivity in farmer s fields by adopting more efficient water saving practices e g fm 4 3 ghg emissions gwp and ghgi paddy fields are a major source of ch4 and mitigating ch4 emissions by optimizing management practices is a great challenge that needs to be addressed urgently for the sustainability of rice production in this study the seasonal cumulative ch4 emissions ranged from 10 13 to 11 04 kg c ha 1 for the fp treatment table 4 comparable results were reported in previous studies linquist et al 2015 gupta et al 2016 which indicated that the cumulative ch4 emissions ranged from 1 7 to 71 4 kg c ha 1 in rice fields however these results are clearly lower than the reported values 145 7 346 5 kg c ha 1 of other studies skinner et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 water management has been recognized as one of the most important factors influencing ch4 emissions from paddy fields kudo et al 2014 liang et al 2016 and this was also observed in our study where 88 3 of the variation in cumulative ch4 emissions was explained by the irrigation amount fig 5 there are five likely reasons for the relatively low ch4 emissions in this study first the md and awd practices used in the fp treatment prolonged the duration of aerobic conditions in the soil which inhibited ch4 production but stimulated ch4 oxidation linquist et al 2015 second the flooding period after transplanting was approximately 20 days in this study shorter than the expected time about 30 60 days required for ch4 emissions to reach peak values zhou et al 2015 sun et al 2016 third the water depth during the flooding period was 2 3 cm in this study which was much shallower than the depth 8 cm in the study of zhou et al 2015 the ch4 flux rate has been shown to be positively correlated with water depth meijide et al 2017 fourth the soil cracked during the md period and this caused rapid infiltration of irrigation water therefore the ch4 emissions remained at relatively low levels during the awd period fig 4 fifth the low precipitation during the growing seasons probably restricted ch4 production in agreement zhang et al 2018 reported that the higher the precipitation the greater the ch4 emissions observed water saving technologies produced a significant impact on ch4 emissions and the treatments with reduced irrigation significantly decreased the cumulative ch4 emissions compared with the fp treatment table 4 this result agreed with previous studies kreye et al 2007 hou et al 2012 yao et al 2017 the large decrease in ch4 emissions was mainly due to the markedly reduced irrigation amounts for the ci and mulching treatments table 3 which created aerobic environments and prevented the development of anaerobic conditions in the soil hou et al 2012 yao et al 2017 as a result these three treatments inhibited ch4 production by methanogens and stimulated ch4 oxidation by methanotrophs conrad 2007 the cumulative ch4 emissions were further reduced in the fm treatment in both seasons and in the sm treatment in 2015 compared with the ci treatment table 4 most likely because the mulching treatments further decreased irrigation amounts in a recent study zhang et al 2018 reported that ch4 emissions from a field with plastic mulching were similar to those of a rain fed rice field these results indicate that mulching has a greater potential for mitigating ch4 emissions than use of ci however for the sm treatment the cumulative ch4 emission value in 2016 was 6 6 times higher than observed in 2015 table 4 the activity of methanogens is related to the availability of organic matter peyron et al 2016 in the sm treatment the undecomposed wheat straw residues during the 2015 rice season were plowed into the soil which probably provided additional carbon substrates for ch4 production and consequently high diurnal emissions were observed during the flooding period in 2016 fig 4 other studies also reported that straw incorporation into paddy fields dramatically increased ch4 emissions ma et al 2009 peyron et al 2016 therefore apart from adopting water saving technologies reducing carbon input by optimizing residue management may be another promising option to mitigate ch4 emissions in rice production in this study the rice fields acted as an n2o source irrespective of irrigation amount and mulching method table 4 this was consistent with previous studies zou et al 2007 skinner et al 2014 which demonstrated that the seasonal n2o emissions ranged from 0 14 to 6 17 kg n ha 1 from paddy fields however it should be noted that water management plays an important role in regulating n2o emissions cumulative n2o emissions were increased in the three water saving treatments compared with the fp treatment especially for the two mulching treatments table 4 similar results were reported by other studies kreye et al 2007 hou et al 2012 the increase in n2o emissions under water saving practices was primarily attributed to the aerobic and moist soil conditions that resulted from reduced irrigation which allowed nitrification and denitrification processes to produce n2o peyron et al 2016 thus high diurnal n2o emissions were observed in the fm and sm treatments after the initial flooding period fig 4 the basal n fertilization also contributed to the increased n2o emissions during that period zhou et al 2015 surprisingly only a small pulse of n2o emissions was detected with the ci treatment and negative values were even observed with certain treatments during the initial flooding and middle growing seasons this phenomenon was also reported by other studies meijide et al 2017 chen et al 2018 and it was probably because the anaerobic conditions resulting from irrigation or mulching and high temperature facilitated the denitrification process thereby n2o was further reduced to n2 butterbach bahl et al 2013 in the fp treatment gwp was dominated by ch4 emissions fig 6 and this result was in agreement with previous studies linquist et al 2015 gupta et al 2016 due to the lower ch4 emissions table 4 gwp tended to decrease in the ci and mulching treatments fig 6 similarly studies have reported that gwp decreased by 27 3 in the ci treatment hou et al 2012 and by 63 3 in the fm treatment yao et al 2017 compared with a traditional irrigation production practice moreover the decrease in gwp could be greater under water saving practices when considering electricity generation for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 these results confirmed our second hypothesis and demonstrated that the cultivation practice currently used by farmers can be further optimized by integrating mulching or reducing irrigation to further decrease ghg emissions notably for the ci and mulching treatments the gwp was decreased by 20 7 51 4 compared with the fp treatment fig 6 which was lower than the corresponding decrease 50 7 95 0 in cumulative ch4 emissions table 4 this result was primarily because the decrease in ch4 emissions was partially offset by an increase in n2o emissions in these treatments in some cases gwp was even higher in the fields with non flooded mulching or reduced irrigation than gwp in the traditional lowland rice fields due to the great increase in n2o emissions kreye et al 2007 sun et al 2016 therefore reducing n2o emissions by optimizing nitrogen management e g split application deep placement as well as use of controlled release fertilizer nitrification and urease inhibitors is crucial to further decrease the gwp for rice grown under water saving conditions xia et al 2017 changes in climate and increases in food demand will require management practices that can minimize negative environmental effects while maximizing crop productivity chen et al 2014 the ghgi is an indicator that integrates the impacts of management practices on ghg emissions and crop yield thus ghgi can better express the ghg efficiency of a cropping system and can be used to improve cropping technique selection and innovation van groenigen et al 2010 feng et al 2013 in this study the ghgi for the fp treatment ranged from 47 3 to 60 8 kg co2 eq mg 1 fig 6 which was within the low range of reported values 14 2 122 kg co2 eq mg 1 for rice linquist et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 most likely because of the relatively high grain yield and low ch4 emissions observed in this study the fm treatment significantly reduced ghgi by 36 5 51 9 compared with the fp treatment fig 6 owing to the lower gwp a similar result has been reported by other researchers yao et al 2014 2017 who indicated that the ghgi was significantly lower by 50 3 67 0 in plastic mulching fields than in conventional paddy fields although the ci and sm treatments tended to decrease gwp they also caused yield losses and ultimately the ghgi of these two treatments showed no significant difference compared with the fp treatment fig 6 these results confirmed our third hypothesis and suggested that the fm practice is superior to the current fp practice and is a preferable management option for rice production and ghg mitigation 5 conclusions the water saving practices investigated in this study produced significant effects on water productivity and ghg emissions compared with the fp treatment the ci fm and sm treatments significantly increased water productivity by reducing irrigation amounts furthermore the gwp tended to decrease in the ci and two mulching treatments because the reduction in ch4 emissions was greater than the increase in n2o emissions with these treatments however the three water saving practices showed different effects on grain yield with fm producing a similar grain yield to that observed with fp in contrast to ci and sm that both caused yield reductions as a result the ghgi was significantly decreased with the fm treatment but the ci and sm treatments showed no significant effect on ghgi compared with the fp treatment these findings contribute to our understanding of the various effects of different water management practices on rice yield water productivity and ghg mitigation considering the future potential water crisis fm is

10248,soil aeration is considered the third most important factor affecting soil fertility after water and nutrient availability the main reasons for poor soil aeration are slow drainage excessive precipitation or irrigation or a sealing soil cover shallow groundwater impedes drainage by reducing the downwardly hydraulic gradient which consequently increases the water content of the soil in the root zone thus limiting soil aeration in this study we examined the effects of different parameters e g soil texture depth of groundwater table on the severity of oxygen deficiency in the root zone of a mature valencia orange citrus sinensis grove planted above shallow groundwater in addition we examined the effect of the o2 stress level on tree growth yield and fruit quality we also evaluated the effects of air injection and of irrigation intensity on tree growth yield fruit quality and o2 concentration in the soil s air and looked into the technical and economic feasibility of air injection into the soil we found that insufficient soil aeration significantly inhibited tree growth and reduced the yield the soil texture i e clay content had a substantial effect on the yield mainly because of its effect on the soil s water retention while soil o2 concentration slightly increased by air injection the differences in tree growth yield and fruit quality parameters were not significant the o2 concentration of the soil air alone was found to be a poor quantifier of soil aeration status the damkholer number da evaluated from the measured soil o2 profiles and groundwater table depths is a superior quantifier for the prevailing aeration status it can also be used for analyzing the effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration status and respiration rates abbreviations 1d one

used for irrigation mainly because of the increased irrigation doses used to ensure leaching of salts friedman and naftaliev 2012 assouline and narkis 2011 2013 moreover o2 deficiency reduces roots

ben noah and friedman 2018 elevated temperatures may also increase soil respiration and induce oxygen deficiencies asplund and curtis 2001 ityel et al 2014 1 1 effect of oxygen deficiency on plants the subject of soil aeration and the harmful effects of complete anoxia and partial hypoxia lack of o2 and its duration on plant physiology have been discussed in glinski and stepniewski 1985 book and in a number of valuable review articles russell 1952 grable 1966 black 1968 smith 1977 stolzy et al 1981 drew 1992 amthor 2000 bhattarai et al 2005 ben noah and friedman 2018 o2 concentration and supply rates in the root zone affect root respiration root elongation nutrient absorption and transpiration or et al 2007 in addition previous studies have revealed the harmful effect of o2 shortage on root resistance to diseases armstrong 1980 bhattarai et al 2006 areal demand of o2 in orchards is usually about 10 15 g o2 m 2 d 1 friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 several modeling sierra et al 1995 cook and knight 2003 bartholomeus et al 2008 cook et al 2013 ben noah and friedman 2018 and experimental berry and norris 1949 lambers 1976 saglio et al 1983 asplund and curtis 2001 naasz et al 2008 simojoki 2000 yalin et al 2017 efforts have been made to define a representative critical o2 concentration for adequate root respiration however such a unique critical value of o2 concentration or for another single factor does not exist as this suggests that the effects of all other factors are negligible or correlated to this critical value 1 2 soil properties affecting soil aeration volumetric water content θ complementary to the air content θa is the single most important factor affecting soil aeration the o2 storage in partially saturated soils is in the gaseous phase because water at best in equilibrium with atmospheric o2 concentration at 25 c contains 8 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen furthermore o2 diffusion is strongly inhibited by elevated water contents because of the dual effect of the 104 fold smaller o2 diffusion coefficient in free water as compared to free air and its effect on the tortuosity of the soil air pathways smith 1977 1 3 oxygen diffusion and the da number diffusion of o2 from the atmosphere into the soil profile is usually the main natural soil aeration process ben noah et al 2020b ben noah and friedman 2018 bouyoucos and mccool 1924 buckingham 1904 the diffusion flux j m l 2 t 1 is according to fick s law 1 j d s c where d s l2 t 1 is the soil effective diffusion coefficient c m l 3 is the o2 concentration defined here in units of o2 mass per volume of soil air and is the gradient operator if we consider steady one dimensional 1d vertical o2 diffusion from the atmosphere of constant o2 concentration c atm m l 3 into soil with an impermeable surface where the o2 flux is zero e g a shallow water table at depth of z l a constant d s and zero order o2 consumption rate λ0 m l 3 t 1 then the o2 concentration profile is given by ben noah and friedman 2018 2 c z c atm λ 0 z z d s λ 0 z 2 2 d s 0 z z where z l is the vertical axis positive downwardly its origin at the soil surface the damkohler number da is defined as the ratio between the characteristic diffusion z 2 2d s and respiration c atm λ0 times i e λ0z 2 2d s c atm introducing da to eq 2 results in 3 c c atm 1 2 d a z z d a z z 2 0 z z this means that under the simplifying assumptions outlined above the o2 profile in the soil is governed solely by da and the vertical o2 flux is according to fick s law 4 j λ 0 z z 0 z z the assumption of steady o2 diffusion is justified by the low diurnal amplitude of o2 concentration the 1d vertical diffusion assumption and the uniform o2 consumption rates are reasonable in drip irrigated orchards in the region below and near the emitters and in the region far from the emitters where the water content gradients and differences in root density and microbial activity are relatively small friedman and naftaliev 2012 using zero order consumption rate λ0 to describe soil respiration i e assuming that the respiration rate is not affected by the o2 concentration is common cook and knight 2003 ben noah and friedman 2018 and implemented also in this paper this assumption can be justified by the minimum o2 concentration much smaller for microbes than for plant roots for which o2 consumption rate starts to decline gliński and stepniewski 1985 assuming an impermeable surface where shallow water table prevails is justified because respiration rates in groundwater are small and limited by the low o2 solubility and o2 diffusivity in water saturated soils 1 4 methods for improving soil aeration o2 availability is considered the third most important growth parameter after water and nutrient availability gliński and stepniewski 1985 tillage is the only commonly used agricultural practice for improving soil aeration despite its harmful effect on soil structure and organic matter content stepniewski and stepniewska 2008 o2 deficiencies are usually avoided by choosing a crop compatible with soil aeration capability or through manipulation of the irrigation dosage frequency and application mode thus developing an efficient and simple method for soil aeration could increase the variety of permissible crops in fine texture soils and also increase the yields of currently grown crops by increasing the water availability without causing o2 stress ben noah and friedman 2016a air injection was found fairly effective in aerating the soil ben noah et al 2020a 2020b ben noah and friedman 2016a increasing yield and improving fruit quality in a wide range of crops bhattarai et al 2006 nascimento et al 2020 li et al 2016a 2016c enhancing plant growth xiao et al 2015 li et al 2016b vyrlas et al 2014 and also improving water use efficiency abuarab et al 2013 2017 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2020 and nitrogen uptake du et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the main advantage of the air injection method is the availability of air and the ability to deliver large amounts of oxygen compared to other aeration methods such as adding hydrogen peroxide melsted et al 1949 ben noah and friedman 2016b or air bubbles bhattarai et al 2004 2006 goorahoo et al 2002 oo et al 2018 yan et al 2019 to irrigation water in which case the supplied o2 is limited by the irrigation dose low o2 solubility and peroxide s harmful reactivity 1 5 factors for consideration regarding air injection in principle air injection introduces atmospheric air containing about 250 mg l 1 of o2 21 and practically zero co2 to the soil causing exhausted air with elevated concentrations of co2 and low o2 to exile the main challenge associated with the air injection method is to effectively distribute the o2 in the root zone where most of the injected air will flow in a few finger like channels from the air source to the atmosphere especially in structured clayey or wet soils elder and benson 1999 also movement of soil particles caused by momentum transfer between the flowing air and the soil particles kong et al 2009 holtzman et al 2012 varas et al 2013 and the shrinkage of drying soil aggregates at the moving air front extends the preferential pathways thereby enhancing the discrete rather than continuous nature of the flow pattern in addition to gas exchange air injection may have a hydraulic effect on the water distribution ben noah et al 2020b ben noah and friedman 2019 the effect of air injection on water distribution mainly pushing the water upwardly depends on the depth of the air injection source in respect to the water source and the root zone the air and water discharge rates and the soil s permeability to air and water in this study we evaluate the effect of different factors on the degree of o2 deficiency and its effect on orange tree valencia citrus sinensis growth yield and fruit quality furthermore we present the results of a field scale experiment testing the effects of air injection and irrigation intensity in a mature orchard subjected to prolonged o2 deficiency stress next we re analyze some of the data presented in friedman and naftaliev

samples of each treatment repetition total of 32 samples using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 it showed substantial variability with sand content ranging between 57 and 90 and clay content

2 1 weight ratio distilled water to oven dried soil samples shaking the tubes for 24 h and extracting the supernatant after centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min the in situ soil solution in the field was evaluated by multiplying the ec of the analyzed supernatant by the dilution factor 2 θg ec measurements of soil solution and groundwater samples were made with a portable ec meter ott hydromet kl0110 kempten germany o2 concentration was measured using a portable galvanic sensor mo 200 apogee logan ut by extracting soil air samples with a 200 ml plastic syringe from 100 ml perforated plastic bottles buried at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface and at a lateral distance of 20 cm from the drippers and about 0 5 m from the line of tree trunks the measuring frequency was approximately once a month fig 5 daily courses of o2 concentrations were occasionally measured by placing the galvanic o2 sensor possessing an internal data logger in a 2 inch 5 08 cm diameter pvc pipe perforated at a depth of 40 cm below the soil surface water table levels were measured approximately every two months in eleven 2 inch diameter monitoring wells piezometers with a level meter ott kl010 kempten germany the wells were installed without a well skin to a depth of about 1 m below the water table using a 2 inch hand auger 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the jmp pro statistical software version 2 0 1 sas institute inc usa in this work we used different models for the different experiments where the two northern and southern orchard plots were set as treatments for the first experiment of pre air injection irrigation in the air injection irrigation experiment we used two different models a each row at each plot was set as a block with an uneven number of repetitions see fig 1 and b the two plots were analyzed separately while in each of the plots the row number was set as a block with an even number of repetitions the repeated measurement analysis of the o2 conc was made under the univariate assumption this assumption could not be tested via the sphericity test because of the large number of missing samples in the southern plot caused by the high groundwater levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre air injection comparison between two plots of different degree of hypoxia the upper rows no 7 and 8 in the two plots are nearly the same topographical height altitude and of similar water table depths fig 3d yet the difference in the size and volume of the tree canopies was notable fig 1 the different degrees of o2 deficiency between plots were mainly the result of different soil texture namely different clay content fig 3b the different degrees of hypoxia significantly affected yields the average yield in the 2018 fruit picking before the start of air injection and added irrigation treatments of the southern plot severe hypoxia was 33 5 kg tree compared to 58 6 kg tree 75 in the northern plot minor hypoxia table 1 also a lower mean single fruit weight was found in the severe hypoxia plot in the pre treatment picking 2018 however the fruit weight of the northern and southern plots was identical in both the 2019 and 2020 pickings in addition to the yield and fruit load differences in fruit quality parameters were also observed in the 2018 picking with higher sugar acid and chloride contents in the southern plot juice percentage was similar in both plots as was the sugar acid ratio table 1 fruit yield in both plots decreased with clay content and with water content at 40 cm and increased with trunk perimeter fig 4 the apparently positive correlation between yield and groundwater ec fig 3e and soil solution ec figs 4e and 3g may be explained by the higher transpiration rates of the larger trees salinizing the soil solution and yielding more fruits this positive correlation also suggests that salinity is not the main stress factor affecting the trees and that the effect of o2 deficiency or maybe its interaction with salinity is probably stronger the correlation between yield and the depth of the groundwater table figs 4d and 3d also supports the hypothesis that inadequate o2 availability is the main stress factor in this orchard a shallow water table reduces o2 supply by increasing the water content of the soil fig 3f which negatively affects as mentioned above both o2 storage and flux in addition the shallow water table reduces the soil s o2 consumption rate as there is less respiring soil volume per unit area measurements of tree trunk perimeters are a bit problematic as the trunks are not strictly cylindrical the arbitrary height of 10 cm above grafting may sometimes represent a narrow and sometimes a thick section of the trunk causing large variability despite this limitation the measured trunk perimeter in the severe hypoxia plot south was about 6 5 cm shorter 14 compared to the minor hypoxia plot table 1 and the correlation between yield and trunk perimeter was very strong fig 4a o2 concentrations at depths of 20 cm below the soil surface in the southern plot were found to be significantly lower than in the northern plot at the pre air injection measurements fig 5b however at depths of 40 and 60 cm the soil air o2 concentration was not significantly different between the two plots and similar at 60 cm depth this may be explained by the lower respiration of the smaller stressed trees with smaller root systems this explanation is supported by the soil wetting conditions in the southern plot of which the soil depth of 60 cm and sometimes also 40 cm is during most of the year below the water table or in the capillary fringe zone where water saturation also prevails using o2 concentration in the gaseous phase as a quantifier for an adequate supply of o2 to plant roots is common mainly because it is easy to measure also if assuming the roots are an ideal sink zero o2 concentration at their surface then the o2 concentration in the bulk soil air is a good measure of the gradient of o2 concentration towards the respiring root which is according to fick s law the driving force for o2 diffusion however the o2 concentration gradient is merely half of the picture as the o2 flux also depends on the soil s effective diffusion coefficient buckingham 1904 therefore the difference between the o2 fluxes towards the roots in the two plots with similar o2 concentration in the gaseous phase is proportional to the difference between the diffusion coefficients of the finer wetter and coarser dryer soils using the da number as a soil aeration status indicator may be superior as it weighs both the o2 supply and respiration rates a small da number suggests low o2 consumption compared to its supply as expected the growth rate of the tree perimeters declines with increased da in the southern plot which is subjected to extreme hypoxia while in the northern plot the da does not correlate with tree growth fig 5a da had a similar effect on the 2019 yield but with a higher p of 0 055 not presented on the other hand low respiration rate of impaired trees reduces the da number making the da a state variable of the prevailing conditions but not an indicator of the optimal aeration state this limitation is similar to that of o2 concentration in the soil gas for this reason an areal respiration rate criterion for different crops and climate should be a more general quantifier of o2 stress fig 5 b presents the mean o2 concentrations measured in the northern and southern plots averaged spatially over the 16 repetitions in each plot and temporally over 23 measurements in the period of december 28 2018 to april 23 2020 it is clearly observed that while in the northern plot the o2 concentration decreases gradually downwardly in the southern plot the concentrations measured at 20 cm depth are substantially lower than atmospheric but the concentrations at depths of 40 and 60 cm are similar to those at a depth of 20 cm indicating that not much respiration occurs in these depths it should be noted that these two mean concentrations are based on much fewer measurements when the water table was relatively deep and soil air could be sampled by vacuum extraction form the perforated plastic bottles the average depths of the water table of 7 measurement times in the period of august 20 2019 to april 4 2020 in the northern and southern plots were 75 4 and 46 1 cm respectively and if assuming air entry values h cr of 15 cm for the northern plot s soil and 20 cm for the more clayey soil of the southern plot this means that the mean depths of the water saturation surfaces were 60 4 cm in the northern plot and 26 1 in the southern plot the sketched horizontal lines in fig 5b the solution for steady 1d diffusion with zero order respiration in between the soil surface and an impermeable to o2 diffusion layer at z z eq 3 was fitted to the measured mean o2 concentrations in the 0 60 4 cm and 0 26 1 cm unsaturated zones of the soil profiles in the northern and southern plots and the resulted damkohler numbers da λ0 z 2 2d s c atm are 0 147 and 0 177 respectively the effective o2 diffusion coefficient in the soil d s can be approximately evaluated by assuming a hydrostatic water content distribution above the water table if evaluating the mean soil porosities of the two plots by correlating the porosity of the thirty two 40 cm depth samples to their clay and sand percentages according to n 0 332 7 251 10 4 sand 0 1276 log10 clay saxton et al 1986 and if assuming zero residual water contents for both soils a water retention function θw h of θw nexp 2h cr 1 h h cr where h l is the matric head ben noah et al 2020b and d s θa function of d s d 0 n 1 5 θa n 2 5 θa n θw d 0 0 2 cm2 s 1 is the o2 diffusivity in free air friedman and mualem 1994 the resulting arithmetic mean d s in the respiring soil profiles of the northern and southern plots are 0 0150 and 0 0033 cm2 s 1 respectively with an atmospheric o2 concentration of c atm 2 50 10 4 g o2 cm 3 depths of impermeable layers z of 60 4 and 26 1 cm and fitted da numbers of 0 147 and 0 177 the volumetric respiration rates λ0 in the northern and southern plots are 3 01 10 10 and 4 29 10 10 g o2 cm 3 s 1 respectively the areal respiration rates λ0 z are respectively 1 82 10 8 and 1 12 10 8 go2 cm 2 s 1 or 15 7 and 9 7 go2 m 2 d 1 within the range of those characteristics of irrigated orchards averaging at 10 15 g o2 m 2 d 1 friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 it would not be very advantageous to carry out still more tedious measurements and calculations with greater accuracy in order to test the correctness of the sensible conclusions that the mean volumetric respiration rate of the southern plot is about 40 higher than in the northern one and that the areal i e the overall respiration rate in the southern plot with the smaller trees is 40 lower compared to that of the northern plot the reduced overall respiration rates λ0 z in the southern plot stem from both high water contents and a poorly developed root system within the restricted unsaturated sections of the soil profile fig 5b which in a mature orchard transplanted in 2004 probably means irreversible damage 3 2 effect of air injection on tree growth fruit yield and fruit quality trunk perimeter growth was not affected by the irrigation and or aeration treatments table 2 however during the experiments the diameter of the trees in the northern plot increased more than that of the southern plot another indication of the on going hypoxic stress in the southern plot air injection started at the end of december 2018 between irrigation seasons on april 7th 2019 one month before the start of the 2019 irrigation season fruits were harvested and weighed despite the short period of aeration until picking 4 5 months and the fact that by the start of the soil aeration both flowering and fruit setting were completed it was found that air injection increased yield by 24 p 0 092 in the 2019 picking compared to the 2018 picking while the yield in the 2019 picking under soil aeration a increased by 1 01 kg per tree the yield in the non aerated treatments a decreased by 10 61 kg per tree this finding is even more surprising as the single fruit weight was not affected at all by the aeration treatment table 2 shedding of immature fruits seems unlikely to explain the measured difference since we did not notice a large number of fallen fruit under the canopies of the non aerated trees leaving us without a reasonable explanation for these findings two way analysis of aeration treatment and plot side hypoxia severity did not show a significant interaction not presented in the 2019 picking by itself i e not compared to the 2018 picking the least square mean yield accounting for the effect of the blocks i e rows and of the southern and northern plots of the aeration treatments was 21 higher 46 28 compared to 38 22 kg per tree but it was not statistically significant p 0 1422 due to the large variance between trees in the orchard the yield in the april 2020 picking fig 6 was affected neither by the aeration and increased irrigation treatments nor by their interaction 2 way anova analysis not presented even when compared to the 2019 picking to exclude the permanent spatial variance the treatments did not affect yield or fruit weight table 2 also fruit quality parameters and trunk perimeter growth were not affected by the treatments table 2 the yield of the aeration treatments in the southern plot severe hypoxia was lower than the yield of the control w a in the northern plot mild hypoxia as expected this suggests that most of the o2 stress damage is indeed irreversible the general all treatments yield in the northern plot was 49 higher in 2020 as compared to the 2019 picking least square means of 62 25 and 90 94 in 2019 and 2020 in accordance while in the southern severe hypoxia plot the yield decreased by almost 25 from 30 94 to 23 25 the change of the trend in the yield in the northern plot from a decrease between 2018 and 2019 to an increase between 2019 and 2020 pickings may be explained by biennial intermittence while in the southern plot the effect of intermittence is masked by the damage caused by o2 stress 3 3 effect of air injection and irrigation intensity on soil o2 concentration soil air o2 concentrations along the growing season were slightly higher in the aerated treatment with normal irrigation a w than in the no aeration with increased irrigation a w fig 7 significant only at depth of 60 cm using multivariate anova while assuming univariate of the repeated measurements with time this is probably because the measured absolute o2 concentrations were quite high an overall mean of 18 bounded by the atmospheric o2 concentration 21 which limits the potential of active aeration at the beginning of the irrigation seasons blue arrows in fig 7a c a drop in the o2 concentration was observed in all treatments more steeply in the non aerated treatments a the measured daily amplitude of the soil o2 concentration was very small 2 3 in both winter and summer with no significant difference between aerated and non aerated treatments not presented this finding supports the assumption of steady state diffusion from the atmosphere implemented in the model outlined in eq 3 it may be explained by low respiration of the impaired trees and by the limiting factor for respiration not being the o2 concentration of the soil air but rather the o2 diffusivity the average over time o2 concentration profiles in the northern plots show steeper drops in the non aeration treatments more so in the increased irrigation w a than in the control w a treatments fig 8 overall on average air injection increased o2 concentrations in all depths especially at 40 and 60 cm and high irrigation intensity slightly decreased the o2 concentrations at these depths in the southern plot the o2 profiles below the 20 cm depth were irregular probably because of the higher water contents and the fact that the 40 cm and 60 cm depths were submerged in the capillary fringe zone or even below the water table for substantial periods during the growing seasons fig 8 to illustrate in this experiment during most of the season we could not extract an air sample from the perforated bottles buried at a depth of 60 cm during part of the irrigation season we could not even draw air from the 40 cm bottles in the southern plot on account of the soil being water saturated at these depths water was extracted rather than air yet when we did succeed in extracting air samples their o2 concentrations were usually above 15 despite the relatively high o2 concentrations fig 8 the reduced yield and tree growth in the southern plot suggest that o2 stress still prevails as discussed above this means that o2 concentration in the soil air alone is not a good quantifier for soil aeration status we postulate that the da number or the bulk o2 concentration in the soil the product of the air content and the soil air o2 concentration are superior quantifiers friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 3 4 effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration status and respiration rates as written in the material and methods section the experiment in the valencia orange grove described here used treated waste water of relatively good quality to extend the discussion on factors affecting soil aeration to other trees soil textures and irrigation water qualities we re analyzed measurements of soil oxygen concentration profiles carried out on september 8 and 11 2008 in fifteen orchards of pomelo mandarin apple pear peach almond pomegranate persimmon avocado and grapevine the orchards were planted in a variety of soil types with clay percentage at a depth of 30 cm ranging from 25 to 76 and esp exchangeable sodium percentage ranging from 0 8 to 5 8 the orchards were irrigated with either fresh water fw from the israeli national carrier or local wells or with treated waste water tww from either local reservoirs or regional waste water treatments plants friedman and naftaliev 2012 as in sub chapter 3 1 eq 3 with its single da λ0 z 2 2d s c atm parameter was fitted to the measured concentration profiles two repetitions of measurements at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm in each orchard assuming zero oxygen flux at 60 cm z 60 cm measuring gravimetric water contents at a depth of 30 cm at the same time as o2 concentration measurements and correlating the porosity to the clay and sand percentage again according to n 0 332 7 251 10 4 sand 0 1276 log10 clay served to evaluate the uniform assumed effective o2 diffusivity with d s d 0 n 1 5 θa n 2 5 the fifteen orchards are of different tree types and are located in regions of different summer potential evaporation and winter rainfalls and thus are irrigated at different intensities yet the tww irrigated orchards are irrigated with higher irrigation doses probably for providing sufficient salt leaching which results in wetter soil profiles means of θg of 0 396 for tww and 0 233 for fw in the 30 cm depth samples and consequently their o2 concentration profiles are described by higher da numbers a mean of 0 206 as compared to 0 074 for the fw irrigated orchards fig 9 yet the trends of the da θg relationships of the fw and tww irrigated orchards seem quite similar which perhaps indicates that the effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration is not related directly to the water s o2 demand bod cod but probably to the tww s indirect effect on increasing the soil water content and reducing its effective o2 diffusivity the effect of the tww in increasing the soil water content is two fold through larger irrigation doses for salt leaching and the detrimental effect of sodium to decrease the soil s hydraulic conductivity high sar irrigation water generating soils of high esp also reduces the effective o2 diffusivities proportional y ax with zero intercept trend lines were fitted to the da θg data as in totally dry soil θg 0 ds is maximal and respiration is not feasible λ0 0 fig 9a applying the estimated effective o2 diffusivities allows evaluation of the volumetric respiration rates λ0 from the fitted da numbers as in section 3 1 and the areal respiration rates λ0z optimum λ0z θg relationships were fitted to the data of the fifteen orchards as root and soil respiration rates are expected to be low in both extrema of very dry and very wet soils fig 9b as for the similar da θg trends found for tww and fw and although the tww irrigated orchards were characterized with higher water contents fig 9 and with lower areal respiration rates means of λ0z of 2 26 g o2 m 2 d 1 for tww and of 4 11 g o2 m 2 d 1 for fw the effect of the soil water content on the areal respiration rates λ0z θg seemed independent of irrigation water quality the esp of the tww irrigated soils was of course higher compared to those irrigated with fresh water means of 3 06 for tww and 1 5 for fw but the trend in the effect of the soil s esp on the fitted da number da esp is similar for tww and fw fig 10 3 5 economic evaluation of the applicability of an air injection system costs of an air injection system can be divided into three main categories 1 equipment 2 installation and 3 operation and maintenance o m summarized in table 3 equipment costs of the aeration system are relatively low where the dripline especially if one uses pressure compensated and densely spaced drippers stands for most of the equipment costs for 4 5 m spaces between tree rows like in this orchard a length of 2222 m of dripline is required per 1 ha amounting to a cost of about 1200 per ha assuming dripline cost of about 0 54 m 1 the blower used becker dt4 10 germany is capable of discharging 25 m3 h 1 of air with a working pressure of 1 8 bar absolute enough for the drippers to be regulated this discharge rate can be used to provide the entire o2 demand of 1 5 ha accounting for atmospheric o2 concentration of 250 g m 3 and a respiration rate of 10 g o2 m 2 d 1 assuming blower cost of about 3000 this amounts to 2000 ha 1 if operating the blower continuously other equipment such as electric valves and an irrigation computer may sum up to 100 per ha for small plots costs declines as the aeration area increases for the cost estimation below table 3 we assume a ten year life span for the equipment i e that the entire equipment should be replaced once every 10 years installation costs may vary significantly depending on the available infrastructure and state of the orchard in our experiment we were able to locate a nearby electricity source otherwise a generator or electricity line would have been allocated with significant cost implications installation of the air injection driplines before transplanting the trees or in a young grove can be facilitated by using a trencher for this experiment in a mature orchard 2004 transplantation we used an electric rotary hammer to install the aeration tubes this practice was used to prevent the biased effect of the trencher on soil aeration in the reported experiment but it is not a recommended agrotechnological practice as it consumes too much time to illustrate it took us about 100 working hours to drill and install the a treatment area of 0 108 ha 480 air tubes a trencher can probably reduce this installation time and cost by at least an order of magnitude so if we assume a working force cost of 10 per hour installation with a trencher costs is estimated to be less than 1000 ha 1 operation and maintenance costs can be divided into electricity consumables and labor the electricity price of the 0 75 kw blower working 24 7 and aerating 1 ha is about 657 ha 1 y 1 assuming electricity price of 0 1 per kwh consumables and labor costs were mainly the replacement of aeration tubes and drippers damaged by wild animals mostly jackals a monthly visit of about an hour was needed 1 h for a 0 108 ha area which means according to the labor costs mentioned above an annual maintenance labor cost of about 1100 ha 1 which is probably the greatest cost component in summary based on the calculations above air injection system costs are approximately 2000 ha 1 for installation and infrastructure and about 2200 ha 1 yr 1 for equipment and operation for valencia oranges at a price of 0 4 kg 1 and an increase of 6 5 ton ha 1 about 8 7 of the yield in the northern plot is needed to return the investment after 5 years this 8 7 difference in yield is well within the reported impairment in this and in other studies of o2 stress 4 conclusions oxygen deficiencies impair trees growth and productivity the severity of the hypoxia in an orchard located above a shallow water table was found to be correlated with the clay content of the soil this is because of the higher water contents caused by higher water retention and by a shallower water table the o2 concentration of the soil s air alone was not a good quantifier of the degree of o2 deficiency the damkholer number da i e the ratio between characteristic diffusion and respiration times evaluated from the measured o2 concentration profiles with depth and the groundwater table depths is a superior quantifier of aeration status the effect of irrigation water quality on the soil aeration status is probably not related directly to the water s o2 demand but rather to the tww s indirect effect on increasing the soil water contents and reducing its effective o2 diffusivities using air injection without increasing irrigation intensity slightly increased the soil s air o2 concentrations but did not affect tree growth trunk perimeter or yield indicating that the hypoxia impairment was mostly irreversible in the experimented orchard or more pessimistically that air injection is ineffective for aeration of wet soils when if effective air injection is an economically feasible method which can potentially be used to alleviate o2 deficiency stress however its efficiency in cases where shallow groundwater prevails is ambiguous declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10248,soil aeration is considered the third most important factor affecting soil fertility after water and nutrient availability the main reasons for poor soil aeration are slow drainage excessive precipitation or irrigation or a sealing soil cover shallow groundwater impedes drainage by reducing the downwardly hydraulic gradient which consequently increases the water content of the soil in the root zone thus limiting soil aeration in this study we examined the effects of different parameters e g soil texture depth of groundwater table on the severity of oxygen deficiency in the root zone of a mature valencia orange citrus sinensis grove planted above shallow groundwater in addition we examined the effect of the o2 stress level on tree growth yield and fruit quality we also evaluated the effects of air injection and of irrigation intensity on tree growth yield fruit quality and o2 concentration in the soil s air and looked into the technical and economic feasibility of air injection into the soil we found that insufficient soil aeration significantly inhibited tree growth and reduced the yield the soil texture i e clay content had a substantial effect on the yield mainly because of its effect on the soil s water retention while soil o2 concentration slightly increased by air injection the differences in tree growth yield and fruit quality parameters were not significant the o2 concentration of the soil air alone was found to be a poor quantifier of soil aeration status the damkholer number da evaluated from the measured soil o2 profiles and groundwater table depths is a superior quantifier for the prevailing aeration status it can also be used for analyzing the effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration status and respiration rates abbreviations 1d one

used for irrigation mainly because of the increased irrigation doses used to ensure leaching of salts friedman and naftaliev 2012 assouline and narkis 2011 2013 moreover o2 deficiency reduces roots membrane exclusion capabilities drew et al 1988 and thus may intensify plant sensitivity to salinity stress furthermore a high sodium adsorption ratio sar na to ca2 ratio which is common in tww and in tww irrigated soils degrades soil structure assouline and narkis 2011 2013 which in turn reduces soil gas diffusivity by increasing its water content poor drainage and reducing its pore connectivity ben noah and friedman 2018 elevated temperatures may also increase soil respiration and induce oxygen deficiencies asplund and curtis 2001 ityel et al 2014 1 1 effect of oxygen deficiency on plants the subject of soil aeration and the harmful effects of complete anoxia and partial hypoxia lack of o2 and its duration on plant physiology have been discussed in glinski and stepniewski 1985 book and in a number of valuable review articles russell 1952 grable 1966 black 1968 smith 1977 stolzy et al 1981 drew 1992 amthor 2000 bhattarai et al 2005 ben noah and friedman 2018 o2 concentration and supply rates in the root zone affect root respiration root elongation nutrient absorption and transpiration or et al 2007 in addition previous studies have revealed the harmful effect of o2 shortage on root resistance to diseases armstrong 1980 bhattarai et al 2006 areal demand of o2 in orchards is usually about 10 15 g o2 m 2 d 1 friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 several modeling sierra et al 1995 cook and knight 2003 bartholomeus et al 2008 cook et al 2013 ben noah and friedman 2018 and experimental berry and norris 1949 lambers 1976 saglio et al 1983 asplund and curtis 2001 naasz et al 2008 simojoki 2000 yalin et al 2017 efforts have been made to define a representative critical o2 concentration for adequate root respiration however such a unique critical value of o2 concentration or for another single factor does not exist as this suggests that the effects of all other factors are negligible or correlated to this critical value 1 2 soil properties affecting soil aeration volumetric water content θ complementary to the air content θa is the single most important factor affecting soil aeration the o2 storage in partially saturated soils is in the gaseous phase because water at best in equilibrium with atmospheric o2 concentration at 25 c contains 8 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen furthermore o2 diffusion is strongly inhibited by elevated water contents because of the dual effect of the 104 fold smaller o2 diffusion coefficient in free water as compared to free air and its effect on the tortuosity of the soil air pathways smith 1977 1 3 oxygen diffusion and the da number diffusion of o2 from the atmosphere into the soil profile is usually the main natural soil aeration process ben noah et al 2020b ben noah and friedman 2018 bouyoucos and mccool 1924 buckingham 1904 the diffusion flux j m l 2 t 1 is according to fick s law 1 j d s c where d s l2 t 1 is the soil effective diffusion coefficient c m l 3 is the o2 concentration defined here in units of o2 mass per volume of soil air and is the gradient operator if we consider steady one dimensional 1d vertical o2 diffusion from the atmosphere of constant o2 concentration c atm m l 3 into soil with an impermeable surface where the o2 flux is zero e g a shallow water table at depth of z l a constant d s and zero order o2 consumption rate λ0 m l 3 t 1 then the o2 concentration profile is given by ben noah and friedman 2018 2 c z c atm λ 0 z z d s λ 0 z 2 2 d s 0 z z where z l is the vertical axis positive downwardly its origin at the soil surface the damkohler number da is defined as the ratio between the characteristic diffusion z 2 2d s and respiration c atm λ0 times i e λ0z 2 2d s c atm introducing da to eq 2 results in 3 c c atm 1 2 d a z z d a z z 2 0 z z this means that under the simplifying assumptions outlined above the o2 profile in the soil is governed solely by da and the vertical o2 flux is according to fick s law 4 j λ 0 z z 0 z z the assumption of steady o2 diffusion is justified by the low diurnal amplitude of o2 concentration the 1d vertical diffusion assumption and the uniform o2 consumption rates are reasonable in drip irrigated orchards in the region below and near the emitters and in the region far from the emitters where the water content gradients and differences in root density and microbial activity are relatively small friedman and naftaliev 2012 using zero order consumption rate λ0 to describe soil respiration i e assuming that the respiration rate is not affected by the o2 concentration is common cook and knight 2003 ben noah and friedman 2018 and implemented also in this paper this assumption can be justified by the minimum o2 concentration much smaller for microbes than for plant roots for which o2 consumption rate starts to decline gliński and stepniewski 1985 assuming an impermeable surface where shallow water table prevails is justified because respiration rates in groundwater are small and limited by the low o2 solubility and o2 diffusivity in water saturated soils 1 4 methods for improving soil aeration o2 availability is considered the third most important growth parameter after water and nutrient availability gliński and stepniewski 1985 tillage is the only commonly used agricultural practice for improving soil aeration despite its harmful effect on soil structure and organic matter content stepniewski and stepniewska 2008 o2 deficiencies are usually avoided by choosing a crop compatible with soil aeration capability or through manipulation of the irrigation dosage frequency and application mode thus developing an efficient and simple method for soil aeration could increase the variety of permissible crops in fine texture soils and also increase the yields of currently grown crops by increasing the water availability without causing o2 stress ben noah and friedman 2016a air injection was found fairly effective in aerating the soil ben noah et al 2020a 2020b ben noah and friedman 2016a increasing yield and improving fruit quality in a wide range of crops bhattarai et al 2006 nascimento et al 2020 li et al 2016a 2016c enhancing plant growth xiao et al 2015 li et al 2016b vyrlas et al 2014 and also improving water use efficiency abuarab et al 2013 2017 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2020 and nitrogen uptake du et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the main advantage of the air injection method is the availability of air and the ability to deliver large amounts of oxygen compared to other aeration methods such as adding hydrogen peroxide melsted et al 1949 ben noah and friedman 2016b or air bubbles bhattarai et al 2004 2006 goorahoo et al 2002 oo et al 2018 yan et al 2019 to irrigation water in which case the supplied o2 is limited by the irrigation dose low o2 solubility and peroxide s harmful reactivity 1 5 factors for consideration regarding air injection in principle air injection introduces atmospheric air containing about 250 mg l 1 of o2 21 and practically zero co2 to the soil causing exhausted air with elevated concentrations of co2 and low o2 to exile the main challenge associated with the air injection method is to effectively distribute the o2 in the root zone where most of the injected air will flow in a few finger like channels from the air source to the atmosphere especially in structured clayey or wet soils elder and benson 1999 also movement of soil particles caused by momentum transfer between the flowing air and the soil particles kong et al 2009 holtzman et al 2012 varas et al 2013 and the shrinkage of drying soil aggregates at the moving air front extends the preferential pathways thereby enhancing the discrete rather than continuous nature of the flow pattern in addition to gas exchange air injection may have a hydraulic effect on the water distribution ben noah et al 2020b ben noah and friedman 2019 the effect of air injection on water distribution mainly pushing the water upwardly depends on the depth of the air injection source in respect to the water source and the root zone the air and water discharge rates and the soil s permeability to air and water in this study we evaluate the effect of different factors on the degree of o2 deficiency and its effect on orange tree valencia citrus sinensis growth yield and fruit quality furthermore we present the results of a field scale experiment testing the effects of air injection and irrigation intensity in a mature orchard subjected to prolonged o2 deficiency stress next we re analyze some of the data presented in friedman and naftaliev 2012 briefly illustrating the effect of also irrigation water quality fresh water or tww on the soil aeration status and respiration rates of other soil types and trees finally we present a cost benefit analysis delineating key challenges of air injection system requirements and feasibility 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup effects of hypoxia and soil aeration by air injection on

repetitions of the four treatments in both plots fig 1a air was injected during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 at a depth of 100 cm below soil surface from a buried 8 mm polyethylene tube

samples of each treatment repetition total of 32 samples using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 it showed substantial variability with sand content ranging between 57 and 90 and clay content between 3 and 25 gravimetric water content θg was determined by comparing the weights of soil samples before and after drying in an oven at 105 c for 48 h the soil solution ec was determined by adding 2 1 weight ratio distilled water to oven dried soil samples shaking the tubes for 24 h and extracting the supernatant after centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min the in situ soil solution in the field was evaluated by multiplying the ec of the analyzed supernatant by the dilution factor 2 θg ec measurements of soil solution and groundwater samples were made with a portable ec meter ott hydromet kl0110 kempten germany o2 concentration was measured using a portable galvanic sensor mo 200 apogee logan ut by extracting soil air samples with a 200 ml plastic syringe from 100 ml perforated plastic bottles buried at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface and at a lateral distance of 20 cm from the drippers and about 0 5 m from the line of tree trunks the measuring frequency was approximately once a month fig 5 daily courses of o2 concentrations were occasionally measured by placing the galvanic o2 sensor possessing an internal data logger in a 2 inch 5 08 cm diameter pvc pipe perforated at a depth of 40 cm below the soil surface water table levels were measured approximately every two months in eleven 2 inch diameter monitoring wells piezometers with a level meter ott kl010 kempten germany the wells were installed without a well skin to a depth of about 1 m below the water table using a 2 inch hand auger 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the jmp pro statistical software version 2 0 1 sas institute inc usa in this work we used different models for the different experiments where the two northern and southern orchard plots were set as treatments for the first experiment of pre air injection irrigation in the air injection irrigation experiment we used two different models a each row at each plot was set as a block with an uneven number of repetitions see fig 1 and b the two plots were analyzed separately while in each of the plots the row number was set as a block with an even number of repetitions the repeated measurement analysis of the o2 conc was made under the univariate assumption this assumption could not be tested via the sphericity test because of the large number of missing samples in the southern plot caused by the high groundwater levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre air injection comparison between two plots of different degree of hypoxia the upper rows no 7 and 8 in the two plots are nearly the same topographical height altitude and of similar water table depths fig 3d yet the difference in the size and volume of the tree canopies was notable fig 1 the different degrees of o2 deficiency between plots were mainly the result of different soil texture namely different clay content fig 3b the different degrees of hypoxia significantly affected yields the average yield in the 2018 fruit picking before the start of air injection and added irrigation treatments of the southern plot severe hypoxia was 33 5 kg tree compared to 58 6 kg tree 75 in the northern plot minor hypoxia table 1 also a lower mean single fruit weight was found in the severe hypoxia plot in the pre treatment picking 2018 however the fruit weight of the northern and southern plots was identical in both the 2019 and 2020 pickings in addition to the yield and fruit load differences in fruit quality parameters were also observed in the 2018 picking with higher sugar acid and chloride contents in the southern plot juice percentage was similar in both plots as was the sugar acid ratio table 1 fruit yield in both plots decreased with clay content and with water content at 40 cm and increased with trunk perimeter fig 4 the apparently positive correlation between yield and groundwater ec fig 3e and soil solution ec figs 4e and 3g may be explained by the higher transpiration rates of the larger trees salinizing the soil solution and yielding more fruits this positive correlation also suggests that salinity is not the main stress factor affecting the trees and that the effect of o2 deficiency or maybe its interaction with salinity is probably stronger the correlation between yield and the depth of the groundwater table figs 4d and 3d also supports the hypothesis that inadequate o2 availability is the main stress factor in this orchard a shallow water table reduces o2 supply by increasing the water content of the soil fig 3f which negatively affects as mentioned above both o2 storage and flux in addition the shallow water table reduces the soil s o2 consumption rate as there is less respiring soil volume per unit area measurements of tree trunk perimeters are a bit problematic as the trunks are not strictly cylindrical the arbitrary height of 10 cm above grafting may sometimes represent a narrow and sometimes a thick section of the trunk causing large variability despite this limitation the measured trunk perimeter in the severe hypoxia plot south was about 6 5 cm shorter 14 compared to the minor hypoxia plot table 1 and the correlation between yield and trunk perimeter was very strong fig 4a o2 concentrations at depths of 20 cm below the soil surface in the southern plot were found to be significantly lower than in the northern plot at the pre air injection measurements fig 5b however at depths of 40 and 60 cm the soil air o2 concentration was not significantly different between the two plots and similar at 60 cm depth this may be explained by the lower respiration of the smaller stressed trees with smaller root systems this explanation is supported by the soil wetting conditions in the southern plot of which the soil depth of 60 cm and sometimes also 40 cm is during most of the year below the water table or in the capillary fringe zone where water saturation also prevails using o2 concentration in the gaseous phase as a quantifier for an adequate supply of o2 to plant roots is common mainly because it is easy to measure also if assuming the roots are an ideal sink zero o2 concentration at their surface then the o2 concentration in the bulk soil air is a good measure of the gradient of o2 concentration towards the respiring root which is according to fick s law the driving force for o2 diffusion however the o2 concentration gradient is merely half of the picture as the o2 flux also depends on the soil s effective diffusion coefficient buckingham 1904 therefore the difference between the o2 fluxes towards the roots in the two plots with similar o2 concentration in the gaseous phase is proportional to the difference between the diffusion coefficients of the finer wetter and coarser dryer soils using the da number as a soil aeration status indicator may be superior as it weighs both the o2 supply and respiration rates a small da number suggests low o2 consumption compared to its supply as expected the growth rate of the tree perimeters declines with increased da in the southern plot which is subjected to extreme hypoxia while in the northern plot the da does not correlate with tree growth fig 5a da had a similar effect on the 2019 yield but with a higher p of 0 055 not presented on the other hand low respiration rate of impaired trees reduces the da number making the da a state variable of the prevailing conditions but not an indicator of the optimal aeration state this limitation is similar to that of o2 concentration in the soil gas for this reason an areal respiration rate criterion for different crops and climate should be a more general quantifier of o2 stress fig 5 b presents the mean o2 concentrations measured in the northern and southern plots averaged spatially over the 16 repetitions in each plot and temporally over 23 measurements in the period of december 28 2018 to april 23 2020 it is clearly observed that while in the northern plot the o2 concentration decreases gradually downwardly in the southern plot the concentrations measured at 20 cm depth are substantially lower than atmospheric but the concentrations at depths of 40 and 60 cm are similar to those at a depth of 20 cm indicating that not much respiration occurs in these depths it should be noted that these two mean concentrations are based on much fewer measurements when the water table was relatively deep and soil air could be sampled by vacuum extraction form the perforated plastic bottles the average depths of the water table of 7 measurement times in the period of august 20 2019 to april 4 2020 in the northern and southern plots were 75 4 and 46 1 cm respectively and if assuming air entry values h cr of 15 cm for the northern plot s soil and 20 cm for the more clayey soil of the southern plot this means that the mean depths of the water saturation surfaces were 60 4 cm in the northern plot and 26 1 in the southern plot the sketched horizontal lines in fig 5b the solution for steady 1d diffusion with zero order respiration in between the soil surface and an impermeable to o2 diffusion layer at z z eq 3 was fitted to the measured mean o2 concentrations in the 0 60 4 cm and 0 26 1 cm unsaturated zones of the soil profiles in the northern and southern plots and the resulted damkohler numbers da λ0 z 2 2d s c atm are 0 147 and 0 177 respectively the effective o2 diffusion coefficient in the soil d s can be approximately evaluated by assuming a hydrostatic water content distribution above the water table if evaluating the mean soil porosities of the two plots by correlating the porosity of the thirty two 40 cm depth samples to their clay and sand percentages according to n 0 332 7 251 10 4 sand 0 1276 log10 clay saxton et al 1986 and if assuming zero residual

cm2 s 1 is the o2 diffusivity in free air friedman and mualem 1994 the resulting arithmetic mean d s in the respiring soil profiles of the northern and southern plots are 0 0150 and 0 0033 cm2 s 1 respectively with an atmospheric o2 concentration of c atm 2 50 10 4 g o2 cm 3 depths of impermeable layers z of 60 4 and 26 1 cm and fitted da numbers of 0 147 and 0 177 the volumetric respiration rates λ0 in the northern and southern plots are 3 01 10 10 and 4 29 10 10 g o2 cm 3 s 1 respectively the areal respiration rates λ0 z are respectively 1 82 10 8 and 1 12 10 8 go2 cm 2 s 1 or 15 7 and 9 7 go2 m 2 d 1 within the range of those characteristics of irrigated orchards averaging at 10 15 g o2 m 2 d 1 friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 it would not be very advantageous to carry out still more tedious measurements and calculations with greater accuracy in order to test the correctness of the sensible conclusions that the mean volumetric respiration rate of the southern plot is about 40 higher than in the northern one and that the areal i e the overall respiration rate in the southern plot with the smaller trees is 40 lower compared to that of the northern plot the reduced overall respiration rates λ0 z in the southern plot stem from both high water contents and a poorly developed root system within the restricted unsaturated sections of the soil profile fig 5b which in a mature orchard transplanted in 2004 probably means irreversible damage 3 2 effect of air injection on tree growth fruit yield and fruit quality trunk perimeter growth was not affected by the irrigation and or aeration treatments table 2 however during the experiments the diameter of the trees in the northern plot increased more than that of the southern plot another indication of the on going hypoxic stress in the southern plot air injection started at the end of december 2018 between irrigation seasons on april 7th 2019 one month before the start of the 2019 irrigation season fruits were harvested and weighed despite the short period of aeration until picking 4 5 months and the fact that by the start of the soil aeration both flowering and fruit setting were completed it was found that air injection increased yield by 24 p 0 092 in the 2019 picking compared to the 2018 picking while the yield in the 2019 picking under soil aeration a increased by 1 01 kg per tree the yield in the non aerated treatments a decreased by 10 61 kg per tree this finding is even more surprising as the single fruit weight was not affected at all by the aeration treatment table 2 shedding of immature fruits seems unlikely to explain the measured difference since we did not notice a large number of fallen fruit under the canopies of the non aerated trees leaving us without a reasonable explanation for these findings two way analysis of aeration treatment and plot side hypoxia severity did not show a significant interaction not presented in the 2019 picking by itself i e not compared to the 2018 picking the least square mean yield accounting for the effect of the blocks i e rows and of the southern and northern plots of the aeration treatments was 21 higher 46 28 compared to 38 22 kg per tree but it was not statistically significant p 0 1422 due to the large variance between trees in the orchard the yield in the april 2020 picking fig 6 was affected neither by the aeration and increased irrigation treatments nor by their interaction 2 way anova analysis not presented even when compared to the 2019 picking to exclude the permanent spatial variance the treatments did not affect yield or fruit weight table 2 also fruit quality parameters and trunk perimeter growth were not affected by the treatments table 2 the yield of the aeration treatments in the southern plot severe hypoxia was lower than the yield of the control w a in the northern plot mild hypoxia as expected this suggests that most of the o2 stress damage is indeed irreversible the general all treatments yield in the northern plot was 49 higher in 2020 as compared to the 2019 picking least square means of 62 25 and 90 94 in 2019 and 2020 in accordance while in the southern severe hypoxia plot the yield decreased by almost 25 from 30 94 to 23 25 the change of the trend in the yield in the northern plot from a decrease between 2018 and 2019 to an increase between 2019 and 2020 pickings may be explained by biennial intermittence while in the southern plot the effect of intermittence is masked by the damage caused by o2 stress 3 3 effect of air injection and irrigation intensity on soil o2 concentration soil air o2 concentrations along the growing season were slightly higher in the aerated treatment with normal irrigation a w than in the no aeration with increased irrigation a w fig 7 significant only at depth of 60 cm using multivariate anova while assuming univariate of the repeated measurements with time this is probably because the measured absolute o2 concentrations were quite high an overall mean of 18 bounded by the atmospheric o2 concentration 21 which limits the potential of active aeration at the beginning of the irrigation seasons blue arrows in fig 7a c a drop in the o2 concentration was observed in all treatments more steeply in the non aerated treatments a the measured daily amplitude of the soil o2 concentration was very small 2 3 in both winter and summer with no significant difference between aerated and non aerated treatments not presented this finding supports the assumption of steady state diffusion from the atmosphere implemented in the model outlined in eq 3 it may be explained by low respiration of the impaired trees and by the limiting factor for respiration not being the o2 concentration of the soil air but rather the o2 diffusivity the average over time o2 concentration profiles in the northern plots show steeper drops in the non aeration treatments more so in the increased irrigation w a than in the control w a treatments fig 8 overall on average air injection increased o2 concentrations in all depths especially at 40 and 60 cm and high irrigation intensity slightly decreased the o2 concentrations at these depths in the southern plot the o2 profiles below the 20 cm depth were irregular probably because of the higher water contents and the fact that the 40 cm and 60 cm depths were submerged in the capillary fringe zone or even below the water table for substantial periods during the growing seasons fig 8 to illustrate in this experiment during most of the season we could not extract an air sample from the perforated bottles buried at a depth of 60 cm during part of the irrigation season we could not even draw air from the 40 cm bottles in the southern plot on account of the soil being water saturated at these depths water was extracted rather than air yet when we did succeed in extracting air samples their o2 concentrations were usually above 15 despite the relatively high o2 concentrations fig 8 the reduced yield and tree growth in the southern plot suggest that o2 stress still prevails as discussed above this means that o2 concentration in the soil air alone is not a good quantifier for soil aeration status we postulate that the da number or the bulk o2 concentration in the soil the product of the air content and the soil air o2 concentration are superior quantifiers friedman and naftaliev 2012 ben noah and friedman 2018 3 4 effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration status and respiration rates as written in the material and methods section the experiment in the valencia orange grove described here used treated waste water of relatively good quality to extend the discussion on factors affecting soil aeration to other trees soil textures and irrigation water qualities we re analyzed measurements of soil oxygen concentration profiles carried out on september 8 and 11 2008 in fifteen orchards of pomelo mandarin apple pear peach almond pomegranate persimmon avocado and grapevine the orchards were planted in a variety of soil types with clay percentage at a depth of 30 cm ranging from 25 to 76 and esp exchangeable sodium percentage ranging from 0 8 to 5 8 the orchards were irrigated with either fresh water fw from the israeli national carrier or local wells or with treated waste water tww from either local reservoirs or regional waste water treatments plants friedman and naftaliev 2012 as in sub chapter 3 1 eq 3 with its single da λ0 z 2 2d s c atm parameter was fitted to the measured concentration profiles two repetitions of measurements at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm in each orchard assuming zero oxygen flux at 60 cm z 60 cm measuring gravimetric water contents at a depth of 30 cm at the same time as o2 concentration measurements and correlating the porosity to the clay and sand percentage again according to n 0 332 7 251 10 4 sand 0 1276 log10 clay served to evaluate the uniform assumed effective o2 diffusivity with d s d 0 n 1 5 θa n 2 5 the fifteen orchards are of different tree types and are located in regions of different summer potential evaporation and winter rainfalls and thus are irrigated at different intensities yet the tww irrigated orchards are irrigated with higher irrigation doses probably for providing sufficient salt leaching which results in wetter soil profiles means of θg of 0 396 for tww and 0 233 for fw in the 30 cm depth samples and consequently their o2 concentration profiles are described by higher da numbers a mean of 0 206 as compared to 0 074 for the fw irrigated orchards fig 9 yet the trends of the da θg relationships of the fw and tww irrigated orchards seem quite similar which perhaps indicates that the effect of irrigation water quality on soil aeration is not related directly to the water s o2 demand bod cod but probably to the tww s indirect effect on increasing the soil water content and reducing its effective o2 diffusivity the effect of the tww in increasing the soil water content is two fold through larger irrigation doses for salt leaching and the detrimental effect of sodium to decrease the soil s hydraulic conductivity high sar irrigation water generating soils of high esp also reduces the effective o2 diffusivities proportional y ax with zero intercept trend lines were fitted to the da θg data as in totally dry soil θg 0 ds is maximal and respiration is not feasible λ0 0 fig 9a applying the estimated effective o2 diffusivities allows evaluation of the volumetric respiration rates λ0 from the fitted da numbers as in section 3 1 and the areal respiration rates λ0z optimum λ0z θg relationships were fitted to the data of the fifteen orchards as root and soil respiration rates are expected to be low in both extrema of very dry and very wet soils fig 9b as for the similar da θg trends found for tww and fw and although the tww irrigated orchards were characterized with higher water contents fig 9 and with lower areal respiration rates means of λ0z of 2 26 g o2 m 2 d 1 for tww and of 4 11 g o2 m 2 d 1 for fw the effect of the soil water content on the areal respiration rates λ0z θg seemed independent of irrigation water quality the esp of the tww irrigated soils was of course higher compared to those irrigated with fresh water means of 3 06 for tww and 1 5 for fw but the trend in the effect of the soil s esp on the fitted da number da esp is similar for tww and fw fig 10 3 5 economic evaluation of the applicability of an air injection system costs of an air injection system can be divided into three main categories 1 equipment 2 installation and 3 operation and maintenance o m summarized in table 3 equipment costs of the aeration system are relatively low where the dripline especially if one uses pressure compensated and densely spaced drippers stands for most of the equipment costs for 4 5 m spaces between tree rows like in this orchard a length of 2222 m of dripline is required per 1 ha amounting to a cost of about 1200 per ha assuming dripline cost of about 0 54 m 1 the blower used becker dt4 10 germany is capable of discharging 25 m3 h 1 of air with a working pressure of 1 8 bar absolute enough for the drippers to be regulated this discharge rate can be used to provide the entire o2 demand of 1 5 ha accounting for atmospheric o2 concentration of 250 g m 3 and a respiration rate of 10 g o2 m 2 d 1 assuming blower cost of about 3000 this amounts to 2000 ha 1 if operating the blower continuously other equipment such as electric valves and an irrigation computer may sum up to 100 per ha for small plots costs declines as the aeration area increases for the cost estimation below table 3 we assume a ten year life span for the equipment i e that the entire equipment should be replaced once every 10 years installation costs may vary significantly depending on the available infrastructure and state of the orchard in our experiment we were able to locate a nearby electricity source otherwise a generator or electricity line would have been allocated with significant cost implications installation of the air injection driplines before transplanting the trees or in a young grove can be facilitated by using a trencher for this experiment in a mature orchard 2004 transplantation we used an electric rotary hammer to install the aeration tubes this practice was used to prevent the biased effect of the trencher on soil aeration in the reported experiment but it is not a recommended agrotechnological practice as it consumes too much time to illustrate it took us about 100 working hours to drill and install the a treatment area of 0 108 ha 480 air tubes a trencher can probably reduce this installation time and cost by at least an order of magnitude so if we assume a working force cost of 10 per hour installation with a trencher costs is estimated to be less than 1000 ha 1 operation and maintenance costs can be divided into electricity consumables and labor the electricity price of the 0 75 kw blower working 24 7 and aerating 1 ha is about 657 ha 1 y 1 assuming electricity price of 0 1 per kwh consumables and labor costs were mainly the replacement of aeration tubes and drippers damaged by wild animals mostly jackals a monthly visit of about an hour was needed 1 h for a 0 108 ha area which means according to the labor costs mentioned above an annual maintenance labor cost of about 1100 ha 1 which is probably the greatest cost component in summary based on the calculations above air injection system costs are approximately 2000 ha 1 for installation and infrastructure and about 2200 ha 1 yr 1 for equipment and operation for valencia oranges at a price of 0 4 kg 1 and an increase of 6 5 ton ha 1 about 8 7 of the yield in the northern plot is needed to return the investment after 5 years this 8 7 difference in yield is well within the reported impairment in this and in other studies of o2 stress 4 conclusions oxygen deficiencies impair trees growth and productivity the severity of the hypoxia in an orchard located above a shallow water table was found to be correlated with the clay content of the soil this is because of the higher water contents caused by higher water retention and by a shallower water table the o2 concentration of the soil s air alone was not a good quantifier of the degree of o2 deficiency the damkholer number da i e the ratio between characteristic diffusion and respiration times evaluated from the measured o2 concentration profiles with depth and the groundwater table depths is a superior quantifier of aeration status the effect of irrigation water quality on the soil aeration status is probably not related directly to the water s o2 demand but rather to the tww s indirect effect on increasing the soil water contents and reducing its effective o2 diffusivities using air injection without increasing irrigation intensity slightly increased the soil s air o2 concentrations but did not affect tree growth trunk perimeter or yield indicating that the hypoxia impairment was mostly irreversible in the experimented orchard or more pessimistically that air injection is ineffective for aeration of wet soils when if effective air injection is an economically feasible method which can potentially be used to alleviate o2 deficiency stress however its efficiency in cases where shallow groundwater prevails is ambiguous declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10249,in rainfed areas due to the many variable environmental factors the introduced cultivars in addition to high yield must also have yield stability in the present study 15 barley lines along with three local control cultivars under dryland conditions in six cold locations of iran during three consecutive years 2013 2016 were evaluated the results showed that the genotype by environment interaction is highly significant the ratios between the sums of squares of g ge and ipca1 indicated that the ammi model is suitable for data analysis also combining ammi model with blup technique and using waasb index was promising and the results of both were in agreement with the ammi1 model three mega environments were determined and the locations of maragheh qamlu and zanjan were located in the same mega environment every three years finally it was concluded that the second control cultivar was the most desirable genotype for most environments genotypes 16 15 and 12 with high yield and optimal stability have the ability to be used as new potential genetic resources for improving and stabilizing grain yield in barley breeding programs for cold rainfed conditions genotypes 4 5 and 6 should only be used in narrow adaptation to restricted environments on the other hand rainfall in november and january is important for proper seedling establishment and rainfall in april and may is important for pollination and grain filling period keywords adaptability and stability ammi models rainfed factorial regression partial least squares regression 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the fourth and second most produced cereal in the world and iran respectively the second rank of barley in iran is due to the vastness of dryland lands in this country and drought tolerance in barley iran has an average rainfall of less than 250 mm and about 90 of it is located in arid and semi arid regions under such environmental conditions achieving high yield and stable genotypes has become a major goal for this purpose breeders are testing genotypes in a wide range of environments in the final stages of their programs what they generally see are different responses of genotypes to different environmental conditions in the most severe cases these responses are such that the performance rating of the genotypes changes this is known as the genotype by environment interaction gei and is caused in the barley by various environmental factors including the rainfall pattern abay and bjørnstad 2009 gei is one of the biggest challenges for researchers yan and frégeau reid 2018 and reduce selection efficiency due to the confusion it creates therefore improving barley cultivars requires understanding and effective use of the gei vaezi et al 2017 in order to understand and explain gei various statistical methods have been developed elias et al 2016 and various researchers have used these methods to investigate grain yield and stability of barley genotypes nurminiemi and rognli 1996 mühleisen et al 2014 meng et al 2016 vaezi et al 2019 among these methods additive main effect and multiplicative interaction ammi analysis is one of the most widely used and popular ones malosetti et al 2013 the ammi model uses a combination analysis of variance and principal components analysis with fixed effects without external data and additional structure in environments and genotypes gauch 1988 the graphical tools of this method have a special role in the simultaneous evaluation of performance and stability as well as the selection of mega environments and narrow adaptation in addition to graphical tools the ammi model has a wide range of stability measures ajay et al 2020 as a result of this method has played a special role in evaluated grain yield and stability of barley genotypes kumar et al 2018 examined the yield stability of barley cultivars and stated that ammi method is more suitable than other methods mortazavian et al 2014 and vaezi et al 2017 evaluated the grain yield of barley genotypes in semi tropical regions of iran with ammi and genotypic main effect plus genotype by environment interaction gge biplot methods and emphasized the usefulness of both methods in selecting stable and high yielding genotypes ammi method was simplified by gauch 2013 with a protocol consisting of four steps in this protocol the sum of square ss for genotypes g ge signal ges and ge noise gen are calculated and based on them the usefulness of the ammi model is judged then one of the ammi family models is diagnosed and mega environments are delineated and finally the genotypes are selected and recommended this protocol has been used by various researchers mohammed et al 2016 ito et al 2016 hassani et al 2018 in addition to the advantages the ammi model also has disadvantages for example it is sensitive to outlying observations rodrigues et al 2016 and has no success in analyzing the structure of the linear mixed eﬀect model lmm olivoto et al 2019 olivoto et al 2019 combined the features of ammi and best linear unbiased prediction blup techniques they introduced two statistics waasb weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of blup for gei eﬀects generated by an lmm and waasby weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of blup for the gei eﬀects generated by an lmm and response variable for selecting genotypes based on both mean performance and stability possibly with different weights for each one in this introduced method genotype or environment or both can be random effects such a combination of ammi graphical tools and prediction accuracy of blup are useful in gei studies olivoto et al 2019 simultaneous use of the proposed models for ammi in addition to providing a complete view of the gei can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each as mentioned the ammi model is not able to import external variables directly into the model but partial least squares pls regression and factorial regression fr models can combine external data with gei analysis reynolds et al 2002 vargas et al 1999 used ammi model in addition to pls and fr models to identify environmental variables affecting performance in another study mohammadi et al 2020 while pointing to the complementarity of ammi pls and fr results showed that rainfall was one of the most important factors in rainfed conditions although rainfall is important proper distribution of rainfall is essential for high yields for example a large amount of precipitation in may has been reported to lead to poor pollination and reduced wheat grain yield kondić špika et al 2019 considering the total rainfall or monthly rainfall it is still not possible to describe the barley performance changes in different environments because other factors also play a role abay and bjørnstad 2009 however the inclusion of rainfall data in the gei can be useful in management issues and the introduction of genotypes due to the fact that most of the barley cultivation areas in iran are located in cold and semi arid areas the present study describes the gei for the grain yield of barley genotypes under dryland conditions in these areas monthly rainfall has also been used as a covariate for gei interpretation to reveal their importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and field evaluation in this study 15 advanced barley genotypes along with three local check cultivars were investigated based on complete randomized block design with four replications in rainfed conditions in six cold research stations for three consecutive years 2013 2016 the characteristics of the genotypes and environments are presented in table 1 the experimental plots consisted of six lines seven m long and 20 cm apart at the end of the growing season and with the removal of marginal effects grain yield was estimated based on kg ha 1 2 2 statistical analysis 2 2 1 ammi model to analyze the data we followed the ammi method based on the four step gauch 2013 protocol in ammisoft software the ammi model equation is as follows 1 y ger μ α g β e n λ n γ gn δ en ρ ge k r e e ger where y ger is the yield of the genotype g in environment e for replicate r μ is the grand mean α g is the genotype deviation from μ β e is the environmental deviation from μ λ n is the singular value for interaction principal component ipc axis n γ gn and δ en are the eigenvector values of genotype g and environment e for the axis n respectively ρ ge is the residual κ r e is the effect of the block r within the environment j ε ger is the error 2 2 2 combining features of ammi and blup techniques in order to combine the features of blup and ammi techniques we followed the method introduced by olivoto et al 2019 in this method statistics of waasb were used as follows 2 waasb g n 1 p ipca gn ep n n 1 p ep n where waasb g is the weighted average of absolute scores of the genotype g ipca gn is the score of the genotype g in the nth interaction principal component axis ipca and ep n is the amount of the variance explained by the nth ipca since achieving high yield and stable genotypes has become a major goal we used the waasby index as follows 3 waasby g rg g θ y rw g θ s θ y θ s where waasby g is the superiority index with different weights between yield and stability for the gth genotype θ y and θ s are the weights for yield and stability respectively rg g and rw g are the rescaled values of the gth genotype for yield and waasb respectively and are as follows 4 rg g 100 0 g max g min g g g max 100 5 rw g 0 100 w max w min w g w max 0 where g g and w g are the yield and waasb values for gth genotype respectively the mentioned method was performed in r software with metan package olivoto and lúcio 2020 2 2 3 incorporating rainfall covariables for explaining gei we used monthly rainfall from october to june as environmental covariables supplementary table 1 these external data were entered into gei analysis by pls regression and factorial regression methods by gea r software pacheco et al 2015 the pls model consists of an independent matrices x rainfall data and a dependent matrix y grain yield and the latent variables t as follows 6 x t 1 p 1 t 2 p 2 e tp e 7 y t 1 q 1 t 2 q 2 f tq f where the matrix t contains x scores matrix p contains the x loadings matrix q contains the y loadings and f and e are the residual matrices finally pls results were presented in the form of a biplot the factorial regression model is also as follows 8 y ge μ α g β e g 1 h z ih ζ jh ε ij where y ge is the yield of the genotype g in environment e μ is the grand mean α g and β e are the genotype and environment deviations from μ respectively z ih are the environmental covariates ζ jh are the genotype factor h is the number of environmental covariates and ε ij is the error in this model we use akaike s akaike 1974 information criterion aic for decide which variable we include in the model 3 results 3 1 ammi the effects of genotype environment and ge interaction were highly significant p 0 001 also the fr test showed that only the first two components were significant and explained about 60 of ssge table 2 the estimated ss for ges and gen were 67005742 7 55 6 and 53554517 1 44 4 respectively ges and gen were 2 85 and 2 28 times ssg respectively fig 1 a shows the distribution of genotypes and environments based on ipc1 scores and mean yield it is clear that the line perpendicular to the horizontal axis shows the average total i e 2627 9 kg ha 1 g2 and then g6 had the highest and g4 had the lowest mean yield the environments were more widely distributed than genotypes so there was a big difference between sa3 with the highest and sh1 with the lowest mean yield the g7 g15 g16 and g18 genotypes had ipc1 scores close to zero and they appear to have high yield stability fig 1a genotypes with negative ipc1 scores have lower grain yield while genotypes with a positive ipc1 score showed higher yield therefore the correlation between the genotype means and their ipc1 scores was positive and significant r 0 83 p 0 001 such a relationship was not found between the environment means and their ipc1 scores ammi2 model biplot shows the position of genotypes and environments in terms of the first two ipcs the origin of this biplot shows zero value for both components so genotypes and environments close to the origin played a smaller role in gei while those with a large distance from this point played a greater role in gei accordingly the g16 genotype and to some extent the g3 g7 g10 and g15 genotypes have broad stability to all environments but the g4 g5 g6 g9 g18 g12 and g13 genotypes can be used in narrow adaptation also among the environments sa3 ar1 ma3 ma1 and sh3 were the most influential in creating gei fig 1b the first step in determining mega environments is to choose the ammi model table 3 presents the number of mega environments and winner genotypes based on ammi model families by selecting the ammi0 model which is a model with only additive effects only 1 mega environment was determined this number was 3 6 7 and 9 mega environments for ammi1 ammi2 ammi3 and ammi4 respectively finally 13 mega environments were detected in the ammif model in this table genotypes are sorted from large to small based on ipc1 scores among the genotypes only the g2 won in all models while the g4 did not win in any of the mega environments determined by the ammi family of models the ammi1 explained about half of the gei changes and its ss was almost equal to the ges so it was the most suitable model for the ammi family ammi1 model was used to determine the mega environments as mentioned earlier three mega environments were determined by the ammi1 model details of these mega environments along with 5 winner genotypes are given in table 4 the first mega environment included ma1 ma2 ma3 za1 za2 za3 qa1 qa2 qa3 sh3 and sa2 environments in this mega environment the g2 genotype and then the g11 g12 g8 and g15 genotypes won the sh1 sh2 and ar2 environments were in the second mega environment with genotypes g16 g2 g17 and g15 ranking first to fifth respectively the sa1 sa3 ar1 and ar3 environments together formed the third mega environment where the g5 g6 g4 and g16 genotypes won the ratio for the g2 in the first mega environment was 1 this ratio for the g16 in the second mega environment varied from 1 to 1 065 finally the ratio for the g5 in the third mega environment was large between 1 047 and 1 459 table 4 also shows the ranking of the five winner genotypes based on the ammif model which includes raw data only five of the ammi1 winner genotypes in the ammif model also won 3 2 combining features of ammi and blup techniques fig 2 shows a biplot where the grain yield is on the horizontal axis and the waasb values are on the vertical axis the lines perpendicular to these axes divide the biplot into four parts the first section contains the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes and the ma1 and ar1 environments these genotypes and environments performed lower than average grain yields and played the largest role in gei in the second quadrant genotypes g1 g8 and g14 and environments sa3 ma3 ma2 sa1 and za1 were present these points like the previous part played a bigger role in gei but their grain yield was good so these environments in quadrant ii deserve special attention since they provide above average production and high ability to discriminate genotypes the g7 g9 and g10 genotypes along with the sh1 sh2 sa2 za2 and ar2 environments were placed in the third section in this part the genotypes had low performance and high stability also the environments of this section along with low performance had less ability to discriminate because they had the lowest waasb values among all environments the za3 environment was exactly on the frontier of the first and third sections with low performance and moderate discriminate power finally the fourth part included the largest number of genotypes thus g2 g3 g11 g13 g12 g15 g16 and g17 genotypes with high performance and stability were the most desirable genotypes the g18 genotype was located on the border of the third and fourth quadrant meaning that the grain yield was equal to the total average and high stability also qa1 qa2 qa3 sh3 and ar3 environments were present in the fourth section which had high production capacity and less waasb fig 2 genotypes are grouped according to ipca rankings in fig 3 a although ipcas explain some of the changes independently they were divided into three groups ipca1 and ipca2 each in one group and other ipcas in the third group the ranking of some genotypes such as g4 g5 g6 g7 g15 g16 and g18 was almost the same in terms of these ipcas while other genotypes especially the g1 g2 g8 g9 g11 g12 g14 and g17 genotypes had different rankings so this can show the importance of using all ipcas the genotypes studied were also divided into four groups genotypes g3 g7 g15 g16 and g18 were in the first group with the lowest ipca ratings the second group included the g2 g9 g10 g12 g13 and g17 genotypes which had medium and low rankings genotypes g1 g8 g11 and g14 also had average and high rankings finally the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes had the highest ipca rankings and were the most unstable these results were entirely in agreement with the results of fig 2 the heat map shown in fig 3 b ranks the genotypes based on the waasb ratio to grain yield with different weights the left side of the figure gives more weight to stability and the right side gives more weight to grain yield this figure clearly shows how the genotype s rank changes as a result of applying different weights four groups of genotypes can be identified based on these rankings the first group genotypes especially the g16 genotype were in the best condition in terms of stability and yield these genotypes are then highly productive and broadly adapted since they ranks remains the same or similar independently on the weight given for mean performance or stability the second group of genotypes had low stability but high yield the genotypes of the third group unlike the second group had the desired stability but poor performance finally the fourth group genotypes especially the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes were the most undesirable genotypes in terms of both stability and yield fig 3b 3 3 partial least squares regression and factorial regression the first and second factors in the pls biplot explained 38 74 and 17 18 of the gei variance respectively factor1 was almost able to distinguish high yielding environments sa3 sa1 and ma3 from low yielding environment sh1 the results of pls analysis showed that rainfall is involved in gei in all months except october and december pls biplot have similar interpretations to ammi biplots environments sa3 and sh3 had the longest vectors and the highest rainfall values for the beginning and end of the season respectively while other environments did not have a significant increase in rainfall for some months and had a distribution close to the origin of this biplot genotypes 5 6 and 2 which won in the third mega environment were associated with rainfall in january february and march genotypes 7 8 10 and 11 which were mostly non winner genotypes were affected by rainfall in april may and june genotype 17 was also associated with november rainfall while other genotypes did not show a significant relationship with monthly rainfall fig 4 on the other hand the stepwise factorial regression model based on akaike s information criterion aic genotype by rainfall interaction in january may november april and december were significant respectively table 5 therefore rainfall during these months plays an important role in gei 4 discussion as expected we observed a very significant gei for barley grain yield such a result has been reported in almost all similar studies rodriguez et al 2008 mortazavian et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 vaezi et al 2019 the magnitude of the gei effect is primarily due to changes in environmental conditions from one place to another and from year to year the high yield in environments with more rainfall and also its low in environments with low rainfall show that the amount of rainfall under rainfed conditions is very decisive the high difference in precipitation in the years within the stations can challenge the reproducibility patterns of the results of multi environment trials met in addition to the amount the pattern of precipitation distribution during the growth stages is also important on the other hand part of the gei is due to genetic differences between the studied genotypes we found that ammi analysis is useful for this dataset because they have more ges the high ges over ssg showed the importance of using narrow adaptations while the high gen over ssg showed that we had to use primary ipcs to increase accuracy because they selectively capture the signal gauch 2013 the first two ipc were significant with the gollob s f test gollob 1968 which accounted for more than half of the total variance therefore studying the distribution of genotypes and environments based on these two components can provide interesting information the distribution of genotypes based on average yield and ipca1 scores is a suitable model for simultaneous evaluation of yield and stability the high dispersion of environments compared to genotypes in this plot indicates more variability and very high environmental diversity than genotypes oliveira et al 2014 significant positive correlation between mean yield of genotypes and ipca1 values indicates that medium yield genotypes are stable while high and low yield genotypes are somewhat unstable these results allow the use of broad and narrow adaptability of genotypes these two concepts of adaptation are the main approach of breeders in selecting genotypes during met so that broad adaptability is based on the average performance of genotypes in all environments while narrow adaptability selection is based on the average performance of genotypes in a subset of specific environments gauch et al 2008 the use of these two concepts and determining which genotypes have general and specific adaptability depends on the type of ammi model family determining the number of mega environments is difficult and complicated shahzad et al 2019 however previous research shows that using the ammi1 model in determining this group of environments can be useful mohammed et al 2016 paderewski et al 2016 hassani et al 2018 this is because ipca1 usually has a clear interpretation but as gauch 2013 has pointed out such interpretations may sometimes be subjective as in the present study we did not find a significant correlation between ipca1 scores and environmental measurements the superiority of genotype g2 in the largest mega environments indicates the high potential of check cultivars the superiority of genotype g16 in the second mega environment indicates that this line can replace the check cultivars in these environments however factors such as seed availability and cost of preparation can lead to the selection of genotype g2 in this mega environment in this regard paderewski et al 2016 have stated that various factors can lead to the recommendation of genotypes other than the winner the interesting thing is that genotypes g5 and g6 and to some extent genotype g4 won in the third mega environment because these genotypes had lower performance than the total average some researchers consider gei to be ineffective for genotypes with a low average yield which as we have seen may not be the case the advantage of using ipca1 is that it selectively records the signal the importance of this can be understood when 13 mega environments are detected with the ammif model such structures of data are false and impossible to interpret because they are mainly caused by idiosyncratic noise to show that ammi1 information can be used reliably we calculated the waasb index which is based on the blup technique and uses all ipcas olivoto et al 2019 the variation for most of the genotypes can be explained by the two first ipcas on the other hand for some genotypes more ipcas can be necessary to account for the variation in this case the waasb value can be used as a quantitative measure of stability that accounts for these changes for example based on the ipca1 scores g3 stability would be underestimated the results of this index were very similar to the results of ammi1 this is because ipca1 plays a larger role in the waasb calculation and more than half of ipcas behave similarly in genotype rankings in addition ipca accounted for 46 of the gei so it is expected a high correlation between ipca1 and waasb ranks when the explanation of ipca1 is low especially when there are too many possible axes the waasb index can be useful to account for the variance explained in other axes than ipca1 thus the blup technique can be useful in analyzing met data as has already been proven piepho 1994 simultaneous evaluation of yield and yield stability is very important so ranking genotypes based on different weights of the two can be more useful genotypes g12 g15 and g16 with high rankings were the most desirable genotypes based on different weights of yield and stability although genotypes g4 g5 and g6 were unfavorable in terms of yield and stability at different weights as we have seen they were among the winner genotypes in the third mega environment therefore the selection of genotypes based on performance and ipcas scores regardless of the mega environment pattern eliminates the opportunity to take advantage of narrow adaptation with the entry of external data i e monthly rainfall to the gei analysis it was found that rainfall in some months has no effect on the gei pattern identifying the most influential rainfall months in the gei can be useful in introducing stable genotypes for current and future conditions where the rainfall pattern is changing according to pls june rainfall was in the opposite direction to high yield genotypes and is negatively correlated with them in this regard abay and bjørnstad 2009 reported that rainfall this month has a negative effect on barley performance while rainfall in may has a significant positive relationship with yield in other plants it was reported that the genetic diversity index was significantly correlated with rainfall in june zhang et al 2018 however rainfall in june did not enter the factorial regression model slight differences between the pls and fr models in the introduction of covariates have already been observed mohammadi et al 2020 comparing the two methods it was found that rainfall in january may november and april affect the gei and researchers and farmers should pay attention to it rainfall in november and january seems to be important for germination and proper seedling establishment and rainfall in april and may is important for pollination and seed filling period under rainfed condition drought tolerant genotypes can be identified by comparing the specific adaptation pattern and rainfall data mortazavian et al 2014 but voltas et al 2005 after identifying the winning genotypes with gge biplot clarified the role of drought and other environmental factors affecting them by fr method this is because of the pattern of mega environments is not only affected by rainfall conditions and various known and unknown factors are effective in their formation such environmental factors have caused half of the places to be in different mega environments in three years while places with an altitude of over 1500 m were well placed in one mega environment every three years however the pattern of rainfall during different months was almost able to play its role in the formation of mega environments where the third mega environment in terms of rainfall was highest in january february and march 5 conclusions gei was significant for barley grain yield in cold rainfed areas of iran the ammi method and its combination with the blup technique made it possible to properly describe the gei genotype g2 which was one of the check cultivars won in most environments and is therefore recommended due to its easy access genotypes g12 g16 and g15 with high yield and stability can be considered as new genetic resources in barley breeding programs finally genotypes g4 g5 and g6 should only be used in narrow adaptations to specific environments rainfall in january may november and april entered the regression model with both pls and fr methods

10249,in rainfed areas due to the many variable environmental factors the introduced cultivars in addition to high yield must also have yield stability in the present study 15 barley lines along with three local control cultivars under dryland conditions in six cold locations of iran during three consecutive years 2013 2016 were evaluated the results showed that the genotype by environment interaction is highly significant the ratios between the sums of squares of g ge and ipca1 indicated that the ammi model is suitable for data analysis also combining ammi model with blup technique and using waasb index was promising and the results of both were in agreement with the ammi1 model three mega environments were determined and the locations of maragheh qamlu and zanjan were located in the same mega environment every three years finally it was concluded that the second control cultivar was the most desirable genotype for most environments genotypes 16 15 and 12 with high yield and optimal stability have the ability to be used as new potential genetic resources for improving and stabilizing grain yield in barley breeding programs for cold rainfed conditions genotypes 4 5 and 6 should only be used in narrow adaptation to restricted environments on the other hand rainfall in november and january is important for proper seedling establishment and rainfall in april and may is important for pollination and grain filling period keywords adaptability and stability ammi models rainfed factorial regression partial least squares regression 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the fourth and second most produced cereal in the world and iran respectively the second rank of barley in iran is due to the vastness of dryland lands in this country and drought tolerance in barley iran has an average rainfall of less than 250 mm and about 90 of it is located in arid and semi arid regions under such environmental conditions achieving high yield and stable genotypes has become a major goal for this purpose breeders are testing genotypes in a wide range of environments in the final stages of their programs what they generally see are different responses of genotypes to different environmental conditions in the most severe cases these responses are such that the performance rating of the genotypes changes this is known as the genotype by environment interaction gei and is caused in the barley by various environmental factors including the rainfall pattern abay and bjørnstad 2009 gei is one of the biggest challenges for researchers yan and frégeau reid 2018 and reduce selection efficiency due to the confusion it creates therefore improving barley cultivars requires understanding and effective use of the gei vaezi et al 2017 in order to understand and explain gei various statistical methods have been developed elias et al 2016 and various researchers have used these methods to investigate grain yield and stability of barley genotypes nurminiemi and rognli 1996 mühleisen et al 2014 meng et al 2016 vaezi et al 2019 among these methods additive main effect and multiplicative interaction ammi analysis is one of the most widely used and popular ones malosetti et al 2013 the ammi model uses a combination analysis of variance and principal components analysis with fixed effects without external data and additional structure in environments and genotypes gauch 1988 the graphical tools of this method have a special role in the simultaneous evaluation of performance and stability as well as the selection of mega environments and narrow adaptation in addition to graphical tools the ammi model has a wide range of stability measures ajay et al 2020 as a result of this method has played a special role in evaluated grain yield and stability of barley genotypes kumar et al 2018 examined the yield stability of barley cultivars and stated that ammi method is more suitable than other methods mortazavian et al 2014 and vaezi et al 2017 evaluated the grain yield of barley genotypes in semi tropical regions of iran with ammi and genotypic main effect plus genotype by environment interaction gge biplot methods and emphasized the usefulness of both methods in selecting stable and high yielding genotypes ammi method was simplified by gauch 2013 with a protocol consisting of four steps in this protocol the sum of square ss for genotypes g ge signal ges and ge noise gen are calculated and based on them the usefulness of the ammi model is judged then one of the ammi family models is diagnosed and mega environments are delineated and finally the genotypes are selected and recommended this protocol has been used by various researchers mohammed et al 2016 ito et al 2016 hassani et al 2018 in addition to the advantages the ammi model also has disadvantages for example it is sensitive to outlying observations rodrigues et al 2016 and has no success in analyzing the structure of the linear mixed eﬀect model lmm olivoto et al 2019 olivoto et al 2019 combined the features of ammi and best linear unbiased prediction blup techniques they introduced two statistics waasb weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of blup for gei eﬀects generated by an lmm and waasby weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of blup for the gei eﬀects generated by an lmm and response variable for selecting genotypes based on both mean performance and stability possibly with different weights for each one in this introduced method genotype or environment or both can be random effects such a combination of ammi graphical tools and prediction accuracy of blup are useful in gei studies olivoto et al 2019 simultaneous use of the proposed models for ammi in addition to providing a complete view of the gei can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each as mentioned the ammi model is not able to import external variables directly into the model but partial least squares pls regression and factorial regression fr models can combine external data with gei analysis reynolds et al 2002 vargas et al 1999 used ammi model in addition to pls and fr models to identify environmental variables affecting performance in another study mohammadi et al 2020 while pointing to the complementarity of ammi pls and fr results showed that rainfall was one of the most important factors in rainfed conditions although rainfall is important proper distribution of rainfall is essential for high yields for example a large amount of precipitation in may has been reported to lead to poor pollination and reduced wheat grain yield kondić špika et al 2019 considering the total rainfall or monthly rainfall it is still not possible to describe the barley performance changes in different environments because other factors also play a role abay and bjørnstad 2009 however the inclusion of rainfall data in the gei can be useful in management issues and the introduction of genotypes due to the fact that most of the barley cultivation areas in iran are located in cold and semi arid areas the present study describes the gei for the grain yield of barley genotypes under dryland conditions in these areas monthly rainfall has also been used as a covariate for gei interpretation to reveal their importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and field evaluation in this study 15 advanced barley genotypes along with three local check cultivars were investigated based on complete randomized block design with four replications in rainfed conditions in six cold research stations for three consecutive years 2013 2016 the characteristics of the genotypes and environments are presented in table 1 the experimental plots consisted of six lines seven m long and 20 cm apart at the end of the growing season and with the removal of marginal effects grain yield was estimated based on kg ha 1 2 2 statistical analysis 2 2 1 ammi model to analyze the data we followed the ammi method based on the four step gauch 2013 protocol in ammisoft software the ammi model equation is as follows 1 y ger μ α g β e n λ n γ gn δ en ρ ge k r e e ger where y ger is the yield of the genotype g in environment e for replicate r μ is the grand mean α g is the genotype deviation from μ β e is the environmental deviation from μ λ n is the singular value for interaction principal component ipc axis n γ gn and δ en are the eigenvector values of genotype g and environment e for the axis n respectively ρ ge is the residual κ r e is the effect of the block r within the environment j ε ger is the error 2 2 2 combining features of ammi and blup techniques in order to combine the features of blup and ammi techniques we followed the method introduced by olivoto et al 2019 in this method statistics of waasb were used as follows 2 waasb g n 1 p ipca gn ep n n 1 p ep n where waasb g is the weighted average of absolute scores of the genotype g ipca gn is the score of the genotype g in the nth interaction principal component axis ipca and ep n is the amount of the variance explained by the nth ipca since achieving high yield and stable genotypes has become a major goal we used the waasby index as follows 3 waasby g rg g θ y rw g θ s θ y θ s where waasby g is the superiority index with different weights between yield and stability for the gth genotype θ y and θ s are the weights for yield and stability respectively rg g and rw g are the rescaled values of the gth genotype for yield and waasb respectively and are as follows 4 rg g 100 0 g max g min g g g max 100 5 rw g 0 100 w max w min w g w max 0 where g g and w g are the yield and waasb values for gth genotype respectively the mentioned method was performed in r software with metan package olivoto and lúcio 2020 2 2 3 incorporating rainfall covariables for explaining gei we used monthly rainfall from october to june as environmental covariables supplementary table 1 these external data were entered into gei analysis by pls regression and factorial regression methods by gea r software pacheco et al 2015 the pls model consists of an independent matrices x rainfall data and a dependent matrix y grain yield and the latent variables t as follows 6 x t 1 p 1 t 2 p 2 e tp e 7 y t 1 q 1 t 2 q 2 f tq f where the matrix t contains x scores matrix p contains the x loadings matrix q contains the y loadings and f and e are the residual matrices finally pls results were presented in the form of a biplot the factorial regression model is also as follows 8 y ge μ α g β e g 1 h z ih ζ jh ε ij where y ge is the yield of the genotype g in environment e μ is the grand mean α g and β e are the genotype and environment deviations from μ respectively z ih are the environmental covariates ζ jh are the genotype factor h is the number of environmental covariates and ε ij is the error in this model we use akaike s akaike 1974 information criterion aic for decide which variable we include in the model 3 results 3 1 ammi the effects of genotype environment and ge interaction were highly significant p 0 001 also the fr test showed that only the first two components were significant and explained about 60 of ssge table 2 the estimated ss for ges and gen were 67005742 7 55 6 and 53554517 1 44 4 respectively ges and gen were 2 85 and 2 28 times ssg respectively fig 1 a shows the distribution of genotypes and environments based on ipc1 scores and mean yield it is clear that the line perpendicular to the horizontal axis shows the average total i e 2627 9 kg ha 1 g2 and then g6 had the highest and g4 had the lowest mean yield the environments were more widely distributed than genotypes so there was a big difference between sa3 with the highest and sh1 with the lowest mean yield the g7 g15 g16 and g18 genotypes had ipc1 scores close to zero and they appear to have high yield stability fig 1a genotypes with negative ipc1 scores have lower grain yield while genotypes with a positive ipc1 score showed higher yield therefore the correlation between the genotype means and their ipc1 scores was positive and significant r 0 83 p 0 001 such a relationship was not found between the environment means and their ipc1 scores ammi2 model biplot shows the position of genotypes and environments in terms of the first two ipcs the origin of this biplot shows zero value for both components so genotypes and environments close to the origin played a smaller role in gei while those with a large distance from this point played a greater role in gei accordingly the g16 genotype and to some extent the g3 g7 g10 and g15 genotypes have broad stability to all environments but the g4 g5 g6 g9 g18 g12 and g13 genotypes can be used in narrow adaptation also among the environments sa3 ar1 ma3 ma1 and sh3 were the most influential in creating gei fig 1b the first step in determining mega environments is to choose the ammi model table 3 presents the number of mega environments and winner genotypes based on ammi model families by selecting the ammi0 model which is a model with only additive effects only 1 mega environment was determined this number was 3 6 7 and 9 mega environments for ammi1 ammi2 ammi3 and ammi4 respectively finally 13 mega environments were detected in the ammif model in this table genotypes are sorted from large to small based on ipc1 scores among the genotypes only the g2 won in all models while the g4 did not win in any of the mega environments determined by the ammi family of models the ammi1 explained about half of the gei changes and its ss was almost equal to the ges so it was the most suitable model for the ammi family ammi1 model was used to determine the mega environments as mentioned earlier three mega environments were determined by the ammi1 model details of these mega environments along with 5 winner genotypes are given in table 4 the first mega environment included ma1 ma2 ma3 za1 za2 za3 qa1 qa2 qa3 sh3 and sa2 environments in this mega environment the g2 genotype and then the g11 g12 g8 and g15 genotypes won the sh1 sh2 and ar2 environments were in the second mega environment with genotypes g16 g2 g17 and g15 ranking first to fifth respectively the sa1 sa3 ar1 and ar3 environments together formed the third mega environment where the g5 g6 g4 and g16 genotypes won the ratio for the g2 in the first mega environment was 1 this ratio for the g16 in the second mega environment varied from 1 to 1 065 finally the ratio for the g5 in the third mega environment was large between 1 047 and 1 459 table 4 also shows the ranking of the five winner genotypes based on the ammif model which includes raw data only five of the ammi1 winner genotypes in the ammif model also won 3 2 combining features of ammi and blup techniques fig 2 shows a biplot where the grain yield is on the horizontal axis and the waasb values are on the vertical axis the lines perpendicular to these axes divide the biplot into four parts the first section contains the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes and the ma1 and ar1 environments these genotypes and environments performed lower than average grain yields and played the largest role in gei in the second quadrant genotypes g1 g8 and g14 and environments sa3 ma3 ma2 sa1 and za1 were present these points like the previous part played a bigger role in gei but their grain yield was good so these environments in quadrant ii deserve special attention since they provide above average production and high ability to discriminate genotypes the g7 g9 and g10 genotypes along with the sh1 sh2 sa2 za2 and ar2 environments were placed in the third section in this part the genotypes had low performance and high stability also the environments of this section along with low performance had less ability to discriminate because they had the lowest waasb values among all environments the za3 environment was exactly on the frontier of the first and third sections with low performance and moderate discriminate power finally the fourth part included the largest number of genotypes thus g2 g3 g11 g13 g12 g15 g16 and g17 genotypes with high performance and stability were the most desirable genotypes the g18 genotype was located on the border of the third and fourth quadrant meaning that the grain yield was equal to the total average and high stability also qa1 qa2 qa3 sh3 and ar3 environments were present in the fourth section which had high production capacity and less waasb fig 2 genotypes are grouped according to ipca rankings in fig 3 a although ipcas explain some of the changes independently they were divided into three groups ipca1 and ipca2 each in one group and other ipcas in the third group the ranking of some genotypes such as g4 g5 g6 g7 g15 g16 and g18 was almost the same in terms of these ipcas while other genotypes especially the g1 g2 g8 g9 g11 g12 g14 and g17 genotypes had different rankings so this can show the importance of using all ipcas the genotypes studied were also divided into four groups genotypes g3 g7 g15 g16 and g18 were in the first group with the lowest ipca ratings the second group included the g2 g9 g10 g12 g13 and g17 genotypes which had medium and low rankings genotypes g1 g8 g11 and g14 also had average and high rankings finally the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes had the highest ipca rankings and were the most unstable these results were entirely in agreement with the results of fig 2 the heat map shown in fig 3 b ranks the genotypes based on the waasb ratio to grain yield with different weights the left side of the figure gives more weight to stability and the right side gives more weight to grain yield this figure clearly shows how the genotype s rank changes as a result of applying different weights four groups of genotypes can be identified based on these rankings the first group genotypes especially the g16 genotype were in the best condition in terms of stability and yield these genotypes are then highly productive and broadly adapted since they ranks remains the same or similar independently on the weight given for mean performance or stability the second group of genotypes had low stability but high yield the genotypes of the third group unlike the second group had the desired stability but poor performance finally the fourth group genotypes especially the g4 g5 and g6 genotypes were the most undesirable genotypes in terms of both stability and yield fig 3b 3 3 partial least squares regression and factorial regression the first and second factors in the pls biplot explained 38 74 and 17 18 of the gei variance respectively factor1 was almost able to distinguish high yielding environments sa3 sa1 and ma3 from low yielding environment sh1 the results of pls analysis showed that rainfall is involved in gei in all months except october and december pls biplot have similar interpretations to ammi biplots environments sa3 and sh3 had the longest vectors and the highest rainfall values for the beginning and end of the season respectively while other environments did not have a significant increase in rainfall for some months and had a distribution close to the origin of this biplot genotypes 5 6 and 2 which won in the third mega environment were associated with rainfall in january february and march genotypes 7 8 10 and 11 which were mostly non winner genotypes were affected by rainfall in april may and june genotype 17 was also associated with november rainfall while other genotypes did not show a significant relationship with monthly rainfall fig 4 on the other hand the stepwise factorial regression model based on akaike s information criterion aic genotype by rainfall interaction in january may november april and december were significant respectively table 5 therefore rainfall during these months plays an important role in gei 4 discussion as expected we observed a very significant gei for barley grain yield such a result has been reported in almost all similar studies rodriguez et al 2008 mortazavian et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 vaezi et al 2019 the magnitude of the gei effect is primarily due to changes in environmental conditions from one place to another and from year to year the high yield in environments with more rainfall and also its low in environments with low rainfall show that the amount of rainfall under rainfed conditions is very decisive the high difference in precipitation in the years within the stations can challenge the reproducibility patterns of the results of multi environment trials met in addition to the amount the pattern of precipitation distribution during the growth stages is also important on the other hand part of the gei is due to genetic differences between the studied genotypes we found that ammi analysis is useful for this dataset because they have more ges the high ges over ssg showed the importance of using narrow adaptations while the high gen over ssg showed that we had to use primary ipcs to increase accuracy because they selectively capture the signal gauch 2013 the first two ipc were significant with the gollob s f test gollob 1968 which accounted for more than half of the total variance therefore studying the distribution of genotypes and environments based on these two components can provide interesting information the distribution of genotypes based on average yield and ipca1 scores is a suitable model for simultaneous evaluation of yield and stability the high dispersion of environments compared to genotypes in this plot indicates more variability and very high environmental diversity than genotypes oliveira et al 2014 significant positive correlation between mean yield of genotypes and ipca1 values indicates that medium yield genotypes are stable while high and low yield genotypes are somewhat unstable these results allow the use of broad and narrow adaptability of genotypes these two concepts of adaptation are the main approach of breeders in selecting genotypes during met so that broad adaptability is based on the average performance of genotypes in all environments while narrow adaptability selection is based on the average performance of genotypes in a subset of specific environments gauch et al 2008 the use of these two concepts and determining which genotypes have general and specific adaptability depends on the type of ammi model family determining the number of mega environments is difficult and complicated shahzad et al 2019 however previous research shows that using the ammi1 model in determining this group of environments can be useful mohammed et al 2016 paderewski et al 2016 hassani et al 2018 this is because ipca1 usually has a clear interpretation but as gauch 2013 has pointed out such interpretations may sometimes be subjective as in the present study we did not find a significant correlation between ipca1 scores and environmental measurements the superiority of genotype g2 in the largest mega environments indicates the high potential of check cultivars the superiority of genotype g16 in the second mega environment indicates that this line can replace the check cultivars in these environments however factors such as seed availability and cost of preparation can lead to the selection of genotype g2 in this mega environment in this regard paderewski et al 2016 have stated that various factors can lead to the recommendation of genotypes other than the winner the interesting thing is that genotypes g5 and g6 and to some extent genotype g4 won in the third mega environment because these genotypes had lower performance than the total average some researchers consider gei to be ineffective for genotypes with a low average yield which as we have seen may not be the case the advantage of using ipca1 is that it selectively records the signal the importance of this can be understood when 13 mega environments are detected with the ammif model such structures of data are false and impossible to interpret because they are mainly caused by idiosyncratic noise to show that ammi1 information can be used reliably we calculated the waasb index which is based on the blup technique and uses all ipcas olivoto et al 2019 the variation for most of the genotypes can be explained by the two first ipcas on the other hand for some genotypes more ipcas can be necessary to account for the variation in this case the waasb value can be used as a quantitative measure of stability that accounts for these changes for example based on the ipca1 scores g3 stability would be underestimated the results of this index were very similar to the results of ammi1 this is because ipca1 plays a larger role in the waasb calculation and more than half of ipcas behave similarly in genotype rankings in addition ipca accounted for 46 of the gei so it is expected a high correlation between ipca1 and waasb ranks when the explanation of ipca1 is low especially when there are too many possible axes the waasb index can be useful to account for the variance explained in other axes than ipca1 thus the blup technique can be useful in analyzing met data as has already been proven piepho 1994 simultaneous evaluation of yield and yield stability is very important so ranking genotypes based on different weights of the two can be more useful genotypes g12 g15 and g16 with high rankings were the most desirable genotypes based on different weights of yield and stability although genotypes g4 g5 and g6 were unfavorable in terms of yield and stability at different weights as we have seen they were among the winner genotypes in the third mega environment therefore the selection of genotypes based on performance and ipcas scores regardless of the mega environment pattern eliminates the opportunity to take advantage of narrow adaptation with the entry of external data i e monthly rainfall to the gei analysis it was found that rainfall in some months has no effect on the gei pattern identifying the most influential rainfall months in the gei can be useful in introducing stable genotypes for current and future conditions where the rainfall pattern is changing according to pls june rainfall was in the opposite direction to high yield genotypes and is negatively correlated with them in this regard abay and bjørnstad 2009 reported that rainfall this month has a negative effect on barley performance while rainfall in may has a significant positive relationship with yield in other plants it was reported that the genetic diversity index was significantly correlated with rainfall in june zhang et al 2018 however rainfall in june did not enter the factorial regression model slight differences between the pls and fr models in the introduction of covariates have already been observed mohammadi et al 2020 comparing the two methods it was found that rainfall in january may november and april affect the gei and researchers and farmers should pay attention to it rainfall in november and january seems to be important for germination and proper seedling establishment and rainfall in april and may is important for pollination and seed filling period under rainfed condition drought tolerant genotypes can be identified by comparing the specific adaptation pattern and rainfall data mortazavian et al 2014 but voltas et al 2005 after identifying the winning genotypes with gge biplot clarified the role of drought and other environmental factors affecting them by fr method this is because of the pattern of mega environments is not only affected by rainfall conditions and various known and unknown factors are effective in their formation such environmental factors have caused half of the places to be in different mega environments in three years while places with an altitude of over 1500 m were well placed in one mega environment every three years however the pattern of rainfall during different months was almost able to play its role in the formation of mega environments where the third mega environment in terms of rainfall was highest in january february and march 5 conclusions gei was significant for barley grain yield in cold rainfed areas of iran the ammi method and its combination with the blup technique made it possible to properly describe the gei genotype g2 which was one of the check cultivars won in most environments and is therefore recommended due to its easy access genotypes g12 g16 and g15 with high yield and stability can be considered as new genetic resources in barley breeding programs finally genotypes g4 g5 and g6 should only be used in narrow adaptations to specific environments rainfall in january may november and april entered the regression model with both pls and fr methods
