1400,diffusion coefficients for na was measured in low permeability samples diameter of 3 cm and average length of 7 cm from the deep disposal site of the siberian chemical combine scc using the end diffusion technique the direction of diffusion was perpendicular to the direction of bedding special equipment was designed and constructed for the experiment two types of concentration observations were used for non sorbing na ec sensors and the length distribution of sorbed elements were used the synthetic solution used in the experiments was a model of the low activity contaminant of the scc and consisted of nano3 25 g l and nitrate compounds of cs ni2 co2 and sr2 100 mg l each the measured values of the effective diffusion coefficients d e for na from 1 92 10 11 to 1 70 10 10 m2 s the microstructure was studied with x ray microtomography for the same cores image shooting was performed on undisturbed microsamples with a size of 0 913 mm 7003 vox spatial correlation analysis was performed after the binarization of each obtained 3 d structure this analysis showed that the spatial correlation scale of the indicator variogram is considerably smaller than the microsample length then a numerical simulation of the laplace equation with binary coefficients for each microsample was performed the results were analysed in the form of a plot of the tortuosity versus the porosity pore scale simulations show a nonlinear decrease in the tortuosity with decreasing porosity exponential values in the range between 1 8 and 2 4 were found by fitting this graph with archie s model anisotropic tortuosity is also detected in the horizontal and vertical directions the diffusion coefficients of non sorbing na measured in this study agree with those of the pore scale diffusion simulation of the microtomography data keywords tortuosity diffusion diffusivity microtomography diffusion simulation archie s law 1 introduction subsurface diffusion mass transfer may dominate over advection for a low groundwater flow velocity for example in low permeability rocks such as clays worldwide natural and human made barriers made of low permeability clay materials play an essential role in isolating radioactive waste in near surface disposal and deep geological nuclear waste disposal witherspoon and bodvarsson 2001 in the russian federation there are several sites for the injection of liquid radioactive waste lrw into deep aquifers rybalchenko et al 1998 in such facilities transport through low permeability formations which separates the deep waste injection zone from groundwater largely determines the possibility of disposal rybalchenko et al 1998 shestakov et al 2002 because of such sites long term potential environmental impact evaluating the role and scale of diffusive transport in clay formations is an important issue typically lrw injected into aquifers is a complex solution that includes many substances rybalchenko et al 1998 multicomponent diffusion models that consider electrostatic effects on the particles surface are the most appropriate models to describe the transport of such wastes in clayey rocks gimmi and alt epping 2018 wersin et al 2018 muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 glaus et al 2020 these models include free electro neutral porosity and electric double layer edl porosity experimental study and simulation of multicomponent solution in clays showed that the apparent diffusion coefficients for cations depend on the diffusion time and salinity of solution tertre et al 2015 but application of multicomponent models requires knowledge of many parameters and data for verification as is well known diffusion is the main transport process involved in the evolution of many nonequilibrium systems to equilibrium by brownian motion oliveira et al 2019 the classical diffusion equation in porous medium is based on fick s law in the last decades in the study of diffusion in many heterogeneous systems it has been repeatedly noted that the classical diffusion equation with a single constant effective diffusion coefficient does not always work satisfactorily berkowitz et al 2000 such inconsistent behavior of diffusing substances of the classical fick model is called anomalous diffusion oliveira et al 2019 anomalous has repeatedly been noted in systems with thin water layers diéz fernández et al 2020 or thin pore gao et al 2011 in diéz fernández et al 2020 the diffusion of a large molecule in a thin film of water confined between two silica surfaces was investigated using all atom molecular dynamics computer simulations this study shows that diffusion coefficient is found from the classical diffusive equation is not valid and the set of finite different brownian motions with different diffusivities is better approach in such a system in gao et al 2011 experiments with drug molecules it was shown that as the pore diameter increases from 3 6 nm to 12 6 nm the overall diffusion rate increases due to an increase in the central part of the pore associated with classical diffusion also in the analysis of breakthrough curves in heterogeneous medium the concept of non fickian transport associated with scale dependent dispersion is introduced berkowitz et al 2000 levy and berkowitz 2003 bijeljic et al 2011 cherstvy et al 2014 bodrova et al 2015 early breakthrough times and long tails in field and laboratory transport experiments do not always fit well with the advective dispersion equation ade the continuous time random walk ctrw approach for quantifying transport is a more universal which that does not rely on fick s transport assumptions despite the growing popularity of multicomponent diffusion models and the use of model dynamics approaches to describe diffusion transport the classical approach based on fick s equation is still extremely popular in the analysis of diffusion processes in subsurface medium to obtain a correct value for the diffusion coefficient laborious laboratory experiments or in situ field scale monitoring gimmi et al 2014 of contaminant distribution in low permeability rocks are needed it should be noted that laboratory experiments are mostly carried out on small samples due to the slow transfer of substances and optimal time that does not allow for rock heterogeneity diffusion studies on low permeability soil performed by various authors in laboratories had a thickness of 1 5 2 сm for shale and limestone cavé et al 2009 a thickness of 1 1 cm for the opalinus clay in switzerland van loon et al 2003 and thicknesses between 0 48 and 1 cm for mudstone barone et al 1992 and limestones boving and grathwohl 2001 another way to obtain values of diffusion coefficients is to use the values of rock analogues reported in literature or apply empirical semiempirical and theoretical models of the porosity tortuosity relations shen and chen 2007 matyka et al 2008 pisani 2011 which relate the diffusion coefficient in porous medium with its value in free aqueous solution and medium porosity the idea of using theoretical models that relate the diffusion coefficient to porosity in porous media is based on the standard approach to deriving effective parameters of transport laws conductivity diffusion conductive heat transfer etc in a binary in physical properties medium consisting of a solid phase and a free pore volume the flux is proportional to the potential gradient multiplied by the local coefficient which depends on the medium s properties at a given point therefore the effective parameters are the laplace equation s coefficients for an effective homogeneous medium which are sought from equality of the average flux in the binary and effective mediums a classic example of this approach is d k maxwell s result for an effective electrical conductivity of medium with inclusion with one conductivity of the medium and another conductivity of inclusions a similar analysis can be performed using granular medium models in which the solid phase inclusions is diffusively impermeable and diffusion occurs in an aqueous solution that fills the pores an example of this approach to estimating a granular medium s effective diffusion coefficient can be found in the literature liasneuski et al 2014 hlushkou et al 2015 hlushkou and tallarek 2018 röding 2018 huang et al 2019 however analytical dependencies are usually developed for simplified inclusions shapes sphere and ellipsoid and do not consider the medium connectivity pores essential geometrical parameter as a result such analytical results can predict the relationship between the diffusion coefficients and porosity only for a sufficiently small concentration in the solid phase which assumes large porosity at low porosity values this approach may lead to ambiguous results in a natural porous medium transport occurs under a small porosity due to the pore s connectivity popular empirical models are related to the effective transport parameters and the porosity of rock the first such model was archie s law archie 1942 glover 2016 which is based on an approximation of a saturated porous medium s electrical conductivity data there is no strong theoretical justification for this approximation therefore these models contain empirical parameters that generally different for various rocks many papers have recently been published on the study of effective transport parameters using 3 d microtomography for different types of soils and rocks the effective parameters were obtained for heat transfer fluid flow etc using sample microtomography development with it the three dimensional structure of heterogeneity and next pore scale simulation of transport phenomenon nakashima et al 2008 nakashima and nakano 2012 blunt et al 2013 the overall goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between the diffusion coefficient and porosity of low permeable rocks and develop an approach for predicting diffusion properties from microtomography data the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 experimentally determine for undisturbed low permeability samples the diffusion coefficients and accessible porosity in conditions close to scc 2 pore scale simulation of diffusion in porous media using microtomography results of these samples 3 verification of pore scale modeling results by performed lab scale experiments 4 analysis of applicability of widely known semiempirical dependences of porosity and tortuosity relation using data from pore scale simulations 2 theoretical background 2 1 diffusion and tortuosity of a porous medium the rate of flow of the diffusive substance is proportional to the concentration gradient one dimensional diffusion flux j l tl2 through a unit transverse area in a porous medium at constant temperature and pressure is described by fick s law 1 j d e dc dx where dc dx is the concentration gradient negative in the diffusion direction c is the pollutant concentration in the solution m l3 x is the distance l and d e is the effective diffusion coefficient in a porous saturated medium l2 t the transition from the aqueous diffusion coefficient d w to the porous medium effective diffusion coefficient is generally expressed by boving and grathwohl 2001 2 d e d w ε acc δ τ d w d where ε acc is the accessible porosity τ is the tortuosity δ is the constrictivity introduced for rock in which there are particles with a diameter less than 1 μm grathwohl 1998 d ε acc δ τ is the relative diffusivity or diffusivity the tortuosity τ 1 is a parameter that reflects the geometry of the pores and is expressed by epstein 1989 3 τ l c l 2 where l is the shortest distance between two points along the direction of mass transfer l and l c is the actual average length of the pore channel l expression 3 is applicable for homogeneous isotropic porous media the literature petersen 1958 shows that the tortuosity can accept an abnormally small value in a porous medium with different pore diameters in a real porous medium homogeneity and isotropy are not observed therefore empirical functions are calculated which include the porosity and tortuosity eq 3 the similarity of ohm s law and fick s law allows to express the diffusivity by the following empirical relationship 4 d a ε m where a and m are empirical parameters that depend on the geometry of the pores parameter m is the sedimentary rock cementation factor grathwohl 1998 typical values for m vary in a range from 1 8 to 2 4 for consolidated formations archie 1942 and are approximately 1 3 for unconsolidated deposits additionally it is customary to assume that when the porosity ε is lower than 0 2 the parameter is higher than 2 the parameter a is usually set to 1 shen and chen 2007 which also not violates the actual physical behavior when the porosity is 0 and the tortuosity is equal to 0 empirical archie s law relates the electrical resistivity of rocks ρ depending on the resistivity of the solution ρ w using follows klinkenberg 1951 5 ρ ρ w a ε m it should be noted that despite the mathematical analogy of ohm s and fick s laws the parameter m is not necessarily the same in eqs 4 and 5 because the diffusion tortuosity may not coincide with the electrical tortuosity liu and kitanidis 2013 2 2 diffusion transport the one dimensional one species diffusion process that occurs in the samples can be characterized by the diffusion model with equilibrium sorption henry s linear sorption isotherm boving and grathwohl 2001 6 d e 2 c x 2 ε acc k d ρ c t parameter ε acc k d ρ is usually called the capacity factor α product k d ρ is called the dimensionless distribution coefficient k d and if it equals zero there is no sorption i e the component is non sorbing then the capacity factor α is equal to the accessible porosity ε acc the ratios of d e α and d e ε acc are usually known as the apparent d a and pore d p diffusion coefficients respectively 7 d a d w ε acc ε acc k d ρ τ d e α d p d w ε acc ε acc τ d e ε acc using model 6 and definition 7 to process the experimental data for diffusion in samples it is possible to obtain a relationship between the effective diffusion parameter and the porosity of the sample size based on the level of averaging 3 materials 3 1 sample preparation and description the samples were cut from the seven cores taken from two wells at the boundary of the scc from depths of 200 400 m furthermore in this text the sample number is its depth of extraction according to mineralogical analysis the rocks were continental origin siltstone mudstone the average primary mineral content was 50 which indicated that the transformation into the clay was unfinished and the remaining mineral content of 35 to 50 among which mainly kaolinite and hydromica smectites represented a low cation exchange capacity cec detailed data on the mineral composition determined by x ray diffraction xrd quantitative analysis are shown in table 1 defined minerals were divided into two groups sorbing and almost not sorbing the total porosity of the samples was determined by the summation of the porosity values obtained by sem images using the stiman 3 d program sokolov et al 2007 and kt microtomography data for that the part of porosity formed by pores in the range of effective diameters from the maximum determined by sem images to the maximum possible for a particular sample was determined by microtomography data and summed up with the porosity according to sem images in addition the total porosity of the samples under study was determined by solids density ρs and bulk density ρd table 2 solids density was determined by pycnometric testing the hydrostatic weighing method was used to determine the bulk density using the experimentally determined values of densities the values of total porosity were calculated the total porosity values obtained by summation were about 10 lower than the porosity values calculated from the densities table 2 allowing this approach to be used to determine the porosity of low permeability clay sediments with limited rock content fifteen samples with a diameter of 3 cm were prepared for diffusion experiments the thickness of the sample varied between 5 2 and 8 1 cm a circular saw and a grinder were used to shape the samples the rock samples were then mounted into an epoxy glue ring epoxy glue was filled to achieve good contact with the samples and to provide an air tight and a water tight fit next four electrode conductivity sensors were installed along the samples each 2 cm and were then connected to the conductivity meter expert 002 econix expert ltd through the switchboard conductivity sensors were based on audio jack 2 5 mm connectors the sensors were calibrated before the experiment and showed a linear relationship between the concentration and conductivity 3 2 sample 3 d microtomography microtomography scanning was carried out on six undisturbed core samples with dimensions of 3 3 3 mm3 with a microtomography tdm 1000h ii scanner sets of 700 images were received from the resulting scans each image resolution was 700 700 pixels the captured size of the samples reached up to 0 91 0 91 0 91 mm3 and one voxel size was 0 00133 mm3 further work with a volumetric data matrix should be performed on the binary system to clearly separate the solid rock matrix and pore space of the sample the most problematic aspect is that the choice of the binarization threshold level is unclear due to their finite size and square shape voxels cannot represent a real phase boundary a single voxel can often be structurally heterogeneous in natural environments that is the structural element size is less than the microtomography method resolution most voxels in these images usually contain several phases and have an average x ray density therefore the phase interface has a smooth transition and cannot be set in a definite way the authors used three binarization threshold levels the closest level to the real boundary between phases and undervalued and overvalued levels fig 1 therefore three similar microtomography matrixes were obtained with different values for the total porosity to determine the empirical dependencies this displays almost the entire range of sedimentary rock porosities the resulting set of black and white raster images with a bmp format was transferred into an indicator function matrix i x y z the matrix consisted of ones and zeros i 1 if the voxel with coordinates x y z is in the pore space and i 0 if it is in the rock matrix the transfer was carried out by reading each pixel in the image determining its bit depth colour and assigning it a value of 0 or 1 according to the bmp file format colour table palette eighteen indicator matrix functions i x y z for the six samples were received the indicator function expected value is the porosity mean value of the image in the selected binarization threshold level of undervalued real overvalued the porosity for each threshold level is shown in table 3 next a correlation analysis was performed for a three dimensional matrix microstructure fig 2a by constructing the indicator variograms in three directions the sgems software package wu et al 2008 was used to determine the characteristic scale of the spatial correlation of the sample s binary structure such an analysis allows for the allocation of a representative elementary volume rev which is characterized by the distance at which the indicator variogram is constant i e it reaches the sill 3 3 spatial correlation analysis experimental indicator semivariograms were built in the three orthogonal directions x y z next the theoretical exponential variogram was approximated which showed fig 2b a microstructure with small anisotropy in the horizontal direction x y versus the vertical z direction the semivariograms for the x and y directions were similar indicating a lack of plane anisotropy the characteristic correlation scale of the investigated structures amounted to 18 voxels for the horizontal direction x y and 16 voxels for the vertical z direction that is the representative elementary volume rev medium for this sample was approximately equal to 183 voxels considering the rev value for simulated diffusion a binary structure minimum volume of 175 175 175 voxels which has a greater magnitude than the rev was selected this allowed us to cut each structure into a three dimensional microstructure with a total matrix on the 43 64 micro matrix the full porosity average value ε is determine by averaging the indicator function for each micro matrix 4 methods 4 1 estimation of the diffusion parameters based on an analysis of the published literature on the experimental determination of diffusion and distribution coefficients boving and grathwohl 2001 van loon et al 2003 the model of the diffusion experiment is developed with a multicomponent solution consisting of a non active tracer the main salt and sorbed microcomponents fig 3 because of the different rates of diffusion for the sorbed and non sorbing components using two types of observations is proposed continuous x const in time recording the change in the concentration of the main salt at several points along the length of the sample by measuring the electrical conductivity in situ and discrete t const where the distribution of the concentrations of all the sorbed elements along the length are obtained after the experiment the accessible porosity ε aсс is obtained by equating the concentrations of the neutral component in the diffusion solution with the concentrations of the component in the sample at the end of the mass diffusion transfer as a result the pore diffusion coefficient d p of the non sorbed component is determined for continuous data and the apparent diffusion coefficients d a of the sorbed elements are determined for the discrete data from which distribution coefficients k d are obtained assuming that sorption is carried out for henry s isotherm 4 2 diffusion experimental setup the experimental setup was designed and assembled to determine transport properties diffusion coefficient distribution coefficient accessible porosity as shown in fig 4 fittings for pvc pipes and simple hardware were used for making the setup the diffusion tank had a volume of approximately 1 5 l according to preliminary calculations only 1 2 of the weight of the species from the tank volume could diffuse into the sample therefore the mass loss in the tank was ignored before the experiments the samples were saturated with distilled water the use of distilled water is explained by the spread of ultra fresh waters in the area scc saturation took place under vacuum conditions on the upper boundary 0 3 mbar and a fixed head 200 cm on the lower boundary the saturation was carried out until the appearance of water on the top of the sample the saturation time lasted for 10 12 days at the end of the saturation the top butt of the sample was insulated with paraffin to prevent evaporation during the diffusion experiment after saturating the sample and paraffinizing the top butt a constant concentration dirichlet boundaries was set at the lower boundary of the water saturated sample and impermeable boundary conditions neumann boundaries were placed on the top piezometers maintained a zero hydraulic gradient to avoid advective transport 4 3 diffusion solution for the diffusion experiment the solution prevailing in the scc was modelled the synthetic solution used in the experiments was a model of the low activity contaminant of the scc and consisted of nano3 294 1 mmol l and nitrate compounds cs 0 75 mmol l ni2 1 70 mmol l co2 1 70 mmol l and sr2 1 14 mmol l the ph of the synthetic solution was 6 70 it is expected that the macrocomponent na is a sorbed cation in accordance with the langmuir type isotherm its concentration at the boundary 294 1 mmol l is much greater than the sorption capacity of the studied sediments therefore in a wide range of relative concentrations it can be considered non sorbing because its expected k d is tending to zero however at the same time sodium ion occupies most of the sorption capacity of the rock in the diffusion process then the sorption of other microcomponent cations on the base of sorbed sodium follows henry s law their k d is constant and does not depend on concentration 4 4 data processing during the experiment the change in the conductivity of the solution and the temperature in the laboratory was recorded every 30 min for each conductometric sensor at the end of the experiment the samples were cut perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder into 1 cm thick disks determination of na macrocomponent concentrations along the length was performed by flame photometry using aqueous extracts from the disks for this purpose 5 g of rock was mixed with 25 ml of distilled water and shaken for 180 s the resulting suspension was separated by filtration the background concentration of sodium ion was determined by similar method in core residues 4 5 diffusion steady state simulation on pore scale steady state diffusion was simulated in each binary micro matrix to estimate the diffusivity using the laplace equation 8 x d x y z c x y d x y z c y z d x y z c z 0 where d is the model diffusion coefficient c is the concentration and x y and z are spatial coordinates the diffusion coefficient in every cell was assigned according to the indicator value of the corresponding cell in the binary matrixes 9 d x y z 1 0 000001 i 1 i 0 the rock matrix diffusion coefficient value was set to a considerably lower value than the pore diffusion coefficient the rock matrix diffusion coefficient value was set to a nonzero value due to numerical reasons for avoiding the full isolated patterns during the simulation most likely screening effects of isolated sites from the rock matrix could lead to violations of the numerical solution of equation eq 8 for every matrix the effective diffusion coefficients were determined in three directions parallel to the main model axes x y and z fig 5 for every d determination a constant concentration was set up on the opposite boundaries dirichlet boundaries of the model to provide a gradient in the target direction no flow boundaries were set on the other four sides newmann boundaries the total number of transport models for the diffusional transfer calculation 64 3 192 simulations was performed for every sample the modflow 2005 code was used for the diffusion simulations which allowed the laplace equation eq 8 to be solved with heterogeneous coefficients for the large grid the gmg solver was used due to its stability harbaugh et al 2000 and good convergence for a large computation mesh in the capacity of the boundary conditions on one boundary the migrant concentration was set to c 0 0 and c l 1 on the opposite boundary depending on whether the direction of the diffusion flux l simulated is x y or z the other four model boundaries were set to impermeable boundaries the simulation result for each micro matrix is the mass flux between the specified concentration boundaries the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium was determined as 10 d e q fi с where q is the mass flux through the model f is the model transverse area and i с is the model concentration gradient applied at the constant concentration boundaries since the model used dimensionless diffusion coefficients it was suggested that the model diffusion coefficient d of the pores is equal to the solution diffusion coefficient d w therefore in accordance with eq 2 the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium equals the diffusivity the respective tortuosity can be calculated by dividing the diffusivity or effective diffusion coefficient by the average porosity value for a specific micro matrix 11 d d w d e d τ d e ε for every d e determination the constant head was set up for the opposite boundaries of the model c 1 for the source boundary and c 0 for the sink to provide a concentration gradient in the target direction 5 results 5 1 lab scale results in the following in connection with the specific purposes of this study the processing of the laboratory experiments only for the unsorbed tracer only is given the duration of the diffusion experiments for different samples ranged from 77 to 247 days the temperature in laboratory was held between 19 and 21 c throughout the entire measurement period the processing of the experimental breakthrough curves was carried out using the analytical solution for an finite medium crank 1975 with a given concentration at the entrance of the boundary fig 3 12 с i

the index fig 6a presents experimental data with temperature compensation obtained from conductometric sensors and fitted lines from the analytical model eq 12 the analysis of the plots showed that for the samples with the experiment time of 247 days the relative concentration of na ions reached a maximum which indicated that the diffusion transport for the non sorbing component was complete to calculate the tortuosity values of accessible porosity selected were used table 4 and the value of diffusion coefficient in aqueous medium for na was taken as 1 33 10 5 m2 s appelo and postma 2006 based on layer by layer distribution of sodium ions along the length of the samples in 1 cm steps after the experiments the accessible porosity was determined by the following expression 13 ε acc с na

accessible porosity and ρ d is the bulk density m l3 the na concentration value in the initial solution was added to the plot 294 1 mmol l at x 0 fig 6b the pore diffusion coefficients d p and accessible porosity ε acc were determined and are given in table 4 processing of the layer by layer distributions shows an increase in the concentration along the length of the samples with increasing time which agrees well with the theoretical ideas fig 6b significant differences in the accessible porosity 0 2 0 3 may be related to the heterogeneity of the well core 378 5 from which samples were cut the determined values of accessible porosity were on average half as much as the porosity values determined computationally through bulk densities and rock solids as well as from sem images and kt tomography 5 2 pore scale simulation results the obtained values of the diffusivity in three orthogonal directions for the investigated samples are shown in fig 7a and b the plots illustrate the nonlinear expansion of the diffusivity from the porosity which is well matched with the theoretical concepts and experimental work the existence of the empty intervals on the plots between the model diffusivity values fig 7b shows that there are no matrixes with such porosity values in the selected threshold binarization levels the data show the vertical anisotropy which is also confirmed by the above variogram analysis archie s law eq 4 with a 1 fig 7a and b is used to describe the relationship between the diffusivity and the porosity of the micro matrix theoretical curves are plotted using autofitting by minimizing the determination coefficient for the cementation parameter m with a fixed value of parameter a equal to 1 the fitted curves show that archie s law effectively describes the model diffusivity fig 7a and b 5 3 comparison of lab and pore scale results to verify the obtained simulated results some experimentally obtained values for the diffusivity are illustrated in fig 8a and b which shows the comparison for four core samples with x y and z directions in these figures the best fit of the experimental data for different directions and simulated data are shown that is the display experimental data and simulated data were taken correctly this result allows the use of tortuosity values obtained by simulation on microtomography data for subsequent comparison with various analytical and empirical models 5 4 experimental tortuosity versus analytical and empirical models an analysis was carried out to match the obtained model diffusivity values with the previously published analytical table 5 and empirical models table 6 and with archie s law with the free factor a the results of which are shown in figs 9 and 10 these models were mainly designed for structures consisting of spherical forms which did not fully reflect the structure of natural media figs 9 and 10 show the tortuosity porosity relations from tables 4 and 5 from the literature shen and chen 2007 these models were given for different physical systems that mainly used sphere packing additionally empirical eq 17c was added with a 3 for clay silt sediments from the literature matyka et al 2008 and semi analytical expression 11 was added pisani 2011 with a 1 07 for packing consisting of large parallelepipeds the plotted empirical curves describe the model results better than the analytical models but in general they overestimate the values up to a porosity of 0 2 0 3 with the exception of the models in the literature lerman 1979 pisani 2011 for porosities greater than 0 2 0 3 the situation is reversed it is clear that the model from the literature lerman 1979 with the value of the coefficient k 1 is degraded into the model of archie s law with the free coefficient a as a result for the determination of the empirical coefficients three models are taken that show the best approximation of the results the model of archie s law with a free and fixed a coefficient and the pisani model pisani 2011 the curves selected for some samples and directions are shown in fig 11a and b and the final values of the empirical coefficients are shown in table 7 the obtained average values of the empirical coefficients for different directions agree well with the data from other researchers for archie s law with a fixed factor a the cementation parameter varies from 2 20 to 2 54 and parameter а agrees perfectly with the model calculations given in the literature pisani 2011 6 conclusion and summary this paper introduces a method for determining the relations between the porosity and diffusion tortuosity of low permeability clay deposits for the further calculation of the diffusion coefficients of a porous medium that is hard to determine by experimental means this analysis is based on three dimensional data for the microstructure of undisturbed rock samples obtained with x ray microtomography and the subsequent transformation of these data into a binary model of diffusion coefficients as a result of the stationary diffusion simulation in a binary medium the diffusion flux averaged by a representative volume is obtained and the tortuosity is calculated at a known porosity the diffusion experiment obtained estimates for the diffusion coefficient of the main unsorbed element sodium ion the diffusion coefficient na was obtained for conductometric sensors and the concentration distributions along the length of the samples in the range from 1 92 10 11 to 1 70 10 10 m2 s with the porosity of investigated samples 0 13 0 43 which takes from 45 to 90 of their total porosity well known analytical and empirical expressions were used to obtain an approximation of the model diffusivity as a result three empirical models were selected which showed the best match with the results of the numerical simulation the empirical coefficients obtained for the empirical models were determined in three directions x y stratification and z perpendicular to layering and dropped into the range of values for low permeable sediments presented in the literature for archie s law with a fixed factor a 1 the value m ranged from 2 2 2 5 for archie s law with a free factor a the parameter a was 1 49 3 22 and m 2 50 2 85 and for the model pisani 2011 the parameter а changed in the range of 1 07 1 18 the analysis of the spatial correlation structure of the binarized three dimensional tomographic model of the studied samples showed that they have anisotropy expressed in excess of the horizontal correlation scale over the vertical one which leads to the anisotropy of the tortuosity and as a result to the anisotropy of the diffusion coefficient a comparison of the values of diffusivity were obtained on two scales and the scale of the elementary representative volume simulation and the scale of the sample experiment were a good match which testified to the validity of the obtained results and to the possibility of using each of the approaches separately it is important to note that the diffusion tortuosity obtained by this method has a volumetric character which gives a more accurate picture than the planned tortuosity determined from sem images additionally the resolution of the tomograph allowed us to obtain a model of the microstructure with pores larger than 1 μm improving the accuracy of shooting the images will allow for thin interparticle micropores 1 μm the presence of which is likely to increase the diffusion tortuosity thus the calculated diffusion coefficients of the porous medium will be less than that of the real value in conclusion it should be noted that unfortunately the samples used were partially dried during transportation and storage of the well core this may have led to some damages to the natural structure of the samples therefore the obtained parameter estimates may differ from their values in situ declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

microstructure was studied with x ray microtomography for the same cores image shooting was performed on undisturbed microsamples with a size of 0 913 mm 7003 vox spatial correlation analysis was performed after the binarization of each obtained 3 d structure this analysis showed that the spatial correlation scale of the indicator variogram is considerably smaller than the microsample length then a numerical simulation of the laplace equation with binary coefficients for each microsample was performed the results were analysed in the form of a plot of the tortuosity versus the porosity pore scale simulations show a nonlinear decrease in the tortuosity with decreasing porosity exponential values in the range between 1 8 and 2 4 were found by fitting this graph with archie s model anisotropic tortuosity is also detected in the horizontal and vertical directions the diffusion coefficients of non sorbing na measured in this study agree with those of the pore scale diffusion

advection for a low groundwater flow velocity for example in low permeability rocks such as clays worldwide natural and human made barriers made of low permeability clay materials play an essential role in isolating radioactive waste in near surface disposal and deep geological nuclear waste disposal witherspoon and bodvarsson 2001 in the russian federation there are several sites for the injection of liquid radioactive waste lrw into deep aquifers rybalchenko et al 1998 in such facilities transport through low permeability formations which separates the deep waste injection zone from groundwater largely determines the possibility of disposal rybalchenko et al 1998 shestakov et al 2002 because of such sites long term potential environmental impact evaluating the role and scale of diffusive transport in clay formations is an important issue typically lrw injected into aquifers is a complex solution that includes many substances rybalchenko et al 1998 multicomponent diffusion models that consider electrostatic effects on the particles surface are the most appropriate models to describe the transport of such wastes in clayey rocks gimmi and alt epping 2018 wersin et al 2018 muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 glaus et al 2020 these models include free electro neutral porosity and electric double layer edl porosity experimental study and simulation of multicomponent solution in clays showed that the apparent diffusion coefficients for cations depend on the diffusion time and salinity of solution tertre et al 2015 but application of multicomponent models requires knowledge of many parameters and data for verification as is well known diffusion is the main transport process involved in the evolution of many nonequilibrium systems to equilibrium by brownian motion oliveira et al 2019 the classical diffusion equation in porous medium is based on fick s law in the last decades in the study of diffusion in many heterogeneous systems it has been repeatedly noted that the classical diffusion equation with a single constant effective diffusion coefficient does not always work satisfactorily berkowitz et al 2000 such inconsistent behavior of diffusing substances of the classical fick model is called anomalous diffusion oliveira et al 2019 anomalous has repeatedly been noted in systems with thin water layers diéz fernández et al 2020 or thin pore gao et al 2011 in diéz fernández et al 2020 the diffusion of a large molecule in a thin film of water confined between two silica surfaces was investigated using all atom molecular dynamics computer simulations this study shows that diffusion coefficient is found from the classical diffusive equation is not valid and the set of finite different brownian motions with different diffusivities is better approach in such a system in gao et al 2011 experiments with drug molecules it was shown that as the pore diameter increases from 3 6 nm to 12 6 nm the overall diffusion rate increases due to an increase in the central part of the pore associated with classical diffusion also in the analysis of breakthrough curves in heterogeneous medium the concept of non fickian transport associated with scale dependent dispersion is introduced berkowitz et al 2000 levy and berkowitz 2003 bijeljic et al 2011 cherstvy et al 2014 bodrova et al 2015 early breakthrough times and long tails in field and laboratory transport experiments do not always fit well with the advective dispersion equation ade the continuous time random walk ctrw approach for quantifying transport is a more universal which that does not rely on fick s transport assumptions despite the growing popularity of multicomponent diffusion models and the use of model dynamics approaches to describe diffusion transport the classical approach based on fick s equation is still extremely popular in the analysis of diffusion processes in subsurface medium to obtain a correct value for the diffusion coefficient laborious laboratory experiments or in situ field scale monitoring gimmi et al 2014 of contaminant distribution in low permeability rocks are needed it should be noted that laboratory experiments are mostly carried out on small samples due to the slow transfer of substances and optimal time that does not allow for rock heterogeneity diffusion studies on low permeability soil performed by various authors in laboratories had a thickness of 1 5 2 сm for shale and limestone cavé et al 2009 a thickness of 1 1 cm for the opalinus clay in switzerland van loon et al 2003 and thicknesses between 0 48 and 1 cm for mudstone barone et al 1992 and limestones boving and grathwohl 2001 another way to obtain values of diffusion coefficients is to use the values of rock analogues reported in literature or apply empirical semiempirical and theoretical models of the porosity tortuosity relations shen and chen 2007 matyka et al 2008 pisani 2011 which relate the diffusion coefficient in porous medium with its value in free aqueous solution and medium porosity the idea of using theoretical models that relate the diffusion coefficient to porosity in porous media is based on the standard approach to deriving effective parameters of transport laws conductivity diffusion conductive heat transfer etc in a binary in physical properties medium consisting of a solid phase and a free pore volume the flux is proportional to the potential gradient multiplied by the local coefficient which depends on the medium s properties at a given point therefore the effective parameters are the laplace equation s coefficients for an effective homogeneous medium which are sought from equality of the average flux in the binary and effective mediums a classic example of this approach is d k maxwell s result for an effective electrical conductivity of medium with inclusion with one conductivity of the medium and another conductivity of inclusions a similar analysis can be performed using granular medium models in which the solid phase inclusions is diffusively impermeable and diffusion occurs in an aqueous solution that fills the pores an example of this approach to estimating a granular medium s effective diffusion coefficient can be found in the literature liasneuski et al 2014 hlushkou et al 2015 hlushkou and tallarek 2018 röding 2018 huang et al 2019 however analytical dependencies are usually developed for simplified inclusions shapes sphere and ellipsoid and do not consider the medium connectivity pores essential geometrical parameter as a result such analytical results can predict the relationship between the diffusion coefficients and porosity only for a sufficiently small concentration in the solid phase which assumes large porosity at low porosity values this approach may lead to ambiguous results in a natural porous medium transport occurs under a small porosity due to the pore s connectivity popular empirical models are related to the effective transport parameters and the porosity of rock the first such model was archie s law archie 1942 glover 2016 which is based on an approximation of a saturated porous medium s electrical conductivity data there is no strong theoretical justification for this approximation therefore these models contain empirical parameters that generally different for various rocks many papers have recently been published on the study of effective transport parameters using 3 d microtomography for different types of soils and rocks the effective parameters were obtained for heat transfer fluid flow etc using sample microtomography development with it the three dimensional structure of heterogeneity and next pore scale simulation of transport phenomenon nakashima et al 2008 nakashima and nakano 2012 blunt et al 2013 the overall goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between the diffusion coefficient and porosity of low permeable rocks and develop an approach for predicting diffusion properties from microtomography data the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 experimentally determine for undisturbed low permeability samples the diffusion coefficients and accessible porosity in conditions close to scc 2 pore scale simulation of diffusion in porous media using microtomography results of these samples 3 verification of pore scale modeling results by performed lab scale experiments 4 analysis of applicability of widely known semiempirical dependences of porosity and tortuosity relation using data from pore scale simulations 2 theoretical background 2 1 diffusion and tortuosity of a porous medium the rate of flow of the diffusive substance is proportional to the concentration gradient one dimensional diffusion flux j l tl2 through a unit transverse area in a porous medium at constant temperature and pressure is described by fick s law 1 j d e dc dx where dc dx is the concentration gradient negative in the diffusion direction c is the pollutant concentration in the solution m l3 x is the distance l and d e is the effective diffusion coefficient in a porous saturated medium l2 t the transition from the aqueous diffusion coefficient d w to the porous medium effective diffusion coefficient is generally expressed by boving and grathwohl 2001 2 d e d w ε acc δ τ d w d where ε acc is the accessible porosity τ is the tortuosity δ is the constrictivity introduced for rock in which there are particles with a diameter less than 1 μm grathwohl 1998 d ε acc δ τ is the relative diffusivity or diffusivity the tortuosity τ 1 is a parameter that reflects the geometry of the pores and is expressed by epstein 1989 3 τ l c l 2 where l is the shortest distance between two points along the direction of mass transfer l and l c is the actual average length of the pore channel l expression 3 is applicable for homogeneous isotropic porous media the literature petersen 1958 shows that the tortuosity can accept an abnormally small value in a porous medium with different pore diameters in a real porous medium homogeneity and isotropy are not observed therefore empirical functions are calculated which include the porosity and tortuosity eq 3 the similarity of ohm s law and fick s law allows to express the diffusivity by the following empirical relationship 4 d a ε m where a and m are empirical parameters that depend on the geometry of the pores parameter m is the sedimentary rock cementation factor grathwohl 1998 typical values for m vary in a range from 1 8 to 2 4 for consolidated formations archie 1942 and are approximately 1 3 for unconsolidated deposits additionally it is customary to assume that when the porosity ε is lower than 0 2 the parameter is higher than 2 the parameter a is usually set to 1 shen and chen 2007 which also not violates the actual physical behavior when the porosity is 0 and the tortuosity is equal to 0 empirical archie s law relates the electrical resistivity of rocks ρ depending on the resistivity of the solution ρ w using follows klinkenberg 1951 5 ρ ρ w a ε m it should be noted that despite the mathematical analogy of ohm s and fick s laws the parameter m is not necessarily the same in eqs 4 and 5 because the diffusion tortuosity may not coincide with the electrical tortuosity liu and kitanidis 2013 2 2 diffusion transport the one dimensional one species diffusion process that occurs in the samples can be characterized by the diffusion model with equilibrium sorption henry s linear sorption isotherm boving and grathwohl 2001 6 d e 2 c x 2 ε acc k d ρ c t parameter ε acc k d ρ is usually called the capacity factor α product k d ρ is called the dimensionless distribution coefficient k d and if it equals zero there is no sorption i e the component is non sorbing then the capacity factor α is equal to the accessible porosity ε acc the ratios of d e α and d e ε acc are usually known as the apparent d a and pore d p diffusion coefficients respectively 7 d a d w ε acc ε acc k d ρ τ d e α d p d w ε acc ε acc τ d e ε acc using model 6 and definition 7 to process the experimental data for diffusion in samples it is possible to obtain a relationship between the effective diffusion parameter and the porosity of the sample size based on the level of averaging 3 materials 3 1 sample preparation and description the samples were cut from the seven cores taken from two wells at the boundary of the scc from depths of 200 400 m furthermore in this text the sample number is its depth of extraction according to mineralogical analysis the rocks were continental origin siltstone mudstone the average primary mineral content was 50 which indicated that the transformation into the clay was unfinished and the remaining mineral content of 35 to 50 among which mainly kaolinite and hydromica smectites represented a low cation exchange capacity cec detailed data on the mineral composition determined by x ray diffraction xrd quantitative analysis are shown in table 1 defined minerals were divided into two groups sorbing and almost not sorbing the total porosity of the samples was determined by the summation of the porosity values obtained by sem images using the stiman 3 d program sokolov et al 2007 and kt microtomography data for that the part of porosity formed by pores in the range of effective diameters from the maximum determined by sem images to the maximum possible for a particular sample was determined by microtomography data and summed up with the porosity according to sem images in addition the total porosity of the samples under study was determined by solids density ρs and bulk density ρd table 2 solids density was determined by pycnometric testing the hydrostatic weighing method was used to determine the bulk density using the experimentally determined values of densities the values of total porosity were calculated the total porosity values obtained by summation were about 10 lower than the porosity values calculated from the densities table 2 allowing this approach to be used to determine the porosity of low permeability clay sediments with limited rock content fifteen samples with a diameter of 3 cm were prepared for diffusion experiments the thickness of the sample varied between 5 2 and 8 1 cm a circular saw and a grinder were used to shape the samples the rock samples were then mounted into an epoxy glue ring epoxy glue was filled to achieve good contact with the samples and to provide an air tight and a water tight fit next four electrode conductivity sensors were installed along the samples each 2 cm and were then connected to the conductivity meter expert 002 econix expert ltd through the switchboard conductivity sensors were based on audio jack 2 5 mm connectors the sensors were calibrated before the experiment and showed a linear relationship between the concentration and conductivity 3 2 sample 3 d microtomography microtomography scanning was carried out on six undisturbed core samples with dimensions of 3 3 3 mm3 with a microtomography tdm 1000h ii scanner sets of 700 images were received from the resulting scans each image resolution was 700 700 pixels the captured size of the samples reached up to 0 91 0 91 0 91 mm3 and one voxel size was 0 00133 mm3 further work with a volumetric data matrix should be performed on the binary system to clearly separate the solid rock matrix and pore space of the sample the most problematic aspect is that the choice of the binarization threshold level is unclear due to their finite size and square shape voxels cannot represent a real phase boundary a single voxel can often be structurally heterogeneous in natural environments that is the structural element size is less than the microtomography method resolution most voxels in these images usually contain several phases and have an average x ray density therefore the phase interface has a smooth transition and cannot be set in a definite way the authors used three binarization threshold levels the closest level to the real boundary between phases and undervalued and overvalued levels fig 1 therefore three similar microtomography matrixes were obtained with different values for the total porosity to determine the empirical dependencies this displays almost the entire range of sedimentary rock porosities the resulting set of black and white raster images with a bmp format was transferred into an indicator function matrix i x y z the matrix consisted of ones and zeros i 1 if the voxel with coordinates x y z is in the pore space and i 0 if it is in the rock matrix the transfer was carried out by reading each pixel in the image determining its bit depth colour and assigning it a value of 0 or 1 according to the bmp file format colour table palette eighteen indicator matrix functions i x y z for the six samples were received the indicator function expected value is the porosity mean value of the image in the selected binarization threshold level of undervalued real overvalued the porosity for each threshold level is shown in table 3 next a correlation analysis was performed for a three dimensional matrix microstructure fig 2a by constructing the indicator variograms in three directions the sgems software package wu et al 2008 was used to determine the characteristic scale of the spatial correlation of the sample s binary structure such an analysis allows for the allocation of a representative elementary volume rev which is characterized by the distance at which the indicator variogram is constant i e it reaches the sill 3 3 spatial correlation analysis experimental indicator semivariograms were built in the three orthogonal directions x y z next the theoretical exponential variogram was approximated which showed fig 2b a microstructure with small anisotropy in the horizontal direction x y versus the vertical z direction the semivariograms for the x and y directions were similar indicating a lack of plane anisotropy the characteristic correlation scale of the investigated structures amounted to 18 voxels for the horizontal direction x y and 16 voxels for the vertical z direction that is the representative elementary volume rev medium for this sample was approximately equal to 183 voxels considering the rev value for simulated diffusion a binary structure minimum volume of 175 175 175 voxels which has a greater magnitude than the rev was selected this allowed us to cut each structure into a three dimensional microstructure with a total matrix on the 43 64 micro matrix the full porosity average value ε is determine by averaging the indicator function for each micro matrix 4 methods 4 1 estimation of the diffusion parameters based on an analysis of the published literature on the experimental determination of diffusion and distribution coefficients boving and grathwohl 2001 van loon et al 2003 the model of the diffusion experiment is developed with a multicomponent solution consisting of a non active tracer the main salt and sorbed microcomponents fig 3 because of the different rates of diffusion for the sorbed and non sorbing components using two types of observations is proposed continuous x const in time recording the change in the concentration of the main salt at several points along the length of the sample by measuring the electrical conductivity in situ and discrete t const where the distribution of the concentrations of all the sorbed elements along the length are obtained after the experiment the accessible porosity ε aсс is obtained by equating the concentrations of the neutral component in the diffusion solution with the concentrations of the component in the sample at the end of the mass diffusion transfer as a result the pore diffusion coefficient d p of the non sorbed component is determined for continuous data and the apparent diffusion coefficients d a of the sorbed elements are determined for the discrete data from which distribution coefficients k d are obtained assuming that sorption is carried out for henry s isotherm 4 2 diffusion experimental setup the experimental setup was designed and assembled to determine transport properties diffusion coefficient distribution coefficient accessible porosity as shown in fig 4 fittings for pvc pipes and simple hardware were used for making the setup the diffusion tank had a volume of approximately 1 5 l according to preliminary calculations only 1 2 of the weight of the species from the tank volume could diffuse into the sample therefore the mass loss in the tank was ignored before the experiments the samples were saturated with distilled water the use of distilled water is explained by the spread of ultra fresh waters in the area scc saturation took place under vacuum conditions on the upper boundary 0 3 mbar and a fixed head 200 cm on the lower boundary the saturation was carried out until the appearance of water on the top of the sample the saturation time lasted for 10 12 days at the end of the saturation the top butt of the sample was insulated with paraffin to prevent evaporation during the diffusion experiment after saturating the sample and paraffinizing the top butt a constant concentration dirichlet boundaries was set at the lower boundary of the water saturated sample and impermeable boundary conditions neumann boundaries were placed on the top piezometers maintained a zero hydraulic gradient to avoid advective transport 4 3 diffusion solution for the diffusion experiment the solution prevailing in the scc was modelled the synthetic solution used in the experiments was a model of the low activity contaminant of the scc and consisted of nano3 294 1 mmol l and nitrate compounds cs 0 75 mmol l ni2 1 70 mmol l co2 1 70 mmol l and sr2 1 14 mmol l the ph of the synthetic solution was 6 70 it is expected that the macrocomponent na is a sorbed cation in accordance with the langmuir type isotherm its concentration at the boundary 294 1 mmol l is much greater than the sorption capacity of the studied sediments therefore in a wide range of relative concentrations it can be considered non sorbing because its expected k d is tending to zero however at the same time sodium ion occupies most of the sorption capacity of the rock in the diffusion process then the sorption of other microcomponent cations on the base of sorbed sodium follows henry s law their k d is constant and does not depend on concentration 4 4 data processing during the experiment the change in the conductivity of the solution and the temperature in the laboratory was recorded every 30 min for each conductometric sensor at the end of the experiment the samples were cut perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder into 1 cm thick disks determination of na macrocomponent concentrations along the length was performed by flame photometry using aqueous extracts from the disks for this purpose 5 g of rock was mixed with 25 ml of distilled water and shaken for 180 s the resulting suspension was separated by filtration the background concentration of sodium ion was determined by similar method in core residues 4 5 diffusion steady state simulation on pore scale steady state diffusion was simulated in each binary micro matrix to estimate the diffusivity using the laplace equation 8 x d x y z c x y d x y z c y z d x y z c z 0 where d is the model diffusion coefficient c is the concentration and x y and z are spatial coordinates the diffusion coefficient in every cell was assigned according to the indicator value of the corresponding cell in the binary matrixes 9 d x y z 1 0 000001 i 1 i 0 the rock matrix diffusion coefficient value was set to a considerably lower value than the pore diffusion coefficient the rock matrix diffusion coefficient value was set to a nonzero value due to numerical reasons for avoiding the full isolated patterns during the simulation most likely screening effects of isolated sites from the rock matrix could lead to violations of the numerical solution of equation eq 8 for every matrix the effective diffusion coefficients were determined in three directions parallel to the main model axes x y and z fig 5 for every d determination a constant concentration was set up on the opposite boundaries dirichlet boundaries of the model to provide a gradient in the target direction no flow boundaries were set on the other four sides newmann boundaries the total number of transport models for the diffusional transfer calculation 64 3 192 simulations was performed for every sample the modflow 2005 code was used for the diffusion simulations which allowed the laplace equation eq 8 to be solved with heterogeneous coefficients for the large grid the gmg solver was used due to its stability harbaugh et al 2000 and good convergence for a large computation mesh in the capacity of the boundary conditions on one boundary the migrant concentration was set to c 0 0 and c l 1 on the opposite boundary depending on whether the direction of the diffusion flux l simulated is x y or z the other four model boundaries were set to impermeable boundaries the simulation result for each micro matrix is the mass flux between the specified concentration boundaries the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium was determined as 10 d e q fi с where q is the mass flux through the model f is the model transverse area and i с is the model concentration gradient applied at the constant concentration boundaries since the model used dimensionless diffusion coefficients it was suggested that the model diffusion coefficient d of the pores is equal to the solution diffusion coefficient d w therefore in accordance with eq 2 the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium equals the diffusivity the respective tortuosity can be calculated by dividing the diffusivity or effective diffusion coefficient by the average porosity value for a specific micro matrix 11 d d w d e d τ d e ε for every d e determination the constant head was set up for the opposite boundaries of the model c 1 for the source boundary and c 0 for the sink to provide a concentration gradient in the target direction 5 results 5 1 lab scale results in the following in connection with the specific purposes of this study the processing of the laboratory experiments only for the unsorbed tracer only is given the duration of the diffusion experiments for different samples ranged from 77 to 247 days the temperature in laboratory was held between 19 and 21 c throughout the entire measurement period the processing of the experimental breakthrough curves was carried out using the analytical solution for an finite medium crank 1975 with a given concentration at the entrance of the boundary fig 3 12 с i

the index fig 6a presents experimental data with temperature compensation obtained from conductometric sensors and fitted lines from the analytical model eq 12 the analysis of the plots showed that for the samples with the experiment time of 247 days the relative concentration of na ions reached a maximum which indicated that the diffusion transport for the non sorbing component was complete to calculate the tortuosity values of accessible porosity selected were used table 4 and the value of diffusion coefficient in aqueous medium for na was taken as 1 33 10 5 m2 s appelo and postma 2006 based on layer by layer distribution of sodium ions along the length of the samples in 1 cm steps after the experiments the accessible porosity was determined by the following expression 13 ε acc с na

accessible porosity and ρ d is the bulk density m l3 the na concentration value in the initial solution was added to the plot 294 1 mmol l at x 0 fig 6b the pore diffusion coefficients d p and accessible porosity ε acc were determined and are given in table 4 processing of the layer by layer distributions shows an increase in the concentration along the length of the samples with increasing time which agrees well with the theoretical ideas fig 6b significant differences in the accessible porosity 0 2 0 3 may be related to the heterogeneity of the well core 378 5 from which samples were cut the determined values of accessible porosity were on average half as much as the porosity values determined computationally through bulk densities and rock solids as well as from sem images and kt tomography 5 2 pore scale simulation results the obtained values of the diffusivity in three orthogonal directions for the investigated samples are shown in fig 7a and b the plots illustrate the nonlinear expansion of the diffusivity from the porosity which is well matched with the theoretical concepts and experimental work the existence of the empty intervals on the plots between the model diffusivity values fig 7b shows that there are no matrixes with such porosity values in the selected threshold binarization levels the data show the vertical anisotropy which is also confirmed by the above variogram analysis archie s law eq 4 with a 1 fig 7a and b is used to describe the relationship between the diffusivity and the porosity of the micro matrix theoretical curves are plotted using autofitting by minimizing the determination coefficient for the cementation parameter m with a fixed value of parameter a equal to 1 the fitted curves show that archie s law effectively describes the model diffusivity fig 7a and b 5 3 comparison of lab and pore scale results to verify the obtained simulated results some experimentally obtained values for the diffusivity are illustrated in fig 8a and b which shows the comparison for four core samples with x y and z directions in these figures the best fit of the experimental data for different directions and simulated data are shown that is the display experimental data and simulated data were taken correctly this result allows the use of tortuosity values obtained by simulation on microtomography data for subsequent comparison with various analytical and empirical models 5 4 experimental tortuosity versus analytical and empirical models an analysis was carried out to match the obtained model diffusivity values with the previously published analytical table 5 and empirical models table 6 and with archie s law with the free factor a the results of which are shown in figs 9 and 10 these models were mainly designed for structures consisting of spherical forms which did not fully reflect the structure of natural media figs 9 and 10 show the tortuosity porosity relations from tables 4 and 5 from the literature shen and chen 2007 these models were given for different physical systems that mainly used sphere packing additionally empirical eq 17c was added with a 3 for clay silt sediments from the literature matyka et al 2008 and semi analytical expression 11 was added pisani 2011 with a 1 07 for packing consisting of large parallelepipeds the plotted empirical curves describe the model results better than the analytical models but in general they overestimate the values up to a porosity of 0 2 0 3 with the exception of the models in the literature lerman 1979 pisani 2011 for porosities greater than 0 2 0 3 the situation is reversed it is clear that the model from the literature lerman 1979 with the value of the coefficient k 1 is degraded into the model of archie s law with the free coefficient a as a result for the determination of the empirical coefficients three models are taken that show the best approximation of the results the model of archie s law with a free and fixed a coefficient and the pisani model pisani 2011 the curves selected for some samples and directions are shown in fig 11a and b and the final values of the empirical coefficients are shown in table 7 the obtained average values of the empirical coefficients for different directions agree well with the data from other researchers for archie s law with a fixed factor a the cementation parameter varies from 2 20 to 2 54 and parameter а agrees perfectly with the model calculations given in the literature pisani 2011 6 conclusion and summary this paper introduces a method for determining the relations between the porosity and diffusion tortuosity of low permeability clay deposits for the further calculation of the diffusion coefficients of a porous medium that is hard to determine by experimental means this analysis is based on three dimensional data for the microstructure of undisturbed rock samples obtained with x ray microtomography and the subsequent transformation of these data into a binary model of diffusion coefficients as a result of the stationary diffusion simulation in a binary medium the diffusion flux averaged by a representative volume is obtained and the tortuosity is calculated at a known porosity the diffusion experiment obtained estimates for the diffusion coefficient of the main unsorbed element sodium ion the diffusion coefficient na was obtained for conductometric sensors and the concentration distributions along the length of the samples in the range from 1 92 10 11 to 1 70 10 10 m2 s with the porosity of investigated samples 0 13 0 43 which takes from 45 to 90 of their total porosity well known analytical and empirical expressions were used to obtain an approximation of the model diffusivity as a result three empirical models were selected which showed the best match with the results of the numerical simulation the empirical coefficients obtained for the empirical models were determined in three directions x y stratification and z perpendicular to layering and dropped into the range of values for low permeable sediments presented in the literature for archie s law with a fixed factor a 1 the value m ranged from 2 2 2 5 for archie s law with a free factor a the parameter a was 1 49 3 22 and m 2 50 2 85 and for the model pisani 2011 the parameter а changed in the range of 1 07 1 18 the analysis of the spatial correlation structure of the binarized three dimensional tomographic model of the studied samples showed that they have anisotropy expressed in excess of the horizontal correlation scale over the vertical one which leads to the anisotropy of the tortuosity and as a result to the anisotropy of the diffusion coefficient a comparison of the values of diffusivity were obtained on two scales and the scale of the elementary representative volume simulation and the scale of the sample experiment were a good match which testified to the validity of the obtained results and to the possibility of using each of the approaches separately it is important to note that the diffusion tortuosity obtained by this method has a volumetric character which gives a more accurate picture than the planned tortuosity determined from sem images additionally the resolution of the tomograph allowed us to obtain a model of the microstructure with pores larger than 1 μm improving the accuracy of shooting the images will allow for thin interparticle micropores 1 μm the presence of which is likely to increase the diffusion tortuosity thus the calculated diffusion coefficients of the porous medium will be less than that of the real value in conclusion it should be noted that unfortunately the samples used were partially dried during transportation and storage of the well core this may have led to some damages to the natural structure of the samples therefore the obtained parameter estimates may differ from their values in situ declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1401,soil moisture is an important indicator for monitoring land degradation and plays an important role in soil biogeochemistry mapping the spatial distribution of soil moisture provides fundamental information for soil management and agricultural production in this study 225 sampling points in the study area nanxiong basin were investigated to map the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the typical ecological degradation red beds area four interpolation methods including inverse distance weighting idw ordinary kriging ok radial basis function rbf and empirical bayesian kriging ebf were used to estimate the continuous soil moisture distribution the results showed that the soil moisture of the study area ranged from 8 12 to 32 82 with an average of 18 42 and a median of 18 20 the annual average temperature and soil bulk density had significantly negative correlations with soil moisture of 0 53 and 0 31 respectively the regional soil moisture had a moderate variation with the variation coefficient of 21 66 and strong spatial dependence with the nugget to sill ratios of 32 23 the idw method obtained a more accurate estimation on the spatial variability of soil moisture in the nanxiong basin the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the study area was drawn by different interpolation methods the results show that the red bed degradation in the eastern part of the nanxiong basin is more severe than in other areas in which the geomorphic characteristics of red bed desert have appeared with the lowest soil moisture in this study in addition the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is also pertinent to human disturbance and land use the results of spatial soil moisture distribution are of great significance for monitoring land degradation and agricultural drought in the red bed area keywords soil moisture nanxiong basin influential factor spatial variation spatial interpolation 1 introduction land degradation is currently one of the most serious environmental issues in humid regions of southern china where red bed deserts are widely formed in various red bed basins li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 these deserts have resulted in irreversible soil erosion ecological deterioration and depletion of land productivity drought is thought of as one of the most complex environmental disasters with devastating impact on agriculture economy water resources and ecosystems maneta et al 2009 rhee et al 2010 doughty et al 2015 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 the red bed is a rock series of coarse and hard red continental clastic accumulation that is mainly composed of conglomerate sandstone mudstone etc from the jurassic to the early tertiary period due to these characteristics they are vulnerable to weathering and erosion luo et al 2021 the lack of water resources is the main trigger for such hazards peng et al 2015 yan et al 2017 different from the karst rocky desertification or the desertification in arid areas the drought of red beds occurs on the special red bed parent rocks the degradation is first manifested as the erosion of organic matter on soil surfaces with the reverse succession of vegetation the soil moisture content an important indicator for land degradation continues to decrease reaching only 5 64 at a stage called cattle liver land the soil erosion of red beds further exacerbates the water loss in the soil peng et al 2015 yan 2021 at present the land degradation at the red bed regions has posted threads on the local ecological stability and sustainable development of the agricultural ecosystem therefore monitoring the soil moisture content and preventing land degradation at the red bed regions are of great importance yan et al 2019a soil moisture content plays a significant role in monitoring drought risk and land degradation and has been utilized for monitoring the health of agricultural lands zhu et al 2012 crow et al 2012 champagne et al 2015 dari et al 2019 the spatial distribution of soil moisture content is a multivariate problem starks et al 2006 niether et al 2017 which often involves environmental variables e g climates wang et al 2015 parent soil lin et al 2009 topographic characteristics huang et al 2012 and vegetation types and anthropogenic variables rodríguez et al 2009 e g types of land use ross et al 1999 huang et al 2012 understanding the interactive relations among variables and the characteristics of soil moisture content distribution is the key to tackling land degradation and managing agricultural nutrients the traditional and common approaches for mapping soil moisture content distribution are field sampling and lab testing cho and choi 2014 however these methods are not able to cover all the moisture content values across a large study region even with a large sampling density which is time consuming and expensive meanwhile assessing the physical pajares et al 2016 yan et al 2019a chemical bogunovic et al 2017 and biological kara et al 2016 properties of soil and associated affecting parameters especially types of land use johnes 1996 are of great importance however studies on soil moisture content are still lacking compared to the research in soil organic carbon under the widely concerned topic of climate change and the carbon cycle in the past few decades classical statistics and geostatistics have been widely applied in soil studies cambardella et al 1994 goovaerts 1998 yang et al 2011 veronesi et al 2014 niether et al 2017 continuous spatial data of soil properties serve as the foundation of the soil information system among which the soil moisture is a necessary input in the system model benedetto et al 2013 applying spatial interpolation methods and assessing their accuracy for monitoring the spatial distribution of soil moisture content are key challenges in digital soil studies various commonly used spatial interpolation methods i e the kriging interpolation the inverse distance and the spline function have been attempted and compared by many scholars li et al 2013 samad et al 2017 chen et al 2017 but inconsistent results were obtained some researchers claimed that the kriging interpolation method noticeably outperforms the inverse distance method and the spline function method hu et al 2013 ford and quiring 2014 but requires selection of appropriate model and parameters during the modelling of semi variograms and covariance functions liu et al 2012 guan et al 2017 however other scholars argued that the higher computational costs of the kriging interpolation method are not able to provide considerably better performance and accuracy anderson et al 2012 in addition the accuracy of interpolation methods depends on the available study scales for spatial variability e g the size of the study area the density and distribution of sampling points etc to this end this study will focus on the following objectives using the nanxiong basin in southern china as a regional study area 1 to investigate the current level and spatial variability of surface soil moisture content in the typical red bed ecological degradation area of the nanxiong basin 2 to compare the performance of four spatial interpolation methods including the inverse distance weighting idw method the ordinary kriging ok method the radial basis function rbf method and the empirical bayesian kriging ebk method for studying red bed ecological degradation and 3 based on above comparative analysis to produce a robust spatial distribution map for soil moisture content in the nanxiong basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northeast of the nanxiong basin a typical red bed area in guangdong province china with the longitude of 113 50 114 44 east and the latitude 24 35 25 24 north the total basin length is 80 km from west to east and the width is more than 30 km from south to north fig 1 the area of the middle red layer in the nanxiong basin is 1500 km2 and the erosion area of purple sand shale has a high population density and a high farmland reclamation rate which is an important soil erosion control area in guangdong province yan et al 2019b the nanxiong basin has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with short winters long summers and fast transitional autumns the annual average temperature is 19 6 c and the average rainfall is 1555 1 mm purple soil is the main soil type in the central part of the nanxiong basin with purple sand shale as its parent material types of land use mainly include farmland woodland grassland bare land etc there are a wide variety of plants and most of them are the cold tolerant evergreen forests and the warm temperate mixed forests some regions are widely distributed with unformed forests grasslands and bare lands in addition to artificial cultivation 2 2 field sampling and laboratory testing the soil moisture sampling data was acquired through field collection in the study area considering the influence of the spatial distribution of sample points on interpolation results the following procedure was carried out in november 2017 the debris and plants were removed on the sampling surface and a handheld soil drill with a diameter of 5 cm was used to collect soil samples at a soil depth of 0 20 cm within a circle with a radius of 5 m under the guidance of gps 5 6 samples were collected from each sampling location and mixed evenly by the quarter method to get one combined sample of around 1 kg which was sealed and labelled in a plastic bag a total of 225 soil samples was collected fig 2 anderson et al 2012 benedetto et al 2013 bogunovic et al 2017 bostani et al 2017 the distance between each sampling location is about 50 m 300 m and a ring knife was pressed into the soil to maintain the original structure of the soil when sampling the type of land use was also recorded at each sampling site the moisture content of the soil sample was immediately determined by the drying method on the day of sampling following these procedures 1 the fresh soil was granulated and weighted to the nearest 0 001 g on an aluminum box with known mass 2 the sample was dried in an oven preheated to 105 2 c for 12 h 3 the dried sample was weighted again immediately once it cooled to the ambient temperature three parallel tests were carried out for one sample site she et al 2010 yang et al 2017 li et al 2019 if the difference between the three parallel tests was too large i e more than 0 05 the sampled would be re dried and re weighted 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 descriptive statistics basic statistical parameters such as the average median minimum maximum variance skewness and kurtosis are used to describe the distribution characteristics of soil moisture the coefficient of variation cv is used to indicate the overall degree of variation of soil moisture with cv 10 small variability cv in the range of 10 100 medium variability and cv 100 high variability fang et al 2012 the pearson correlation analysis method was used to quantify the correlation between soil moisture and environmental factors the kolmogorov smirnov ks method was used to test the normality of the distribution of soil moisture liu et al 2013 descriptive statistical analysis was completed using the spss 19 0 software 2 3 2 semi variogram function the spatial variability of soil moisture and its influencing factors were analyzed by a basic geostatistics tool trangmar et al 1986 goovaerts 1999 variogram the gs 7 0 gamma design software plainwell miusa software was used for semi variation analysis following the eq 1 1 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the point logarithm when the distance is equal to h z xi is the true measured value at the location of xi and z xi h is the true measured value at the location of xi h motaghian et al 2008 oliver and webster 2010 2 3 3 spatial interpolation methods the choice of spatial interpolation method is one of the main factors that affect the accuracy of interpolation yasrebi 2009 bostani et al 2017 the requirements for data parameter settings etc are significantly different for different spatial interpolation methods the geostatistical analyst tool of the arcgis 10 5 software which can also be theoretically transferred to every geographic information system gis capable of working with different map projections and was employed to fit the variogram and to perform spatial interpolation methods including the idw method the ok method the rbf method and the ebk method kneissl et al 2011 the description of the methods are as follows 1 the inverse distance weighting method idw is based on the principle of similarity the weighted average is the reciprocal of the power of the distance between the point to be simulated and the sample point and the sample point closer to the simulated point is assigned with a greater the weight this method is suitable for evenly and densely distributed sample points 2 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z so is the simulated value n is the number of samples around the points to be simulated λi is the sample weights and z si is the measured value at si the equations for obtaining weights at si is 3 λ i d i 0 p i 1 n d i 0 p 4 i 1 n λ i 1 2 where p is the index value and p 2 is chosen here dio is the distance between the point to be simulated s0 and each known sample point si the ordinary kriging method kriging assumes that the data changes are normally distributed the weight value is obtained by spatial analysis of the data the entire process of interpolation is equivalent to the weighted sliding calculation of the expected value of the unknown regionalized variable z the process of averaging this method is suitable for sampling points with good spatial correlation 5 z x o i 1 n λ i z x i where z x0 is the estimated value to the point to be simulated z xi is the true value for the ith value and λi is the weight at the sample i which is determined by the kriging formula 6 i 1 n λ i c x i x j μ c x i x 0 7 i 1 n λ i 1 where c xi xj is the covariance between the sample points of the station c xi x0 is the covariance between the sample points of the station and the interpolation point and μ is the lagrangian multiplier 3 the radial basis function rbf interpolation method is a deterministic interpolator with moderate speed and accuracy this method is more flexible than idw but requires more parameters to be determined at the same time it does not contain prediction error estimates it can provide a prediction surface comparable to the precise form of the kriging method the radial basis function does not allow to study the autocorrelation of the data which makes it less flexible than the kriging method but more automated the radial basis function does not make any assumptions about the data 4 empirical bayes kriging ebf is an interpolation method based on kriging it uses input data to simulate multiple semivariograms to illustrate the uncertainty of semivariogram estimates in addition the empirical bayesian kriging method accounts for moderate instability by constructing a local model based on a subset of the input data 2 3 4 validation method the cross validation method first assumes that the element value of each point to be simulated is unknown the value of the surrounding sample points is used to estimate and the difference between the interpolation value and the actual observation value is then calculated to evaluate the estimation method spatial interpolate methods enable the selection of the optimal curve test and the evaluation of model fitting whether the prediction is unbiased or optimal can be indicated by whether the mean error me is close to 0 besides the prediction standard error σ x i is more reliable when the root mean square standard error rmsse is closer to 1 and the root mean square error rmse is closer to the average standard error ase cheng et al 2007 martín et al 2016 the formulas for these indicators are as follows the me is expressed as 7 i 1 n z x i z x i n the ase is expressed as 8 i 1 n σ x i n the rmse is expressed as 9 i 1 n z x i z x i 2 n the rmsse is expressed as 10 i 1 n z x i z x i σ x i 2 n where the σ x i is the prediction standard error z x i is the prediction value of the i th sample at the location of x i and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content and its degree of variation table 1 lists the basic statistical information of soil moisture content and related environmental factors for 225 sampling points in the nanxiong basin research area the soil moisture content varies from 8 12 to 32 82 with a small difference between the mean i e 18 42 and median i e 18 20 compared with other humid regions in china the red bed soil moisture content in the study area is relatively low because the red bed is mainly composed of rock series of red continental clastic accumulation which are large grained and high strength rocks e g conglomerate sandstone and mudstone this rock composition makes the red bed extremely susceptible to weathering and erosion and the soil moisture is easy to be drained the coefficient of variation cv for soil moisture was obtained to be 21 66 which falls in the range of moderate variation at a regional scale indicating that the soil composition in the red bed region has good uniformity the absolute values of skewness and kurtosis are both less than 1 and the p values are both larger than 0 05 given by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test showing that the sampled soil moisture content follows normal distribution the coefficient of variation of the altitude soil ph and soil bulk density at the sampling points are all in the range of 13 07 to 17 18 falling within the degree of moderate variation the average annual rainfall and annual temperature values vary little throughout the region with a degree of weak variation of only 0 01 there exists a significant positive correlation between the total amount of potassium in the soil and the average annual rainfall with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 22 a significant negative correlation with the average annual temperature soil ph and the soil bulk density with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 53 0 28 and 0 31 respectively and there is no obvious relation with the altitude the values of pearson s correlation coefficient shown above indicate that the degree of correlation between soil moisture content and these environmental factors is small this may be because traditional statistics cannot effectively reflect the correlation between the variables under the sampling interval of 50 m 300 m at a regional scale used in this study future works should develop a strategy for more intensive sampling at the sub level scale in contrast the annual average temperature and soil bulk density have a better correlation with soil moisture li et al 2019 this is mainly because the temperature can reflect the local energy status which not only affects the growth of crops on the soil surface but also various biogeochemical processes and soil moisture change below the soil surface the soil bulk density reflects the porosity and compactness of the soil affecting the transport of water and solutes in the soil soil aeration and the growth of crop roots which in turn affects the dynamic changes of soil moisture fig 3 shows the soil moisture content of the 225 samples in an order of sampling numbers irregular fluctuations of the total potassium content exist between adjacent soil measurements and obvious characteristics of local variation could be observed for instance there are large fluctuations of the soil total potassium content between the 60th and 80th sampling points and between the 100th and 120th sampling points these local variabilities are profoundly greater than the moderate variability expressed by the correlation coefficient because the relationship of spatial positions was not taken into account when calculating the coefficient of variation therefore traditional statistical models that do not rely on spatial relationships e g linear regression equations have the capacity of generating a more accurately prediction on the actual spatial variability when studying the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in a sampling location with large local variability 3 2 analysis of structural characteristics of soil moisture spatial variability the gs 7 0 software was employed to fit the variation function of the soil moisture in the study area table 2 the fitting model of variogram was selected according to various indicators such as the nugget effect coefficient of determination r2 variable range etc as summarized in table 2 the nugget value is 8 52 the abutment value is 26 43 the ratio is 32 23 and the coefficient of determination is 0 803 the variation function of the soil moisture value in the study area is close to the gaussian model and has a moderate spatial correlation this shows that the regional spatial variability of soil moisture is mainly affected by structural factors e g factors of climate parent material topography that enhance the spatial correlation of soil moisture and random factors of anthropogenic activities e g cultivation and fertilization that weaken the spatial correlation of soil moisture as illustrated in fig 4 when the step length is greater than 226 m the semi variance tends to be stable with small fluctuations which may be caused by variations in other directions when the step length is less than 226 m the soil moisture levels are correlated across a large scale and have good spatial continuity reflecting that the regional factors e g climate topography soil parent material etc have a large impact on soil moisture levels the sampling interval employed in this study is less than the change of soil moisture range which meets the requirement for evaluating the soil spatial variation to further comprehend the spatial variability characteristics of soil moisture in the study area the semi variograms in 4 directions of e w 0 ne sw 45 sn 90 se nw 135 were developed using the gs 7 0 software fig 5 it can be observed that there exists only a small difference among the semi variograms table 3 shows that the models developed in the four directions are all linear and have a moderate degree of variation with ratios ranging from 25 to 75 the variation of soil moisture content is much smaller in the directions of ne sw 45 and se nw 135 than that of the directions of e w 0 and sn 90 as shown in fig 4 the variation in the directions of 0 and 135 is larger than 45 and 90 when the step length is larger than 130 m in the direction of 0 the semi variance value of soil moisture begins to fluctuate and the variance value presents a wave shaped trend of first decrease and then increase at around 26 61 the semi variance values in the direction of 135 also share a similar trend of fluctuating but with a smaller magnitude than in the 0 direction when the step length is greater than approximately 145 m the variations of soil moisture in the 45 and 90 directions are similar and relatively stable at around 26 61 this is mainly because the study area is close to mountainous areas in the directions of 0 and 135 where topographic variables and the material of parent rocks have more effects on soil moisture in particular there are more hills in the 135 direction with undulating terrains in the directions of 45 and 90 terrains are flatter and have been exposed to long term anthropogenic activities such as agricultural cultivation and fertilization leading to the isotropic variation of soil moisture in different directions in general the soil moisture in the study area presents profound spatial heterogeneity which calls for further interpolation analysis 3 3 comparisons of the performance of four interpolation methods the most straightforward way to test the performance of interpolation is to map the actual measured values and the predicted values yasrebi 2009 guan et al 2017 fig 6 shows the matching of the measured and predicted values of soil moisture content obtained by the idw method the ok method the rbf method and the ebk method at each sampling point it can be observed that the paired scatter plots obtained from different methods are not identical and the predicted values of different methods at each sampling point are different liu et al 2012 the scatter points ranging from 15 to 25 are closer to the 45 reference line which indicates that the predicted values in this range are very close to the actual measured values thus higher prediction accuracy was achieved however all the four methods generally produced overestimated values or underestimated values when the soil moisture content is less than 15 or greater than 25 respectively this is caused by the inherent algorithm of spatial interpolation methods which try to achieve an unbiased estimate for the overall mean the slopes of the paired scatter plots obtained by different methods in fig 5 do not present large differences and they are 0 3479 from the idw method 0 4620 from the ok method 0 4719 from the rbf method and 0 6139 from the ebk method respectively the best linear regression fit was generated by the idw method with r2 0 9532 followed by the rbf method r2 0 8513 and the ok method r2 0 6582 and the worst fit is from the ebk method this problem is associated with the dataset which was not sampled using a probabilistic design veronesi et al 2014 guan et al 2017 table 4 summarizes the me ase rmse and the rmsse obtained by cross checking different interpolation methods me values obtained by the four interpolation methods are all close to 0 indicating that all methods achieved relatively unbiased spatial interpolations for soil moisture the idw method generates the smallest ase i e 0 2035 followed by that of the ok method i e 0 2079 and the rbf method i e 0 2106 similarly the idw method produces the smallest rmse i e 0 3276 which overperforms that of the ok method i e 0 3559 the rbf method i e 0 4447 and the ebk method i e 0 2291 the normalized rms values for all methods are positive among which and the one from the co kriging method is the smallest the ones from the ok method and the ebk method are in the middle and the one from the rbf method is the largest based on the above results it can be considered that the idw method has higher interpolation accuracy than that of the ok method the ebk method and the rbf method when performing small scale soil moisture spatial interpolation similar results were obtained from the relevant research on the spatial variability of soil physical properties on a small scale in the typical ecological degradation area it can be observed from the regression function graph and the cross validation graph that the idw method generated more accurate interpolation results for the spatial variability of soil moisture of red beds therefore developing appropriate methods to study soil moisture variability enables improvement in the characterization of the soil and provides a more reliable basis for the effective management of agricultural soil in red bedded land degradation areas 3 4 analysis of spatial distribution for soil moisture fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of soil water content in the nanxiong basin produced by different interpolation methods a same grading scale for moisture content was employed for all distribution maps in general the four figures share similarities in the characteristics of moisture levels and variabilities the soil moisture content is considerably higher in the northwest part of the study area which is mostly used as agricultural land where the farming and irrigating activities could increase the local moisture content the southern part is mainly woodland and contains higher soil moisture levels this is mainly due to the presence of the forest litter layer that provides timely soil moisturization and prevention of evaporation from the topsoil layer the red beds in the eastern part of the study area is highly degraded and presents typical characteristics of the red bed deserts where the lowest value of soil moisture 8 12 in this research was observed this is mainly due to inappropriate anthropogenic activities e g over deforestation slash burning of mountains over burden of agricultural lands etc which exacerbates the soil erosion and ecological degradation of red beds further affecting the sustainable development of agriculture thus the reduction of soil moisture is an important characteristic indicator for land degradation and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is closely related to various factors such as improper human disturbance and land use although different interpolation methods can provide similar distribution patterns for soil moisture in general there are still exist considerable differences of details among the methods the distribution map produced by the ok method shows many obvious small patches which are often called the bull eye effect liu et al 2012 while the idw method can provide a smoother distribution the distribution map drawn by the rbf method has a more sporadic distribution of noise which may be caused by the three detrending processes during interpolation the ebk method also produced a similar sporadic distribution of noise but there are still many differences in details than that of the rbf method the comparison results of the interpolation accuracy for the four methods have concluded that the idw method provides higher accuracy for mapping the spatial distribution of soil moisture 3 5 potential applications a large scale of field sampling often requires a considerable amount of time labour and equipment during the study of soil moisture scale johnes 1996 besides a long sampling time results in other potential issues such as a change of moisture condition of soil samples recent advances of the near ground and far ground remote sensing technology have enabled the application of reflection spectra in the visible and near infrared bands to measure soil moisture content this method is easy to apply and is time saving and cost effective cashion et al 2005 kumar et al 2018 however to obtain reliable predictions it is necessary to conduct the physical field measurement for soil moisture which can be used to calibrate prediction models of spectral characteristics and soil organic carbon content this study was conducted based on field measurements for 1 year soil moisture content and could provide fundamental information for the remote sensing spectral characteristics of the ecologically vulnerable red beds in southern china furthermore the spatially continuous moisture data of soil surfaces could be used as an important input layer for regional soil hydrological cycle simulation the spatial distribution maps obtained in this study have enabled the observation of regional soil moisture content in the typical study area of the red bed deserts in southern china compared with studies on the local scale it has more research value which paves the way for future works on the red beds on a regional scale such as regional evaluations on soil resource potentials environmental monitoring optimization of land use policy health evaluation of soil and ecosystem locating the remediation areas of soil similar literature has been conducted in other countries such as a study focusing on mapping the regional spatial distribution of soil moisture content in italy emadi et al 2015 therefore the selection of interpolation parameters and the comparison of interpolation accuracy in this study could also pave the path for future research on the spatial distribution of regional soil moisture thus understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture plays an important and practical role in monitoring land degradation and agricultural drought of red beds 4 conclusions this study focused on a typical ecologically vulnerable red bed area the northern guangdong nanxiong basin which is currently a popular study area of red bed deserts in southern china the soil moisture level spatial distribution and variability characteristics as well as the explicit relationship among environmental factors were studied and better understood the soil moisture content displaced a moderate degree of variation at a regional scale indicating that the uniformity of soil moisture in the study area is quite good besides the annual average temperature and soil bulk density have good correlations with the soil moisture content the idw method provides a smoother distribution and obtains more accurate interpolation results the appropriate interpolation method provided by this study for mapping the red bed moisture content which could serve as a more accurate basis for the effective management decision on degraded agricultural land however the drawback of this study is the use of traditional soil moisture measurement methods based on manual single point measurement this method has the problem of low data timeliness and is not applicable for large scale and real time soil moisture monitoring therefore future research could attempt to employ drones and remote sensing technology to conduct more precise rapid and large scale soil moisture monitoring in conclusion this study also serves as an introduction framework of soil moisture content studies and future works could be conducted on multiple sub scales to further reveal the spatial variability of soil moisture and its relationship with affecting factors a more robust decision making plan could be carried out

1401,soil moisture is an important indicator for monitoring land degradation and plays an important role in soil biogeochemistry mapping the spatial distribution of soil moisture provides fundamental information for soil management and agricultural production in this study 225 sampling points in the study area nanxiong basin were investigated to map the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the typical ecological degradation red beds area four interpolation methods including inverse distance weighting idw ordinary kriging ok radial basis function rbf and empirical bayesian kriging ebf were used to estimate the continuous soil moisture distribution the results showed that the soil moisture of the study area ranged from 8 12 to 32 82 with an average of 18 42 and a median of 18 20 the annual average temperature and soil bulk density had significantly negative correlations with soil moisture of 0 53 and 0 31 respectively the regional soil moisture had a moderate variation with the variation coefficient of 21 66 and strong spatial dependence with the nugget to sill ratios of 32 23 the idw method obtained a more accurate estimation on the spatial variability of soil moisture in the nanxiong basin the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the study area was drawn by different interpolation methods the results show that the red bed degradation in the eastern part of the nanxiong basin is more severe than in other areas in which the geomorphic characteristics of red bed desert have appeared with the lowest soil moisture in this study in addition the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is also pertinent to human disturbance and land use the results of spatial soil moisture distribution are of great significance for monitoring land degradation and agricultural drought in the red bed area keywords soil moisture nanxiong basin influential factor spatial variation spatial interpolation 1 introduction land degradation is currently one of the most serious environmental issues in humid regions of southern china where red bed deserts are widely formed in various red bed basins li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 these deserts have resulted in irreversible soil erosion ecological deterioration and depletion of land productivity drought is thought of as one of the most complex environmental disasters with devastating impact on agriculture economy water resources and ecosystems maneta et al 2009 rhee et al 2010 doughty et al 2015 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 the red bed is a rock series of coarse and hard red continental clastic accumulation that is mainly composed of conglomerate sandstone mudstone etc from the jurassic to the early tertiary period due to these characteristics they are vulnerable to weathering and erosion luo et al 2021 the lack of water resources is the main trigger for such hazards peng et al 2015 yan et al 2017 different from the karst rocky desertification or the desertification in arid areas the drought of red beds occurs on the special red bed parent rocks the degradation is first manifested as the erosion of organic matter on soil surfaces with the reverse succession of vegetation the soil moisture content an important indicator for land degradation continues to decrease reaching only 5 64 at a stage called cattle liver land the soil erosion of red beds further exacerbates the water loss in the soil peng et al 2015 yan 2021 at present the land degradation at the red bed regions has posted threads on the local ecological stability and sustainable development of the agricultural ecosystem therefore monitoring the soil moisture content and preventing land degradation at the red bed regions are of great importance yan et al 2019a soil moisture content plays a significant role in monitoring drought risk and land degradation and has been utilized for monitoring the health of agricultural lands zhu et al 2012 crow et al 2012 champagne et al 2015 dari et al 2019 the spatial

interactive relations among variables and the characteristics of soil moisture content distribution is the key to tackling land degradation and managing agricultural nutrients the traditional and common approaches for mapping soil moisture content distribution are field sampling and lab testing cho and choi 2014 however these methods are not able to cover all the moisture content values across a large study region even with a large sampling density which is time consuming and expensive meanwhile assessing the physical pajares et al 2016 yan et al 2019a chemical bogunovic et al 2017 and biological kara et al 2016 properties of soil and associated affecting parameters especially types of land use johnes 1996 are of great importance however studies on soil moisture content are still lacking compared to the research in soil organic carbon under the widely concerned topic of climate change and the carbon cycle in the past few decades classical statistics and geostatistics have been widely applied in soil studies cambardella et al 1994 goovaerts 1998 yang et al 2011 veronesi et al 2014 niether et al 2017 continuous spatial data of soil properties serve as the foundation of the soil information system among which the soil moisture is a necessary input in the system model benedetto et al 2013 applying spatial interpolation methods and assessing their accuracy for monitoring the spatial distribution of soil moisture content are key challenges in digital soil studies various commonly used spatial interpolation methods i e the kriging interpolation the inverse distance and the spline function have been attempted and compared by many scholars li et al 2013 samad et al 2017 chen et al 2017 but inconsistent results were obtained some researchers claimed that the kriging interpolation method noticeably outperforms the inverse distance method and the spline function method hu et al 2013 ford and quiring 2014 but requires selection of appropriate model and parameters during the modelling of semi variograms and covariance functions liu et al 2012 guan et al 2017 however other scholars argued that the higher computational costs of the kriging interpolation method are not able to provide considerably better performance and accuracy anderson et al 2012 in addition the accuracy of interpolation methods depends on the available study scales for spatial variability e g the size of the study area the density and distribution of sampling points etc to this end this study will focus on the following objectives using the nanxiong basin in southern china as a regional study area 1 to investigate the current level and spatial variability of surface soil moisture content in the typical red bed ecological degradation area of the nanxiong basin 2 to compare the performance of four spatial interpolation methods including the inverse distance weighting idw method the ordinary kriging ok method the radial basis function rbf method and the empirical bayesian kriging ebk method for studying red bed ecological degradation and 3 based on above comparative analysis to produce a robust spatial distribution map for soil moisture content in the nanxiong basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northeast of the nanxiong basin a typical red bed area in guangdong province china with the longitude of 113 50 114 44 east and the latitude 24 35 25 24 north the total basin length is 80 km from west to east and the width is more than 30 km from south to north fig 1 the area of the middle red layer in the nanxiong basin is 1500 km2 and the erosion area of purple sand shale has a high population density and a high farmland reclamation rate which is an important soil erosion control area in guangdong province yan et al 2019b the nanxiong basin has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with short winters long summers and fast transitional autumns the annual average temperature is 19 6 c and the average rainfall is 1555 1 mm purple soil is the main soil type in the central part of the nanxiong basin with purple sand shale as its parent material types of land use mainly include farmland woodland grassland bare land etc there are a wide variety of plants and most of them are the cold tolerant evergreen forests and the warm temperate mixed forests some regions are widely distributed with unformed forests grasslands and bare lands in addition to artificial cultivation 2 2 field sampling and laboratory testing the soil moisture sampling data was acquired through field collection in the study area considering the influence of the spatial distribution of sample points on interpolation results the following procedure was carried out in november 2017 the debris and plants were removed on the sampling surface and a handheld soil drill with a diameter of 5 cm was used to collect soil samples at a soil depth of 0 20 cm within a circle with a radius of 5 m under the guidance of gps 5 6 samples were collected from each sampling location and mixed evenly by the quarter method to get one combined sample of around 1 kg which was sealed and labelled in a plastic bag a total of 225 soil samples was collected fig 2 anderson et al 2012 benedetto et al 2013 bogunovic et al 2017 bostani et al 2017 the distance between each sampling location is about 50 m 300 m and a ring knife was pressed into the soil to maintain the original structure of the soil when sampling the type of land use was also recorded at each sampling site the moisture content of the soil sample was immediately determined by the drying method on the day of sampling following these procedures 1 the fresh soil was granulated and weighted to the nearest 0 001 g on an aluminum box with known mass 2 the sample was dried in an oven preheated to 105 2 c for 12 h 3 the dried sample was weighted again immediately once it cooled to the ambient temperature three parallel tests were carried out for one sample site she et al 2010 yang et al 2017 li et al 2019 if the difference between the three parallel tests was too large i e more than 0 05 the sampled would be re dried and re weighted 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 descriptive statistics basic statistical parameters such as the average median minimum maximum variance skewness and kurtosis are used to describe the distribution characteristics of soil moisture the coefficient of variation cv is used to indicate the overall degree of variation of soil moisture with cv 10 small variability cv in the range of 10 100 medium variability and cv 100 high variability fang et al 2012 the pearson correlation analysis method was used to quantify the correlation between soil moisture and environmental factors the kolmogorov smirnov ks method was used to test the normality of the distribution of soil moisture liu et al 2013 descriptive statistical analysis was completed using the spss 19 0 software 2 3 2 semi variogram function the spatial variability of soil moisture and its influencing factors were analyzed by a basic geostatistics tool trangmar et al 1986 goovaerts 1999 variogram the gs 7 0 gamma design software plainwell miusa software was used for semi variation analysis following the eq 1 1 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the point logarithm when the distance is equal to h z xi is the true measured value at the location of xi and z xi h is the true measured value at the location of xi h motaghian et al 2008 oliver and webster 2010 2 3 3 spatial interpolation methods the choice of spatial interpolation method is one of the main factors that affect the accuracy of interpolation yasrebi 2009 bostani et al 2017 the requirements for data parameter settings etc are significantly different for different spatial interpolation methods the geostatistical analyst tool of the arcgis 10 5 software which can also be theoretically transferred to every geographic information system gis capable of working with different map projections and was employed to fit the variogram and to perform spatial interpolation methods including the idw method the ok method the rbf method and the ebk method kneissl et al 2011 the description of the methods are as follows 1 the inverse distance weighting method idw is based on the principle of similarity the weighted average is the reciprocal of the power of the distance between the point to be simulated and the sample point and the sample point closer to the simulated point is assigned with a greater the weight this method is suitable for evenly and densely distributed sample points 2 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z so is the simulated value n is the number of samples around the points to be simulated λi is the sample weights and z si is the measured value at si the equations for obtaining weights at si is 3 λ i d i 0 p i 1 n d i 0 p 4 i 1 n λ i 1 2 where p is the index value and p 2 is chosen here dio is the distance between the point to be simulated s0 and each known sample point si the ordinary kriging method kriging assumes that the data changes are normally distributed the weight value is obtained by spatial analysis of the data the entire process of interpolation is equivalent to the weighted sliding calculation of the expected value of the unknown regionalized variable z the process of averaging this method is suitable for sampling points with good spatial correlation 5 z x o i 1 n λ i z x i where z x0 is the estimated value to the point to be simulated z xi is the true value for the ith value and λi is the weight at the sample i which is determined by the kriging formula 6 i 1 n λ i c x i x j μ c x i x 0 7 i 1 n λ i 1 where c xi xj is the covariance between the sample points of the station c xi x0 is the covariance between the sample points of the station and the interpolation point and μ is the lagrangian multiplier 3 the radial basis function rbf interpolation method is a deterministic interpolator with moderate speed and accuracy this method is more flexible than idw but requires more parameters to be determined at the same time it does not contain prediction error estimates it can provide a prediction surface comparable to the precise form of the kriging method the radial basis function does not allow to study the autocorrelation of the data which makes it less flexible than the kriging method but more automated the radial basis function does not make any assumptions about the data 4 empirical bayes kriging ebf is an interpolation method based on kriging it uses input data to simulate multiple semivariograms to illustrate the uncertainty of semivariogram estimates in addition the empirical bayesian kriging method accounts for moderate instability by constructing a local model based on a subset of the input data 2 3 4 validation method the cross validation method first assumes that the element value of each point to be simulated is unknown the value of the surrounding sample points is used to estimate and the difference between the interpolation value and the actual observation value is then calculated to evaluate the estimation method spatial interpolate methods enable the selection of the optimal curve test and the evaluation of model fitting whether the prediction is unbiased or optimal can be indicated by whether the mean error me is close to 0 besides the prediction standard error σ x i is more reliable when the root mean square standard error rmsse is closer to 1 and the root mean square error rmse is closer to the average standard error ase cheng et al 2007 martín et al 2016 the formulas for these indicators are as follows the me is expressed as 7 i 1 n z x i z x i n the ase is expressed as 8 i 1 n σ x i n the rmse is expressed as 9 i 1 n z x i z x i 2 n the rmsse is expressed as 10 i 1 n z x i z x i σ x i 2 n where the σ x i is the prediction standard error z x i is the prediction value of the i th sample at the location of x i and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content and its degree of variation table 1 lists the basic statistical information of soil moisture content and related environmental factors for 225 sampling points in the nanxiong basin research area the soil moisture content varies from 8 12 to 32 82 with a small difference between the mean i e 18 42 and median i e 18 20 compared with other humid regions in china the red bed soil moisture content in the study area is relatively low because the red bed is mainly composed of rock series of red continental clastic accumulation which are large grained and high strength rocks e g conglomerate sandstone and mudstone this rock composition makes the red bed extremely susceptible to weathering and erosion and the soil moisture is easy to be drained the coefficient of variation cv for soil moisture was obtained to be 21 66 which falls in the range of moderate variation at a regional scale indicating that the soil composition in the red bed region has good uniformity the absolute values of skewness and kurtosis are both less than 1 and the p values are both larger than 0 05 given by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test showing that the sampled soil moisture content follows normal distribution the coefficient of variation of the altitude soil ph and soil bulk density at the sampling points are all in the range of 13 07 to 17 18 falling within the degree of moderate variation the average annual rainfall and annual temperature values vary little throughout the region with a degree of weak variation of only 0 01 there exists a significant positive correlation between the total amount of potassium in the soil and the average annual rainfall with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 22 a significant negative correlation with the average annual temperature soil ph and the soil bulk density with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 53 0 28 and 0 31 respectively and there is no obvious relation with the altitude the values of pearson s correlation coefficient shown above indicate that the degree of correlation between soil moisture content and these environmental factors is small this may be because traditional statistics cannot effectively reflect the correlation between the variables under the sampling interval of 50 m 300 m at a regional scale used in this study future works should develop a strategy for more intensive sampling at the sub level scale in contrast the annual average temperature and soil bulk density have a better correlation with soil moisture li et al 2019 this is mainly because the temperature can reflect the local energy status which not only affects the growth of crops on the soil surface but also various biogeochemical processes and soil moisture change below the soil surface the soil bulk density reflects the porosity and compactness of the soil affecting the transport of water and solutes in the soil soil aeration and the growth of crop roots which in turn affects the dynamic changes of soil moisture fig 3 shows the soil moisture content of the 225 samples in an order of sampling numbers irregular fluctuations of the total potassium content exist between adjacent soil measurements and obvious characteristics of local variation could be observed for instance there are large fluctuations of the soil total potassium content between the 60th and 80th sampling points and between the 100th and 120th sampling points these local variabilities are profoundly greater than the moderate variability expressed by the correlation coefficient because the relationship of spatial positions was not taken into account when calculating the coefficient of variation therefore traditional statistical models that do not rely on spatial relationships e g linear regression equations have the capacity of generating a more accurately prediction on the actual spatial variability when studying the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in a sampling location with large local variability 3 2 analysis of structural characteristics of soil moisture spatial variability the gs 7 0 software was employed to fit the variation function of the soil moisture in the study area table 2 the fitting model of variogram was selected according to various indicators such as the nugget effect coefficient of determination r2 variable range etc as summarized in table 2 the nugget value is 8 52 the abutment value is 26 43 the ratio is 32 23 and the coefficient of determination is 0 803 the variation function of the soil moisture value in the study area is close to the gaussian model and has a moderate spatial correlation this shows that the regional spatial variability of soil moisture is mainly affected by structural factors e g factors of climate parent material topography that enhance the spatial correlation of soil moisture and random factors of anthropogenic activities e g cultivation and fertilization that weaken the spatial correlation of soil moisture as illustrated in fig 4 when the step length is greater than 226 m the semi variance tends to be stable with small fluctuations which may be caused by variations in other directions when the step length is less than 226 m the soil moisture levels are correlated across a large scale and have good spatial continuity reflecting that the regional factors e g climate topography soil parent material etc have a large impact on soil moisture levels the sampling interval employed in this study is less than the change of soil moisture range which meets the requirement for evaluating the soil spatial variation to further comprehend the spatial variability characteristics of soil moisture in the study area the semi variograms in 4 directions of e w 0 ne sw 45 sn 90 se nw 135 were developed using the gs 7 0 software fig 5 it can be observed that there exists only a small difference among the semi variograms table 3 shows that the models developed in the four directions are all linear and have a moderate degree of variation with ratios ranging from 25 to 75 the variation of soil moisture content is much smaller in the directions of ne sw 45 and se nw 135 than that of the directions of e w 0 and sn 90 as shown in fig 4 the variation in the directions of 0 and 135 is larger than 45 and 90 when the step length is larger than 130 m in the direction of 0 the semi variance value of soil moisture begins to fluctuate and the variance value presents a wave shaped trend of first decrease and then increase at around 26 61 the semi variance values in the direction of 135 also share a similar trend of fluctuating but with a smaller magnitude than in the 0 direction when the step length is greater than approximately 145 m the variations of soil moisture in the 45 and 90 directions are similar and relatively stable at around 26 61 this is mainly because the study area is close to mountainous areas in the directions of 0 and 135 where topographic variables and the material of parent rocks have more effects on soil moisture in particular there are more hills in the 135 direction with undulating terrains in the directions of 45 and 90 terrains are flatter and have been exposed to long term anthropogenic activities such as agricultural cultivation and fertilization leading to the isotropic variation of soil moisture in different directions in general the soil moisture in the study area presents profound spatial heterogeneity which calls for further interpolation analysis 3 3 comparisons of the performance of four interpolation methods the most straightforward way to test the performance of interpolation is to map the actual measured values and the predicted values yasrebi 2009 guan et al 2017 fig 6 shows the matching of the measured and predicted values of soil moisture content obtained by the idw method the ok method the rbf method and the ebk method at each sampling point it can be observed that the paired scatter plots obtained from different methods are not identical and the predicted values of different methods at each sampling point are different liu et al 2012 the scatter points ranging from 15 to 25 are closer to the 45 reference line which indicates that the predicted values in this range are very close to the actual measured values thus higher prediction accuracy was achieved however all the four methods generally produced overestimated values or underestimated values when the soil moisture content is less than 15 or greater than 25 respectively this is caused by the inherent algorithm of spatial interpolation methods which try to achieve an unbiased estimate for the overall mean the slopes of the paired scatter plots obtained by different methods in fig 5 do not present large differences and they are 0 3479 from the idw method 0 4620 from the ok method 0 4719 from the rbf method and 0 6139 from the ebk method respectively the best linear regression fit was generated by the idw method with r2 0 9532 followed by the rbf method r2 0 8513 and the ok method r2 0 6582 and the worst fit is from the ebk method this problem is associated with the dataset which was not sampled using a probabilistic design veronesi et al 2014 guan et al 2017 table 4 summarizes the me ase rmse and the rmsse obtained by cross checking different interpolation methods me values obtained by the four interpolation methods are all close to 0 indicating that all methods achieved relatively unbiased spatial interpolations for soil moisture the idw method generates the smallest ase i e 0 2035 followed by that of the ok method i e 0 2079 and the rbf method i e 0 2106 similarly the idw method produces the smallest rmse i e 0 3276 which overperforms that of the ok method i e 0 3559 the rbf method i e 0 4447 and the ebk method i e 0 2291 the normalized rms values for all methods are positive among which and the one from the co kriging method is the smallest the ones from the ok method and the ebk method are in the middle and the one from the rbf method is the largest based on the above results it can be considered that the idw method has higher interpolation accuracy than that of the ok method the ebk method and the rbf method when performing small scale soil moisture spatial interpolation similar results were obtained from the relevant research on the spatial variability of soil physical properties on a small scale in the typical ecological degradation area it can be observed from the regression function graph and the cross validation graph that the idw method generated more accurate interpolation results for the spatial variability of soil moisture of red beds therefore developing appropriate methods to study soil moisture variability enables improvement in the characterization of the soil and provides a more reliable basis for the effective management of agricultural soil in red bedded land degradation areas 3 4 analysis of spatial distribution for soil moisture fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of soil water content in the nanxiong basin produced by different interpolation methods a same grading scale for moisture content was employed for all distribution maps in general the four figures share similarities in the characteristics of moisture levels and variabilities the soil moisture content is considerably higher in the northwest part of the study area which is mostly used as agricultural land where the farming and irrigating activities could increase the local moisture content the southern part is mainly woodland and contains higher soil moisture levels this is mainly due to the presence of the forest litter layer that provides timely soil moisturization and prevention of evaporation from the topsoil layer the red beds in the eastern part of the study area is highly degraded and presents typical characteristics of the red bed deserts where the lowest value of soil moisture 8 12 in this research was observed this is mainly due to inappropriate anthropogenic activities e g over deforestation slash burning of mountains over burden of agricultural lands etc which exacerbates the soil erosion and ecological degradation of red beds further affecting the sustainable development of agriculture thus the reduction of soil moisture is an important characteristic indicator for land degradation and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is closely related to various factors such as improper human disturbance and land use although different interpolation methods can provide similar distribution patterns for soil moisture in general there are still exist considerable differences of details among the methods the distribution map produced by the ok method shows many obvious small patches which are often called the bull eye effect liu et al 2012 while the idw method can provide a smoother distribution the distribution map drawn by the rbf method has a more sporadic distribution of noise which may be caused by the three detrending processes during interpolation the ebk method also produced a similar sporadic distribution of noise but there are still many differences in details than that of the rbf method the comparison results of the interpolation accuracy for the four methods have concluded that the idw method provides higher accuracy for mapping the spatial distribution of soil moisture 3 5 potential applications a large scale of field sampling often requires a considerable amount of time labour and equipment during the study of soil moisture scale johnes 1996 besides a long sampling time results in other potential issues such as a change of moisture condition of soil samples recent advances of the near ground and far ground remote sensing technology have enabled the application of reflection spectra in the visible and near infrared bands to measure soil moisture content this method is easy to apply and is time saving and cost effective cashion et al 2005 kumar et al 2018 however to obtain reliable predictions it is necessary to conduct the physical field measurement for soil moisture which can be used to calibrate prediction models of spectral characteristics and soil organic carbon content this study was conducted based on field measurements for 1 year soil moisture content and could provide fundamental information for the remote sensing spectral characteristics of the ecologically vulnerable red beds in southern china furthermore the spatially continuous moisture data of soil surfaces could be used as an important input layer for regional soil hydrological cycle simulation the spatial distribution maps obtained in this study have enabled the observation of regional soil moisture content in the typical study area of the red bed deserts in southern china compared with studies on the local scale it has more research value which paves the way for future works on the red beds on a regional scale such as regional evaluations on soil resource potentials environmental monitoring optimization of land use policy health evaluation of soil and ecosystem locating the remediation areas of soil similar literature has been conducted in other countries such as a study focusing on mapping the regional spatial distribution of soil moisture content in italy emadi et al 2015 therefore the selection of interpolation parameters and the comparison of interpolation accuracy in this study could also pave the path for future research on the spatial distribution of regional soil moisture thus understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture plays an important and practical role in monitoring land degradation and agricultural drought of red beds 4 conclusions this study focused on a typical ecologically vulnerable red bed area the northern guangdong nanxiong basin which is currently a popular study area of red bed deserts in southern china the soil moisture level spatial distribution and variability characteristics as well as the explicit relationship among environmental factors were studied and better understood the soil moisture content displaced a moderate degree of variation at a regional scale indicating that the uniformity of soil moisture in the study area is quite good besides the annual average temperature and soil bulk density have good correlations with the soil moisture content the idw method provides a smoother distribution and obtains more accurate interpolation results the appropriate interpolation method provided by this study for mapping the red bed moisture content which could serve as a more accurate basis for the effective management decision on degraded agricultural land however the drawback of this study is the use of traditional soil moisture measurement methods based on manual single point measurement this method has the problem of low data timeliness and is not applicable for large scale and real time soil moisture monitoring therefore future research could attempt to employ drones and remote sensing technology to conduct more precise rapid and large scale soil moisture monitoring in conclusion this study also serves as an introduction framework of soil moisture content studies and future works could be conducted on multiple sub scales to further reveal the spatial variability of soil moisture and its relationship with affecting factors a more robust decision making plan could be carried out

1402,in waste rock piles the leaching process involved in acid rock drainage is mainly controlled by water flow this paper part 2 investigates the effects of heterogeneities on the water flow patterns by applying probability density functions to hydrogeological properties in this study a piecewise constant distribution is proposed to describe the permeability inside waste rock piles which reflects the effect of both finer and coarser pores compared with uniform water flow obtained from traditional homogeneous modeling various water flow patterns and their pathways inside waste rock piles can be simulated by the proposed model in addition the leaching process is also investigated by coupling the calculated water flow with the geochemical reaction based on the water film model proposed in part 1 for demonstration these models are integrated and applied to the full scale waste rock pile at equity silver mine in british columbia canada because the iron loading is highly correlated to the acidity at this site it is found that the fluctuation of annual lime consumption for neutralization at this site can be well predicted by the integrated model in addition the results indicate that waste rock piles with different spatial patterns of permeability distribution but with the same probability density function may have different water flow patterns and spatial distributions of iron concentrations inside the pile however the total water flow discharge rate and iron loading profiles from the pile are almost the same on the temporal scale keywords acid rock drainage waste rock pile heterogeneity probability density functions water flow pattern leaching process 1 introductions open pit hard rock mines can generate a huge amount of waste rocks during mining typically many 106 to more than 109 t over time waste rocks are deposited large waste rock piles some waste rock piles may create significant environmental footprints and cover a few hundred hectares when sulfide minerals enclosed in waste rocks are exposed to the open environment and accessed by air and water they oxidize gradually generate protons and further dissolve metal ions into the water flowing through this geochemical and transport process is often called acid rock drainage and metal leaching ard ml parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 dold 2017 it is believed that ard ml is mainly controlled by two factors the geochemical reaction and the water flowing through part 1 of this series paper has discussed the geochemical reaction by proposing a new water film model to consider the impact of water film thickness oxygen concentration and geochemical kinetics on the total product generation at the particle level this paper part 2 focuses on describing the water flow inside the waste rock piles and how the water transports those generated geochemical products out of the piles in the part 1 paper ma et al 2019 a pile scale mass transport model including water and air flows reactant product transport and heat transfer coupled with the proposed water film model have been proposed and validated through a field scale case study similar to other modeling studies da silva et al 2009 lefebvre et al 2001a lefebvre et al 2001b mayer et al 2002 the mass transport models in part 1 assumes that waste rock properties are distributed homogeneously on spatial scale so that all parameters related to the waste rock properties are set to constants within the whole pile or its sub structures however in real field conditions those properties especially hydrological properties are naturally heterogeneous as their particle size may vary from several micrometers to several meters for example li 1999 found that the field waste rock piles are usually complex structures and the heterogeneity can result in layers with large ranges of particle sizes and or physically distinct layers these heterogeneous features of full scale waste rock piles have been known and documented for many decades morin et al 1991 the heterogeneity in permeability and pore connection may create local enhanced pathways for water to flow through with higher speed this phenomena is commonly called as preferential flow muniruzzaman and pedretti 2020 which has been widely observed in many waste rock piles trinchero et al 2011 eriksson et al 1997 in terms of the volumetric percentage of the preferential flow in waste rock piles hendrickx and flury 2001 identified that it is only a small fraction of the pore space however ma et al 2020 adopted a dual permeability model to assess the water flow inside waste rock piles and found that the total drainage water discharged from the piles are mainly from preferential flow field evidence supporting this observation requires high frequency measurements of flows such as hourly to detect the fast passage of water in preferential channels such high frequency monitoring is rare for full scale piles but results from spectral analysis morin 2019 support this observation that preferential flow dominates as a result the heterogeneous hydrological properties inside waste rock piles and the resulted various water flow patterns should be included in modeling for better prediction of ard ml for modeling various water flow patterns inside waste rock piles molson et al 2005 and fala et al 2005 found that preferential flow channels can be reproduced from mesh grid orientation effects of the geometry model in terms of physical mechanisms of water flow it is believed that the heterogeneous distribution of permeability is one of key mechanisms that generates various flow patterns through waste rock piles pedretti et al 2016 pedretti et al 2017b pedretti et al 2017a pedretti et al 2020 developed a conceptualized stochastic modeling framework based on probability density function which assumes a bundle of stream tubes inside waste rock piles to assess the impact of heterogeneity of minerals and hydraulic conductivity the drawback is that the discretization into 1 d models is necessary for simplification lahmira et al 2017 divided waste rock into four groups with different water retention properties based on different grain sizes coarse intermediate fine and very fine and randomly distributed them into the mesh grids of pile geometry to simulate preferential water flow pathways the limitation of adopting different waste rock groups is that the real permeability can be continuous rather than discrete in nature and may follow some specific stochastic distribution in addition discrete permeability boundaries between different mesh grids could create significant computational difficulties this paper adopts the concept of probability density function to describe distributed permeability on the 2 d cross section of waste rock piles to consider the impacts from both of finer pores and coarser pores a piecewise constant distribution is proposed to describe the permeability in waste rock piles compared with traditional homogeneous modeling the distribution of permeability can be more easily defined and controlled also various water flow patterns and leaching processes can be well simulated in the piles the proposed water flow model is further coupled with the geochemical reaction calculated from the water film model proposed in part 1 and applied to a full scale waste rock pile to predict the annual lime consumption onsite 2 conceptual models 2 1 water and air flows as waste rock piles are built with rock particles it is naturally porous and the saturation of air phase or water phase inside waste rock piles is denoted by s α which is defined as the fraction of the pore space occupied by that phase 1 s α θ α ϕ where θ α is the volume content for phase α and ϕ is the porosity here the sum of the air a and water w saturations is equal to unity 2 s α s w 1 furthermore the effective saturation for phase α α is defined as 3 s eα s α s α min s α max s α min where s α min and s α max are minimum and maximum saturations for phase α respectively at the darcy scale the capillary pressure p c in the pore is defined as the pressure m l t2 difference between water and air 4 p c p a p w van genuchten 1980 introduced an equation to estimate the relationship between capillary pressure and the effective water saturation as 5 p c p g s ew 1 m g 1 1 n g where p g is defined as the capillary entry pressure the exponents m g and n g are the coefficients related to the pore size distribution the permeability l2 under unsaturated conditions k α is generally far less than saturated conditions k sα in the porous waste rocks if m g in eq 5 is assumed to be equal to1 1 n g the unsaturated permeability can be calculated by the form proposed by mualem 1976 6 k α k sα 1 s ew κ 1 s ew 1 m g 2 m g 7 k w k sw s ew κ 1 1 s ew 1 m g m g 2 where the connectivity factor κ can be treated as a fitting parameter of the model by applying darcy s law q α are the velocities l t of air and water inside the pile and they can be determined by using 8 q α k α μ α p α ρ α g where μ α is the viscosity m lt for phase α g is the gravity vector l t2 ρ α is the density m l3 for phase α additional mass conservation laws for both of air and water phases are applied to ensure that the darcy s equations are closed 9 t ρ α s α ρ α q α 0 2 2 finer pores and coarser pores due to variable day to day blasting loading hauling dumping and dozing in three dimensions on many waste rock piles pore sizes are often effectively random thus it is generally believed that the permeability inside waste rock piles should have certain kinds of distribution pattern this means that the porosity ϕ and all parameters related to water retention in eqs 6 7 should not be considered as constants like many traditional modeling studies of waste rock have done in real full scale situations the porosity and water retention properties can be better expressed as probability density functions pdfs in the 3 d domain of waste rock piles to reflect these hydrogeological heterogeneities as a preliminary study this paper only treats the saturated permeability k s on the 2 d cross section of waste rock piles as a pdf and leaves all other parameters as constants for simplification although size distributions for waste rock more likely follows non symmetric distributions the translation of particle size distribution to pore size distribution and even to permeability distribution is not easy and straightforward generally finite statistical moments can be calculated based on waste rock samples to define the permeability distribution for the whole pile when those collected samples are representative for simplicity of calculation this paper proposes that the saturated permeability k s inside waste rock piles follows a piecewise constant distribution to consider the effect of both finer pores and coarser pores the corresponding pdf for k s is calculated as follows 10 f x e b a a x b 1 e c b b x c 0 x a and x c where a is the lower boundary of saturated permeability for finer pore portion b is the transition boundary of saturated permeability between the finer pore portion and the coarser pore portion no permeability gap and c is the higher boundary of saturated permeability for the coarser pore portion in addition e is the fraction for the finer pore portion and 1 e is the fraction for the coarser pore portion in the waste rock piles a diagram of the proposed pdf and its accumulated distribution function cdf that reflects eq 10 is illustrated in fig 1 the advantage of this piecewise constant distribution is that 1 it simply divides the domain into a finer pore portion and a coarser pore portion or many pore portions if needed to investigate their effects on the water flow and 2 it assumes that the pdf are constant in the finer pore potion and the coarser pore portion respectively thus the mean effective permeability of two pore portions can be easily calculated and scaled for model calibration the pdf for permeability is discontinuous between finer pore potion and coarser pore potion but the permeability is continuous between these two pore potions this could reduce computational difficulties during simulation in eq 10 the accurate values of a b and c inside waste rock piles could be difficult to define or to measure directly however the ratio between mean permeability from finer pores and coarser pores can be roughly estimated as the distribution is uniform for each pore portion the mean saturated permeability for finer pores is calculated as b a 2 and that for coarser pores is c b 2 by adjusting the ratio of b a 2 to c b 2 and the ratio of e to 1 e the volume ratio of finer pores to coarser pores a stochastic distribution of saturated permeability k s that considers the effect of both finer pores and coarser pores can be mathematically defined to simulate the heterogeneity of water flows inside waste rock piles the purpose of this study is to test and demonstrate the proposed pdf concept for simulating the heterogeneity of water flow inside waste rock piles the real hydrogeological conditions in the field are much more complicated than the proposed mathematical simplification on the permeability here in the future the proposed method may be further refined by extending pdfs from saturated permeability to other parameters related to hydrogeology as long as the corresponding characterizations are available 2 3 reactant product transport and heat transfer to investigate the transport of all species in the water phase related to geochemical processes inside a waste rock pile a general species transport equation is adopted as 11 t θ w c i θ w d i c i q w c i q i where c i and d i are the concentration and diffusion coefficient for species i q w is the darcy s velocity for water phase calculated from eq 8 and q i sink or source term is the generation or consumption rate similarly the supply of oxygen with air flow concentrationc o 2 for geochemical reactions can be calculated as 12 t θ α c o 2 d o 2 c o 2 q α c o 2 q o 2 where d o 2 is the effective oxygen diffusivity l2 t and q o 2 sink term is the oxygen consumption rate m l3 t to evaluate the effect of reaction heat and its impact on air flow oxygen supply for ard ml reaction the equation for heat transfer in the waste rock pile is also included 13 c p ρ t t c w ρ w t q w λ t q h where c p is the specific heat capacity q h denotes the heat generation rate from geochemical reactions the effective mass density ρ and the effective thermal conductivity λ are defined as 14 c p ρ ϕ ρ w s w c w 1 ϕ ρ s c s 15 λ λ dry s w λ wet λ dry where c w and c s are heat capacities for water and solid waste rock particles λ dry and λ wet are the thermal conductivities for waste rocks in dry and wet conditions respectively the ideal gas law is then applied to link the calculated temperature t to air pressure p a and air density ρ a to adjust the air flow calculation in eq 12 as source sink term for eqs 11 13 q i q o2and q h can be calculated from the water film model proposed in part 1 or any other particle level geochemical model for example the calculation of q i q o2 and q h based on the water film model proposed in part 1 can be found as bellows 16 q i k us i β γ δ 17 q o 2 k us o 2 β γ δ where k us i and k us o2 is the inward or outward flux m l2 t for species ii and oxygen at the upper surface us in the water film model respectively β is the surface to volume ratio 1 l measured from waste rock pile γ is area ratio for sulphide minerals on the surface of waste rock particles and δ is the area ratio for water coverage on the waste rock surface which can be roughly assumed to be proportional to the water content θ w 18 δ θ w ϕ the heat generation is not simulated in the particle level water film model q h in eq 13 is calculated from q o 2 which is based on the assumption of a simplified pyrite oxidation kinetic fes 2 7 2o 2 h 2 o fe 2 2so 4 2 2h 19 20 q h h r q o 2 v o 2 where h r is the heat of reaction for the oxidation reaction and v o2is the stoichiometry coefficient of oxygen in the reaction equation 3 case study to demonstrate the above methodology the conceptual models proposed in this paper combined with the particle level water film model proposed in part 1 are further applied to the main waste rock dump at the equity silver mine as a full scale case study the equity silver mine is located in the central interior of british columbia canada the waste rock piles at this mine cumulatively contain about 80 million metric tonnes of waste rocks which have been producing ard since the 1980s they were built with a combination of end dumping and push dumping methods sometimes with and sometimes without intervening dozing changing from day to day and from year to year as the piles grew irregularly in height and lateral area at closure there was additional dozing to recontour the piles extensive research has been conducted at the equity silver since the 1990s which focused on hydrogeological characterization cover system modeling modeling of infiltration geochemical reaction seepage flow and drainage chemistry etc the case study focuses on the main waste rock dump at the equity silver for simplification a 2 d model is built and applied to a typical 2 d cross section from the main waste rock the rock thickness contours of the main dump and the location of the 2 d cross section can be found in fig 2 3 1 environmental input a schematic of the 2 d cross section is plotted in fig 3 the top layer of the waste rock pile in vertical cross section receives the climatic precipitation from the open environment the net infiltration is adjusted by the net infiltration rate ir in addition the open environmental air temperature is also applied to the top layer both the precipitation and the temperature data are collected from the weather station at the equity silver which are extracted from environmental canada website the ph of precipitation is set constantly to 5 5 during the whole simulation which is consistent to the yearly average value measured at this site the air pressure distribution adjusted by elevation gravity effect is applied on the top and slope surfaces of the pile so the air advection can be well simulated in addition open boundary conditions are also set on the top and slope surfaces for calculating oxygen transport which means at these surfaces the gradient of oxygen concentration is zero when air exits and oxygen concentration equals to the ambient atmospheric value when air ingresses the water table was assumed to lie below the base of the pile and a free drainage condition was applied at the bottom of the cross section this boundary condition reproduces the effect of a coarse and well drained rock layer which is often observed at the base of a waste rock pile fala et al 2005 3 2 parameters for the study the key parameters to control the heterogeneous distribution of water flow in waste rock piles are a b c and e which are defined in eq 10 as these parameters are proposed and defined theoretically and no clear boundary can be provide to distinguish finer pores from coarser pores at this stage some estimation and simplification have to be applied in this case study nichol et al 2005 and webb et al 2008 found that the wetting front velocities in coarse heterogeneous material travel several orders of magnitude faster than the mean water velocity in finer waste rocks so the mean permeability for coarser pores c b 2 is generally assumed here to be 1000 times higher than mean permeability for finer pores b a 2 in this study the mean saturated permeability for finer pores is translated from hydraulic conductivity 1e 3 m s based on the previous study of part 1 in terms of volume fraction for finer pore portion e it is difficult to get a rough estimation because it cannot be reliably measured in situ in full scale waste rock based on previous studies on this site a parametric study e for 90 and 80 is performed to evaluate how it impacts on the water flow pattern within the pile in addition an increasing number of studies indicate that the water flow through coarser pores may still be dominated by capillarity neuner et al 2013 appels et al 2018 so that water retention shown in eqs 5 7 can also apply to them for simplification all parameters related to water retention are shared between finer pores and coarser pores in this study other parameters related to water and air flow and those parameters that determine oxygen transport heat transfer and the leaching process are given in table 1 the water film model proposed in part 1 is adopted to calculate the particle level geochemical reaction and the water film thickness is set to 100um other related parameters are described in that first paper in this study the simulation time period is from 1981 to 2002 22 years for the time period 1981 1990 10 years insufficient weather monitoring data are available so yearly average precipitation and temperature are set in that time period the simulation results for this initial time period are used to balance geochemical reaction and mass transport within the pile and to initialize the detailed simulation for the subsequent time period 1991 to 2002 12 years during which measured precipitation and temperature data are applied the overlying soil till cover system approximately 1 m thickness is included in this model starting from jan 1994 which is based on the fact that the cover was installed between 1990 and 1994 and completed in 1994 the net infiltration rate ir decreases after the cover is completed see in table 1 which is pre estimated by ma et al 2020 this case study is based on monthly average precipitation and temperature so hourly or daily response in seepage water and leaching geochemistry cannot be assessed at this stage as mentioned above the waste rock piles are built with a complex spatial and temporal combination of various dumping and dozing patterns thus the random spatial pattern is adopted for permeability distribution in this study in addition the spatial pattern for modeling is not only dependent on the pdf shown in eq 10 but also dependent on the mesh grids that mathematically generates the pattern the effect of mesh shape and the mesh size which are also investigated in this study a parametric study on mesh grid is performed 16337 triangle elements dense mesh 3954 triangle elements coarse mesh 8904 sweeping quadrilateral elements oriented mesh the oriented mesh scenario simulates the waste rock as piled layer by layer each with its own pdf however each layer shares the same permeability distribution in this case study these models are built and implemented in the commercial software package comsol 5 3a all physical equations are solved in fully coupled manner backward differentiation algorithm bda is adopted for controlling calculation time step the initial time step is 0 001 s and maximum time step is 43 200 s the simulation results are automatically saved every 86 400 s 1 day the cpu time per realization ranges from 7 days to 12 days for different scenarios see scenario definition in section 3 3 3 3 case study results in summary 5 scenarios in total are simulated for the vertical 2 d cross section through the main waste rock dump at the equity silver mine 1 the original model with homogeneous saturated permeability a b e 100 2 higher finer pore portion e 90 with coarser mesh 3 less finer pore portion e 80 with coarser mesh 4 less finer pore portion with dense mesh and 5 less finer pore portion with oriented mesh the randomly generated distribution of saturated permeability for the four heterogeneous scenarios are plotted in fig 4 fig 5 displays the simulated streamlines for water flow in the 2 d cross section for all 5 scenarios which suggests various water flow patterns and their pathways inside the waste rock pile detail calculation equations can be found in the comsol manual for all streamline generation integration tolerance is 1e 3 maximum integration number is 1e6 and stationary point stop tolerance 1e 3 for the homogeneous scenario the results show that the water infiltrates into the top surface and passes vertically downward through the pile in straight lines as the permeability is constant everywhere for the coarse mesh e 90 scenario the streamlines combine together when they move deep into the piles and the streamline density is significantly reduced when they leave the pile from bottom this observation of combined streamlines has been confirmed by previous preferential flow test work li 1999 the scenarios of coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 appear to have similar streamline patterns and the streamline density for these two scenarios is found to be higher than that obtained in the second scenario e 90 the streamline pattern in the last oriented mesh e 80 scenario seems completely different as the water flow in the slope region right part of the cross section tends to move along the layer direction while going down to the bottom of the pile as the pdf indicates only the probability of distribution the same permeability pdf may create different spatial patterns due to different generations impacted by mesh grid size and shape random seeds etc as a result the water flow pattern may not be completely the same for two scenarios that share the same pdf of permeability at this stage the actual water flow pattern inside a waste rock pile is technically difficult to be measure directly thus mine site engineers usually pay more attention to the combined effect of all these internal water flows which is the integration of all water flows discharged at the bottom and received in collection ditches fig 6 provides the comparison of the total water flow rates leaving from the simulated cross section for all 5 scenarios it is shown that the total flow rate profile of homogenous scenario is different from those of heterogeneous scenarios the scenarios of coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 have almost same total flow rates profile this means that even though spatial patterns of permeability distribution and streamlines are not identical for those scenarios having the same permeability pdf their total impacts on the output integration of the water flow discharged at the pile bottom are almost same a potential explanation is that the dimensional scale of higher permeability zone is much less than the dimensional scale of the whole pile so that the permeability field is well mixed and the effects of heterogeneities are averaged out in addition fig 6 suggests that lower e may bring higher fluctuations into the total water flow profile such highly variable fluctuations in the heterogeneous simulations are typical of full scale waste rock piles when measured at high frequencies morin 2019 fig 7 shows the calculated iron concentration distributions inside the waste rock pile at the end of simulation period for all scenarios the homogenous scenario has the concentration distributed in layers some disturbance can be observed at the left part as the oxygen controlling the reaction is periodically depleted there for all scenarios with heterogeneous saturated permeability the iron concentration distributions are also heterogeneous however the maximum level of iron concentration is in the same scale and located close to the middle of the cross section the total effect of the iron concentration distribution was also investigated which is defined as the integration of iron discharge rate iron loading from the bottom of the pile fig 8 provides the comparison of the iron loading on temporal scale for all 5 scenarios similar to the comparison of water flow rate the iron loading obtained from the homogeneous scenario has significant difference compared with those from remaining heterogeneous scenarios both scenarios with coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 have almost the same iron loading profile which confirms that the integration of iron discharged at the bottom of the waste rock piles is only dependent on the pdf not on specific spatial pattern of permeability distribution those scenarios with the same saturated permeability pdf should have almost same iron loading profile iron loading is often highly correlated to the acidity kirby and cravotta 2005 as it is at this site and the acidity is generally proportional to the lime consumption used for neutralization and ard treatment at equity silver thus the iron loading is further integrated in the time scale to get the annual iron loading which is compared with the annual lime consumption at this site as iron loading and lime consumption are on different scales the fluctuations of their annual mean values over 12 years are provided and compared in fig 9 the overlying soil cover is implemented in the model starting on jan 1st 1994 whereas the real cover was installed between 1991 and 1994 the comparison before 1994 is not reliable it can be observed that the homogeneous model generally fails to correlate well with the iron loading and the lime consumption at this site after the cover is built the heterogeneous models e 80 is better than e 90 can match the fluctuation of lime computation in most of years except for 1997 and 2002 when the higher than normal lime consumptions are recorded due to unusually wet years 4 conclusions traditional ard ml investigations on waste rock piles are usually performed based on the simplifications of homogeneous material properties however real material properties for waste rock piles are generally heterogeneous in full scale field conditions this paper part 2 adopts pdfs to describe the heterogeneity of the hydrogeological properties for modeling various water flow patterns in waste rock piles in addition the water flow patterns calculated from the proposed method is further integrated with geochemical reactions obtained from water film model proposed in part 1 so that the leaching process of ard ml can be simulated in a more realistic manner the results of the full scale case study show that water flow pathways inside a full scale waste rock piles can be simulated by the proposed model also waste rock piles with different spatial patterns of permeability distribution but with the same permeability pdf may have different water flow patterns and spatial distributions of iron concentrations inside the pile respectively however the total water flow discharge rates and iron loading profiles from the whole waste rock pile are almost the same on the temporal scale this indicates that the pdf of hydrogeological properties controls the total water flow output from waste rock piles regardless of localized difference of water flow pattern as this is a preliminary study the pdf is only applied to the saturated permeability of waste rocks in this case study another limitation is that the proposed piecewise constant pdf model is not benchmarked with other stochastic models as the characterization of grain pore size inside the full scale pile is not sufficient at this stage only comparison between the proposed pdf model and homogeneous model is provided in this paper further investigation on the correlation between particle size distribution and the distribution of water retention properties on the spatial scale is highly recommended for more realistic water

1402,in waste rock piles the leaching process involved in acid rock drainage is mainly controlled by water flow this paper part 2 investigates the effects of heterogeneities on the water flow patterns by applying probability density functions to hydrogeological properties in this study a piecewise constant distribution is proposed to describe the permeability inside waste rock piles which reflects the effect of both finer and coarser pores compared with uniform water flow obtained from traditional homogeneous modeling various water flow patterns and their pathways inside waste rock piles can be simulated by the proposed model in addition the leaching process is also investigated by coupling the calculated water flow with the geochemical reaction based on the water film model proposed in part 1 for demonstration these models are integrated and applied to the full scale waste rock pile at equity silver mine in british columbia canada because the iron loading is highly correlated to the acidity at this site it is found that the fluctuation of annual lime consumption for neutralization at this site can be well predicted by the integrated model in addition the results indicate that waste rock piles with different spatial patterns of permeability distribution but with the same probability density function may have different water flow patterns and spatial distributions of iron concentrations inside the pile however the total water flow discharge rate and iron loading profiles from the pile are almost the same on the temporal scale keywords acid rock drainage waste rock pile heterogeneity probability density functions water flow pattern leaching process 1 introductions open pit hard rock mines can generate a huge amount of waste rocks during mining typically many 106 to more than 109 t over time waste rocks are deposited large waste rock piles some waste rock piles may create significant environmental footprints and cover a few hundred hectares when sulfide minerals enclosed in waste rocks are exposed to the open environment and accessed by air and water they oxidize gradually generate protons and further dissolve metal ions into the water flowing through this geochemical and transport process is often called acid rock drainage and metal leaching ard ml parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 dold 2017 it is believed that ard ml is mainly controlled by two factors the geochemical reaction and the water flowing through part 1 of this series paper has discussed the geochemical reaction by proposing a new water film model to consider the impact of water film thickness oxygen concentration and geochemical kinetics on the total product generation at the particle level this paper part 2 focuses on describing the water flow inside the waste rock piles and how the water transports those generated geochemical products out of the piles in the part 1 paper ma et al 2019 a pile scale mass transport model including water and air flows reactant product transport and heat transfer coupled with the proposed water film model have been proposed and validated through a field scale case study similar to other modeling studies da silva et al 2009 lefebvre et al 2001a lefebvre et al 2001b mayer et al 2002 the mass transport models in part 1 assumes that waste rock properties are distributed homogeneously on spatial scale so that all parameters related to the waste rock properties are set to constants within the whole pile or its sub structures however in real field conditions those properties especially hydrological properties are naturally heterogeneous as their particle size may vary from several micrometers to several meters for example li 1999 found that the field waste rock piles are usually complex structures and the heterogeneity can result in layers with large ranges of particle sizes and or physically distinct layers these heterogeneous features of full scale waste rock piles have been known and documented for many decades morin et al 1991 the heterogeneity in permeability and pore connection may create local enhanced pathways for water to flow through with higher speed this phenomena is commonly called as preferential flow muniruzzaman and pedretti 2020 which has been widely observed in many waste rock piles trinchero et al 2011 eriksson et al 1997 in terms of the volumetric percentage of the preferential flow in waste rock piles hendrickx and flury 2001 identified that it is only a small fraction of the pore space however ma et al 2020 adopted a dual permeability model to assess the water flow inside waste rock piles and found that the total drainage water discharged from the piles are mainly from preferential flow field evidence supporting this observation requires high frequency measurements of flows such as hourly to detect the fast passage of water in preferential channels such high frequency monitoring is rare for full scale piles but results from spectral analysis morin 2019 support this observation that preferential flow dominates as a result the heterogeneous hydrological properties inside waste rock piles and the resulted various water flow patterns should be included in modeling for better prediction of ard ml for modeling various water flow patterns inside waste rock piles molson et al 2005 and fala et al 2005 found that preferential flow channels can be reproduced from mesh grid orientation effects of the geometry model in terms of physical mechanisms of water flow it is believed that the heterogeneous distribution of permeability is one of key mechanisms that generates various flow patterns through waste rock piles pedretti et al 2016 pedretti et al 2017b pedretti et al 2017a pedretti et al 2020 developed a conceptualized stochastic modeling framework based on probability density function which assumes a bundle of stream tubes inside waste rock piles to assess the impact of heterogeneity of minerals and hydraulic conductivity the drawback is that the discretization into 1 d models is necessary for simplification lahmira et al 2017 divided waste rock into four groups with different water retention properties based on different grain sizes coarse intermediate fine and very fine and randomly distributed them into the mesh grids of pile geometry to simulate preferential water flow pathways the limitation of adopting different waste rock groups is that the real permeability can be continuous rather than discrete in nature and may follow some specific stochastic distribution in addition discrete permeability boundaries between different mesh grids could create significant computational difficulties this paper adopts the concept of probability density function to describe distributed permeability on the 2 d cross section of waste rock piles to consider the impacts from both of finer pores and coarser pores a piecewise constant distribution is proposed to describe the permeability in waste rock piles compared with traditional homogeneous modeling the distribution of permeability can be more easily defined and controlled also various water flow patterns and leaching processes can be well simulated in the piles the proposed water flow model is further coupled with the geochemical reaction calculated from the water film model proposed in part 1 and applied to a full scale waste rock pile to predict the annual lime consumption onsite 2 conceptual models 2 1 water and air flows as waste rock piles are built with rock particles it is naturally porous and the saturation of air phase or water phase inside waste rock piles is denoted by s α which is defined as the fraction of the pore space occupied by that phase 1 s α θ α ϕ where θ α is the volume content for phase α and ϕ is the porosity here the sum of the air a and water w saturations is equal to unity 2 s α s w 1 furthermore the effective saturation for phase α α is defined as 3 s eα s α s α min s α max s α min where s α min and s α max are minimum and maximum saturations for phase α respectively at the darcy scale the capillary pressure p c in the pore is defined as the pressure m l t2 difference between water and air 4 p c p a p w van genuchten 1980 introduced an equation to estimate the relationship between capillary pressure and the effective water saturation as 5 p c p g s ew 1 m g 1 1 n g where p g is defined as the capillary entry pressure the exponents m g and n g are the coefficients related to the pore size distribution the permeability l2 under unsaturated conditions k α is generally far less than saturated conditions k sα in the porous waste rocks if m g in eq 5 is assumed to be equal to1 1 n g the unsaturated permeability can be calculated by the form proposed by mualem 1976 6 k α k sα 1 s ew κ 1 s ew 1 m g 2 m g 7 k w k sw s ew κ 1 1 s ew 1 m g m g 2 where the connectivity factor κ can be treated as a fitting parameter of the model by applying darcy s law q α are the velocities l t of air and water inside the pile and they can be determined by using 8 q α k α μ α p α ρ α g where μ α is the viscosity m lt for phase α g is the gravity vector l t2 ρ α is the density m l3 for phase α additional mass conservation laws for both of air and water phases are applied to ensure that the darcy s equations are closed 9 t ρ α s α ρ α q α 0 2 2 finer pores and coarser pores due to variable day to day blasting loading hauling dumping and dozing in three dimensions on many waste rock piles pore sizes are often effectively random thus it is generally believed that the permeability inside waste rock piles should have certain kinds of distribution pattern this means that the porosity ϕ and all parameters related to water retention in eqs 6 7 should not be considered as constants like many traditional modeling studies of waste rock have done in real full scale situations the porosity and water retention properties can be better expressed as probability density functions pdfs in the 3 d domain of waste rock piles to reflect these hydrogeological heterogeneities as a preliminary study this paper only treats the saturated permeability k s on the 2 d cross section of waste rock piles as a pdf and leaves all other parameters as constants for simplification although size distributions for waste rock more likely follows non symmetric distributions the translation of particle size distribution to pore size distribution and even to permeability distribution is not easy and straightforward generally finite statistical moments can be calculated based on waste rock samples to define the permeability distribution for the whole pile when those collected samples are representative for simplicity of calculation this paper proposes that the saturated permeability k s inside waste rock piles follows a piecewise constant distribution to consider the effect of both finer pores and coarser pores the corresponding pdf for k s is calculated as follows 10 f x e b a a x b 1 e c b b x c 0 x a and x c where a is the lower boundary of saturated permeability for finer pore portion b is the transition boundary of saturated permeability between the finer pore portion and the coarser pore portion no permeability gap and c is the higher boundary of saturated permeability for the coarser pore portion in addition e is the fraction for the finer pore portion and 1 e is the fraction for the coarser pore portion in the waste rock piles a diagram of the proposed pdf and its accumulated distribution function cdf that reflects eq 10 is illustrated in fig 1 the advantage of this piecewise constant distribution is that 1 it simply divides the domain into a finer pore portion and a coarser pore portion or many pore portions if needed to investigate their effects on the water flow and 2 it assumes that the pdf are constant in the finer pore potion and the coarser pore portion respectively thus the mean effective permeability of two pore portions can be easily calculated and scaled for model calibration the pdf for permeability is discontinuous between finer pore potion and coarser pore potion but the permeability is continuous between these two pore potions this could reduce computational difficulties during simulation in eq 10 the accurate values of a b and c inside waste rock piles could be difficult to define or to measure directly however the ratio between mean permeability from finer pores and coarser pores can be roughly estimated as the distribution is uniform for each pore portion the mean saturated permeability for finer pores is calculated as b a 2 and that for coarser pores is c b 2 by adjusting the ratio of b a 2 to c b 2 and the ratio of e to 1 e the volume ratio of finer pores to coarser pores a stochastic distribution of saturated permeability k s that considers the effect of both finer pores and coarser pores can be mathematically defined to simulate the heterogeneity of water flows inside waste rock piles the purpose of this study is to test and demonstrate the proposed pdf concept for simulating the heterogeneity of water flow inside waste rock piles the real hydrogeological conditions in the field are much more complicated than the proposed mathematical simplification on the permeability here in the future the proposed method may be further refined by extending pdfs from saturated permeability to other parameters related to hydrogeology as long as the corresponding characterizations are available 2 3 reactant product transport and heat transfer to investigate the transport of all species in the water phase related to geochemical processes inside a waste rock pile a general species transport equation is adopted as 11 t θ w c i θ w d i c i q w c i q i where c i and d i are the concentration and diffusion coefficient for species i q w is the darcy s velocity for water phase calculated from eq 8 and q i sink or source term is the generation or consumption rate similarly the supply of oxygen with air flow concentrationc o 2 for geochemical reactions can be calculated as 12 t θ α c o 2 d o 2 c o 2 q α c o 2 q o 2 where d o 2 is the effective oxygen diffusivity l2 t and q o 2 sink term is the oxygen consumption rate m l3 t to evaluate the effect of reaction heat and its impact on air flow oxygen supply for ard ml reaction the equation for heat transfer in the waste rock pile is also included 13 c p ρ t t c w ρ w t q w λ t q h where c p is the specific heat capacity q h denotes the heat generation rate from geochemical reactions the effective mass density ρ and the effective thermal conductivity λ are defined as 14 c p ρ ϕ ρ w s w c w 1 ϕ ρ s c s 15 λ λ dry s w λ wet λ dry where c w and c s are heat capacities for water and solid waste rock particles λ dry and λ wet are the thermal conductivities for waste rocks in dry and wet conditions respectively the ideal gas law is then applied to link the calculated temperature t to air pressure p a and air density ρ a to adjust the air flow calculation in eq 12 as source sink term for eqs 11 13 q i q o2and q h can be calculated from the water film model proposed in part 1 or any other particle level geochemical model for example the calculation of q i q o2 and q h based on the water film model proposed in part 1 can be found as bellows 16 q i k us i β γ δ 17 q o 2 k us o 2 β γ δ where k us i and k us o2 is the inward or outward flux m l2 t for species ii and oxygen at the upper surface us in the water film model respectively β is the surface to volume ratio 1 l measured from waste rock pile γ is area ratio for sulphide minerals on the surface of waste rock particles and δ is the area ratio for water coverage on the waste rock surface which can be roughly assumed to be proportional to the water content θ w 18 δ θ w ϕ the heat generation is not simulated in the particle level water film model q h in eq 13 is calculated from q o 2 which is based on the assumption of a simplified pyrite oxidation kinetic fes 2 7 2o 2 h 2 o fe 2 2so 4 2 2h 19 20 q h h r q o 2 v o 2 where h r is the heat of reaction for the oxidation reaction and v o2is the stoichiometry coefficient of oxygen in the reaction equation 3 case study to demonstrate the above methodology the conceptual models proposed in this paper combined with the particle level water film model proposed in part 1 are further applied to the main waste rock dump at the equity silver mine as a full scale case study the equity silver mine is located in the central interior of british columbia canada the waste rock piles at this mine cumulatively contain about 80 million metric tonnes of waste rocks which have been producing ard since the 1980s they were built with a combination of end dumping and push dumping methods

d cross section from the main waste rock the rock thickness contours of the main dump and the location of the 2 d cross section can be found in fig 2 3 1 environmental input a schematic of the 2 d cross section is plotted in fig 3 the top layer of the waste rock pile in vertical cross section receives the climatic precipitation from the open environment the net infiltration is adjusted by the net infiltration rate ir in addition the open environmental air temperature is also applied to the top layer both the precipitation and the temperature data are collected from the weather station at the equity silver which are extracted from environmental canada website the ph of precipitation is set constantly to 5 5 during the whole simulation which is consistent to the yearly average value measured at this site the air pressure distribution adjusted by elevation gravity effect is applied on the top and slope surfaces of the pile so the air advection can be well simulated in addition open boundary conditions are also set on the top and slope surfaces for calculating oxygen transport which means at these surfaces the gradient of oxygen concentration is zero when air exits and oxygen concentration equals to the ambient atmospheric value when air ingresses the water table was assumed to lie below the base of the pile and a free drainage condition was applied at the bottom of the cross section this boundary condition reproduces the effect of a coarse and well drained rock layer which is often observed at the base of a waste rock pile fala et al 2005 3 2 parameters for the study the key parameters to control the heterogeneous distribution of water flow in waste rock piles are a b c and e which are defined in eq 10 as these parameters are proposed and defined theoretically and no clear boundary can be provide to distinguish finer pores from coarser pores at this stage some estimation and simplification have to be applied in this case study nichol et al 2005 and webb et al 2008 found that the wetting front velocities in coarse heterogeneous material travel several orders of magnitude faster than the mean water velocity in finer waste rocks so the mean permeability for coarser pores c b 2 is generally assumed here to be 1000 times higher than mean permeability for finer pores b a 2 in this study the mean saturated permeability for finer pores is translated from hydraulic conductivity 1e 3 m s based on the previous study of part 1 in terms of volume fraction for finer pore portion e it is difficult to get a rough estimation because it cannot be reliably measured in situ in full scale waste rock based on previous studies on this site a parametric study e for 90 and 80 is performed to evaluate how it impacts on the water flow pattern within the pile in addition an increasing number of studies indicate that the water flow through coarser pores may still be dominated by capillarity neuner et al 2013 appels et al 2018 so that water retention shown in eqs 5 7 can also apply to them for simplification all parameters related to water retention are shared between finer pores and coarser pores in this study other parameters related to water and air flow and those parameters that determine oxygen transport heat transfer and the leaching process are given in table 1 the water film model proposed in part 1 is adopted to calculate the particle level geochemical reaction and the water film thickness is set to 100um other related parameters are described in that first paper in this study the simulation time period is from 1981 to 2002 22 years for the time period 1981 1990 10 years insufficient weather monitoring data are available so yearly average precipitation and temperature are set in that time period the simulation results for this initial time period are used to balance geochemical reaction and mass transport within the pile and to initialize the detailed simulation for the subsequent time period 1991 to 2002 12 years during which measured precipitation and temperature data are applied the overlying soil till cover system approximately 1 m thickness is included in this model starting from jan 1994 which is based on the fact that the cover was installed between 1990 and 1994 and completed in 1994 the net infiltration rate ir decreases after the cover is completed see in table 1 which is pre estimated by ma et al 2020 this case study is based on monthly average precipitation and temperature so hourly or daily response in seepage water and leaching geochemistry cannot be assessed at this stage as mentioned above the waste rock piles are built with a complex spatial and temporal combination of various dumping and dozing patterns thus the random spatial pattern is adopted for permeability distribution in this study in addition the spatial pattern for modeling is not only dependent on the pdf shown in eq 10 but also dependent on the mesh grids that mathematically generates the pattern the effect of mesh shape and the mesh size which are also investigated in this study a parametric study on mesh grid is performed 16337 triangle elements dense mesh 3954 triangle elements coarse mesh 8904 sweeping quadrilateral elements oriented mesh the oriented mesh scenario simulates the waste rock as piled layer by layer each with its own pdf however each layer shares the same permeability distribution in this case study these models are built and implemented in the commercial software package comsol 5 3a all physical equations are solved in fully coupled manner backward differentiation algorithm bda is adopted for controlling calculation time step the initial time step is 0 001 s and maximum time step is 43 200 s the simulation results are automatically saved every 86 400 s 1 day the cpu time per realization ranges from 7 days to 12 days for different scenarios see scenario definition in section 3 3 3 3 case study results in summary 5 scenarios in total are simulated for the vertical 2 d cross section through the main waste rock dump at the equity silver mine 1 the original model with homogeneous saturated permeability a b e 100 2 higher finer pore portion e 90 with coarser mesh 3 less finer pore portion e 80 with coarser mesh 4 less finer pore portion with dense mesh and 5 less finer pore portion with oriented mesh the randomly generated distribution of saturated permeability for the four heterogeneous scenarios are plotted in fig 4 fig 5 displays the simulated streamlines for water flow in the 2 d cross section for all 5 scenarios which suggests various water flow patterns and their pathways inside the waste rock pile detail calculation equations can be found in the comsol manual for all streamline generation integration tolerance is 1e 3 maximum integration number is 1e6 and stationary point stop tolerance 1e 3 for the homogeneous scenario the results show that the water infiltrates into the top surface and passes vertically downward through the pile in straight lines as the permeability is constant everywhere for the coarse mesh e 90 scenario the streamlines combine together when they move deep into the piles and the streamline density is significantly reduced when they leave the pile from bottom this observation of combined streamlines has been confirmed by previous preferential flow test work li 1999 the scenarios of coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 appear to have similar streamline patterns and the streamline density for these two scenarios is found to be higher than that obtained in the second scenario e 90 the streamline pattern in the last oriented mesh e 80 scenario seems completely different as the water flow in the slope region right part of the cross section tends to move along the layer direction while going down to the bottom of the pile as the pdf indicates only the probability of distribution the same permeability pdf may create different spatial patterns due to different generations impacted by mesh grid size and shape random seeds etc as a result the water flow pattern may not be completely the same for two scenarios that share the same pdf of permeability at this stage the actual water flow pattern inside a waste rock pile is technically difficult to be measure directly thus mine site engineers usually pay more attention to the combined effect of all these internal water flows which is the integration of all water flows discharged at the bottom and received in collection ditches fig 6 provides the comparison of the total water flow rates leaving from the simulated cross section for all 5 scenarios it is shown that the total flow rate profile of homogenous scenario is different from those of heterogeneous scenarios the scenarios of coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 have almost same total flow rates profile this means that even though spatial patterns of permeability distribution and streamlines are not identical for those scenarios having the same permeability pdf their total impacts on the output integration of the water flow discharged at the pile bottom are almost same a potential explanation is that the dimensional scale of higher permeability zone is much less than the dimensional scale of the whole pile so that the permeability field is well mixed and the effects of heterogeneities are averaged out in addition fig 6 suggests that lower e may bring higher fluctuations into the total water flow profile such highly variable fluctuations in the heterogeneous simulations are typical of full scale waste rock piles when measured at high frequencies morin 2019 fig 7 shows the calculated iron concentration distributions inside the waste rock pile at the end of simulation period for all scenarios the homogenous scenario has the concentration distributed in layers some disturbance can be observed at the left part as the oxygen controlling the reaction is periodically depleted there for all scenarios with heterogeneous saturated permeability the iron concentration distributions are also heterogeneous however the maximum level of iron concentration is in the same scale and located close to the middle of the cross section the total effect of the iron concentration distribution was also investigated which is defined as the integration of iron discharge rate iron loading from the bottom of the pile fig 8 provides the comparison of the iron loading on temporal scale for all 5 scenarios similar to the comparison of water flow rate the iron loading obtained from the homogeneous scenario has significant difference compared with those from remaining heterogeneous scenarios both scenarios with coarse mesh e 80 and dense mesh e 80 have almost the same iron loading profile which confirms that the integration of iron discharged at the bottom of the waste rock piles is only dependent on the pdf not on specific spatial pattern of permeability distribution those scenarios with the same saturated permeability pdf should have almost same iron loading profile iron loading is often highly correlated to the acidity kirby and cravotta 2005 as it is at this site and the acidity is generally proportional to the lime consumption used for neutralization and ard treatment at equity silver thus the iron loading is further integrated in the time scale to get the annual iron loading which is compared with the annual lime consumption at this site as iron loading and lime consumption are on different scales the fluctuations of their annual mean values over 12 years are provided and compared in fig 9 the overlying soil cover is implemented in the model starting on jan 1st 1994 whereas the real cover was installed between 1991 and 1994 the comparison before 1994 is not reliable it can be observed that the homogeneous model generally fails to correlate well with the iron loading and the lime consumption at this site after the cover is built the heterogeneous models e 80 is better than e 90 can match the fluctuation of lime computation in most of years except for 1997 and 2002 when the higher than normal lime consumptions are recorded due to unusually wet years 4 conclusions traditional ard ml investigations on waste rock piles are usually performed based on the simplifications of homogeneous material properties however real material properties for waste rock piles are generally heterogeneous in full scale field conditions this paper part 2 adopts pdfs to describe the heterogeneity of the hydrogeological properties for modeling various water flow patterns in waste rock piles in addition the water flow patterns calculated from the proposed method is further integrated with geochemical reactions obtained from water film model proposed in part 1 so that the leaching process of ard ml can be simulated in a more realistic manner the results of the full scale case study show that water flow pathways inside a full scale waste rock piles can be simulated by the proposed model also waste rock piles with different spatial patterns of permeability distribution but with the same permeability pdf may have different water flow patterns and spatial distributions of iron concentrations inside the pile respectively however the total water flow discharge rates and iron loading profiles from the whole waste rock pile are almost the same on the temporal scale this indicates that the pdf of hydrogeological properties controls the total water flow output from waste rock piles regardless of localized difference of water flow pattern as this is a preliminary study the pdf is only applied to the saturated permeability of waste rocks in this case study another limitation is that the proposed piecewise constant pdf model is not benchmarked with other stochastic models as the characterization of grain pore size inside the full scale pile is not sufficient at this stage only comparison between the proposed pdf model and homogeneous model is provided in this paper further investigation on the correlation between particle size distribution and the distribution of water retention properties on the spatial scale is highly recommended for more realistic water

1403,in this study an integrated framework is proposed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy water nexus the framework has two components the optimized interval solutions generation of unknown market quotation and environment situation through the novel interval fuzzy expectation programming and the post optimization decision making of the tradeoff between system risk and return through risk explicit interval programming an optimization model based on the framework was developed from a real description for agricultural water resources system of guangdong province under considering various crop multiple water sources and the related energy consumption in irrigation and drainage the impact of energy consumption and risk level control on water resources allocation among different crops and system benefits were analyzed the results indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints risk tradeoff based results can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon oriented agricultural water resources management schemes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated optimization framework agricultural water resources management energy consumption control interval fuzzy expectation programming risk analysis 1 introduction coped with the competition for water system services from other economic sectors agricultural water resources consumption is confronting more and more challenges from various resources and environmental aspect affection qin et al 2020 xue et al 2017 according to the statistical information agricultural system production accounts for 30 of the global energy consumption 92 of the human water footprint and over 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 as population growth oriented food needs and agricultural system development in future with the limited land expansion water and energy resources control could be included in regional agricultural water resources management abrishambaf et al 2020 geng et al 2014 karamian et al 2021 lee et al 2020 in addition the uncertainties in water resource system and technical economical parameters and the complexities relationships among water land crops and energy have brought a greater pressure li et al 2007 sun et al 2020 ma et al 2020a 2020b xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore agricultural water and land resources management schemes under water energy nexus for supporting regional agricultural system development under considering the irrigation and drainage consumed energy from different water sources the land competition between food and energy crops and the co ordination of supply and demand for food energy water and land many optimization methods have been used to solve agricultural water resource management and land planning problems such as nonlinear programming and multi objective programming interval parameter programming ipp chen et al 2020 fu et al 2018 fuzzy mathematical programming fmp mathematical programming fmp ji et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 and stochastic mathematical programming smp ermolieva et al 2015 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020a 2020b these optimization methods help to provide decision makers with the best strategy for achieving their objectives e g minimum system cost maximum economic benefit maximum environmental safety and maximum social satisfaction under all considerations for example luo et al 2003 proposed an inexact two stage stochastic nonlinear programming model for water resources management of an agricultural system with water trading under uncertainty lu et al 2008 proposed an inexact programming method to obtain optimal water allocation strategies for agricultural irrigation systems tan and zhang 2018 developed a robust fractional programming method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization to improve agricultural water use efficiency under uncertainty zhang et al 2020 developed an interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming model to provide risk averse solutions with recourse to irrigation water management yue and guo 2021 presented a model to explore sustainable agricultural management measures with minimum water and carbon footprint as optimization targets from the previous studies the comprehensive complexities among multiple factors in agricultural water resources system have led to more difficult in uncertainties reflection interval parameter programming and fuzzy mathematical programming would be relatively good choices for uncertainties expression with a less information for complexity description in agricultural system martinez et al 2018 li et al 2019b however there are two problems in the integrated framework of interval parameter programming and fuzzy mathematical programming firstly fuzzy optimization models could provide more effective tools to handle uncertainty and in reality it is hard to predict accurately the expected values of fuzzy information due to the complexity of agricultural water resources system ebrahimnejad and verdegay 2014 kumar and kaur 2014 wang and peng 2019 secondly the interval solutions would be faced with the infeasibility and non optimality of the actual implementation scheme and it does not demonstrate the decision maker s trade off between systemic benefits and systemic risks zhou et al 2009 zou et al 2010 ji et al 2017 ji et al 2018 therefore in order to deal with the above problems the objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework through proposing the risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming for agricultural water resources allocation and land management under energy consumption control and risk attitude in the framework interval parameter programming fuzzy expectation programming and risk explicit interval programming are integrated and uncertainties can be directly integrated into the optimization process through reflecting the uncertain parameters and coefficients as interval values fuzzy sets and their combinations moreover the developed model will be applied to planning irrigation water resources allocation and crop land pattern under considering multiple water sources and energy resources constraints in guangdong province the main contributions of this work are summarized as 1 the optimal irrigation water resources and planting area allocation under different energy consumption levels is analyzed and compared at regional level 2 the explicit solution with the system cost risk tradeoff information could be provided according to the risk preference of decision maker and 3 the optimized model could be a more effective management tool for making regional reasonable water energy planning strategy under multiple uncertainties 2 methodology 2 1 interval fuzzy expectation programming in general a conventional interval fuzzy linear programming can be expressed as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 1b j 1 n a ij x ij b i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 where c j is a fuzzy number a ij r m n b i r m 1 and r denotes a set of interval numbers in order to reflect the interval range of the fuzzy number the fuzzy number can be converted by the following a trapezoidal fuzzy number r j a lj a uj c j d j is a fuzzy set defined on r and characterized by its membership function μ r r μ r 0 1 2 μ r r l a l r c if r a l c a l 1 if r a l a u r r a u d if r a u a u d where l and r are respectively non decreasing and non increasing functions that characterize the left and right side of the fuzzy number r j assuming that the left and right reference functions are all of the same shape for j 1 n and the following linear combination expresses in the fuzzy objective function p x x 1 x j can be expressed as follows vercher et al 2007 3a p j 1 n r j x j j 1 n a lj x j j 1 n a uj x j j 1 n c j x j j 1 n d j x j def p l x p u x c x d x then we can verify that the α level sets of p have the following form 3b p α inf p α sup p α p l x c x 1 α 1 ρ p u x d x 1 α 1 ρ for α 0 1 and it is easy to obtain the expectation of the fuzzy objective function 3c e sup p 0 1 sup p α d α p u x d x p p 1 3d e inf p 0 1 inf p α d α p l x c x p p 1 therefore we can obtain that 3e e p p l x c x p p 1 p u x d x p p 1 therefore the interval fuzzy linear programming can be converted into the interval fuzzy expectation programming ifep as follows 4a max f e p subject to 4b j 1 n a ij x ij b i i 1 2 m 4c x j 0 according to huang et al 1992 the above model can be solved through the interactive algorithm and transformed to two deterministic sub models e g the lower and upper bounds model and the optimized solutions are expressed as interval numbers 2 2 risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming the interval solution of the ifep model can be calculated with less information and shorter time nonetheless in the real world due to the lack of direct connection between the system benefit and the decision risk it is impractical for the decision maker to make the actual decision directly through the interval solution therefore in order to solve the infeasibility and non optimal problems interval explicit programming can provide the tradeoff information for decision makers with certain risk preference by introducing decision risk function and expected risk level through integrated with the ifep and interval explicit programming the risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming reifep can be proposed and an uncertainty based decision can be achieved through applying the reifep to explore the risk tradeoff in the ifep solutions the corresponding reifep can be formulated as 5a min ξ i j 1 n λ ij a ij a ij x j η i b i b i subject to 5b j 1 n p u x j d x j p p 1 λ 0 p u x j d x j p p 1 p l x j c x j p p 1 f opt λ 0 f opt f opt 5c b i j 1 n a ij x j ξ i 5d λ 0 λ pre 5e 0 λ ij 1 5f x j 0 j where λ 0 is the system aspiration level with a value between 0 and 1 λ ij and η i are real numbers between 0 and 1 ξ i j 1 n λ ij a ij a ij x j η i b i b i is the prescribed system aspiration level is a general arithmetic operator that can be a simple addition a weighted addition simple arithmetic mean weighted arithmetic mean or a max operator the general solution algorithm of the reifep model is illustrated in fig 1 through the solving process of reifep the relationship between risk level and system benefit and the trade off between system explicit risk and benefit can be deeply analyzed 3 system modeling 3 1 overview of the study area guangdong province the largest economic province in china is the core district of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area the region s latitude ranges from 20 13 to 25 31 n while its longitude ranges from 109 39 to 117 19 e as shown in fig 2 the study area includes 21 prefecture level city and 122 county level administrative region the region s administrative area covers 179 725 km2 with a total population of 115 21 million in 2020 the total multi year average water resource under different hydrological guarantee rates is 1962 109 m3 the available area of cultivated land garden and forest land is 2 593 106 ha 1 256 106 ha and 1 001 106 ha respectively the area is a subtropical monsoon climate and the annual average temperature is 22 8 c with a maximum temperature of 40 0 c and minimum temperature of 0 7 c early rice peanut soybean potato and cassava are the summer major crop form may to october and sugarcane corn and late rice are the main autumn crops from november to april agricultural cultivation in guangdong province is mostly irrigated by surface water and the spatial distribution of cultivated land has little relationship with the distribution of surface water resources which is mainly distributed in the undeveloped areas groundwater is as a main supplemental water source in the undeveloped or non central areas in term of the water consumption agricultural irrigation amount accounted for 50 6 of the total water utilization and the amount of surface water resources was 188 52 billion m3 in 2018 and reached 205 83 billion m3 in 2019 as regional continuing population growth food supply security will directly promote the agricultural planting structure adjustment and increase irrigation water demand that have led to a desired need for balancing water and crops planting besides energy consumption needs to be considered during regional agricultural system planning and management geographically due to the difference in altitude and terrain the energy consumption of agricultural irrigation in high altitude and complex terrain areas is in a high level energy consumption is related to planting area crops water requirement and water sources the energy consumption of different irrigation water sources is different generally energy consumption of groundwater for irrigation is higher than surface water moreover in agricultural system the main uncertainties are from socio economic system e g price that directly affects the system benefit and the initiative of planting crops and water resources system e g water availability that directly or indirectly impacts the type of crop and yields in general crops price is expressed in fuzzy return coefficients according to expert prediction and analysis and other parameters could reflect as interval information those uncertainties have intensified the difficulty of management in order to realize efficient green irrigation it is necessary to emphasize the restrictive effect of energy consumption first and perfect green irrigation mechanism under uncertain environment 3 2 model development 3 2 1 interval fuzzy agricultural water resources management model policies in terms of the related agricultural water resources activities energy consumption and pollutants mitigation are critical for ensuring maximized system benefit from agricultural system operation the objective is to maximize total system benefit which includes a economic value of crops b benefit from biomass conversion and utilization c cost of energy consumption for water irrigation and drainage and d charge fee for water resources the constraints are for the relationships between the decision variables and a number of water related restrictions and energy related restrictions including the balance between water supply and demand energy supply and demand planting area constraint and so on therefore the optimization model can be formulated as follows 6a maxf 1 2 3 4 6b 1 i 1 i k 1 k pc k ya ik a

from guangdong province rural statistics 2010 2019 the information on irrigation quota is from guangdong province norm of water use energy and water prices are obtained from the website of the guangdong provincial people s government the fuzzy food price is compiled from information collected online and energy consumption per water irrigation and drainage was calculated through coefficient

consumption and allocation of water resources and planting area two scenarios 10 and 15 reduction of the base energy consumption e g s1 and s2 are designed for concretely analyzing the situation of crop water resources and planting area allocation of crops in different cities at different case three scenarios named as r1 r2 and r3 that are corresponding to λ 0 with the fitting value of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 results analysis under non risk consideration 4 1 1 optimal area allocation table 2 provides the optimal solutions of crop acreage during the planting periods under the base case in general rice peanut and corn would be the main crops that would account for over 80 of the total cultivated area in guangdong province for example the optimized planting area for early rice peanut late rice and corn in maoming i 16 would be 118 9 240 3 103 ha 90 1 112 7 103 ha 72 6 103 ha and 9 5 380 6 103 ha respectively for rice early rice would have an obvious advantage in the planting distribution and more than half of the study area would plant more early rice than late rice except guangzhou foshan shaoguan heyuan dongguan zhaoqing and chaozhou from the optimized results due to the large distance between the upper and lower bounds of the available surface water the boundary gap is relatively large for example the planting area for corn in huizhou zhanjiang and qingyuan would be 8 3 247 5 103 ha 14 6 187 8 103 ha 10 4 497 9 103 ha respectively in contrast crops with relatively small boundary gaps would be peanut soybean potato and cassava the sugarcane mainly concentrated in zhanjiang with an optimal area of 281 0 351 3 103 ha and the planting area for wheat would be 267 9 103 ha that all concentrated in meizhou 4 1 2 optimal water resources allocation tables 3 and 4 describe the optimized irrigation water amount for different crops from surface water and groundwater under the base case surface water resources would be mainly allocated to rice peanut and corn that corresponds to the planting area and crop water requirement as shown in table 4 the groundwater would be mainly used in shantou for early rice and potato zhanjiang for early rice soybean and cassava and maoming for early rice further only the early rice would obtain irrigation water resources from groundwater and surface water in the three cities and the remaining crops would be only irrigated by groundwater therefore the total water resources amount that allocated to early rice in shantou zhanjiang and maoming would be 94 8 324 6 106 m3 412 7 1639 2 106 m3 and 823 9 1665 0 106 m3 respectively the surface water amount for late rice in guangzhou foshan shaoguan heyuan zhaoqing and chaozhou would be 47 6 1130 4 106 m3 9 8 517 5 106 m3 274 0 3108 7 106 m3 281 5 2104 5 106 m3 372 8 1689 8 106 m3 and 72 8 530 0 106 m3 respectively 4 1 3 scenario analysis fig 3 presents the total energy consumption and the energy consumption of per benefit under three scenarios generally the total energy consumption and the energy consumption of per benefit would have a decrease trend as the energy consumption reduction level increasing for example the energy consumption of per benefit would reduce from 343 01 1431 24 103kwh rmb to 340 43 1423 38 103kwh rmb from the base scenario to s2 and the related energy consumption would decrease from 63 63 113 05 109kwh to 63 51 107 31 109kwh from this point the measures for reasonable energy consumption control could increase energy efficiency bring down the excessive growth on energy intensity of water resources supply and lead to a lower system benefit fig 4 shows the crop planting area under different energy consumption scenarios as the energy consumption intensity changes the planting area of each crop would have different variations as shown in fig 4 a the optimal early rice area in shantou would be 14 76 50 50 103 ha 14 76 50 50 103 ha and 14 76 30 59 103 ha under the base scenario s1 and s2 respectively for zhanjiang city the cultivated area for early rice in would be 61 14 242 84 103 ha in the base scenario 61 14 228 63 103 ha in s1 and 61 14 155 83 103 ha in s2 respectively in addition the optimized area of potato in shantou would increase from 12 94 103 ha in s1 to 12 94 32 86 103 ha in s2 as shown in fig 4 b the optimized corn area in zhanjiang would have a large difference under different scenarios with 14 62 187 83 103 ha under the base case and 14 62 103 ha under s1 and s2 respectively fig 5 describes the surface water allocation scheme for crops irrigation under different energy consumption control the surface water resources allocated to early rice would have different changes in the study areas under the base scenario s1 and s2 for example in shantou surface water amount would be 88 12 206 56 106 m3 58 14 178 28 106 m3 and 63 85 121 73 106 m3 in the three scenarios respectively 134 38 173 12 106 m3 134 38 600 88 106 m3 and 99 11 441 12 106 m3 in zhanjiang and 823 91 106 m3 823 91 106 m3 and 833 91 1212 98 106 m3 for maoming respectively in addition as for other crop surface water resources allocation would show few overall changes with energy constraints variation especially for crops with a high water demand for example the sum of the optimized surface water amount for peanut sugarcane and late rice in zhanjiang would be 283 45 354 32 106 m3 1832 13 2290 16 106 m3 and 503 77 528 34 106 m3 under three scenarios respectively moreover there would be also a few exceptions for example the optimal surface water resources for soybean in shantou would be from 3 68 4 59 106 m3 to 0 as the energy consumption reduction level increasing the surface water amount allocated to cassava in zhanjiang would be 48 52 60 65 106 m3 in s2 scenario similarly surface water resources for sugarcane irrigation would be only allocated at base scenario with 3 09 3 86 106 m3 in zhanjiang for corn it would be 36 10 463 86 106 m3 under base scenario in zhanjiang and 36 10 106 m3 at the other two scenarios obviously after reducing energy consumption by 10 surface water resource that allocate to corn would reach to the minimum value in zhanjiang compared with surface water allocation strategy groundwater utilization would not have an obvious change for different crops in the study areas and it would have a different change trend fig 6 for example groundwater resources for early rice would be 6 75 118 10 106 m3 36 73 146 38 106 m3 and 31 02 74 90 106 m3 under base s1 and s2 scenarios in shantou respectively groundwater amount for early rice would be 278 34 1466 07 106 m3 278 34 942 39 106 m3 and 313 62 511 66 106 m3 under base s1 s2 scenarios in maoming respectively compared with surface water the change of groundwater allocation schemes under different energy consumption scenarios is more intuitive from the above analysis it indicated that 1 surface water is the main source of irrigation and groundwater is the supplement 2 the utilization of groundwater is mainly in economically underdeveloped areas including zhanjiang maoming and shantou especially for early rice and 3 the change of energy consumption has a strong constraint on the surface water in the area with abundant groundwater 4 2 system risk analysis 4 2 1 tradeoff between system benefit and risk fig 7 presents the tradeoff between the system net benefit and the defined risk under different scenarios as λ 0 value increasing the corresponding risk would be increased from 11 34 to 15 00 with the minimum and maximum numbers existing in λ 0 0 1 and λ 0 0 9 in addition the system net benefit would be not stable as the risk level changing the system benefit would remain at around 44 00 109rmb from λ 0 0 to λ 0 0 4 and the benefit polyline would be concave at λ 0 0 4 to λ 0 0 9 with the minimum value of 39 81 109rmb at λ 0 0 6 in general as risk level increasing the system benefit would have a generally increase trends except from λ 0 0 3 to λ 0 0 5 4 2 2 risk tradeoff based water and land resources allocation fig 8 shows the optimized crops planting area in different cities under different risk scenarios obviously the planting area for early rice would change under different risk scenarios in heyuan meizhou dongguan yangjiang and zhaoqing for example the optimized early rice area in heyuan would be 37 93 103 ha 67 79 103 ha and 73 77 103 ha under r1 r2 and r3 respectively in zhaoqing the related optimized area would be 130 64 103 ha 107 18 103 ha and 75 08 103 ha and in meizhou it would be 90 55 103 ha 50 71 103 ha 67 08 103 ha with un monotonous change under r1 r2 and r3 scenarios respectively in addition the planting area for peanut would have the same tendency with 115 90 103 ha 24 31 103 ha 164 32 103 ha under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan respectively under the three risk levels the change trend of the early rice in zhaoqing and meizhou is similar with benefit trend therefore all of the above change would contribute a lot to the change trend in benefit fig 9 describes the optimal surface water allocation amount for crop irrigation under different risk scenarios in general the surface water allocation for rice peanut and sugarcane would be greatly affected by the risk level control in addition water resources allocation strategies would have a concave trend as the planting area for example the surface water resources allocation amount for peanut would be 383 77 106 m3 73 87 106 m3 and 543 37 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan respectively for surface water resources as the risk level increasing the allocation amount would have various trends for different crops in the sub areas firstly compared with those crops surface water resources allocated to rice in different cities would appear a greater change for example the surface water resources amount for early rice would be 557 85 106 m3 304 74 106 m3 and 403 55 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in meizhou respectively secondly there would be no significant change in the surface water resources allocation for potato corn and wheat for example the surface water resources allocation to peanut would have not obvious change in other cities except shaoguan with 989 41 106 m3 745 48 106 m3 and 827 43 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 respectively thirdly risk control would have a great impact on surface water utilization in shaoguan meizhou huizhou and zhaoqing and no effect on crop irrigation in shenzhen zhuhai shantou and foshan fig 10 shows the optimized groundwater allocation amount for each crop under different risk scenarios the total agricultural groundwater utilization in guangdong province would be 3125 06 106 m3 3956 20 106 m3 and 3201 45 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 scenarios respectively in addition groundwater resources allocation would have pronounced changes in shaoguan heyuan meizhou huizhou and qingyuan under different risk levels control for example the agricultural groundwater amount would be 354 47 106 m3 63 58 106 m3 and 379 01 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan moreover the main crops that irrigated by groundwater would be sugarcane and late rice for example the groundwater allocated to late rice would be 223 32 106 m3 under r1 scenario and 359 73 106 m3 under r2 and r3 in maoming respectively the groundwater amount for sugarcane irragation in qingyuan would be 1179 62 106 m3 and 833 45 106 m3 under r2 and r3 scenarios 4 2 3 total energy and water consumption under different scenarios fig 11 describes the total energy and water consumption amount under different scenarios the total energy consumption would be 59 16 109kwh 60 59 109kwh and 59 39 109kwh under r1 r2 and r3 the related water resources consumption amount would be 15 12 109 m3 14 63 109 m3 and 15 05 109 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 respectively generally the change trend for energy consumption amount would be opposite to water resources consumption and the water resources allocation amount would be the same as the system benefit under the three scenarios therefore water consumption would be the main contributor to the system benefit in general as a water rich area surface water is the main agricultural water source in guangdong province according to the optimization results groundwater would be used in economically underdeveloped areas and energy consumption control would have a greater constraint on surface water resources utilization with groundwater as a supplement to agricultural water resources through incorporated risk control in regional agricultural water resources management water allocation structure would be changed as energy consumption reduction increasing the system would be reduced and groundwater irrigation amount would be decreased due to a higher energy intensity the results are valuable for supporting the adjustment of the existing agricultural water resources management schemes in guangdong province 5 conclusion in this study a risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming model is developed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy water nexus methods of interval parameter programming fuzzy expectation programming and risk explicit interval programming are incorporated into the developed model to reflect uncertainties described by interval values fuzzy sets and their combinations through incorporating fuzzy expectation and risk explicit approach the model can be converted and present the tradeoff information between system benefit and risk the developed method is applied to planning irrigation water resources allocation and land utilization under considering the limited surface water and groundwater the available land resources uncertain energy consumption and system explicit risk in guangdong province according to the results it indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints the results based on risk tradeoff can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon oriented agricultural water resources management schemes guangdong province should make efforts to improve its irrigation policy and crops structure adjustment in the following aspects 1 the groundwater resources allocation for agriculture in cities with abundant surface water resources should be reduced as far as possible 2 it is crucial to define the energy consumption constraint of regional irrigation so as to make an reasonable agricultural water resources allocation schemes 3 explicit system risk for decision maker is necessary to assist the best agricultural water resources management mode in general during the practical decision making process the crisp solutions provide by reifep model are more explicit efficient and enforceable therefore it is a valuable and more effective management tool for making regional reasonable water energy planning strategy and agricultural structure adjustment with multiple uncertainties in the future work we will further study the structure of solutions of reifep and look at more study areas to find out the agricultural water resources management system with wider applicability declaration of competing interest the authors

1403,in this study an integrated framework is proposed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy water nexus the framework has two components the optimized interval solutions generation of unknown market quotation and environment situation through the novel interval fuzzy expectation programming and the post optimization decision making of the tradeoff between system risk and return through risk explicit interval programming an optimization model based on the framework was developed from a real description for agricultural water resources system of guangdong province under considering various crop multiple water sources and the related energy consumption in irrigation and drainage the impact of energy consumption and risk level control on water resources allocation among different crops and system benefits were analyzed the results indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints risk tradeoff based results can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon oriented agricultural water resources management schemes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated optimization framework agricultural water resources management energy consumption control interval fuzzy expectation programming risk analysis 1 introduction coped with the competition for water system services from other economic sectors agricultural water resources consumption is confronting more and more challenges from various resources and environmental aspect affection qin et al 2020 xue et al 2017 according to the statistical information agricultural system production accounts for 30 of the global energy consumption 92 of the human water footprint and over 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 as population growth oriented food needs and agricultural system development in future with the limited land expansion water and energy resources control could be included in regional agricultural water resources management abrishambaf et al 2020 geng et al 2014 karamian et al 2021 lee et al 2020 in addition the uncertainties in water resource system and technical economical parameters and the complexities relationships among water land crops and energy have brought a greater pressure li et al 2007 sun et al 2020 ma et al 2020a 2020b xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore agricultural water and land resources management schemes under water energy nexus for supporting regional agricultural system development under considering the irrigation and drainage consumed energy from different water sources the land competition between food and energy crops and the co ordination of supply and demand for food energy water and land many optimization methods have been used to solve agricultural water resource management and land planning problems such as nonlinear programming and multi objective programming interval parameter programming ipp chen et al 2020 fu et al 2018 fuzzy mathematical programming fmp mathematical programming fmp ji et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 and stochastic mathematical programming smp ermolieva et al 2015 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020a 2020b these optimization methods help to provide decision makers with the best strategy for achieving their objectives e g minimum system cost maximum economic benefit maximum environmental safety and maximum social satisfaction under all considerations for example luo et al 2003 proposed an inexact two stage stochastic nonlinear programming model for water resources management of an agricultural system with water trading under uncertainty lu et al 2008 proposed an inexact programming method to obtain optimal water allocation strategies for agricultural irrigation systems tan and zhang 2018 developed a robust fractional programming method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization to improve agricultural water use efficiency under uncertainty zhang et al 2020 developed an interval fuzzy two stage stochastic quadratic programming model to provide risk averse solutions with recourse to irrigation water management yue and guo 2021 presented a model to explore sustainable agricultural management measures with minimum water and carbon footprint as optimization targets from the previous studies the comprehensive complexities among multiple factors in agricultural water resources system have led to more difficult in uncertainties reflection interval parameter programming and fuzzy mathematical programming would be relatively good choices for uncertainties expression with a less information for complexity description in agricultural system martinez et al 2018 li et al 2019b however there are two problems in the integrated framework of interval parameter programming and fuzzy mathematical programming firstly fuzzy optimization models could provide more effective tools to handle uncertainty and in reality it is hard to predict accurately the expected values of fuzzy information due to the complexity of agricultural water resources system ebrahimnejad and verdegay 2014 kumar and kaur 2014 wang and peng 2019 secondly the interval solutions would be faced with the infeasibility and non optimality of the actual implementation scheme and it does not demonstrate the decision maker s trade off between systemic benefits and systemic risks zhou et al 2009 zou et al 2010 ji et al 2017 ji et al 2018 therefore in order to deal with the above problems the objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework through proposing the risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming for agricultural water resources allocation and land management under energy consumption control and risk attitude in the framework interval parameter programming fuzzy expectation programming and risk explicit interval programming are integrated and uncertainties can be directly integrated into the optimization process through reflecting the uncertain parameters and coefficients as interval values fuzzy sets and their combinations moreover the developed model will be applied to planning irrigation water resources allocation and crop land pattern under considering multiple water sources and energy resources constraints in guangdong province the main contributions of this work are summarized as 1 the optimal irrigation water resources and planting area allocation under different energy consumption levels is analyzed and compared at regional level 2 the explicit solution with the system cost risk tradeoff information could be provided according to the risk preference of decision maker and 3 the optimized model could be a more effective management tool for making regional reasonable water energy planning strategy under multiple uncertainties 2 methodology 2 1 interval fuzzy expectation programming in general a conventional interval fuzzy linear programming can be expressed as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 1b j 1 n a ij x ij b i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 where c j is a fuzzy number a ij r m n b i r m 1 and r denotes a set of interval numbers in order to reflect the interval range of the fuzzy number the fuzzy number can be converted by the following a trapezoidal fuzzy number r j a lj a uj c j d j is a fuzzy set defined on r and characterized by its membership function μ r r μ r 0 1 2 μ r r l a l r c if r a l c a l 1 if r a l a u r r a u d if r a u a u d where l and r are respectively non decreasing and non increasing functions that characterize the left and right side of the fuzzy number r j assuming that the left and right reference functions are all of the same shape for j 1 n and the following linear combination expresses in the fuzzy objective function p x x 1 x j can be expressed as follows vercher et al 2007 3a p j 1 n r j x j j 1 n a lj x j j 1 n a uj x j j 1 n c j x j j 1 n d j x j def p l x p u x c x d x then we can verify that the α level sets of p have the following form 3b p α inf p α sup p α p l x c x 1 α 1 ρ p u x d x 1 α 1 ρ for α 0 1 and it is easy to obtain the expectation of the fuzzy objective function 3c e sup p 0 1 sup p α d α p u x d x p p 1 3d e inf p 0 1 inf p α d α p l x c x p p 1 therefore we can obtain that 3e e p p l x c x p p 1 p u x d x p p 1 therefore the interval fuzzy linear programming can be converted into the interval fuzzy expectation programming ifep as follows 4a max f e p subject to 4b j 1 n a ij x ij b i i 1 2 m 4c x j 0 according to huang et al 1992 the above model can be solved through the interactive algorithm and transformed to two deterministic sub models e g the lower and upper bounds model and the optimized solutions are expressed as interval numbers 2 2 risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming the interval solution of the ifep model can be calculated with less information and shorter time nonetheless in the real world due to the lack of direct connection between the system benefit and the decision risk it is impractical for the decision maker to make the actual decision directly through the interval solution therefore in order to solve the infeasibility and non optimal problems interval explicit programming can provide the tradeoff information for decision makers with certain risk preference by introducing decision risk function and expected risk level through integrated with the ifep and interval explicit programming the risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming reifep can be proposed and an uncertainty based decision can be achieved through applying the reifep to explore the risk tradeoff in the ifep solutions the corresponding reifep can be formulated as 5a min ξ i j 1 n λ ij a ij a ij x j η i b i b i subject to 5b j 1 n p u x j d x j p p 1 λ 0 p u x j d x j p p 1 p l x j c x j p p 1 f opt λ 0 f opt f opt 5c b i j 1 n a ij x j ξ i 5d λ 0 λ pre 5e 0 λ ij 1 5f x j 0 j where λ 0 is the system aspiration level with a value between 0 and 1 λ ij and η i are real numbers between 0 and 1 ξ i j 1 n λ ij a ij a ij x j η i b i b i is the prescribed system aspiration level is a general arithmetic operator that can be a simple addition a weighted addition simple arithmetic mean weighted arithmetic mean or a max operator the general solution algorithm of the reifep model is illustrated in fig 1 through the solving process of reifep the relationship between risk level and system benefit and the trade off between system explicit risk and benefit can be deeply analyzed 3 system modeling 3 1 overview of the study area guangdong province the largest economic province in china is the core district of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area the region s latitude ranges from 20 13 to 25 31 n while its longitude ranges from 109 39 to 117 19 e as shown in fig 2 the study area includes 21 prefecture level city and 122 county level administrative region the region s administrative area covers 179 725 km2 with a total population of 115 21 million in 2020 the total multi year average water resource under different hydrological guarantee rates is 1962 109 m3 the available area of cultivated land garden and forest land is 2 593 106 ha 1 256 106 ha and 1 001 106 ha respectively the area is a subtropical monsoon climate and the annual average temperature is 22 8 c with a maximum temperature of 40 0 c and minimum temperature of 0 7 c early rice peanut soybean potato and cassava are the summer major crop form may to october and sugarcane corn and late rice are the main autumn crops from november to april agricultural cultivation in guangdong province is mostly irrigated by surface water and the spatial distribution of cultivated land has little relationship with the distribution of surface water resources which is mainly distributed in the undeveloped areas groundwater is as a main supplemental water source in the undeveloped or non central areas in term of the water consumption agricultural irrigation amount accounted for 50 6 of the total water utilization and the amount of surface water resources was 188 52 billion m3 in 2018 and reached 205 83 billion m3 in 2019 as regional continuing population growth food supply security will directly promote the agricultural planting structure adjustment and increase irrigation water demand that have led to a desired need for balancing water and crops planting besides energy consumption needs to be considered during regional agricultural system planning and management geographically due to the difference in altitude and terrain the energy consumption of agricultural irrigation in high altitude and complex terrain areas is in a high level energy consumption is related to planting area crops water requirement and water sources the energy consumption of different irrigation water sources is different generally energy consumption of groundwater for irrigation is higher than surface water moreover in agricultural system the main uncertainties are from socio economic system e g price that directly affects the system benefit and the initiative of planting crops and water resources system e g water availability that directly or indirectly impacts the type of crop and yields in general crops price is expressed in fuzzy return coefficients according to expert prediction and analysis and other parameters could reflect as interval information those uncertainties have intensified the difficulty of management in order to realize efficient green irrigation it is necessary to emphasize the restrictive effect of energy consumption first and perfect green irrigation mechanism under uncertain environment 3 2 model development 3 2 1 interval fuzzy agricultural water resources management model policies in terms of the related agricultural water resources activities energy consumption and pollutants mitigation are critical for ensuring maximized system benefit from agricultural system operation the objective is to maximize total system benefit which includes a economic value of crops b benefit from biomass conversion and utilization c cost of energy consumption for water irrigation and drainage and d charge fee for water resources the constraints are for the relationships between the decision variables and a number of water related restrictions and energy related restrictions including the balance between water supply and demand energy supply and demand planting area constraint and so on therefore the optimization model can be formulated as follows 6a maxf 1 2 3 4 6b 1 i 1 i k 1 k pc k ya ik a

from guangdong province rural statistics 2010 2019 the information on irrigation quota is from guangdong province norm of water use energy and water prices are obtained from the website of the guangdong provincial people s government the fuzzy food price is compiled from information collected online and energy consumption per water irrigation and drainage was calculated through coefficient conversion table 1 presents the energy consumption of water irrigation and drainage additional detailed data are showed in the appendix ii in order to search the relationship between energy consumption and allocation of water resources and planting area two scenarios 10 and 15 reduction of the base energy consumption e g s1 and s2 are designed for concretely analyzing the situation of crop water resources and planting area allocation of crops in different cities at different case three scenarios named as r1 r2 and r3 that are corresponding to λ 0 with the fitting value of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 results analysis under non risk consideration 4 1 1 optimal area allocation table 2 provides the optimal solutions of crop acreage during the planting periods under the base case in general rice peanut and corn would be the main crops that would account for over 80 of the total cultivated area in guangdong province for example the optimized planting area for early rice peanut late rice and corn in maoming i 16 would be 118 9 240 3 103 ha 90 1 112 7 103 ha 72 6 103 ha and 9 5 380 6 103 ha respectively for rice early rice would have an obvious advantage in the planting distribution and more than half of the study area would plant more early rice than late rice except guangzhou foshan shaoguan heyuan dongguan zhaoqing and chaozhou from the optimized results due to the large distance between the upper and lower bounds of the available surface water the boundary gap is relatively large for example the planting area for corn in huizhou zhanjiang and qingyuan would be 8 3 247 5 103 ha 14 6 187 8 103 ha 10 4 497 9 103 ha respectively in contrast crops with relatively small boundary gaps would be peanut soybean potato and cassava the sugarcane mainly concentrated in zhanjiang with an optimal area of 281 0 351 3 103 ha and the planting area for wheat would be 267 9 103 ha that all concentrated in meizhou 4 1 2 optimal water resources allocation tables 3 and 4 describe the optimized irrigation water amount for different crops from surface water and groundwater under the base case surface water resources would be mainly allocated to rice peanut and corn that corresponds to the planting area and crop water requirement as shown in table 4 the groundwater would be mainly used in shantou for early rice and potato zhanjiang for early rice soybean and cassava and maoming for early rice further only the early rice would obtain irrigation water resources from groundwater and surface water in the three cities and the remaining crops would be only irrigated by groundwater therefore the total water resources amount that allocated to early rice in shantou zhanjiang and maoming would be 94 8 324 6 106 m3 412 7 1639 2 106 m3 and 823 9 1665 0 106 m3 respectively the surface water amount for late rice in guangzhou foshan shaoguan heyuan zhaoqing and chaozhou would be 47 6 1130 4 106 m3 9 8 517 5 106 m3 274 0 3108 7 106 m3 281 5 2104 5 106 m3 372 8 1689 8 106 m3 and 72 8 530 0 106 m3 respectively 4 1 3 scenario analysis fig 3 presents the total energy consumption and the energy consumption of per benefit under three scenarios generally the total energy consumption and the energy consumption of per benefit would have a decrease trend as the energy consumption reduction level increasing for example the energy consumption of per benefit would reduce from 343 01 1431 24 103kwh rmb to 340 43 1423 38 103kwh rmb from the base scenario to s2 and the related energy consumption would decrease from 63 63 113 05 109kwh to 63 51 107 31 109kwh from this point the measures for reasonable energy consumption control could increase energy efficiency bring down the excessive growth on energy intensity of water resources supply and lead to a lower system benefit fig 4 shows the crop planting area under different energy consumption scenarios as the energy consumption intensity changes the planting area of each crop would have different variations as shown in fig 4 a the optimal early rice area in shantou would be 14 76 50 50 103 ha 14 76 50 50 103 ha and 14 76 30 59 103 ha under the base scenario s1 and s2 respectively for zhanjiang city the cultivated area for early rice in would be 61 14 242 84 103 ha in the base scenario 61 14 228 63 103 ha in s1 and 61 14 155 83 103 ha in s2 respectively in addition the optimized area of potato in shantou would increase from 12 94 103 ha in s1 to 12 94 32 86 103 ha in s2 as shown in fig 4 b the optimized corn area in zhanjiang would have a large difference under different scenarios with 14 62 187 83 103 ha under the base case and 14 62 103 ha under s1 and s2 respectively fig 5 describes the surface water allocation scheme for crops irrigation under different energy consumption control the surface water resources allocated to early rice would have different changes in the study areas under the base scenario s1 and s2 for example in shantou surface water amount would be 88 12 206 56 106 m3 58 14 178 28 106 m3 and 63 85 121 73 106 m3 in the three scenarios respectively 134 38 173 12 106 m3 134 38 600 88 106 m3 and 99 11 441 12 106 m3 in zhanjiang and 823 91 106 m3 823 91 106 m3 and 833 91 1212 98 106 m3 for maoming respectively in addition as for other crop surface water resources allocation would show few overall changes with energy constraints variation especially for crops with a high water demand for example the sum of the optimized surface water amount for peanut sugarcane and late rice in zhanjiang would be 283 45 354 32 106 m3 1832 13 2290 16 106 m3 and 503 77 528 34 106 m3 under three scenarios respectively moreover there would be also a few exceptions for example the optimal surface water resources for soybean in shantou would be from 3 68 4 59 106 m3 to 0 as the energy consumption reduction level increasing the surface water amount allocated to cassava in zhanjiang would be 48 52 60 65 106 m3 in s2 scenario similarly surface water resources for sugarcane irrigation would be only allocated at base scenario with 3 09 3 86 106 m3 in zhanjiang for corn it would be 36 10 463 86 106 m3 under base scenario in zhanjiang and 36 10 106 m3 at the other two scenarios obviously after reducing energy consumption by 10 surface water resource that allocate to corn would reach to the minimum value in zhanjiang compared with surface water allocation strategy groundwater utilization would not have an obvious change for different crops in the study areas and it would have a different change trend fig 6 for example groundwater resources for early rice would be 6 75 118 10 106 m3 36 73 146 38 106 m3 and 31 02 74 90 106 m3 under base s1 and s2 scenarios in shantou respectively groundwater amount for early rice would be 278 34 1466 07 106 m3 278 34 942 39 106 m3 and 313 62 511 66 106 m3 under base s1 s2 scenarios in maoming respectively compared with surface water the change of groundwater allocation schemes under different energy consumption scenarios is more intuitive from the above analysis it indicated that 1 surface water is the main source of irrigation and groundwater is the supplement 2 the utilization of groundwater is mainly in economically underdeveloped areas including zhanjiang maoming and shantou especially for early rice and 3 the change of energy consumption has a strong constraint on the surface water in the area with abundant groundwater 4 2 system risk analysis 4 2 1 tradeoff between system benefit and risk fig 7 presents the tradeoff between the system net benefit and the defined risk under different scenarios as λ 0 value increasing the corresponding risk would be increased from 11 34 to 15 00 with the minimum and maximum numbers existing in λ 0 0 1 and λ 0 0 9 in addition the system net benefit would be not stable as the risk level changing the system benefit would remain at around 44 00 109rmb from λ 0 0 to λ 0 0 4 and the benefit polyline would be concave at λ 0 0 4 to λ 0 0 9 with the minimum value of 39 81 109rmb at λ 0 0 6 in general as risk level increasing the system benefit would have a generally increase trends except from λ 0 0 3 to λ 0 0 5 4 2 2 risk tradeoff based water and land resources allocation fig 8 shows the optimized crops planting area in different cities under different risk scenarios obviously the planting area for early rice would change under different risk scenarios in heyuan meizhou dongguan yangjiang and zhaoqing for example the optimized early rice area in heyuan would be 37 93 103 ha 67 79 103 ha and 73 77 103 ha under r1 r2 and r3 respectively in zhaoqing the related optimized area would be 130 64 103 ha 107 18 103 ha and 75 08 103 ha and in meizhou it would be 90 55 103 ha 50 71 103 ha 67 08 103 ha with un monotonous change under r1 r2 and r3 scenarios respectively in addition the planting area for peanut would have the same tendency with 115 90 103 ha 24 31 103 ha 164 32 103 ha under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan respectively under the three risk levels the change trend of the early rice in zhaoqing and meizhou is similar with benefit trend therefore all of the above change would contribute a lot to the change trend in benefit fig 9 describes the optimal surface water allocation amount for crop irrigation under different risk scenarios in general the surface water allocation for rice peanut and sugarcane would be greatly affected by the risk level control in addition water resources allocation strategies would have a concave trend as the planting area for example the surface water resources allocation amount for peanut would be 383 77 106 m3 73 87 106 m3 and 543 37 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan respectively for surface water resources as the risk level increasing the allocation amount would have various trends for different crops in the sub areas firstly compared with those crops surface water resources allocated to rice in different cities would appear a greater change for example the surface water resources amount for early rice would be 557 85 106 m3 304 74 106 m3 and 403 55 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in meizhou respectively secondly there would be no significant change in the surface water resources allocation for potato corn and wheat for example the surface water resources allocation to peanut would have not obvious change in other cities except shaoguan with 989 41 106 m3 745 48 106 m3 and 827 43 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 respectively thirdly risk control would have a great impact on surface water utilization in shaoguan meizhou huizhou and zhaoqing and no effect on crop irrigation in shenzhen zhuhai shantou and foshan fig 10 shows the optimized groundwater allocation amount for each crop under different risk scenarios the total agricultural groundwater utilization in guangdong province would be 3125 06 106 m3 3956 20 106 m3 and 3201 45 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 scenarios respectively in addition groundwater resources allocation would have pronounced changes in shaoguan heyuan meizhou huizhou and qingyuan under different risk levels control for example the agricultural groundwater amount would be 354 47 106 m3 63 58 106 m3 and 379 01 106 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 in shaoguan moreover the main crops that irrigated by groundwater would be sugarcane and late rice for example the groundwater allocated to late rice would be 223 32 106 m3 under r1 scenario and 359 73 106 m3 under r2 and r3 in maoming respectively the groundwater amount for sugarcane irragation in qingyuan would be 1179 62 106 m3 and 833 45 106 m3 under r2 and r3 scenarios 4 2 3 total energy and water consumption under different scenarios fig 11 describes the total energy and water consumption amount under different scenarios the total energy consumption would be 59 16 109kwh 60 59 109kwh and 59 39 109kwh under r1 r2 and r3 the related water resources consumption amount would be 15 12 109 m3 14 63 109 m3 and 15 05 109 m3 under r1 r2 and r3 respectively generally the change trend for energy consumption amount would be opposite to water resources consumption and the water resources allocation amount would be the same as the system benefit under the three scenarios therefore water consumption would be the main contributor to the system benefit in general as a water rich area surface water is the main agricultural water source in guangdong province according to the optimization results groundwater would be used in economically underdeveloped areas and energy consumption control would have a greater constraint on surface water resources utilization with groundwater as a supplement to agricultural water resources through incorporated risk control in regional agricultural water resources management water allocation structure would be changed as energy consumption reduction increasing the system would be reduced and groundwater irrigation amount would be decreased due to a higher energy intensity the results are valuable for supporting the adjustment of the existing agricultural water resources management schemes in guangdong province 5 conclusion in this study a risk explicit interval fuzzy expectation programming model is developed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy water nexus methods of interval parameter programming fuzzy expectation programming and risk explicit interval programming are incorporated into the developed model to reflect uncertainties described by interval values fuzzy sets and their combinations through incorporating fuzzy expectation and risk explicit approach the model can be converted and present the tradeoff information between system benefit and risk the developed method is applied to planning irrigation water resources allocation and land utilization under considering the limited surface water and groundwater the available land resources uncertain energy consumption and system explicit risk in guangdong province according to the results it indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints the results based on risk tradeoff can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon oriented agricultural water resources management schemes guangdong province should make efforts to improve its irrigation policy and crops structure adjustment in the following aspects 1 the groundwater resources allocation for agriculture in cities with abundant surface water resources should be reduced as far as possible 2 it is crucial to define the energy consumption constraint of regional irrigation so as to make an reasonable agricultural water resources allocation schemes 3 explicit system risk for decision maker is necessary to assist the best agricultural water resources management mode in general during the practical decision making process the crisp solutions provide by reifep model are more explicit efficient and enforceable therefore it is a valuable and more effective management tool for making regional reasonable water energy planning strategy and agricultural structure adjustment with multiple uncertainties in the future work we will further study the structure of solutions of reifep and look at more study areas to find out the agricultural water resources management system with wider applicability declaration of competing interest the authors

1404,particulate organic carbon poc significantly influences nitrogen processes in riparian zones however the role of different types of natural organic matter e g plant leaves and mud deposits in nitrate reduction during the hydraulically driven mixing between rivers and groundwater within bank storage bs is not well known here we used laboratory columns filled with 30 cm of riparian soil and buried with poc of varying quantity and quality leaf litter mud deposit a mixture of both and a sediment control on the soil surface in the column to investigate the effects of poc addition on nitrate reduction in low permeable media pore waters were collected and measured periodically to compare the physicochemical differences among these treatments over time during scenarios of downward and upward flow the leaf litter treatment had a larger amount of poc and higher reactivity driving pore water to be in suboxic conditions with lower eh and ph values nitrate reduction occurred immediately with downward surface water and no3 was removed in the poc buried layer due to the low poc content and low reactivity of the carbon source in the mud deposit denitrification primarily occurred in the deeper sediment during the downwelling stage as well as when groundwater returned to the poc buried layer with longer travel times both poc quantity and poc quality had strong effects on nitrate reduction our results suggested that the leaf litter treatment was preferential for nitrate reduction over the mud deposit treatment with a higher no3 reduction rate and less nh4 accumulation during the complete bs process keywords bank storage riparian zone nitrate reduction mud deposit leaf litter 1 introduction the riparian zone rz and hyporheic zone hz have been acknowledged for their nitrogen buffering capacity findlay 1995 zhao et al 2021 the hz is defined as a fluctuating ecotone between stream and groundwater and the rz is often defined as the zone of direct interaction between terrestrial and aquatic environments butturini et al 2002 mcclain et al 2003 the rz is located along the stream edge and it is characterized by the unidirectional flux from the hillslope to the stream boulton et al 1998 butturini et al 2002 intensive biogeochemical reactions occur in this area and they have been widely recognized as a hot spot for the reactive transformation of nutrients and energy rich substrates boulton et al 1998 storey et al 2004 battin et al 2009 boano et al 2014 merill and tonjes 2014 bernhardt et al 2017 unlike the in stream hyporheic exchange across riverbeds that is induced by bed forms the exchange between rivers and riparian aquifers occurring across riverbanks is called bank storage bs sawyer et al 2009 harvey and gooseff 2015 shuai et al 2017 during the monsoon season the rising river stage drives surface water flowing into the bank sediments and then the riparian aquifer will force groundwater to flow out of the bank when the river stage falls fig 1 surface water is often richer in dissolved oxygen do nutrients and nitrogen n contaminants while groundwater is typically anoxic without much reactive solute because it is consumed by microbial communities attached to streambed sediments findlay 1995 storey et al 2004 ping et al 2018 li et al 2020 the exchange of streams and groundwater in river banks may alter the redox environment within rzs enhance dynamic pore water flow and solute transformation facilitate biogeochemical reactions and ultimately regulate the n cycle ensign et al 2008 hanrahan 2008 musial et al 2016 jarvie et al 2018 wang et al 2019 nitrate contaminants cause eutrophication of inland and coastal waters vitousek et al 1997 galloway et al 2008 pescimoro et al 2019 bs plays an important role in nitrate retention

fluxes gu et al 2012 a pivotal process that removes nitrate is denitrification nitrate can be reduced to nitrite and nitrous oxide gas under anoxic conditions and thus n pollution is permanently removed from aquatic ecosystems hedin et al 1998 gomez velez et al 2015 ping et al 2020 the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process transforms bioavailable n from no3 into nh4 which coupled with anammox which reduces nh4 and no2 to gaseous n2 is an alternative or additional n loss pathway in aquatic systems jensen et al 2011 sgouridis et al 2011 salk et al 2017 the quality and quantity of organic carbon play major roles in n dynamics and many studies have shown that the experimental addition of dissolved organic carbon doc hill et al 2000 kessel et al 2009 zarnetske et al 2011 hampton et al 2019 and particulate organic carbon poc is an important driver of n transformation including nitrate removal and retention in aquatic systems lovett et al 2004 barnes et al 2012 stelzer et al 2014 2015 sawyer 2015 reeder et al 2018 organic carbon availability may influence and alter the rates of dnra and denitrification differently as dnra is favored over denitrification under high c n ratios and organic c loading rates tiedje et al 1982 christensen et al 2000 sgouridis et al 2011 brin et al 2015 in particular stegen et al 2016 proposed that labile organic carbon will accumulate within microsites at the low river stage the hz is dominated by groundwater discharge as indicated by the green arrow in fig 1 and then stimulate heterotrophic respiration at the rising river stage with surface water intrusion into rzs blue arrow in fig 1 many investigators have investigated the influence of different poc qualities or types on the denitrification rate especially the ways in which natural organic carbon compounds i e leaves wood chips cardboard fibers cornstalks and wheat straw etc greenan et al 2006 vargas et al 2006 saliling et al 2007 navel et al 2011 stelzer et al 2014 affect denitrification in aquatic systems past studies have generally used plant species as carbon sources but few of them have evaluated the difference between plant leaves and mud deposits in poc quality and quantity and made a direct comparison between their effect on n retention and nitrate reduction in addition there is far less understanding of how different types of natural particulate organic matter influence nitrate reduction during the bs process in this study we investigated the different roles of leaf litter and mud deposits in nitrate reduction during the bs process the column system was filled with riparian sediments and buried with the poc layer on the soil surface which was collected from natural organic components then the column system was subjected to a change in the water flow direction and chemistry mimicking the bs process namely downwelling stream flow and upwelling groundwater flow the experimental results will provide some insights into how different poc types affect nitrate reduction in the rz during the bs process 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling site the soil columns were filled with sediments collected from the rz of the tongshun river in shahu town in hubei province china fig 2 the sediments in the soil columns were composed of loam sandy loam and silt clay loam which is a typical low permeable medium the shahu research field is located in the hinterland of the eastern jianghan plain in xiantao city and is surrounded by the tongshun river and the kuige river with mean no3 and nh4 concentrations of 0 01 4 40 mg l and 0 03 7 15 mg l in the surface water deng et al 2014 the jianghan plain is located in the south central part of hubei province in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and it was formed by the yangtze river and its largest tributary the han river this area has a subtropical monsoonal climate with an annual average temperature of 16 8 c the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1200 mm and 1378 mm respectively deng et al 2014 schaefer et al 2016 2 2 soil and natural poc five sampled blocks were chosen for inclusion in a randomized block experiment at the investigation site each block measured 1 m 1 m the upper 20 cm of unvegetated sediments was collected after removing leaf litter and humus materials above the soil surface the 2 mm grain size fraction of the sediments was sieve collected and homogenized after being spread thin to air dry at room temperature and then ground liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the sediments were packed into columns in several increments and each increment was tightly packed before the next increment was placed on the top the packed mass of sediments in each increment was based on sediment density the basic physical properties of riparian sediments at the sampling site were measured by standard procedures through in situ tests and indoor experiments including bulk density porosity and hydraulic conductivity zhang et al 2011 rezanezhad et al 2014 bulk density ρ b was determined using the cutting ring method at the sampling site we chose three locations stochastically and pressed cutting rings with known weights vertically into the soil then we removed the rings that were fully filled with soil and measured the soil moisture content θ by the oven drying method the sediment bulk density ρ b was calculated using the soil moisture content ρ b m v 1 θm where m is the filled soil weight in the ring and v is the volume of the ring three replicates were performed at each location the hydraulic conductivity k

manually and sifted through a 0 25 mm sieve zhang et al 2011 2 3 column experiments the column apparatus 45 cm in length and 14 cm in inner diameter is illustrated and described in fig 3 the soil columns were packed with sampled sediment soil to a height of 30 cm a 2 cm poc treatment layer was placed on the top of the soil surface the amounts of poc added to each column are shown in table 1 and there was a comparable c n ratio in each treatment four lateral sampling ports were spaced at depths of 4 cm 1 0 cm 2 16 cm 3 and 30 cm 4 below the buried poc layers all these depths are

the columns to ensure artificial water flow through the saturation systems at a constant head these columns were presaturated with nitrate free agw before the experiments first osw with no3 contaminant was transfused through the top of each column for 30 days the columns were then eluted with agw from opposite ends of the column to mimic the stream discharging groundwater process by upwelling flux for 36 days the sedimentary part of each treatment was kept in the dark to suppress the effect of photosynthesis mermillod blondin et al 2005 navel et al 2011 2 4 measurement of chemical and physical parameters water samples collected from the buried poc layer and bottom outlet were measured every 2 days for their physical and chemical characteristics whereas water samples collected from other sampling ports were measured every 4 days the physicochemical parameters of the water samples including the ph do eh and temperature were measured with specific probes using a hach multiparameter controller inorganic solutes were analyzed as follows no3 by ion chromatography nh4 by nessler s reagent colorimetric method and doc by the combustion nondispersive infrared method and toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan for carbon analysis the total carbon content was determined in a subsample and the inorganic carbon was determined by the co2 content in the gas phase after acidification of the sample the organic carbon was calculated by the difference between the total organic carbon and inorganic carbon the poc quantity in different types of natural organic matter and sediment was represented by toc content and the loss on ignition mass was measured by toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the tn content was analyzed using a vario macro cube by high temperature combustion and chemical reduction and then transformed to measure the n2 concentration 2 5 data treatment the biogeochemical parameters were transformed using a logarithm base 10 to meet the requirements of statistic tests in cases where data were not distributed normally pearson s correlation statistics r and associated p values were reported for all correlations two tailed t tests were used to calculate whether the no3 concentration in different depths was reduced significantly compared with the no3 concentration in osw with poc addition barnes et al 2012 one way anova was used to assess whether different poc treatments had impacts on pore water solute concentrations and redox conditions regression analysis including linear and nonlinear regression was used to derive the time

in addition do ph and eh value variations covered a somewhat narrower range than those measured in the buried poc layers 3 2 characteristics of physicochemical parameters in the upward flow 3 2 1 time series of chemical parameters in the column influent when the flow direction was inverted artificial groundwater do 2 5 0 5 mg l without n contaminants flowed from the bottom of the columns port 5 no3 nh4 doc and do concentrations were detected in sampling port 4 which represented the bottom influent because the agw was free from no3 both the no3 and nh4 concentrations continuously decreased with time due to the dilution effect fig 7a b the doc concentration in the mud deposit treatment decreased gradually with upward flux r 2 0 618 p 0 05 while the doc concentration was volatile during the upwelling stage in the leaf litter mixture and blank control treatments fig 7c the do concentration fluctuated within a range between 1 and 5 mg l which represented hypoxic and suboxic conditions fig

higher in the mixture and leaf litter treatments than in the blank control and mud deposit treatments in the mid late stage fig 9b the doc concentration declined quickly during the first 2 days of the upwelling experiment in the leaf litter treatment and then increased the doc concentration approached a peak value of 7 18 mg l on approximately the 10th day in the mud deposit treatment fig 9c the effluent doc concentration in the mixture and blank control treatments increased over time with upward flux r 2 0 878 p 0 01 and r 2 0 847 p 0 01 the do concentration during the upwelling period was also affected by the poc treatments two way anova f 3 439 p 0 05 the do concentration generally decreased with time and was lower in the leaf litter and mixture treatments anoxic environment than in the mud deposit and blank control treatments suboxic environment fig 9d the ph value was also higher under more sub oxic conditions fig 8b r 0 644 p 0 001 4 discussion for all treatments the effluent no3 concentrations were lower than those in osw which suggested that no3 was removed in the hyporheic sediment dnra was less likely to occur because the do concentration was above 1 mg l and the eh value was above 0 mv in these treatments compared with denitrification dnra is typically mediated by strict anaerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria and favored by strict anaerobic conditions buresh and patrick 1978 pett ridge et al 2006 lansdown et al 2012 denitrification was therefore likely the dominant pathway for nitrate reduction and transformation with downward flux in our experiment other authors have found that low permeable media such as clay is more favorable to denitrification than sand akhavan et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the hyporheic sediment in this study was a typical low permeable medium and was composed of loam sandy loam and silt clay loam which was conducive to denitrification the no3 in pore water may also have been removed through assimilatory nitrate reduction lansdown et al 2012 stelzer et al 2014 the production of nh4 however was primarily derived from mineralization and desorption in these columns 4 1 effect of poc quantity on nitrate reduction poc addition had significant effects on nitrate reduction in two ways namely poc quantity and quality stelzer et al 2014 2015 past research has illustrated that heterotrophic microbial activity is limited by the bioavailability of organic matter within hzs jones 1995 and the bioavailability of organic substrates would also limit denitrification arango et al 2010 barnes et al 2012 the leaf litter had a higher poc content which was conducive to nitrate reduction through denitrification during the downwelling stage leaf litter addition caused a rapid decline in the do concentration in the buried poc layer drove pore water to have a suboxic condition and stimulated nitrate reduction by producing a large amount of doc and creating favorable redox conditions do 3 mg l ph 7 8 for denitrification sgouridis et al 2011 the no3 decreased rapidly in the poc buried layer and the no3 concentration was lowest in the leaf litter treatment the limited amount of poc in the mud deposits led to a minor drop in the do concentration in the buried poc layer which was under oxidizing conditions with a do value 6 mg l during the downwelling experiment fig 4d it should be emphasized that nitrate was not removed in the mud deposit and blank control treatments within the poc buried layer fig 4a as the influent osw was oxygenated water do competed with nitrate to act as an electron acceptor compared with nitrate organic carbon tends to be oxidized with oxygen preferentially which supplies more energy to microorganisms gu et al 2007 rivett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 denitrification may dominate aerobic respiration in the mid late stage with the depletion of do the no3 concentration was reduced in the deeper hyporheic sediments with downward flux in the mud deposit treatment despite well oxygenated pore water detected in the bottom effluent fig 6a d 4 2 effect of poc quality on nitrate reduction previous studies have investigated the influence of different types of poc such as plant leaves wood chips cardboard fibers and cornstalks on organic matter breakdown and n cycling greenan et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 stelzer et al 2014 the chemical composition of poc had a direct impact on doc production and further played a role in n dynamics especially the denitrification rate yoshimura et al 2010 one limitation of these studies was that they focused more on the comparisons among various plant species in addition mud deposits containing organic matter which are widely present in rzs and crucial for n cycling have mostly been ignored as shown in table 1 the four columns consisted of comparable c n ratios but different toc contents the solute concentrations were standardized and presented as a relative value c to the total doc concentration with the assumption that the buried poc decomposed into doc and was released completely into the pore water it was assumed that there was the same decomposition capacity in all treatments we investigated the action of natural organic matter by assuming that the converted per unit mass doc different sources reacted with river borne nitrate during the downwelling stage the doc concentration in the leaf litter treatment was lowest and decreased with time continuously in the poc buried layer while doc accumulation appeared in the mud deposit mixture and blank control treatments fig 10a which suggests that the organic carbon in leaf litter can be easily consumed by denitrification as the carbon source translocated to deeper sediments the peak doc concentration was also higher in the mud deposit treatment than in the leaf litter treatment which also indicated that more doc remained in the bottom effluent of the mud deposit treatment due to the lower reactivity of the carbon substrate fig 10c in addition when the upward flux returned to the poc buried layer the doc concentration still remained greater in mud deposit treatment fig 10e therefore buried leaf litter had more benefits for reducing nitrate efficiently and effectively than mud deposits burial of the mud deposit resulted in higher nh4 production compared with the leaf litter treatment with the addition of per unit mass of doc fig 10b d and f in this study we followed the pretreatment of leaves used by stelzer et al 2014 and allowed leaf litter to become colonized with microbes in the stream channel before burying it into hyporheic sediments cornut et al 2010 navel et al 2011 stelzer et al 2014 colonized microbes stimulate biogeochemical reactions and require dissolved n for proliferation from water which leads to n retention cheever et al 2012 for leaf litter treatment these reasons contribute to faster nitrate reduction in pore water most no3 was removed in the poc buried layer during the initial mid stage of the downwelling period the organic matter in mud deposits is mainly derived from phytoplankton and algal remains and consists of humic substances including humin humic acid and fulvic acid liu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 dissolved organic matter consists of molecules with various degrees of biological recalcitrance humic substances are persistent and have been regarded as macromolecules and the molecular weight of aqueous humic extracts from soil is up to 2000 da luo et al 2019 humic acids and fulvic acids are also recognized as a complex supra molecular arrangement of various mass components which have a low molecular mass and associate with aromatic and aliphatic structures sutton and sposito 2005 olk et al 2019 due to the refractory nature of humic substances microbial metabolism would take longer time than using labile compounds as carbon source such as polysaccharides amino acids and fatty acids as carbon sources fischer et al 2002 yoshimura et al 2010 attributed to the lower reactivity of mud deposits nitrate reduction occurred in the deeper hz during the mid late stage of the downwelling experiment and nitrate reduction also occurred in the upwelling stage at longer time scales 4 3 limitations and future research direction both poc quantity and quality had a significant effect on nitrate reduction within a simulated rz the chemical composition of leaf litter and mud deposits should also be investigated because previous studies have suggested that poc chemical composition has a direct effect on doc production pfenning and mcmahon 1997 yoshimura et al 2010 and on the denitrification rate baker and vervier 2004 barnes et al 2012 some investigations have shown that there is a positive relationship between the protein like fluorophore quantity and denitrification potential but a negative relationship between aromatic fractions and the denitrification rate barnes et al 2012 notably baker and vervier 2004 found that the denitrification reaction rate at the stream sediment interface was not related to bulk doc concentration while it was determined by the low molecular weight organic acid concentration additionally the protein like substances in dissolved organic matter are much more easily transformed and act as carbon sources for denitrification gao et al 2020 therefore the chemical compositions of leaf litter and mud deposits should be examined and analyzed in the future if the nitrate reduction potential is tightly related to one specific chemical composition under different redox conditions the interface between streams and hyporheic sediment has been recognized as a hotspot for n processing stream water with n contaminants encounters buried particulate organic matter and forms sharp gradients in no3 doc and do concentrations in the streambed mcclain et al 2003 gu et al 2007 duff et al 2008 although the role of buried poc in nitrate reduction at the stream sediment interface is well known stelzer et al 2014 2015 further studies should focus on the role of poc addition at different locations within rzs such as deep sediment 30 cm channels and other linked compartments of aquatic ecosystems in n processing seitzinger et al 2006 sgouridis et al 2011 buried leaf litter removed nitrate more quickly within the poc buried layer during the initial mid stage of the downwelling experiment while mud deposits promoted nitrate reduction in deeper sediment during the mid late downwelling stage as well as during the upwelling stage however the design of our experiments did not allow us to compare the nitrate removal efficiency between these treatments during the two stages in addition the poc addition effect on the nitrate reduction potential and efficiency during long term and repetitive pollution processes should be investigated for example we could compare the role of leaf litter and mud deposits in nitrate reduction and n retention over multiple phases of bs with different intensities and durations of upward and downward fluxes liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 poc addition promoted no3 reduction but also resulted in nh4 accumulation which was probably induced by mineralization and desorption in our experiments except for denitrification there are many biogeochemical processes which remove no3 such as assimilatory no3 reduction mediated by microbes sobczak et al 2003 lansdown et al 2012 perujo et al 2018 sulfur driven nitrate reduction may also be present in surficial sediments of rzs when there is sulfide in close proximity to oxic water and the process of no3 reduction to nh4 or n2 is coupled with the process of sulfide oxidation to so4 burgin and hamilton 2007 burgin et al 2013 in addition microbial communities might also be stressed due to depleted labile organic carbon and lead to an increase in nh4 production by mineralization of microbial n and don production from cell lysis stelzer et al 2015 when there is plenty of do and doc in sediments and interstitial water nh4 would be consumed by the coupled process of nitrification and denitrification therefore a higher ratio of leaf litter and mud deposit mixtures will increase no3 reduction and reduce nh4 accumulation in the rzs during the overall bs process 5 conclusions we investigated the effect of buried natural organic matter on nitrate reduction in the low permeable rz by comparing the no3 nh4 do and doc concentrations between soil columns with different poc qualities and quantities leaf litter mud deposits mixture and blank control throughout a complete hydraulic interaction called bs a downward flux in which river borne no3 flowed into groundwater and upward hypoxic groundwater discharged to surface water through sediment in the leaf litter treatment nitrate reduction occurred immediately in the poc buried layer with downward flux because of the larger amount of poc and a higher reactivity in leaf litter it caused suboxic conditions in the pore water with lower eh and ph values which was conducive to the occurrence of denitrification due to the lower poc content and lower reactivity of doc in the mud deposit the reduction of river borne no3 primarily occurred in deeper sediment with downward flux for the demand of longer timescales and denitrification also occurred during the upwelling stage it also resulted in nh4 accumulation with the burial of natural organic matter in the rz a suitable ratio of leaf litter and mud deposit addition in rzs might be helpful for removing no3 and decreasing nh4 production simultaneously author statement this

1404,particulate organic carbon poc significantly influences nitrogen processes in riparian zones however the role of different types of natural organic matter e g plant leaves and mud deposits in nitrate reduction during the hydraulically driven mixing between rivers and groundwater within bank storage bs is not well known here we used laboratory columns filled with 30 cm of riparian soil and buried with poc of varying quantity and quality leaf litter mud deposit a mixture of both and a sediment control on the soil surface in the column to investigate the effects of poc addition on nitrate reduction in low permeable media pore waters were collected and measured periodically to compare the physicochemical differences among these treatments over time during scenarios of downward and upward flow the leaf litter treatment had a larger amount of poc and higher reactivity driving pore water to be in suboxic conditions with lower eh and ph values nitrate reduction occurred immediately with downward surface water and no3 was removed in the poc buried layer due to the low poc content and low reactivity of the carbon source in the mud deposit denitrification primarily occurred in the deeper sediment during the downwelling stage as well as when groundwater returned to the poc buried layer with longer travel times both poc quantity and poc quality had strong effects on nitrate reduction our results suggested that the leaf litter treatment was preferential for nitrate reduction over the mud deposit treatment with a higher no3 reduction rate and less nh4 accumulation during the complete bs process keywords bank storage riparian zone nitrate reduction mud deposit leaf litter 1 introduction the riparian zone rz and hyporheic zone hz have been acknowledged for their nitrogen buffering capacity findlay 1995 zhao et al 2021 the hz is defined as a fluctuating ecotone between stream and groundwater and the rz is often defined as the zone of direct interaction between terrestrial and aquatic environments butturini et al 2002 mcclain et al 2003 the rz is located along the stream edge and it is characterized by the unidirectional flux from the hillslope to the stream boulton et al 1998 butturini et al 2002 intensive biogeochemical reactions occur in this area and they have been widely recognized as a hot spot for the reactive transformation of nutrients and energy rich substrates boulton et al 1998 storey et al 2004 battin et al 2009 boano et al 2014 merill and tonjes 2014 bernhardt et al 2017 unlike the in stream hyporheic exchange across riverbeds that is induced by bed forms the exchange between rivers and riparian aquifers occurring across riverbanks is called bank storage bs sawyer et al 2009 harvey and gooseff 2015 shuai et al 2017 during the monsoon season the rising river stage drives surface water flowing into the bank sediments and then the riparian aquifer will force groundwater to flow out of the bank when the river stage falls fig 1 surface water is often richer in dissolved oxygen do nutrients and nitrogen n contaminants while groundwater is typically anoxic without much reactive solute because it is consumed by microbial communities attached to streambed sediments findlay 1995 storey et al 2004 ping et al 2018 li et al 2020 the exchange of streams and groundwater in river banks may alter the redox environment within

removed from aquatic ecosystems hedin et al 1998 gomez velez et al 2015 ping et al 2020 the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process transforms bioavailable n from no3 into nh4 which coupled with anammox which reduces nh4 and no2 to gaseous n2 is an alternative or additional n loss pathway in aquatic systems jensen et al 2011 sgouridis et al 2011 salk et al 2017 the quality and

accumulate within microsites at the low river stage the hz is dominated by groundwater discharge as indicated by the green arrow in fig 1 and then stimulate heterotrophic respiration at the rising river stage with surface water intrusion into rzs blue arrow in fig 1 many investigators have investigated the influence of different poc qualities or types on the denitrification rate especially the

et al 2014 affect denitrification in aquatic systems past studies have generally used plant species as carbon sources but few of them have evaluated the difference between plant leaves and mud deposits in poc quality and quantity and made a direct comparison between their effect on n retention and nitrate reduction in addition there is far less understanding of how different types of natural particulate organic matter influence nitrate reduction during the bs process in this study we investigated the different roles of leaf litter and mud deposits in nitrate reduction during the bs process the column system was filled with riparian sediments and buried with the poc layer on the soil surface which was collected from natural organic components then the column system was subjected to a change in the water flow direction and chemistry mimicking the bs process namely downwelling stream flow and upwelling groundwater flow the experimental results will provide some insights into how different poc types affect nitrate reduction in the rz during the bs process 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling site the soil columns were filled with sediments collected from the rz of the tongshun river in shahu town in hubei province china fig 2 the sediments in the soil columns were composed of loam sandy loam and silt clay loam which is a typical low permeable medium the shahu research field is located in the hinterland of the eastern jianghan plain in xiantao city and is surrounded by the tongshun river and the kuige river with mean no3 and nh4 concentrations of 0 01

by the yangtze river and its largest tributary the han river this area has a subtropical monsoonal climate with an annual average temperature of 16 8 c the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1200 mm and 1378 mm respectively deng et al 2014 schaefer et al 2016 2 2 soil and natural poc five sampled blocks were chosen for inclusion in a randomized block experiment at the investigation site each block measured 1 m 1 m the upper 20 cm of unvegetated sediments was collected after removing leaf litter and humus materials above the soil surface the 2 mm grain size fraction of the sediments was sieve collected and homogenized after being spread thin to air dry at room temperature and then ground liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the sediments were packed into columns in several increments and each increment was tightly packed before the next increment was placed on the top the packed mass of sediments in each increment was based on sediment density the basic physical properties of riparian sediments at the sampling site were measured by standard procedures through in situ tests and indoor experiments including bulk density porosity and hydraulic conductivity zhang et al 2011 rezanezhad et al 2014 bulk density ρ b was determined using the cutting ring method at the sampling site we chose three locations stochastically and pressed cutting rings with known weights vertically into the soil then we removed the rings that were fully filled with soil and measured the soil moisture content θ by the oven drying method the sediment bulk density ρ b was calculated using the soil moisture content ρ b m v 1 θm where m is the filled soil weight in the ring and v is the volume of the ring three replicates were performed at each location the hydraulic conductivity k

mixture compound the mass ratio of mud deposit to leaf litter was 10 1 and a blank control soil the mud deposit was collected from the river bottom and dried for approximately 4 5 days to a constant weight then it was ground and sifted through a 2 mm sieve fresh leaves were collected from the rz placed in a fishing net and conditioned in a stream channel for 15 days to simulate the natural conditions of leaf litter buried in the hz stelzer et al 2014 after the pretreatment of the leaf litter the litter was oven dried at 60 c to a constant weight for approximately one week ground manually and sifted through a 0 25 mm sieve zhang et al 2011 2 3 column experiments the column apparatus 45 cm in length and 14 cm in inner diameter is illustrated and described in fig 3 the soil columns were packed with sampled sediment soil to a height of 30 cm a 2 cm poc treatment layer was placed on the top of the soil surface the amounts of poc added to each column are shown in table 1 and there was a comparable c n ratio in each treatment four lateral sampling ports were spaced at depths of 4 cm 1 0 cm 2 16 cm 3 and 30 cm 4 below the buried poc layers all these depths are referenced to the poc buried layers in all treatments infiltration was performed with synthetic well oxygenated surface water osw kno3 100 mg l nahco3 96 mg l caso4 2h2o 60 mg l mgso4 7h2o 60 mg l kcl

the columns to ensure artificial water flow through the saturation systems at a constant head these columns were presaturated with nitrate free agw before the experiments first osw with no3 contaminant was transfused through the top of each column for 30 days the columns were then eluted with agw from opposite ends of the column to mimic the stream discharging groundwater process by upwelling flux for 36 days the sedimentary part of each treatment was kept in the dark to suppress the effect of photosynthesis mermillod blondin et al 2005 navel et al 2011 2 4 measurement of chemical and physical parameters water samples collected from the buried poc layer and bottom outlet were measured every 2 days for their physical and chemical characteristics whereas water samples collected from other sampling ports were measured every 4 days the physicochemical parameters of the water samples including the ph do eh and temperature were measured with specific probes using a hach multiparameter controller inorganic solutes were analyzed as follows no3 by ion chromatography nh4 by nessler s reagent colorimetric method and doc by the combustion nondispersive infrared method and toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan for carbon analysis the total carbon content was determined in a subsample and the inorganic carbon was determined by the co2 content in the gas phase after acidification of the sample the organic carbon was calculated by the difference between the total organic carbon and inorganic carbon the poc quantity in different types of natural organic matter and sediment was represented by toc content and the loss on ignition mass was measured by toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the tn content was analyzed using a vario macro cube by high temperature combustion and chemical reduction and then transformed to measure the n2 concentration 2 5 data treatment the biogeochemical parameters were transformed using a logarithm base 10 to meet the requirements of statistic tests in cases where data were not distributed normally pearson s correlation statistics r and associated p values were reported for all correlations two tailed t tests were used to calculate whether the no3 concentration in different depths was reduced significantly compared with the no3 concentration in osw with poc addition barnes et al 2012 one way anova was used to assess whether different poc treatments had impacts on pore water solute concentrations and redox conditions regression analysis including linear and nonlinear regression was used to derive the time series trend of physiochemical parameters we also used two way anova factor day and treatment perujo et al 2017 combined with the least significant difference lsd post hoc test to investigate the treatment time and treatment time interaction effects on the no3 nh4 do and doc concentrations a relationship was significant when the p value was less than 0 05 statistical analyses were conducted with spss statistical software 3 results 3 1 characteristics of physicochemical parameters in the downward flow 3 1 1 time series of chemical parameters within the buried poc layer during the

during the downwelling stage and had the lowest concentration 67 68 mg l in these two treatments the leaf litter treatment had a higher nh4 concentration than that in the mud deposit and blank control treatments two way anova f 3 339 p 0 05 which suggested higher nh4 production in the leaf litter due to higher tn fig 4b table 1 in the mud deposit and blank control there was a linear decline in nh4

before the 15th day and then increased from the 15th to the 27th day r 2 0 566 p 0 01 and r 2 0 442 p 0 05 respectively combined with the decreasing nh4 concentration in the mud deposit treatment these results suggested the occurrence of nitrification the eh value was always larger than 0 mv in the poc buried layers and it was lower in the leaf litter and mixture treatments than in the mud deposit and control treatments two way anova f 3 120 p 0 05 fig 5a the eh value in the leaf litter mixture and blank control treatments increased with time p 0 05 except for the mud deposit treatment

concentration approached the first peak concentration on approximately the 10th day in the leaf litter and mixture treatments for all treatments the peak doc concentration appeared on the 17th day and the doc concentration maxima decreased in magnitude from the leaf litter mixture and mud deposit treatments to the blank control treatment fig 6c the effluent do concentration two way anova f 1 848 p

the do eh and ph values were in the range of 9 5 12 mg l 100 250 mv and 7 8 8 6 respectively with more oxidizing and alkaline conditions at deeper sediments compared with the buried poc layers fig 5 in addition do ph and eh value variations covered a somewhat narrower range than those measured in the buried poc layers 3 2 characteristics of physicochemical parameters in the upward flow 3 2 1 time series of chemical parameters in the column influent when the flow direction was inverted artificial groundwater do 2 5 0 5 mg l without n contaminants flowed from the bottom of the columns port 5 no3 nh4 doc and do concentrations were detected in sampling port 4 which represented the bottom influent because the agw was free from no3 both the no3 and nh4 concentrations continuously decreased with time due to the dilution effect fig 7a b the doc concentration in the mud deposit treatment decreased gradually with upward flux r 2 0 618 p 0 05 while the doc concentration was volatile during the upwelling stage in the leaf litter mixture and blank control treatments fig 7c the do concentration fluctuated within a range between 1 and 5 mg l which represented hypoxic and suboxic conditions fig 7d the do concentration did not vary significantly among the different poc treatments one way anova f 1 635 p 0 194 there was no significant difference in ph among these treatments throughout the entire upwelling period one way anova f 1 419 p 0 249 and the ph value fluctuated between 7 4 and 8 6 fig 8a 3 2 2 time series of chemical parameters within the buried poc layer in the poc buried layer the no3 concentration decreased rapidly and was almost consumed after the bs process in all treatments fig 9a different from no3 concentration nh4 concentration increased over time leaf litter

higher in the mixture and leaf litter treatments than in the blank control and mud deposit treatments in the mid late stage fig 9b the doc concentration declined quickly during the first 2 days of the upwelling experiment in the leaf litter treatment and then increased the doc concentration approached a peak value of 7 18 mg l on approximately the 10th day in the mud deposit treatment fig 9c the effluent doc concentration in the mixture and blank control treatments increased over time with upward flux r 2 0 878 p 0 01 and r 2 0 847 p 0 01 the do concentration during the upwelling period was also affected by the poc treatments two way anova f 3 439 p 0 05 the do concentration generally decreased with time and was lower in the leaf litter and mixture treatments anoxic environment than in the mud deposit and blank control treatments suboxic environment fig 9d the ph value was also higher under more sub oxic conditions fig 8b r 0 644 p 0 001 4 discussion for all treatments the effluent no3 concentrations were lower than those in osw which suggested that no3 was removed in the hyporheic sediment dnra was less likely to occur because the do concentration was above 1 mg l and the eh value was above 0 mv in these treatments compared with denitrification dnra is typically mediated by strict anaerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria and favored by strict anaerobic conditions buresh and patrick 1978 pett ridge et al 2006 lansdown et al 2012 denitrification was therefore likely the dominant pathway for nitrate reduction and transformation with downward flux in our experiment other authors have found that low permeable media such as clay is more favorable to denitrification than sand akhavan et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the hyporheic sediment in this study was a typical low permeable medium and was composed of loam sandy loam and silt clay loam which was conducive to denitrification the no3 in pore water may also have been removed through assimilatory nitrate reduction lansdown et al 2012 stelzer et al 2014 the production of nh4 however was primarily derived from mineralization and desorption in these columns 4 1 effect of poc quantity on nitrate reduction poc addition had significant effects on nitrate reduction in two ways namely poc quantity and quality stelzer et al 2014 2015 past research has illustrated that heterotrophic microbial activity is limited by the bioavailability of organic matter within hzs jones 1995 and the bioavailability of organic substrates would also limit denitrification arango et al 2010 barnes et al 2012 the leaf litter had a higher poc content which was conducive to nitrate reduction through denitrification during the downwelling stage leaf litter addition caused a rapid decline in the do concentration in the buried poc layer drove pore water to have a suboxic condition and stimulated nitrate reduction by producing a large amount of doc and creating favorable redox conditions do 3 mg l ph 7 8 for denitrification sgouridis et al 2011 the no3 decreased rapidly in the poc buried layer and the no3 concentration was lowest in the leaf litter treatment the limited amount of poc in the mud deposits led to a minor drop in the do concentration in the buried poc layer which was under oxidizing conditions with a do value 6 mg l during the downwelling experiment fig 4d it should be emphasized that nitrate was not removed in the mud deposit and blank control treatments within the poc buried layer fig 4a as the influent osw was oxygenated water do competed with nitrate to act as an electron acceptor compared with nitrate organic carbon tends to be oxidized with oxygen preferentially which supplies more energy to microorganisms gu et al 2007 rivett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 denitrification may dominate aerobic respiration in the mid late stage with the depletion of do the no3 concentration was reduced in the deeper hyporheic sediments with downward flux in the mud deposit treatment despite well oxygenated pore water detected in the bottom effluent fig 6a d 4 2 effect of poc quality on nitrate reduction previous studies have investigated the influence of different types of poc such as plant leaves wood chips cardboard fibers and cornstalks on organic matter breakdown and n cycling greenan et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 stelzer et al 2014 the chemical composition of poc had a direct impact on doc production and further played a role in n dynamics especially the denitrification rate yoshimura et al 2010 one limitation of these studies was that they focused more on the comparisons among various plant species in addition mud deposits containing organic matter which are widely present in rzs and crucial for n cycling have mostly been ignored as shown in table 1 the four columns consisted of comparable c n ratios but different toc contents the solute concentrations were standardized and presented as a relative value c to the total doc concentration with the assumption that the buried poc decomposed into doc and was released completely into the pore water it was assumed that there was the same decomposition capacity in all treatments we investigated the action of natural organic matter by assuming that the converted per unit mass doc different sources reacted with river borne nitrate during the downwelling stage the doc concentration in the leaf litter treatment was lowest and decreased with time continuously in the poc buried layer while doc accumulation appeared in the mud deposit mixture and blank control treatments fig 10a which suggests that the organic carbon in leaf litter can be easily consumed by denitrification as the carbon source translocated to deeper sediments the peak doc concentration was also higher in the mud deposit treatment than in the leaf litter treatment which also indicated that more doc remained in the bottom effluent of the mud deposit treatment due to the lower reactivity of the carbon substrate fig 10c in addition when the upward flux returned to the poc buried layer the doc concentration still remained greater in mud deposit treatment fig 10e therefore buried leaf litter had more benefits for reducing nitrate efficiently and effectively than mud deposits burial of the mud deposit resulted in higher nh4 production compared with the leaf litter treatment with the addition of per unit mass of doc fig 10b d and f in this study we followed the pretreatment of leaves used by stelzer et al 2014 and allowed leaf litter to become colonized with microbes in the stream channel before burying it into hyporheic sediments cornut et al 2010 navel et al 2011 stelzer et al 2014 colonized microbes stimulate biogeochemical reactions and require dissolved n for proliferation from water which leads to n retention cheever et al 2012 for leaf litter treatment these reasons contribute to faster nitrate reduction in pore water most no3 was removed in the poc buried layer during the initial mid stage of the downwelling period the organic matter in mud deposits is mainly derived from phytoplankton and algal remains and consists of humic substances including humin humic acid and fulvic acid liu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 dissolved organic matter consists of molecules with various degrees of biological recalcitrance humic substances are persistent and have been regarded as macromolecules and the molecular weight of aqueous humic extracts from soil is up to 2000 da luo et al 2019 humic acids and fulvic acids are also recognized as a complex supra molecular arrangement of various mass components which have a low molecular mass and associate with aromatic and aliphatic structures sutton and sposito 2005 olk et al 2019 due to the refractory nature of humic substances microbial metabolism would take longer time than using labile compounds as carbon source such as polysaccharides amino acids and fatty acids as carbon sources fischer et al 2002 yoshimura et al 2010 attributed to the lower reactivity of mud deposits nitrate reduction occurred in the deeper hz during the mid late stage of the downwelling experiment and nitrate reduction also occurred in the upwelling stage at longer time scales 4 3 limitations and future research direction both poc quantity and quality had a significant effect on nitrate reduction within a simulated rz the chemical composition of leaf litter and mud deposits should also be investigated because previous studies have suggested that poc chemical composition has a direct effect on doc production pfenning and mcmahon 1997 yoshimura et al 2010 and on the denitrification rate baker and vervier 2004 barnes et al 2012 some investigations have shown that there is a positive relationship between the protein like fluorophore quantity and denitrification potential but a negative relationship between aromatic fractions and the denitrification rate barnes et al 2012 notably baker and vervier 2004 found that the denitrification reaction rate at the stream sediment interface was not related to bulk doc concentration while it was determined by the low molecular weight organic acid concentration additionally the protein like substances in dissolved organic matter are much more easily transformed and act as carbon sources for denitrification gao et al 2020 therefore the chemical compositions of leaf litter and mud deposits should be examined and analyzed in the future if the nitrate reduction potential is tightly related to one specific chemical composition under different redox conditions the interface between streams and hyporheic sediment has been recognized as a hotspot for n processing stream water with n contaminants encounters buried particulate organic matter and forms sharp gradients in no3 doc and do concentrations in the streambed mcclain et al 2003 gu et al 2007 duff et al 2008 although the role of buried poc in nitrate reduction at the stream sediment interface is well known stelzer et al 2014 2015 further studies should focus on the role of poc addition at different locations within rzs such as deep sediment 30 cm channels and other linked compartments of aquatic ecosystems in n processing seitzinger et al 2006 sgouridis et al 2011 buried leaf litter removed nitrate more quickly within the poc buried layer during the initial mid stage of the downwelling experiment while mud deposits promoted nitrate reduction in deeper sediment during the mid late downwelling stage as well as during the upwelling stage however the design of our experiments did not allow us to compare the nitrate removal efficiency between these treatments during the two stages in addition the poc addition effect on the nitrate reduction potential and efficiency during long term and repetitive pollution processes should be investigated for example we could compare the role of leaf litter and mud deposits in nitrate reduction and n retention over multiple phases of bs with different intensities and durations of upward and downward fluxes liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 poc addition promoted no3 reduction but also resulted in nh4 accumulation which was probably induced by mineralization and desorption in our experiments except for denitrification there are many biogeochemical processes which remove no3 such as assimilatory no3 reduction mediated by microbes sobczak et al 2003 lansdown et al 2012 perujo et al 2018 sulfur driven nitrate reduction may also be present in surficial sediments of rzs when there is sulfide in close proximity to oxic water and the process of no3 reduction to nh4 or n2 is coupled with the process of sulfide oxidation to so4 burgin and hamilton 2007 burgin et al 2013 in addition microbial communities might also be stressed due to depleted labile organic carbon and lead to an increase in nh4 production by mineralization of microbial n and don production from cell lysis stelzer et al 2015 when there is plenty of do and doc in sediments and interstitial water nh4 would be consumed by the coupled process of nitrification and denitrification therefore a higher ratio of leaf litter and mud deposit mixtures will increase no3 reduction and reduce nh4 accumulation in the rzs during the overall bs process 5 conclusions we investigated the effect of buried natural organic matter on nitrate reduction in the low permeable rz by comparing the no3 nh4 do and doc concentrations between soil columns with different poc qualities and quantities leaf litter mud deposits mixture and blank control throughout a complete hydraulic interaction called bs a downward flux in which river borne no3 flowed into groundwater and upward hypoxic groundwater discharged to surface water through sediment in the leaf litter treatment nitrate reduction occurred immediately in the poc buried layer with downward flux because of the larger amount of poc and a higher reactivity in leaf litter it caused suboxic conditions in the pore water with lower eh and ph values which was conducive to the occurrence of denitrification due to the lower poc content and lower reactivity of doc in the mud deposit the reduction of river borne no3 primarily occurred in deeper sediment with downward flux for the demand of longer timescales and denitrification also occurred during the upwelling stage it also resulted in nh4 accumulation with the burial of natural organic matter in the rz a suitable ratio of leaf litter and mud deposit addition in rzs might be helpful for removing no3 and decreasing nh4 production simultaneously author statement this
