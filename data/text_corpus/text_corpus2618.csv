13090,this study aims to investigate treatment efficiency and evaluate the energy efficacy of integrated electrocoagulation system combined with ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes for successful textile dye bath effluents treatment in this regard the characterization of physicochemical parameters such as ph turbidity salinity total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss electrical conductivity ec and chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed to estimate removal efficiency of each treatment process moreover the electrical energy consumption of all aforementioned processes was measured individually to work out cost effectiveness fenton process appeared to be ineffective for reducing cod and other parameters while the overall performance of ecs alone showed far better results cod and color removal efficiencies were 57 4 and 40 respectively however the application of ecs o3 resulted in complete decolorization and almost 99 7 cod removal under optimized operating conditions including ozone flow 300 mg h ph 7 1 temperature 25 c ecs photo fenton process resulted in cod and color removal of 95 6 and 97 respectively electrical energy per order of ecs was found 1 58 kwh m3 for minimum removal of dyes and cod ecs ozonation is responsible for 100 decolorization but at a very high cost ecs photo fenton process proved to be the second best option in terms of treatment and energy consumption hence an integrated treatment system of ecs with aops appeared to be the most feasible and eco friendly that could lead to the treated wastewater for reuse and

environmental issues such as water pollution and climate change signify a major urgency for civil societies industries and government institutional frameworks 1 2 in order to conserve water resources many developed nations are rapidly taking immediate action by implementing policies and legislation 3 4 a textile production unit produces 8000 kg products per day consumes around 1 6 million liters of water 5 6 about 25 of this entire water consumption is utilized in printing and dyeing processes usepa estimates that about 40 l water is required for dyeing 1 kg of cloth and the requirement still varies with process type and textile material textile effluent consists of solvents dichloromethane l chlorinated hydrocarbons 1 1 1 trichloroethane surfactants sulphonates alkyl ether phosphates carboxylates salts kcl nacl and dyes these compounds persist in the environments and pose toxicity to the biotic and abiotic components 7 8 therefore behra et al 8 estimated through detailed literature by demonstrating advanced techniques to abate and degrade the pollutants from textile dye bath effluents through novel and promising technologies additionally atalay and ers√∂z 9 investigated some of the most advanced oxidation processes with biological treatment to remove dyes through hybrid applications the profit making behaviors and reluctance of industrialists have caused the release of toxic effluent directly into the environment with the consequences of pollution damage to agricultural lands and aquatic toxicity 10 12 wastewater treatment plants in developing countries are either non functional or utilize conventional wastewater treatment techniques 13 14 the conventional wastewater treatment processes are energy intensive costly require more space manpower and material for installation and are time consuming 8 15 16 the conventional treatment technologies involve a combination of ph neutralization dissolved air flotation 17 biological treatment 18 19 reverse osmosis 20 22 and process automation producing treated water and meets the environmental quality standards 23 24 among all traditional treatment technologies the ecs process is the most effective for removing high molecular weight particles and suspended substances from industrial effluents and producing less volume of sludge 25 it is based on major operational parameters such as time required for separation chemical additive dose pressure size and diameter of gaseous bubbles and time for saturation 26 this results in almost 98 removal of cod from textile dye bath effluents 17 27 the advantages of integrated ozonation and electrocoagulation process for cod removal are reported by many studies 25 28 29 aops have been recognized as more successful and feasible in contaminant removal from textile dye bath effluents 30 33 aops are oxidation based treatment techniques to produce reactive oh radicals aops contain ozonation direct uv uv h2o2 uv h2o2 o3 fenton and photo fenton processes to treat textile wastewater 34 37 aops technologies are feasible easy to operate and have comparatively less sludge and residual products than activated sludge 38 40 however aops are considered the tertiary treatment having high operating costs 40 but the sludge treatment facility is installed after an activated sludge treatment plant then the cost is relatively higher than aops cost chemical methods require more chemicals for textile wastewater treatment there is no add on the chemicals in aops treatment of textile wastewater moreover toxic dyes and chemicals are only separated out by conventional treatment which attributes to sludge production to salts and chemicals without treatment only an organic portion of pollutants absorbs and generates more sludge in aerobic treatment advanced oxidation processes break down complex pollutant molecules into simpler non toxic ones 41 43 almost 90 of the textile industries have a space conflict in pakistan conventional treatment methods require 100 times more footprint compared to advanced oxidation processes the aerobic and anaerobic treatment processes are continuous treatment technologies which take 24 h for dye bath effluents treatment if these processes shut down because of some technical issue or poor maintenance then these processes will initiate from their starting point meanwhile aops are switch on processes and do not require long time intervals to complete the space and location facility are not feasible to install conventional etp sludge production in secondary methods results in again the production of chemicals just as 80 cost for the treatment and discharge thus these are the scientific gaps which highly demand this integrated electrocoagulation process with advanced oxidation processes for the successful textile dye bath effluents treatment integrated technologies are recently being employed to overcome the process limitations cost inefficiency and resource in conventional water treatment technologies 34 44 in this study wastewater from the textile dyeing industry has been treated through a combination of conventional and oxidation treatment systems each oxidative treatment such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes were applied after ecs to study for appropriate dye removal and treatment efficiency in addition various aops and other processes were investigated to study their effectiveness moreover considering the complex nature of real textile wastewater it is essential to apply combined ecs with aops to achieve effective degradation of pollutants in real textile dye bath effluents therefore this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of integrated ecs coupled with each o3 fenton and photo fenton process to study the effect on the treatment efficiency using real textile wastewater in this study textile dye bath effluents are successfully treated with physical i e ecs and aops treatment by measuring physicochemical parameters to meet the neqs additionally this study sheds light on the evaluation of energy requirements and cost of each treatment process for optimizing overall treatment s cost effectiveness this study will also pave the way to utilize the aops a as feasible alternative for successfully treating textile dye bath effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater samples collection the samples of textile dye bath effluents were collected from a local textile and dyeing industry located in lahore pakistan a medium scale physical treatment plant was installed to treat dye bath effluents and etp components were electrocoagulation dissolved air flotation lamella clarifier and reverse osmosis particularly 5 l triplicate wastewater samples were taken from the ecs unit in etp this effluent was primarily treated with an electrocoagulation unit of etp these samples were then collected in the pre washed containers and transferred into a laboratory for treatment with aops in order to prevent reactions and contamination the triplicate samples were kept at 4 c without adding preservatives 2 2 experimental design experiments were conducted to treat the textile dye bath effluents through integrated ecs coupled with aops such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes 2 2 1 electrocoagulation system ecs the electrocoagulation treatment unit is deliberately used as a physiochemical process to remove suspended particles from textile dye bath effluents this unit consisted of a feeding tank reaction chamber with vertically arranged electrodes development tank where reactions were completed in the reaction chamber and sludge removal unit it involved a redox reaction where destabilization of pollutants occurs due to electric current dc voltage to the electrolyte solution ec unit contained two electrodes fe and al combined with a power supply in the ec process anodic dissolution was generated coagulants with oh and h2 gas at the cathode cationic polymer pac liquid anionic polyelectrolyte type i and poly alcl2 were dosed to agglomerate the particles to synthesize the flocs by gradual moving the flocculator process prior to inserted in the ecs unit then these flocs were removed from downstream for an efficient settling system that was performed under gravity 25 45 46 the capacity of the ecs unit was 120 m3 h for the retention time of 60 min the ecs had a voltage of about 380 400 v and power 70 80 kw to run this set up sludge was separated in tank 1 and the remnant scraped sludge was discarded in tank ii hereafter the treated wastewater was then extracted from the bottom of tank i triplicate samples from the ecs unit were collected and preserved at 4 c in plastic bottles for further analysis the physicochemical water quality parameters were measured in order to check the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation process 2 2 2 advance oxidation processes aops the electrocoagulation process was coupled with the following aops for the treatment of textile wastewater 2 2 2 1 ozonation the treatment with ozone was carried out in a bubble column plexi glass reactor with a diameter of 2 5 cm to treat textile dye bath effluents the flow rate of the ozone generator model oz 10g dimensions 350 mm 250 mm 600 mm was 300 mg o3 h at room temperature 25 c and ozone dose was optimized at about 50 mg 47 48 for calibration purposes ozone was formed bubbles in deionized water to control the ozone dose for 10 min before initiation of the experiment filtered and non filtered wastewater samples were used for the treatment and removal of color and cod in this regard 1 l triplicate samples from the electrocoagulation unit were collected and measured the physicochemical parameters such as ph cod mg l color tds mg l tss mg l ec ms cm salinity ppt and turbidity ntu the treated water with o3 was sampled after 15 30 and 60 min hereafter the aforementioned wastewater quality parameters were measured to determine cod removal decolorization and treatment efficacy of studied processes these samples were then stored in plastic bottles at 4 c for further analysis 2 2 2 2 fenton process fenton process set up was conducted in 1 l graduated pyrex glass column and the magnetic stirrer was used for efficient stirring at 100 rpm for 30 min followed by 60 min settling time the doses of h2o2 35 of analytical grade merck germany and feso4 7h2o 99 w w merck germany were optimized at about 170 mg l 510 Œºl and 50 mg l respectively the optimal doses were gradually added in triplicate textile wastewater samples from the ecs unit treatment efficiency was measured by estimating physicochemical parameters including ph turbidity salinity tds tss and electrical conductivity then these samples were preserved at 4 c in plastic bottles 2 2 2 3 photo fenton process the photo fenton oxidation process was conducted in a cylindrical photo reactor with a volume of 5 l uv reactor height 25 5 cm length 17 cm width 13 5 cm was wrapped with al foil to increase the absorbance of uv irradiance in the uv reactor the irradiance of the low pressure mercury uv lamp penray 3sc9 upland usa was 5 mw cm2 with a wavelength of 254 nm fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of uv reactor used in the photo fenton oxidation process in the photo fenton process uv irradiance 72 w power was varied from 15 and 30 min in 1 l wastewater sample at the optimized doses of 170 mg l h2o2 and 50 mg l feso4 7h2o to check treatment efficiency and efficacy of textile dye bath effluents then samples were withdrawn after regular time intervals from uv for the determination of physicochemical parameters 2 3 analytical techniques the physicochemical water quality parameters were evaluated to analyze wastewater samples the textile dye bath effluents were characterized based on the quality of samples concentration and type of textile wastewater sample these parameters were estimated to access the pollution load which is essential to optimize operation and design in ecs and aops the physicochemical parameters such as ph temperature electrical conductivity total dissolved solids salinity turbidity and cod were determined following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 49 additionally the removal efficiency was also evaluated by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 8230 tokyo japan moreover cod was measured by tintometer lovibond gmbh44287 2 4 calculation of energy requirements and cost the operational costs are directly influenced by the treatment performance of the ecs and aops the efficiencies of reactions can be facilitated in comparison through powerful scale parameters referred to ee o the electrical energy per order kwh m3 refers to the electrical energy required to eliminate contaminants in 1 m3 of effluent by one order magnitude it describes direct association to electrical efficiency of aops which is independent of nature of the treatment process therefore it allows to compare these efficacies of aops technologies and offers requisite information for economic and scale up analyses to compare with the conventional treatments the values of ee o have been evaluated by using the following empirical formula in eq 1 50 52 1 ee o kwh m 3 p t 1000 v 60 log c o c t where p power of generator or uv reactor or magnetic stirrer kw t reaction time min v textile effluent volume litre co initial concentration of pollutant in cod mg l ct final concentration of contaminant mg l 3 results and discussion the key findings are given below which succinctly represent the exponential increase in physicochemical water quality parameters in textile dye bath effluents in order to maintain quality and optimize the treatment processes the textile effluent from the dyeing industry was treated enough to meet the water quality parameters integrated ecs treatment with aops was compared to check the treatment efficiency and efficacy of textile dye bath effluents 3 1 characterization of raw water and ecs textile dyeing wastewater the physicochemical characteristics of the textile dye bath effluents inlet and ecs wastewater are represented in table 1 the obtained results showed that electrocoagulation treatment reduced the water quality parameters from inlet raw water it can be depicted from table 1 that the cod of raw water was 680 0 6 mg l which was extremely high from neqs value for cod 150 mg l higher cod concentration in wastewater is a favorable condition for electrocoagulation treatment of textile dye bath effluents at the same time other parameters such as ph turbidity tds tss and ec of raw water were significantly higher than the permissible limits of neqs a similar finding has been proposed by kothai et al 46 and chanikya et al 53 where the ph ranged from 8 2 to 12 5 the other parameters were also high from the neqs moreover other studies also proposed similar results that textile wastewater s ph cod salinity turbidity tss and tds were not met the discharge limits 25 54 higher the parameters of textile dyeing wastewater cause toxicity to the environment therefore it is significant to treat textile dye bath effluents prior to discharge into the environment 3 2 direct raw water treatment with aops the experimental results demonstrated water quality parameters for removing and degrading various dyes and chemicals in the effluent raw water as represented in table 2 the o3 process reduced the cod of the inlet from 680 0 6 mg l to 160 0 02 mg l which succinctly depicted maximum removal of almost 77 similarly this resulted in the removal of 74 8 tds and 65 6 turbidity additionally results indicate 50 removal of salinity 67 electrical conductivity and 25 3 of tss removal from the ozonation process at 60 min retention time however the fenton process showed comparatively less effectiveness for removing turbidity cod tds tss ec salinity and ph change almost 34 removal of cod was achieved after 15 min and 55 9 after 30 min residence time while the photo fenton treatment showed quite better results in decolorization and removal efficiencies of textile raw water compared to the fenton treatment process cod tds tss turbidity salinity and ec removal were achieved up to 69 2 73 4 23 69 6 50 and 51 respectively within 30 min of the uv irradiance almost 33 9 of cod was eliminated after 15 min reaction time as shown in table 3 these treated parameters from aops have not met the neqs table 1 raw water of textile dye bath effluents showed a gradual decline in decolorization and removal of physical parameters compared to aops including o3 fenton and photo fenton therefore it was assumed that some factors affecting on the rate of removal efficiency of water parameters 3 3 electrocoagulation treatment with aops the electrocoagulation process is physical treatment technology for mineralizing and decomposing suspended particles in textile dye bath effluents as a result of electrocoagulation large sized flocs were formed resulting in less sludge to entrap colloidal particles present in the effluent pollutants in wastewater are absorbed when hydroxide ions give the active site for attachment 55 56 the characterization of various physiochemical parameters for determining treatment efficiencies is represented in table 4 fig 2 a depicts the effect of ph on ecs alone ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton techniques the reaction ph is a significant parameter which affects the overall performance of ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton treatment methods as it maintains the generation rate of oh the present study optimized solution ph by reducing from alkaline ph which ultimately meets the permissible limits the ph of treated effluent from ecs alone was 9 73 0 01 which is alkaline in nature the alkaline ph is converted the iron and aluminium hydroxides into the hydroxy ferrate or hydroxy aluminate byproducts respectively these products have the potential for absorbing dye molecules and ec residues the textile raw water has more concentrated in terms of chemicals and dyes which is hard to eliminate with ecs alone however the maximum treatment efficiency of ecs was observed by adding coagulants with 15 min of retention time subsequently ph was lowered up to 7 1 while treated with ozonation and met neqs required values the ph values of ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton efficiently reached the permissible limits of water quality parameters the ph has an important influence on pollutant degradation via conversion of reactive species and the dissolution of ozone moreover the high ph will lead to the precipitation of ferrous ferric ions ozonation and photo fenton with electrocoagulation showed better results of ph the ph is directly affected through solubility and production of hydroxyl radical 57 58 the main reason for this trend is the rapid decomposition process at alkaline ph and the potential of hydroxyl radical is relatively higher consequently oxidation treatment with ozone degrades contaminants in textile wastewater oxidation accelerates the reaction of ozone at lower ph conversely the primary reaction is the oxidation process of hydroxyl radicals at alkaline ph which is effectively rapid compared to other reactions the other significant reason behind the ozonation process after ecs is that the reaction of ozone with degradation products through the oxidation process lowers the ph of wastewater 59 60 similarly the effect of variation in ph was reported by various studies that show similar trend 60 62 in the decomposition process ozone produces more oh radicals at alkaline ph and the rate of degradation of dyes and chemicals is increased in textile dye bath effluents it is demonstrated from fig 2 b that turbidity is another parameter which influences in performance of treatment efficiency ecs alone and ecs fenton processes obtained greater turbidity values of about 21 0 05 ntu and 15 0 089 ntu respectively however both of treatment processes were involved in less contribution in turbidity reduction conversely ecs o3 depicted more optimized results of treated effluent to reach the neqs value of turbidity moreover the primary contributing treatment process was ecs photo fenton for 100 removal of turbidity tds and turbidity are used to effectively remove all suspended and dissolved particles in textile dye bath effluent for reuse and discharge purposes 52 63 several researchers 25 64 65 reported a similar trend under optimal conditions the dissolved metallic ions as coagulants in the ecs reactor were not sufficient to completely remove the pollutants ecs o3 contributes to better mixing and mass transfer increases oxidation of pollutants and reduces sludge content thus providing higher pollutant removal efficiency barrera et al 66 has demonstrated coupling of ec o3 provides greater benefits than the single treatment system because of the catalytic coagulants and hydroxyl radicals which effectively remove the organic pollutants the efficiency of ecs o3 coupling having synergetic effects is attributed to the efficiency of hydroxyl radicals and coagulants which many studies have proved ozonation has enabled the elimination of pollutants in textile dye bath effluents through the attraction of hydroxyl radical oh due to the decomposition of o3 58 67 68 the obtained test results of salinity from ecs alone ecs o3 ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes of textile dye bath effluents are as follows in fig 2 c the simple ecs and ecs fenton processes showed comparatively less effectiveness in eliminating salinity from the obtained test results the optimal dosage was 20 mg l 170 mg l of fe 2 h2o2 meanwhile it is succinctly found from results that treatment with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton attributed maximum salinity removal and met the standard limits of discharge effluents to achieve sustainability additionally kothai et al 46 and chanikya et al 53 have reported similar results by using integrated fenton and ecs processes for maximum removal and mineralization of dyes from textile effluents the same trend has been studied by various research studies 69 72 under optimized conditions it is observed from results that successful desalination was done with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton treatment technologies which would be a feasible opportunity to treat textile dye bath effluents fig 2 d illustrates the effect of total dissolved solids on various treatment technologies and compares them with neqs in the present study all treatment processes including electrocoagulation ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton showed satisfactory results which met the permissible standards for instance tds was removed from 3570 mg l to 2090 mg l by using ecs process similarly ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton were responsible for the complete removal of tds from textile dyeing wastewater which contributed to remove almost all the settleable substances and total dissolved solids the minimum tds value should be present because of organics available in textile wastewater which may produce excess fouling layer upon membrane surface 62 and also enhance pressure in the inlet and reduce inorganic concentrate in wastewater 73 75 hence this produces a feasible and promising option for the treatment of dye bath effluents fig 2 e represents the influence of total suspended solids on different treatment processes and compares them with neqs electrocoagulation showed a comparatively higher value of tss than the other treatment techniques the results inferred from fig 2 e shows that ecs ozonation resulted in 100 tss removal with an optimal dose of ozone the ecs photo fenton process was given significantly better results in the degradation and elimination of suspended particles from textile dye bath effluents meanwhile 170 mg l dose of h2o2 and 20 mg l doses of feso4 in ecs fenton process reduced tss from 330 mg l to 150 mg l which is up to the mark according to neqs a gradual increase in removal efficiency was noticed in the ecs fenton treatment process because the optimal concentration of h2o2 enhances the overall treatment of textile wastewater 76 77 as shown in fig 2 f ecs followed by ecs ozonation showed remarkable results regarding electrical conductivity the minimum amount of ozone dose was probably required that was highly productive for the degradation and removal of dyes and chemicals from textile dye bath effluents it is demonstrated that ec value was varied from the standard limit after treatment with electrocoagulation it was inferred that ecs alone depicted maximum ec during the stirring process due to the agglomeration of suspended particles dyes and various concentrations of chemicals in this regard nacl pump speed was remained low for maximum effectiveness and to get desired results similarly the fenton process after ecs also represented a less significant ec value that was not up to the mark according to standard discharge limits the excessive number of ions present in textile wastewater which ultimately increase conductivity and deteriorate water quality the results described that there was a slight reduction in conductivity from 3 27 ms cm to 1 28 ms cm this declining trend is that no of pollutants dissolved solids and dyes were removed and the ability to conduct electricity is also eliminated it may be attributed to the trend that the ecs fenton process was not much reactive for removing electrical conductivity satisfactory results were obtained by ecs photo fenton processes the maximum efficiency was achieved with ozonation from 3 27 0 01 ms cm to 0 109 0 007 ms cm after 60 min exposure this resulted in removing suspended particles to become apparent water for discharge and reuse purposes it is inferred from various researches that ec is an obvious parameter that imparts relatively high degradation of dyes and chemicals from textile dye bath effluents 40 46 78 fig 2 g illustrates the effect of cod on various treatment processes of textile dye bath effluents the treatment efforts concerned physical treatment such as ecs unit that was more feasible for more than 50 removal of cod load while remaining pollution load was minimized with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton treatment processes furthermore it can be comprehended that cod values varied from 290 mg l to 161 mg l by the treatment with the fenton process which could not be considered a feasible option according to a study conducted by abdullah et al 40 similar results were reported about 45 and 89 cod removal by ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes respectively in addition photo fenton process resulted in reduction cod from 290 mg l to 13 mg l moreover the obtained results succinctly demonstrated that there was 100 removal of cod after treatment with ozone within 60 min retention time increased removal of cod after ozonation of 60 min can best be elaborated by the fact that ozone is dissociated into the hydroperoxide anions and 79 80 ozonation is relatively more promising for decolorizing dyes especially azo dyes 81 hydroxyl radical is especially significant for cod removal and decolorization due to a high oxidation potential of about 2 7 v in acidic ph 82 83 3 4 removal efficiencies of ecs alone ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton treatment processes the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes were estimated for physicochemical parameters fig 3 represents the removal efficacy of the electrocoagulation process this process resulted in 57 35 cod and 41 46 of tds removal after treatment of textile dye bath effluent with ecs unit the ecs process changed the ph by 21 keeping it in the neutral range of 7 1 the advantages of integrated ozonation and electrocoagulation process for cod removal is reported by many studies 25 26 28 mehralian et al 84 reported that synergistic removal efficiency had been observed due to the oxidation s influence due to oh radicals and fe oh n coagulation increasing the dose of coagulants reduces cod turbidity and color but the efficiency is less than the ozone treatment the electrocoagulation process was comparatively less electrical conductivity total suspended solids salinity and turbidity the reason behind this less efficacy of ecs process was the formation of large sized flocs and high contamination with chemicals and dyes 62 84 the electrocoagulation treatment is feasible by adding polymers as primary coagulants 85 the agglomeration and settling process of colloidal particles increases with an increased dosage of coagulants non ionic polyacrylamide was also used to facilitate in electrocoagulation process 86 although coagulants were added during treatment textile dyeing wastewater contained a higher concentration of contaminants in textile dye bath effluents 87 hence ecs proved to be an effective treatment for removing large floc particles in textile dye bath effluents integrated ecs ozonation has been considered a highly promising and feasible option for complete decolorization and successful removal of cod tds tss and turbidity fig 4 represents the removal efficiencies increase gradually versus retention time till 60 min however after 15 min exposure time various parameters including ec cod and tds showed high reduction efficacy compared to other parameters additionally as retention time increased the removal efficiencies of physicochemical parameters were also increased after 30 min this depicted optimal results due to decomposition and formation of hydroxyl radical ozonation treatment followed by the electrocoagulation process provided turbidity salinity tds tss ec and cod removal efficiency by 99 29 93 100 100 90 and 100 respectively with maximum exposure with ozone these can be attributed to maximum production of hydroxyl radicals the complete decolorization was done by ozonation at a residence time of 60 min because of direct reactivity with textile dye bath effluents 52 68 ozonation followed by ecs showed the best results because of the synergistic effect of electrocoagulation oxidation through o3 enhanced turbulence while injecting ozone and decomposition through oh radicals the al 3 and fe 2 ions performed a catalytic action for ozone activation which further resulted in better decomposition of ozone roa morales et al 89 showed similar findings for ozonation with 100 color and cod removal efficiency consistent with the color removal efficiency observed in this study moreover a similar trend was demonstrated by various studies that ozone treatment was effective for the decolorization of azo dyes 44 65 88 the primary cause for this trend is decomposition reaction and contaminants are degraded through ozone oxidation ozonation treatment is responsible for organics and dyes removal from textile dye bath effluents this process is considered the best option for further consideration in the near future compared to other aops thus ecs ozonation process proved to be the most potent alternative for successfully removing water quality parameters and meeting the permissible limits of neqs ecs fenton oxidation treatment process is another great option for the degradation of contaminants of textile dye bath effluents ferrous ion involved scavenging effect and great concentration of ferrous ion caused slow degradation it produces only 10 sludge compared to activated sludge it hinders the fenton oxidation process for the effective treatment of wastewater therefore the optimal dose of h2o2 was added to enhance this degradation action fig 5 indicates the removal efficiencies of different parameters treated with ecs fenton oxidation process the optimal dose of 170 mg l h2o2 and 20 mg l feso4 7h2o resulted in 48 cod 64 3 salinity 57 8 ec and 55 tss removal respectively moreover the color of wastewater was removed by almost 37 after 30 min of settling time since in this case fe ions are hydrolyzed and form a disperse phase of iron hydroxide which works as a coagulant the reason behind the inefficiency of the fenton process is that this has not actively been participated as a catalyst at alkaline ph it causes coagulation and produces sludge indicating less satisfactory wastewater treatment results significantly fenton process is based on solution ph and shows effective results at acidic ph ramirez pereda et al 64 and kuleyin et al 77 reported similar results that succinctly depicted the comparatively low effectiveness of the fenton process followed by electrocoagulation various researchers depict the same trend to determine the efficacy and removal efficiencies 90 92 this showed 58 toc 49 cod and 67 color removal which would be ineffective for treatment dosages are inversely proportional to removal efficiencies of color whereas these have a direct relation with cod reduction in the present study the fenton process showed ineffective results than other treatment techniques such as ozonation photo fenton electrocoagulation processes 92 98 the removal efficiency is increased by enhancing the optimal doses of h2o2 and feso4 and then it will show satisfactory results for treating textile wastewater the ecs photo fenton process is considered a remarkable option for the treatment and degradation of dyes in textile dye bath effluents the removal efficiency of ecs photo fenton technology is significantly higher compared to ecs fenton process during photo fenton after ecs process uv irradiance is used in terms of h2o2 photolysis and ferric ion photo reduction into ferrous ion fig 6 depicts removal efficiencies of ecs photo fenton for various physicochemical parameters after 15 30 min exposure time the successful removal of tds and turbidity were done through treatment with the ecs photo fenton process at 15 min of exposure time a gradually increasing trend appeared after treatment with photo fenton followed by the electrocoagulation process moreover more than 90 cod salinity and electrical conductivity were removed after a retention time of 30 min therefore the removal efficiencies of each parameter were gradually increased with varied time intervals of 15 and 30 min of exposure uv irradiance the oh is a highly reactive oxidant to initiate the degradation of contaminants in textile dye bath effluents that led to the complete mineralization of organic contaminants 93 94 the other major reason could be the production of radical in a series of reactions involved instantaneous formation peroxyl radical which also commenced chain reaction leading towards subsequent oxidation process 78 95 hence the ecs photo fenton process proved to second best option after ozonation for successful treatment of textile dye bath effluents 3 5 comparison of electrical energy requirements in energy intensive treatment processes ecs ozonation fenton and photo fenton the design variables including exposure to uv irradiance the energy required by treatment processes and the order of magnitude regarding pollutant concentration removal are combined in a single function known as electrical energy per order of contaminant removal in kwh m3 ee o measures process treatment rates achieved in optimal volume of polluted effluents as a function of applied fixed energy and acts as a scale up parameter for energy use efficiency 52 96 97 table 4 compares electrical energy requirements by various treatment processes such as electrocoagulation ozonation fenton and photo fenton significantly ecs as medium scale unit consumed 70 80 kw of total power for 30 m3 of wastewater and ee o was found 1 58 kwh m3 for minimum removal of dyes and cod the ozone process resulted in successful decolorization and almost 99 7 cod removal that proved itself as the best viable option in terms of decolorization of textile dye bath effluents meanwhile photo fenton oxidation process required comparatively more ee o than the ozonation and fenton processes however it seemed to depict satisfactory color and cod removal results the photo fenton process showed the second feasible option for energy consumption 98 it is succinctly apparent that the fenton treatment process consumed less electrical energy to remove cod and color but removal efficiency was not up to the optimal level cod removal requires consuming more electricity than color removal 99 100 4 conclusions the conclusion can be drawn from obtained results of this study that the integrated treatment of electrocoagulation system with each aops such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton process is deemed and evaluated as a promising option in the textile sector for wastewater treatment this study was carried out to check the efficacy and feasibility of ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes all aops with ecs appeared to be capable of complete and successful decolorization and removal of tds tss and cod from textile dye bath effluents compared to ecs alone in the case of ecs alone almost 40 decolorization and 57 5 removal of cod were achieved that would be effective removal of large sized flocs and suspended particles in textile dye bath effluents among all treatment processes ecs photo fenton appeared to be the most feasible option as compared to ecs fenton process energy requirements for fenton process were negligible but its effectiveness for removal of tds tss and all other parameters was significantly very low however ecs ozonation proved to be a more promising and successful option in 100 decolorization and 99 7 cod removal moreover all other physiochemical parameters reduced and met the neqs which would be the best opportunity regarding cost effectiveness and performance of treatment of textile dye bath effluents overall it can be stated that ozonation and photo fenton processes followed by electrocoagulation depicted as a great performance to treat completely maintain all water quality parameters and reduce operational cost comparison of electrical energy requirements of all treatment technologies suggested that the fenton oxidation process was the most economical and viable option for partially removing physicochemical parameters including tds color cod and tss however ozonation and photo fenton showed the best results in terms of efficiency and efficacy of textile wastewater treatment the electrical energy consumed more by photo fenton showed quite significant results this process will obtain maximum pollutant load removal and the treated wastewater can involve in reuse it is highly recommended to install an integrated physical system i e electrocoagulation with advanced oxidation processes including o3 fenton and photo fenton that will ensure wastewater recovery and reuse of wastewater process modification for the conservation of water thus achieving sustainability in terms of clean and

13090,this study aims to investigate treatment efficiency and evaluate the energy efficacy of integrated electrocoagulation system combined with ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes for successful textile dye bath effluents treatment in this regard the characterization of physicochemical parameters such as ph turbidity salinity total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss electrical conductivity ec and chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed to estimate removal efficiency of each treatment process moreover the electrical energy consumption of all aforementioned processes was measured individually to work out cost effectiveness fenton process appeared to be ineffective for reducing cod and other parameters while the overall performance of ecs alone showed far better results cod and color removal efficiencies were 57 4 and 40 respectively however the application of ecs o3 resulted in complete decolorization and almost 99 7 cod removal under optimized operating conditions including ozone flow 300 mg h ph 7 1 temperature 25 c ecs photo fenton process resulted in cod and color removal of 95 6 and 97 respectively electrical energy per order of ecs was found 1 58 kwh m3 for minimum removal of dyes and cod ecs ozonation is responsible for 100 decolorization but at a very high cost ecs photo fenton process proved to be the second best option in terms of treatment and energy consumption hence an integrated treatment system of ecs with aops appeared to be the most feasible and eco friendly that could lead to the treated wastewater for reuse and

environmental issues such as water pollution and climate change signify a major urgency for civil societies industries and government institutional frameworks 1 2 in order to conserve water resources many developed nations are rapidly taking immediate action by implementing policies and legislation 3 4 a textile production unit produces 8000 kg products per day consumes around 1 6 million liters of water 5 6 about 25 of this entire water consumption is utilized in printing and dyeing processes usepa estimates that about 40 l water is required for dyeing 1 kg of cloth and the requirement still varies with process type and textile material textile effluent consists of solvents dichloromethane l chlorinated hydrocarbons 1 1 1 trichloroethane surfactants sulphonates alkyl ether phosphates carboxylates salts kcl nacl and dyes these compounds persist in the environments and pose toxicity to the biotic and abiotic components 7 8 therefore behra et al 8 estimated through detailed literature by demonstrating advanced techniques to abate and degrade the pollutants from textile dye bath effluents through novel and promising technologies additionally atalay and ers√∂z 9 investigated some of the most advanced oxidation processes with biological treatment to remove dyes through hybrid applications the profit making behaviors and reluctance of industrialists have caused the release of toxic effluent directly into the environment with the consequences of pollution damage to agricultural lands and aquatic toxicity 10 12 wastewater treatment plants in developing countries are either non functional or utilize conventional wastewater treatment techniques 13 14 the conventional wastewater treatment processes are energy intensive costly require more space manpower and material for installation and are time consuming 8 15 16 the conventional treatment technologies involve a combination of ph neutralization dissolved air flotation 17 biological treatment 18 19 reverse osmosis 20 22 and process automation producing treated water and meets the environmental quality standards 23 24 among all traditional treatment technologies the ecs process is the most effective for removing high molecular weight particles and suspended substances from industrial effluents and producing less volume of sludge 25 it is based on major operational parameters such as time required for separation chemical additive dose pressure size and diameter of gaseous bubbles and time for saturation 26 this results in almost 98 removal of cod from textile dye bath effluents 17 27 the advantages of integrated ozonation and electrocoagulation process for cod removal are reported by many studies 25 28 29 aops have been recognized as more successful and feasible in contaminant removal from textile dye bath effluents 30 33 aops are oxidation based treatment techniques to produce reactive oh radicals aops contain ozonation direct uv uv h2o2 uv h2o2 o3 fenton and photo fenton processes to treat textile wastewater 34 37 aops technologies are feasible easy to operate and have comparatively less sludge and residual products than activated sludge 38 40 however aops are considered the tertiary treatment having high operating costs 40 but the sludge treatment facility is installed after an activated sludge treatment plant then the cost is relatively higher than aops cost chemical methods require more chemicals for textile wastewater treatment there is no add on the chemicals in aops treatment of textile wastewater moreover toxic dyes and chemicals are only separated out by conventional treatment which attributes to sludge production to salts and chemicals without treatment only an organic portion of pollutants absorbs and generates more sludge in aerobic treatment advanced oxidation processes break down complex pollutant molecules into simpler non toxic ones 41 43 almost 90 of the textile industries have a space conflict in pakistan conventional treatment methods require 100 times more footprint compared to advanced oxidation processes the aerobic and anaerobic treatment processes are continuous treatment technologies which take 24 h for dye bath effluents treatment if these processes shut down because of some technical issue or poor maintenance then these processes will initiate from their starting point meanwhile aops are switch on processes and do not require long time intervals to complete the space and location facility are not feasible to install conventional etp sludge production in secondary methods results in again the production of chemicals just as 80 cost for the treatment and discharge thus these are the scientific gaps which highly demand this integrated electrocoagulation process with advanced oxidation processes for the successful textile dye bath effluents treatment integrated technologies are recently being employed to overcome the process limitations cost inefficiency and resource in conventional water treatment technologies 34 44 in this study wastewater from the textile dyeing industry has been treated through a combination of conventional and oxidation treatment systems each oxidative treatment such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes were applied after ecs to study for appropriate dye removal and treatment efficiency in addition various aops and other processes were investigated to study their effectiveness moreover considering the complex nature of real textile wastewater it is essential to apply combined ecs with aops to achieve effective degradation of pollutants in real textile dye bath effluents therefore this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of integrated ecs coupled with each o3 fenton and photo fenton process to study the effect on the treatment efficiency using real textile wastewater in this study textile dye bath effluents are successfully treated with physical i e ecs and aops treatment by measuring physicochemical parameters to meet the neqs additionally this study sheds light on the evaluation of energy requirements and cost of each treatment process for optimizing overall treatment s cost effectiveness this study will also pave the way to utilize the aops a as feasible alternative for successfully treating textile dye bath effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater samples collection the samples of textile dye bath effluents were collected from a local textile and dyeing industry located in lahore pakistan a medium scale physical treatment plant was installed to treat dye bath effluents and etp components were electrocoagulation dissolved air flotation lamella clarifier and reverse osmosis particularly 5 l triplicate wastewater samples were taken from the ecs unit in etp this effluent was primarily treated with an electrocoagulation unit of etp these samples were then collected in the pre washed containers and transferred into a laboratory for treatment with aops in order to prevent reactions and contamination the triplicate samples were kept at 4 c without adding preservatives 2 2 experimental design experiments were conducted to treat the textile dye bath effluents through integrated ecs coupled with aops such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes 2 2 1 electrocoagulation system ecs the electrocoagulation treatment unit is deliberately used as a physiochemical process to remove suspended particles from textile dye bath effluents this unit consisted of a feeding tank reaction chamber with vertically arranged electrodes development tank where reactions were completed in the reaction chamber and sludge removal unit it involved a redox reaction where destabilization of pollutants occurs due to electric current dc voltage to the electrolyte solution ec unit contained two electrodes fe and al combined with a power supply in the ec process anodic dissolution was generated coagulants with oh and h2 gas at the cathode cationic polymer pac liquid anionic polyelectrolyte type i and poly alcl2 were dosed to agglomerate the particles to synthesize the flocs by gradual moving the flocculator process prior to inserted in the ecs unit then these flocs were removed from downstream for an efficient settling system that was performed under gravity 25 45 46 the capacity of the ecs unit was 120 m3 h for the retention time of 60 min the ecs had a voltage of about 380 400 v and power 70 80 kw to run this set up sludge was separated in tank 1 and the remnant scraped sludge was discarded in tank ii hereafter the treated wastewater was then extracted from the bottom of tank i triplicate samples from the ecs unit were collected and preserved at 4 c in plastic bottles for further analysis the physicochemical water quality parameters were measured in order to check the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation process 2 2 2 advance oxidation processes aops the electrocoagulation process was coupled with the following aops for the treatment of textile wastewater 2 2 2 1 ozonation the treatment with ozone was carried out in a bubble column plexi glass reactor with a diameter of 2 5 cm to treat textile dye bath effluents the flow rate of the ozone generator model oz 10g dimensions 350 mm 250 mm 600 mm was 300 mg o3 h at room temperature 25 c and ozone dose was optimized at about 50 mg 47 48 for calibration purposes ozone was formed bubbles in deionized water to control the ozone dose for 10 min before initiation of the experiment filtered and non filtered wastewater samples were used for the treatment and removal of color and cod in this regard 1 l triplicate samples from the electrocoagulation unit were collected and measured the physicochemical parameters such as ph cod mg l color tds mg l tss mg l ec ms cm salinity ppt and turbidity ntu the treated water with o3 was sampled after 15 30 and 60 min hereafter the aforementioned wastewater quality parameters were measured to determine cod removal decolorization and treatment efficacy of studied processes these samples were then stored in plastic bottles at 4 c for further analysis 2 2 2 2 fenton process fenton process set up was conducted in 1 l graduated pyrex glass column and the magnetic stirrer was used for efficient stirring at 100 rpm for 30 min followed by 60 min settling time the doses of h2o2 35 of analytical grade merck germany and feso4 7h2o 99 w w merck germany were optimized at about 170 mg l 510 Œºl and 50 mg l respectively the optimal doses were gradually added in triplicate textile wastewater samples from the ecs unit treatment efficiency was measured by estimating physicochemical parameters including ph turbidity salinity tds tss and electrical conductivity then these samples were preserved at 4 c in plastic bottles 2 2 2 3 photo fenton process the photo fenton oxidation process was conducted in a cylindrical photo reactor with a volume of 5 l uv reactor height 25 5 cm length 17 cm width 13 5 cm was wrapped with al foil to increase the absorbance of uv irradiance in the uv reactor the irradiance of the low pressure mercury uv lamp penray 3sc9 upland usa was 5 mw cm2 with a wavelength of 254 nm fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of uv reactor used in the photo fenton oxidation process in the photo fenton process uv irradiance 72 w power was varied from 15 and 30 min in 1 l wastewater sample at the optimized doses of 170 mg l h2o2 and 50 mg l feso4 7h2o to check treatment efficiency and efficacy of textile dye bath effluents then samples were withdrawn after regular time intervals from uv for the determination of physicochemical parameters 2 3 analytical techniques the physicochemical water quality parameters were evaluated to analyze wastewater samples the textile dye bath effluents were characterized based on the quality of samples concentration and type of textile wastewater sample these parameters were estimated to access the pollution load which is essential to optimize operation and design in ecs and aops the physicochemical parameters such as ph temperature electrical conductivity total dissolved solids salinity turbidity and cod were determined following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 49 additionally the removal efficiency was also evaluated by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 8230 tokyo japan moreover cod was measured by tintometer lovibond gmbh44287 2 4 calculation of energy requirements and cost the operational costs are directly influenced by the treatment performance of the ecs and aops the efficiencies of reactions can be facilitated in comparison through powerful scale parameters referred to ee o the electrical energy per order kwh m3 refers to the electrical energy required to eliminate contaminants in 1 m3 of effluent by one order magnitude it describes direct association to electrical efficiency of aops which is independent of nature of the treatment process therefore it allows to compare these efficacies of aops technologies and offers requisite information for economic and scale up analyses to compare with the conventional treatments the values of ee o have been evaluated by using the following empirical formula in eq 1 50 52 1 ee o kwh m 3 p t 1000 v 60 log c o c t where p power of generator or uv reactor or magnetic stirrer kw t reaction time min v textile effluent volume litre co initial concentration of pollutant in cod mg l ct final concentration of contaminant mg l 3 results and discussion the key findings are given below which succinctly represent the exponential increase in physicochemical water quality parameters in textile dye bath effluents in order to maintain quality and optimize the treatment processes the textile effluent from the dyeing industry was treated enough to meet the water quality parameters integrated ecs treatment with aops was compared to check the treatment efficiency and efficacy of textile dye bath effluents 3 1 characterization of raw water and ecs textile dyeing wastewater the physicochemical characteristics of the textile dye bath effluents inlet and ecs wastewater are represented in table 1 the obtained results showed that electrocoagulation treatment reduced the water quality parameters from inlet raw water it can be depicted from table 1 that the cod of raw water was 680 0 6 mg l which was extremely high from neqs value for cod 150 mg l higher cod concentration in wastewater is a favorable condition for electrocoagulation treatment of textile dye bath effluents at the same time other parameters such as ph turbidity tds tss and ec of raw water were significantly higher than the permissible limits of neqs a similar finding has been proposed by kothai et al 46 and chanikya et al 53 where the ph ranged from 8 2 to 12 5 the other parameters were also high from the neqs moreover other studies also proposed similar results that textile wastewater s ph cod salinity turbidity tss and tds were not met the discharge limits 25 54 higher the parameters of textile dyeing wastewater cause toxicity to the environment therefore it is significant to treat textile dye bath effluents prior to discharge into the environment 3 2 direct raw water treatment with aops the experimental results demonstrated water quality parameters for removing and degrading various dyes and chemicals in the effluent raw water as represented in table 2 the o3 process reduced the cod of the inlet from 680 0 6 mg l to 160 0 02 mg l which succinctly depicted maximum removal of almost 77 similarly this resulted in the removal of 74 8 tds and 65 6 turbidity additionally results indicate 50 removal of salinity 67 electrical conductivity and 25 3 of tss removal from the ozonation process at 60 min retention time however the fenton process showed comparatively less effectiveness for removing turbidity cod tds tss ec salinity and ph change almost 34 removal of cod was achieved after 15 min and 55 9 after 30 min residence time while the photo fenton treatment showed quite better results in decolorization and removal efficiencies of textile raw water compared to the fenton treatment process cod tds tss turbidity salinity and ec removal were achieved up to 69 2 73 4 23 69 6 50 and 51 respectively within 30 min of the uv irradiance almost 33 9 of cod was eliminated after 15 min reaction time as shown in table 3 these treated parameters from aops have not met the neqs table 1 raw water of textile dye bath effluents showed a gradual decline in decolorization and removal of physical parameters compared to aops including o3 fenton and photo fenton therefore it was assumed that some factors affecting on the rate of removal efficiency of water parameters 3 3 electrocoagulation treatment with aops the electrocoagulation process is physical treatment technology for mineralizing and decomposing suspended particles in textile dye bath effluents as a result of electrocoagulation large sized flocs were formed resulting in less sludge to entrap colloidal particles present in the effluent pollutants in wastewater are absorbed when hydroxide ions give the active site for attachment 55 56 the characterization of various physiochemical parameters for determining treatment efficiencies is represented in table 4 fig 2 a depicts the effect of ph on ecs alone ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton techniques the reaction ph is a significant parameter which affects the overall performance of ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton treatment methods as it maintains the generation rate of oh the present study optimized solution ph by reducing from alkaline ph which ultimately meets the permissible limits the ph of treated effluent from ecs alone was 9 73 0 01 which is alkaline in nature the alkaline ph is converted the iron and aluminium hydroxides into the hydroxy ferrate or hydroxy aluminate byproducts respectively these products have the potential for absorbing dye molecules and ec residues the textile raw water has more concentrated in terms of chemicals and dyes which is hard to eliminate with ecs alone however the maximum treatment efficiency of ecs was observed by adding coagulants with 15 min of retention time subsequently ph was lowered up to 7 1 while treated with ozonation and met neqs required values the ph values of ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton efficiently reached the permissible limits of water quality parameters the ph has an important influence on pollutant degradation via conversion of reactive species and the dissolution of ozone moreover the high ph will lead to the precipitation of ferrous ferric ions ozonation and photo fenton with electrocoagulation showed better results of ph the ph is directly affected through solubility and production of hydroxyl radical 57 58 the main reason for this trend is the rapid decomposition process at alkaline ph and the potential of hydroxyl radical is relatively higher consequently oxidation treatment with ozone degrades contaminants in textile wastewater oxidation accelerates the reaction of ozone at lower ph conversely the primary reaction is the oxidation process of hydroxyl radicals at alkaline ph which is effectively rapid compared to other reactions the other significant reason behind the ozonation process after ecs is that the reaction of ozone with degradation products through the oxidation process lowers the ph of wastewater 59 60 similarly the effect of variation in ph was reported by various studies that show similar trend 60 62 in the decomposition process ozone produces more oh radicals at alkaline ph and the rate of degradation of dyes and chemicals is increased in textile dye bath effluents it is demonstrated from fig 2 b that turbidity is another parameter which influences in performance of treatment efficiency ecs alone and ecs fenton processes obtained greater turbidity values of about 21 0 05 ntu and 15 0 089 ntu respectively however both of treatment processes were involved in less contribution in turbidity reduction conversely ecs o3 depicted more optimized results of treated effluent to reach the neqs value of turbidity moreover the primary contributing treatment process was ecs photo fenton for 100 removal of turbidity tds and turbidity are used to effectively remove all suspended and dissolved particles in textile dye bath effluent for reuse and discharge purposes 52 63 several researchers 25 64 65 reported a similar trend under optimal conditions the dissolved metallic ions as coagulants in the ecs reactor were not sufficient to completely remove the pollutants ecs o3 contributes to better mixing and mass transfer increases oxidation of pollutants and reduces sludge content thus providing higher pollutant removal efficiency barrera et al 66 has demonstrated coupling of ec o3 provides greater benefits than the single treatment system because of the catalytic coagulants and hydroxyl radicals which effectively remove the organic pollutants the efficiency of ecs o3 coupling having synergetic effects is attributed to the efficiency of hydroxyl radicals and coagulants which many studies have proved ozonation has enabled the elimination of pollutants in textile dye bath effluents through the attraction of hydroxyl radical oh due to the decomposition of o3 58 67 68 the obtained test results of salinity from ecs alone ecs o3 ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes of textile dye bath effluents are as follows in fig 2 c the simple ecs and ecs fenton processes showed comparatively less effectiveness in eliminating salinity from the obtained test results the optimal dosage was 20 mg l 170 mg l of fe 2 h2o2 meanwhile it is succinctly found from results that treatment with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton attributed maximum salinity removal and met the standard limits of discharge effluents to achieve sustainability additionally kothai et al 46 and chanikya et al 53 have reported similar results by using integrated fenton and ecs processes for maximum removal and mineralization of dyes from textile effluents the same trend has been studied by various research studies 69 72 under optimized conditions it is observed from results that successful desalination was done with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton treatment technologies which would be a feasible opportunity to treat textile dye bath effluents fig 2 d illustrates the effect of total dissolved solids on various treatment technologies and compares them with neqs in the present study all treatment processes including electrocoagulation ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton showed satisfactory results which met the permissible standards for instance tds was removed from 3570 mg l to 2090 mg l by using ecs process similarly ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton were responsible for the complete removal of tds from textile dyeing wastewater which contributed to remove almost all the settleable substances and total dissolved solids the minimum tds value should be present because of organics available in textile wastewater which may produce excess fouling layer upon membrane surface 62 and also enhance pressure in the inlet and reduce inorganic concentrate in wastewater 73 75 hence this produces a feasible and promising option for the treatment of dye bath effluents fig 2 e represents the influence of total suspended solids on different treatment processes and compares them with neqs electrocoagulation showed a comparatively higher value of tss than the other treatment techniques the results inferred from fig 2 e shows that ecs ozonation resulted in 100 tss removal with an optimal dose of ozone the ecs photo fenton process was given significantly better results in the degradation and elimination of suspended particles from textile dye bath effluents meanwhile 170 mg l dose of h2o2 and 20 mg l doses of feso4 in ecs fenton process reduced tss from 330 mg l to 150 mg l which is up to the mark according to neqs a gradual increase in removal efficiency was noticed in the ecs fenton treatment process because the optimal concentration of h2o2 enhances the overall treatment of textile wastewater 76 77 as shown in fig 2 f ecs followed by ecs ozonation showed remarkable results regarding electrical conductivity the minimum amount of ozone dose was probably required that was highly productive for the degradation and removal of dyes and chemicals from textile dye bath effluents it is demonstrated that ec value was varied from the standard limit after treatment with electrocoagulation it was inferred that ecs alone depicted maximum ec during the stirring process due to the agglomeration of suspended particles dyes and various concentrations of chemicals in this regard nacl pump speed was remained low for maximum effectiveness and to get desired results similarly the fenton process after ecs also represented a less significant ec value that was not up to the mark according to standard discharge limits the excessive number of ions present in textile wastewater which ultimately increase conductivity and deteriorate water quality the results described that there was a slight reduction in conductivity from 3 27 ms cm to 1 28 ms cm this declining trend is that no of pollutants dissolved solids and dyes were removed and the ability to conduct electricity is also eliminated it may be attributed to the trend that the ecs fenton process was not much reactive for removing electrical conductivity satisfactory results were obtained by ecs photo fenton processes the maximum efficiency was achieved with ozonation from 3 27 0 01 ms cm to 0 109 0 007 ms cm after 60 min exposure this resulted in removing suspended particles to become apparent water for discharge and reuse purposes it is inferred from various researches that ec is an obvious parameter that imparts relatively high degradation of dyes and chemicals from textile dye bath effluents 40 46 78 fig 2 g illustrates the effect of cod on various treatment processes of textile dye bath effluents the treatment efforts concerned physical treatment such as ecs unit that was more feasible for more than 50 removal of cod load while remaining pollution load was minimized with ecs ozonation and ecs photo fenton treatment processes furthermore it can be comprehended that cod values varied from 290 mg l to 161 mg l by the treatment with the fenton process which could not be considered a feasible option according to a study conducted by abdullah et al 40 similar results were reported about 45 and 89 cod removal by ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes respectively in addition photo fenton process resulted in reduction cod from 290 mg l to 13 mg l moreover the obtained results succinctly demonstrated that there was 100 removal of cod after treatment with ozone within 60 min retention time increased removal of cod after ozonation of 60 min can best be elaborated by the fact that ozone is dissociated into the hydroperoxide anions and 79 80 ozonation is relatively more promising for decolorizing dyes especially azo dyes 81 hydroxyl radical is especially significant for cod removal and decolorization due to a high oxidation potential of about 2 7 v in acidic ph 82 83 3 4 removal efficiencies of ecs alone ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton treatment processes the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes were estimated for physicochemical parameters fig 3 represents the removal efficacy of the electrocoagulation process this process resulted in 57 35 cod and 41 46 of tds removal after treatment of textile dye bath effluent with ecs unit the ecs process changed the ph by 21 keeping it in the neutral range of 7 1 the advantages of integrated ozonation and electrocoagulation process for cod removal is reported by many studies 25 26 28 mehralian et al 84 reported that synergistic removal efficiency had been observed due to the oxidation s influence due to oh radicals and fe oh n coagulation increasing the dose of coagulants reduces cod turbidity and color but the efficiency is less than the ozone treatment the electrocoagulation process was comparatively less electrical conductivity total suspended solids salinity and turbidity the reason behind this less efficacy of ecs process was the formation of large sized flocs and high contamination with chemicals and dyes 62 84 the electrocoagulation treatment is feasible by adding polymers as primary coagulants 85 the agglomeration and settling process of colloidal particles increases with an increased dosage of coagulants non ionic polyacrylamide was also used to facilitate in electrocoagulation process 86 although coagulants were added during treatment textile dyeing wastewater contained a higher concentration of contaminants in textile dye bath effluents 87 hence ecs proved to be an effective treatment for removing large floc particles in textile dye bath effluents integrated ecs ozonation has been considered a highly promising and feasible option for complete decolorization and successful removal of cod tds tss and turbidity fig 4 represents the removal efficiencies increase gradually versus retention time till 60 min however after 15 min exposure time various parameters including ec cod and tds showed high reduction efficacy compared to other parameters additionally as retention time increased the removal efficiencies of physicochemical parameters were also increased after 30 min this depicted optimal results due to decomposition and formation of hydroxyl radical ozonation treatment followed by the electrocoagulation process provided turbidity salinity tds tss ec and cod removal efficiency by 99 29 93 100 100 90 and 100 respectively with maximum exposure with ozone these can be attributed to maximum production of hydroxyl radicals the complete decolorization was done by ozonation at a residence time of 60 min because of direct reactivity with textile dye bath effluents 52 68 ozonation followed by ecs showed the best results because of the synergistic effect of electrocoagulation oxidation through o3 enhanced turbulence while injecting ozone and decomposition through oh radicals the al 3 and fe 2 ions performed a catalytic action for ozone activation which further resulted in better decomposition of ozone roa morales et al 89 showed similar findings for ozonation with 100 color and cod removal efficiency consistent with the color removal efficiency observed in this study moreover a similar trend was demonstrated by various studies that ozone treatment was effective for the decolorization of azo dyes 44 65 88 the primary cause for this trend is decomposition reaction and contaminants are degraded through ozone oxidation ozonation treatment is responsible for organics and dyes removal from textile dye bath effluents this process is considered the best option for further consideration in the near future compared to other aops thus ecs ozonation process proved to be the most potent alternative for successfully removing water quality parameters and meeting the permissible limits of neqs ecs fenton oxidation treatment process is another great option for the degradation of contaminants of textile dye bath effluents ferrous ion involved scavenging effect and great concentration of ferrous ion caused slow degradation it produces only 10 sludge compared to activated sludge it hinders the fenton oxidation process for the effective treatment of wastewater therefore the optimal dose of h2o2 was added to enhance this degradation action fig 5 indicates the removal efficiencies of different parameters treated with ecs fenton oxidation process the optimal dose of 170 mg l h2o2 and 20 mg l feso4 7h2o resulted in 48 cod 64 3 salinity 57 8 ec and 55 tss removal respectively moreover the color of wastewater was removed by almost 37 after 30 min of settling time since in this case fe ions are hydrolyzed and form a disperse phase of iron hydroxide which works as a coagulant the reason behind the inefficiency of the fenton process is that this has not actively been participated as a catalyst at alkaline ph it causes coagulation and produces sludge indicating less satisfactory wastewater treatment results significantly fenton process is based on solution ph and shows effective results at acidic ph ramirez pereda et al 64 and kuleyin et al 77 reported similar results that succinctly depicted the comparatively low effectiveness of the fenton process followed by electrocoagulation various researchers depict the same trend to determine the efficacy and removal efficiencies 90 92 this showed 58 toc 49 cod and 67 color removal which would be ineffective for treatment dosages are inversely proportional to removal efficiencies of color whereas these have a direct relation with cod reduction in the present study the fenton process showed ineffective results than other treatment techniques such as ozonation photo fenton electrocoagulation processes 92 98 the removal efficiency is increased by enhancing the optimal doses of h2o2 and feso4 and then it will show satisfactory results for treating textile wastewater the ecs photo fenton process is considered a remarkable option for the treatment and degradation of dyes in textile dye bath effluents the removal efficiency of ecs photo fenton technology is significantly higher compared to ecs fenton process during photo fenton after ecs process uv irradiance is used in terms of h2o2 photolysis and ferric ion photo reduction into ferrous ion fig 6 depicts removal efficiencies of ecs photo fenton for various physicochemical parameters after 15 30 min exposure time the successful removal of tds and turbidity were done through treatment with the ecs photo fenton process at 15 min of exposure time a gradually increasing trend appeared after treatment with photo fenton followed by the electrocoagulation process moreover more than 90 cod salinity and electrical conductivity were removed after a retention time of 30 min therefore the removal efficiencies of each parameter were gradually increased with varied time intervals of 15 and 30 min of exposure uv irradiance the oh is a highly reactive oxidant to initiate the degradation of contaminants in textile dye bath effluents that led to the complete mineralization of organic contaminants 93 94 the other major reason could be the production of radical in a series of reactions involved instantaneous formation peroxyl radical which also commenced chain reaction leading towards subsequent oxidation process 78 95 hence the ecs photo fenton process proved to second best option after ozonation for successful treatment of textile dye bath effluents 3 5 comparison of electrical energy requirements in energy intensive treatment processes ecs ozonation fenton and photo fenton the design variables including exposure to uv irradiance the energy required by treatment processes and the order of magnitude regarding pollutant concentration removal are combined in a single function known as electrical energy per order of contaminant removal in kwh m3 ee o measures process treatment rates achieved in optimal volume of polluted effluents as a function of applied fixed energy and acts as a scale up parameter for energy use efficiency 52 96 97 table 4 compares electrical energy requirements by various treatment processes such as electrocoagulation ozonation fenton and photo fenton significantly ecs as medium scale unit consumed 70 80 kw of total power for 30 m3 of wastewater and ee o was found 1 58 kwh m3 for minimum removal of dyes and cod the ozone process resulted in successful decolorization and almost 99 7 cod removal that proved itself as the best viable option in terms of decolorization of textile dye bath effluents meanwhile photo fenton oxidation process required comparatively more ee o than the ozonation and fenton processes however it seemed to depict satisfactory color and cod removal results the photo fenton process showed the second feasible option for energy consumption 98 it is succinctly apparent that the fenton treatment process consumed less electrical energy to remove cod and color but removal efficiency was not up to the optimal level cod removal requires consuming more electricity than color removal 99 100 4 conclusions the conclusion can be drawn from obtained results of this study that the integrated treatment of electrocoagulation system with each aops such as ozonation fenton and photo fenton process is deemed and evaluated as a promising option in the textile sector for wastewater treatment this study was carried out to check the efficacy and feasibility of ecs ozonation ecs fenton and ecs photo fenton processes all aops with ecs appeared to be capable of complete and successful decolorization and removal of tds tss and cod from textile dye bath effluents compared to ecs alone in the case of ecs alone almost 40 decolorization and 57 5 removal of cod were achieved that would be effective removal of large sized flocs and suspended particles in textile dye bath effluents among all treatment processes ecs photo fenton appeared to be the most feasible option as compared to ecs fenton process energy requirements for fenton process were negligible but its effectiveness for removal of tds tss and all other parameters was significantly very low however ecs ozonation proved to be a more promising and successful option in 100 decolorization and 99 7 cod removal moreover all other physiochemical parameters reduced and met the neqs which would be the best opportunity regarding cost effectiveness and performance of treatment of textile dye bath effluents overall it can be stated that ozonation and photo fenton processes followed by electrocoagulation depicted as a great performance to treat completely maintain all water quality parameters and reduce operational cost comparison of electrical energy requirements of all treatment technologies suggested that the fenton oxidation process was the most economical and viable option for partially removing physicochemical parameters including tds color cod and tss however ozonation and photo fenton showed the best results in terms of efficiency and efficacy of textile wastewater treatment the electrical energy consumed more by photo fenton showed quite significant results this process will obtain maximum pollutant load removal and the treated wastewater can involve in reuse it is highly recommended to install an integrated physical system i e electrocoagulation with advanced oxidation processes including o3 fenton and photo fenton that will ensure wastewater recovery and reuse of wastewater process modification for the conservation of water thus achieving sustainability in terms of clean and

13091,polyaniline pani and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt were used for synthesis of pani mwcnt nanocomposites ncs via ultrasonic method the characterization of the pani mwcnt ncs were performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscope the application and photostability of pani mwcnt ncs as recyclable photocatalysts for organic dyes removal including methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo were investigated in presence of ultraviolet uv light obtained results indicated

performance of pani mwcnt ncs were carried out to better understand the effectiveness of uv light irradiation on the dye removal it was found that the synthesized ncs performed better under uv light irradiation in removing the organic dyes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polyaniline dye removal photodegradation adsorption mwcnt 1 introduction it is a major environmental challenge to stop the spread of hazardous pollutants such as synthetic colored dye originating from numerous industries such as textile printing plastic leather which can directly harm natural resources and can lead to several health concerns including cancer and metabolic changes in the human body 1 3 thus it is crucial to apply a cost effective approach to eliminate the industrial pollutants from generated wastewater before being released into the aquatic environment 4 so far several studies have been conducted to address the organic dye elimination from industrial wastewater through chemical physical and biological routes such as bio degradation filtration oxidation flocculation ozonation adsorption and photodegradation 5 7 among these methods photodegradation based semiconductor materials captivated significant attention in recent years based on their low cost process immense activity and no secondary damage to the environment 8 10 the main concept of photodegradation is to apply the photocatalysis process to produce electron hole pairs hydroxyl or superoxide radicals as active agents to decompose the colloidal pollutants available in the wastewater 11 12 although several photocatalyst materials have been introduced the efficiency of photodegradation is a critical factor therefore several methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency by producing more active sites reducing particle size increasing the structure porosity and preventing the fast recombination of electron hole pairs by using dopants or nanocomposites 13 14 the application of conductive polymers cps in recent years such as polyaniline pani polypyrrole ppy polyacetylene pa and polyfuran pf with inorganic materials or carbon nanotube cnt to improve photocatalysis efficiency has captivated the attention of researchers 15 16 among different cps pani was identified as a promising material for the enhancement of photodegradation efficiency due to its simple production low cost water insolubility environmentally friendly high hole mobility slow electron hole recombination and high stability 16 19 previous studies 20 21 have reported that the pani tio2 nanocomposite nc synthesized through chemical oxidative polymerization showed notably higher photodegradation efficiency than standalone pani and tio2 in another study wei et al 22 showed that the pani tio2 nc with bionic nanopapilla structure had significant photocatalytic activity for acetone dye under ultraviolet uv light irradiation haspulat et al 23 investigated the photocatalytic performance of fe doped pani and they indicated that the surface properties of pani such as roughness could be adjusted with the addition of fe2 ions during polymerization similarly the pani fe composites displayed superior photodegradation compared to pani alone other researchers reported the great photocatalytic performance of pani b2o3 pani bivo4 pani binbo4 and pani cdo ncs against pani alone in removing organic carbon in presence of uv and natural light 24 26 in addition the combination of cnt with pani has also been introduced for the photodegradation of organic dyes due to its remarkable transport and electronic properties 27 according to its unique properties pani ncs with inorganic materials or carbon materials were prepared via different methods such as template based and template free synthesis routes the template free synthesis route is more cost effective which includes self assembly and electrospinning methods 28 29 in this route the shape and size of cps can be modified by varying dopants oxidant and monomer type and concentration dopant and oxidant to monomer molar ratio and reaction temperature and time 30 among the self assembly methods the sonochemical approach has several benefits including good and crystallinity eco friendly heating free and controllable parameters therefore it is considered as one of the most important methods for the fabrication of cps 31 in order to optimize the process parameters to obtain the highest efficiency of cps photodegradation the design of experiments doe could be applied in order to minimize the experimental expenses and time different doe methods were used for optimization of chemical processes 32 among them the response surface methodology rsm technique found to be an effective tool for analysis the change in the process response by varying the experimental variables at the same time and performing a limited number of experiments in which quadratic models can be derived 33 34 the current work investigated the photodegradation of organic dyes using synthesized pani mwcnt ncs by the sonochemical process in presence of uv light pani is a common conductive polymer used for adsorption process until today few studies discussed the application of pani for photodegradation process it is noteworthy that the application of carbon nanotubes cnts in several industrial fields has been increased due to its unique properties including unique structural metallic and electronic characteristics and large length to diameter ratio 35 in particular more recently the application of multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and polymer mwcnts ncs has been introduced for the heavy metal ions removal from aqueous medium 36 the statistical analysis method was applied to study the effects of change in the process parameters on the characterization and photodegradation efficiency of pani mwcnt ncs additionally the adsorption capacity of the synthesized ncs was investigated to clarify the effects of uv light irradiation on dye removal efficiency the removal of mb rhb and mo dye was investigated using the kinetics analysis and recyclability of the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs as far as the authors concern such a systematic investigation for pani mwcnt ncs has not been done before 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of pani mwcnt nanocomposites the pani was synthesized by ultrasonic assisted inverse solution polymerization of aniline that is discussed in section s1 of supplementary materials 37 38 the pani mwcnt ncs was synthesized through similar method as described in section s1 in supplementary materials aniline and ammonium persulfate aps were dissolved in hcl 1 m separately next specific amount of mwcnt was added to the aniline solution and stirring continued for an hour then aps solution was added drop by drop to the aniline mwcnt solution and stirring continued for half an hour the solution was then put in an ultrasonic device under certain power for a defined time later the solution was kept overnight filtered and the solid residue was washed again with methanol and deionized water finally the powder was dried in an oven at 70 c for 12 h all the chemicals used in this work were commercially available and employed without further purification table 1 summarizes the chemical components used in this study the schematic of the pani mwcnt synthesis method is shown in fig 1 the optical band gap energy eg of the obtained powder was calculated from sample reflectance using perkin elmer lambda 35 uv spectrophotometer within wavelength Œª of 190 to 1100 nm the phase evolution was studied by xrd x ray diffraction bruker d8 germany method with cu kŒ± radiation Œª 1 54 √• besides that the ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra perkinelmer waltham ma were performed using kbr pellets within the range of 400 4000 cm 1 moreover the morphology of the synthesized ncs was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem leo supra 35vp germany the specific surface area and specific pore volume were measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the average pore size was determined using barret joyner halenda bjh method micromeritics asap 2020 usa finally the zeta potential of pure pani and samples with highest and lowest optical bandgap energy was measured by zeta potential analyzer zeta nano z uk 2 2 design of experiment the design of experiment doe analysis using the box bhenken model was employed with design expert v11 software state ease usa for statistical analysis the experimental parameters were ultrasonic time 15 to 50 min ultrasonic power 30 to 80 and mwcnt wt 3 to 7 wt the selected responses were the optical bandgap energy eg and the photodegradation efficiency of three organic dyes i e mb rhb and mo the plot from the modified kubelka munk k m method associated with the eg of pani mwcnt ncs with the lowest and highest eg and of the synthesized pani is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary material the photodegradation efficiency Œ∑ was calculated using eq 1 where c0 mg l 1 was the initial dye concentration and ci mg l 1 was the dye concentration at time t min 1 Œ∑ c i c 0 c 0 100 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the photodegradation behavior of pani mwcnt ncs was investigated by observing its efficiency in the removal of both cationic organic dyes i e mb rhb and anionic organic dyes i e mo the photocatalytic reactions conducted in presence of uv light 254 nm 360 w uv lamp philips using 200 ml of 5 ppm dye solutions and 0 05 g of the synthesized nanocomposite as the photocatalyst the mixture was placed inside a black box with uv light irradiation and was subjected to irradiation for 45 min under stirring conditions the photodegradation efficiency of each sample was measured by uv vis absorbance varian cary 50 the adsorption behavior of samples associated with the highest and lowest photodegradation efficiency was investigated for a better understanding of how uv light irradiation affects organic dye removal from the solution additionally in separate experiments the photodegradation and adsorption behavior of pure pani in presence of uv light and in dark environment respectively were evaluated for comparison with the results obtained from the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs 2 4 kinetic study of photodegradation and adsorption efficiency the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were employed to investigate the mb rhb and mo dyes photodegradation kinetic behavior using pani mwcnt ncs the pseudo first order and second order kinetic models can be described as eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 lnln c i c 0 k 1 t 3 1 c i k 2 t 1 c 0 therefore the rate constants for the photodegradation experiments could be achieved from the slope of ln ci c0 and 1 ci against time diagrams 39 similarly the adsorption mechanism was investigated by pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the adsorbate capacity of the nanoparticles qt mg g 1 can be obtained from eq 4 4 q t c 0 c i v m on the other hand the equilibrium absorbate capacity qe can be achieved from eq 5 5 q e c 0 c e v m where ce mg l 1 was dye concentration at the equilibrium state m g was the adsorbent mass and v l represented the dye solution volume 40 41 by inserting qt and qe in eqs 2 and 3 the linear shapes of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for adsorption could be given as eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here the rate constants k1 and k2 for the adsorption process were calculated from the plot of ln qe qt and t qt against time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 box bhenken design the details of doe analysis of the obtained results as listed in table 2 has explained in section s2 in the supplementary material the values of eg for all the synthesized ncs are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the maximum eg of 3 32 ev was for sample run 5 with an ultrasonic time of 32 5 min ultrasonic power of 30 and 3 wt mwcnt however the minimum eg of 2 74 ev was for sample run 13 with an ultrasonic time of 32 5 min ultrasonic power of 80 and 7 wt mwcnt the optical bandgap energy calculation of synthesized pani showed that its eg was 3 4 ev the anova analysis of the obtained eg values for each experimental condition according to table 2 resulted to derive a quadratic model to express eg as a function of process variables as eq 8 which can be used to predict the eg by changing the process variables within the studied range of the experimental parameters the detail of anova analysis of the obtained eg is explained in section s3 of the supplementary materials 8 e g 3 08 0 0187 a 0 0762 b 0 2050 c 0 0075 ab 0 0100 bc 0 0017 a 2 0 0133 b 2 0 0307 c 2 where a is the ultrasonic time b is the ultrasonic power and c is the mwcnt amount 42 3 2 water content of the sorbent the amount of swelling or absorption water by the synthesized pani and the samples run 5 and run 13 associated with the highest and lowest eg was measured according to eq 9 43 9 w w w w d w w 100 where w is the percentage of water adsorb by the powder ww is the weight of the wet powder and wd is the weight of the dry powder specific amount of each powder was dried in oven for 24 h then added to the conical flask with 50 ml distilled water and left for 24 h on the magnetic stirrer at the ambient temperature 22 c then the samples were filtered weighed again the amount of absorbed water by pure pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 was 48 42 and 39 respectively 3 3 phase analysis the structure of all the nanocomposites samples was investigated using the xrd and ftir techniques and the results of samples associated with the highest and lowest eg and pani are presented in fig 2 according to fig 2 a the main peaks of pani were detected at 2Œ∏ 15 30 20 40 and 25 72 associated with the 0 1 1 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 crystal planes respectively 44 the broad diffraction peaks were corresponded to the perpendicular and parallel periodicity of pani chains which indicated the poor crystallinity of cps as a result of the replication of benzenoid and quinoid rings 44 the results of xrd analysis for the mwcnt showed a significant broad diffraction peak around 2Œ∏ 25 0 0 2 with d spacing of 0 35 nm and full width half maximum fwhm of 3 06 another broad peak with low intensity was observed at 2Œ∏ 43 1 0 0 with d spacing of 0 20 nm and full width half maximum fwhm of 4 10 it is evident from fig 2 a that the xrd diffraction patterns of pani mwcnt ncs followed the same amorphous pattern as mwcnt compared to the mwcnt and synthesized pani the xrd diffraction pattern of ncs was broadened and a narrow peak around 2Œ∏ 25 was observed this feature could be a result of mwcnt presence in the pani matrix which led to a decrease in the intensity of main peaks and material was found to be more disordered the results demonstrated that the mwcnt presence in the pani matrix impeded crystallite growth in the material 45 the profile fitting data of the xrd spectrums in fig 2 a is summarizes in table 3 according to table 3 the profile fitting data for samples run 5 and run 13 indicated the broad diffraction peak at around 25 besides that low intensity crystalline peaks were observed in both of the samples which are summarized in table s3 in supplementary materials the profile fitting showed the amorphous structure of the nanocomposites with an almost 80 degree of amorphousness this means that changing the process parameters such as changing the ratio of pani mwcnt had no significant effect on the amorphous structure of the samples a previous study by jorge et al 46 showed that the doping of pani with zno could increase the crystallinity of the nanocomposite to 30 the ftir transmission spectra of pani mwcnt and pani mwcnt ncs run 5 and run 13 are shown in fig 2 b the ftir spectra of synthesized pani indicated multiple peaks within 1570 and 1140 cm 1 region which could be related to quinoid and benzenoid ring stretching of aniline moreover the peaks at 1571 and 1482 cm 1 could be associated with the cc and cn stretching emerging from quinoid stretching and benzene rings of aniline and the peak close to 1304 cm 1 related to the cn stretching of quinoid 47 49 the peak at 1145 cm 1 could be associated with the ch in plane bending motion of aromatic rings 47 finally peak at 817 cm 1 was assigned to ch the observed peaks confirmed the successful synthesis of pani 46 the ftir spectrum for mwcnt showed intense peaks at 500 cm 1 which could be corresponded to the ch stretching peak at 1146 cm 1 related to co stretching and a peak at 1311 cm 1 correspond to cc bond stretch 50 the two peaks observed at 2854 and 2918 cm 1 were also associated with the symmetric ch bond stretching in the carboxyl group formed on the sidewall of the mwcnt 51 it can be observed from fig 2 b that the ftir patterns of pani mwcnt ncs were similar to that of pani the obtained results indicated that the pani was relatively covered the mwcnt surface according to fig 2 b with different ratios of mwcnt in the samples the positions of peaks weren t changed and no specific chemical bonding was detected between the available chemical components in the system 3 4 morphology analysis the morphology of the pure mwcnt synthesized pani and all the pani mwcnt nanocomposite samples associated with table 2 is shown in fig 3 the morphology of synthesized pani illustrates agglomerated spherical nanoparticles with an average particle size of 219 53 nm the fesem analysis data for the synthesized nanocomposites illustrate that the mwcnt was dispersed on the surface of pani nanoparticles the morphological study found that the fine pani nanoparticles were spherical in shape at the ultrasonic power of 80 on the other hand at a lower ultrasonic power of 30 coarse spherical nanoparticles were observed another interesting point is that by increasing the ultrasonic power from 30 to 80 the mwcnts were distributed more homogeneously in the matrix it was observed that with increasing ultrasonic power and time the particle size of the obtained nanocomposites decreased from around 190 nm to 103 nm the particle sizes for sample run 13 which had the lowest eg was 102 89 nm and for sample run 5 which had the highest bandgap was 191 01 nm it is worth noting that the increase in ultrasonic power does not always have a positive effect on the reduction of particle size 3 5 bet analysis the specific surface and porosity of the pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 was studied to explore the effect of ultrasonic synthesis of mwcnt doped pani using bet method fig 4 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the mentioned samples it can be observed from fig 4 a to c that the hysteresis loop for pani and pani mwcnt ncs increased sharply at a p p0 of around 0 8 demonstrating mesoporosity according to the shape of hysteresis loop for the adsorption desorption isotherms curves the bet analysis indicated that the specific surface area for pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 were 8 96 20 62 and 25 34 m2 g 1 respectively the pore size distribution of the samples using bjh method is shown in fig 4 d the pore size of the samples ranging from around 5 to 90 nm table 4 summarizes the textural properties of the pani and pani mwcnt ncs according to the obtained results the ultrasonic synthesis of pani mwcnt ncs showed a better surface area compared to pure pani thus this can lead to increase in the photodegradation and adsorption of organic dyes due to the more active sites 3 6 photocatalytic activity the reduction in the mb rhb and mo concentrations was measured from the change in the absorbance spectra of mb at 665 nm rhb at 554 nm and mo at 465 nm respectively from 5 to 45 min as shown in fig s5 in the supplementary materials fig 5 illustrates the photodegradation efficiency of mb rhb and mo dyes in the presence of synthesized pani sample run 13 and sample run 5 which were related to the highest and lowest photodegradation efficiencies of solution dyes the photodegradation efficiency values for all the experiments are summarized in table 2 the photodegradation profiles c c0 vs time in fig 5 illustrate that the initial photodegradation was quick due to the high concentration of dye followed by a slower degradation stage as the concentration of dye decreased it is evident that there was a maximum photodegradation of 62 18 in mb 59 94 in rhb and 98 39 in mo after 45 min irradiation to the uv light for the run 13 sample in comparison the synthesized pani showed photodegradation of 20 13 in mb 20 67 in rhb and 79 80 in mo dyes hence the application of pani mwcnt ncs increased the dye removal efficiency for mb and rhb dyes to about three times more than pani alone and about 1 5 times more than pani alone for mo dye the obtained results indicated that the synthesized pani mwcnt in this study showed the highest photodegradation efficiency in contrast to energy consume time and amount of pollutants used with other research work as listed in table 5 it is worth noting that the reason for the pani mwcnt s better photocatalytic efficiency on mo compared to mb and rhb could be related to the zeta potential of pani as shown in fig 6 the zeta potential for pani was about 14 8 mv and it was increased by addition of mwcnt the presence of mwcnt could facilitate the pani as conducting polymer to transform to its conductive form which resulted in the positive charges of pani mwcnt ncs this can explain the better photodegradation performance of pani mwcnt ncs for mo as anionic dye which was improved by the positive values of zeta potential 53 on the other hand pani mwcnt ncs demonstrated lower efficiency for the cationic dyes the statistical analysis of the obtained photodegradation efficiencies is explained in section s4 in the supplementary materials 3 7 adsorption test in order to investigate the adsorption of dyes in dark environments for a better understanding of uv light irradiation effects on dye removal efficiency dark tests were conducted for the pani and sample run 13 which had the highest photodegradation results as shown in fig 7 it is evident from fig 7 that even without the presence of uv light irradiation pani had the ability to adsorb the mb rhb and mo dyes this is in accordance with a previous study by vidya et al 56 which reported that pani was a good adsorbent of organic dyes according to fig 7 a the adsorption efficiency values of synthesized pani and sample run 13 in a dark environment for the mb dye were about 15 and 25 respectively when compared with photodegradation in the presence of uv light irradiation the uv light irradiation increased the dye removal efficiency by about 45 compared to the adsorption for sample run 13 another interesting point was that pani showed almost the same photodegradation and adsorption efficiencies however with the rhb dye pani showed different behaviors based on the data from fig 7 b the photodegradation efficiency of pani was higher than its adsorption under the same experimental timespan similarly the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye for sample run 13 was higher by about 35 than its adsorption as has been mentioned in section 3 5 pani with a positive zeta potential has a high adsorption capacity for anionic dyes such as mo it can be observed from fig 7 c that in the absence of uv light irradiation pani and pani mwcnt ncs significantly removed the mo dye to up to about 70 and 95 after 45 min respectively therefore it can be said that the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs have higher photodegradation efficiencies than adsorption for the removal of cationic dyes such as mb and rhb dyes with regards to anionic dyes such as mo both the photodegradation and adsorption had high efficiencies the adsorption capacity of pani and pani mwcnt ncs sample run 13 over the experimental timespan was calculated using eq 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the qt of sample run 13 was about 6 mg g 1 after 45 min higher than that of pani 3 4 mg g 1 for mb dye regarding the rhb dyes the adsorption behavior was similar and the sample run 13 showed the final qt near to 3 mg g 1 compared to about 0 7 mg g 1 for pani on the other hand both sample run 13 and pani almost had close qt for the mo dye it should be noted that the qt of pani and pani mwcnt ncs were markedly higher for mo dye compared to mb and rhb dyes fig 8 furthermore the synthesized pani mwcnt nc sample run 13 demonstrated higher qt in mb and rhb dyes than single pani this difference in mo dye was almost negligible again this could be related to the remarkable capacity of pani in adsorbing anionic dyes compared to cationic dyes 53 3 8 kinetics study the rate limiting step of photodegradation and adsorption can be explained by analyzing the kinetics of dye removal as one of the main features of the system according to the pseudo first order kinetic model photodegradation or adsorption occurs at a very low concentration or when the system reaches equilibrium the main assumption of this model is that there was no significant chemical interaction between the dyes and photocatalyst however the pseudo second order kinetic model assumes that strong bonds can exist between the dyes and photocatalyst or adsorbent 57 table 6 summarizes the kinetic rate constants from pseudo first and second order kinetic models for the photodegradation and adsorption of mb rhb and mo dye solutions in the presence of synthesized pani the sample with the highest bandgap run 5 and the sample with the lowest bandgap run 13 respectively according to the curve fitting results of kinetic data for photodegradation the pseudo second order model showed higher r2 values this suggests that the photodegradation process follows second order kinetics the analysis of the photodegradation constants reveals that sample run 13 had a rate constant k2 of about 4 25 4 51 and 7 53 times higher than that of pani for mb rhb and mo dyes respectively the higher kinetic constants for the synthesized nanocomposites illustrate the advantage of pani mwcnt ncs over single pani for a more efficient photocatalysis process similar to photodegradation it can be observed from the model fitting of adsorption capacity with the experimental data that the pseudo second order kinetic model was well fitted to the experimental data due to the higher r2 values in table 6 for the pseudo second order compared to the pseudo first order kinetic model and the chemisorption could be the rate limiting step 58 3 9 effectiveness of the pani mwcnt nanocomposite the effectiveness of pani mwcnt nc of run 13 on the photodegradation efficiency of the organic dyes were investigated via changing the concentration of photocatalyst from 0 01 to 0 07 g at 5 ppm solution dyes and dye concentration from 1 to 15 ppm using photocatalyst of 0 05 the photodegradation efficiency at different amount of pani mwcnt nc for mb rhb and mo solution dyes is shown in fig 9 a it is evident that with increasing the amount of photocatalyst the photodegradation efficiency was improved for all the organic dyes and reached the values of 65 for mb 61 for rhb and 99 for mo dyes at 0 07 g for the sample of run 13 therefore it was concluded that increasing the amount of photocatalyst could result in the higher photodegradation efficiency fig 9 b illustrates the change in photodegradation efficiency against dye concentration it should be noted that the change in the dye concentration resulted in the change in the solution ph on the other hand the solution dye ph has a critical role and significant impact on the dye removal it was reported that higher values of ph were suitable for cationic dye and the lower values of ph showed a better performance for anionic dyes 59 60 it can be seen from fig 9 b that with increasing the dye concentration from 1 to 15 ppm the photodegradation efficiency was slightly decreased about 2 for mo dye and 6 for mb and rhb dyes from ph 1 to ph 5 and notable reduction in the photodegradation efficiency for about 5 for mo dye and 14 for mb and rhb dyes with further increase in the dye concentration up to 15 ppm the recyclability of the sample run 13 which showed the highest photodegradation efficiency was studied for five cycles to investigate the possibility of reusing the photocatalyst after each cycle the powder was filtered and washed using ethanol and distilled water next the powder dried at 70 c for 12 h the recyclability analysis was performed for all the organic dyes i e mb rhb and mo dyes the results of the recyclability experiments are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 c to e when the pani mwcnt nc was used for five cycles the photocatalytic performance slightly decreased over time fig 9 f illustrates that the photodegradation efficiency of mb decreased from 62 18 for the cycle 1 to 56 55 for cycle 5 for rhb from 59 94 to 52 56 and for mo from 98 39 to 97 06 the reduction in the photodegradation efficiency could be related to the weight loss of the sample during the recycling process the blockage of pores and reduction in active sites due to the reaction between the aromatic groups of pani mwcnt with the aromatic rings of the organic dyes overall it is evident from the obtained results in fig 9 f that there was a slight reduction in the photodegradation efficiencies which indicated good recyclability of pani mwcnt ncs 3 10 reaction mechanism it was reported that pani has higher conduction and valence bands compared to the conduction and valence bands of cnt respectively 28 in another study by umer et al 61 similar results were reported for tio2 and mwcnt the proposed mechanism for the photodegradation of organic dyes using pani mwcnt ncs is presented in fig 10 a it is expected that under uv light irradiation both pani and mwcnt excited to produce electrons and holes the excited electrons can absorb energy and shift from the valence to the conductive band of pani therefore the holes can be generated in the valence band as according to eq 10 moreover dye molecules can get photoexcited against irradiation under uv light as presented in eq 11 the key role of the mwcnt in the system is to impede the recombination rate of electron hole pairs since the work function of mwcnt is higher than that of pani another advantage of mwcnt presence in the synthesized ncs is that the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band in pani can be transferred to the mwcnt conduction band due to the close contact between two materials at the same time the difference in the bandgap energy of mwcnt and pani could act as a driving force to transfer the generated holes on the valence band of mwcnt to that of pani this is the main mechanism for effectively separating the photogenerated electrons and holes and hinder the recombination of electron hole pairs the scavenger experiments were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism and formation of active species in the photodegradation of organic dyes 62 for this reason 1 0 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa to detect oh benzoquinone bq to detect o2 and potassium iodide ki to detect h were employed and photodegradation experiments were performed with sample run 13 under uv light irradiation for 45 min the obtained results of the scavenger test are shown in fig 10 b it can be observed that the Œ∑mb Œ∑rhb and Œ∑mo markedly dropped to 14 30 25 77 and 20 66 respectively for the experiments with bq suggesting that o2 could be the main reactive component during the mb rhb and mo dyes photodegradation in the presence of pani mcwnt ncs under uv light irradiation overall the possible reaction mechanism can be presented as reactions of eqs 10 to 17 the dissolved o2 can react with the available electrons in conduction bands of pani and mwcnt to generate superoxide radical anions o2 as the conduction bands in pani and mwcnt are higher than o2 o2 reduction potential 28 the o2 radicals can then react with the water to generate the oh radicals the generated active species such as oh and o2 could react with the available cation in dye and produce degraded and colorless

statistical analysis of the synthesized nanocomposites indicated that the sample with 7 wt mwcnt synthesized under 80 ultrasonic power for 32 5 min exhibited lower bandgap energy and superior photodegradation efficiency against single pani for mb rhb and mo dyes the phase evolution surface morphology particle size and bandgap energy of the synthesized nanocomposites were examined and discussed in detail the addition of mwcnt improved the photodegradation ability of pani under uv light irradiation suggesting potential application as a photocatalyst according to the synergistic effect between pani and mwcnt the synthesized ncs showed excellent photodegradation efficiency in particular compared to pani alone for both cationic and anionic organic dyes the sample produced with 7 wt mwcnt under ultrasonic time 32 5 min and ultrasonic power of 80 exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance with rate constants which were 4 25 4 51 and 7 53 times higher than that of pani for mb rhb and mo dyes respectively the photocatalytic mechanism using the pani mwcnt under uv light irradiation was studied using different scavengers and it was found that superoxide radicals oh could be the main reactive component during the mb rhb and mo dyes photodegradation in conclusion from the findings of this research pani mwcnt ncs are potential candidates for selective dye pollutant

13091,polyaniline pani and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt were used for synthesis of pani mwcnt nanocomposites ncs via ultrasonic method the characterization of the pani mwcnt ncs were performed

performance of pani mwcnt ncs were carried out to better understand the effectiveness of uv light irradiation on the dye removal it was found that the synthesized ncs performed better under uv light irradiation in removing the organic dyes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polyaniline dye removal photodegradation adsorption mwcnt 1 introduction it is a major environmental challenge to stop the spread of hazardous pollutants such as synthetic colored dye originating from numerous industries such as textile printing plastic leather which can directly harm natural resources and can lead to several health concerns including cancer and metabolic changes in the human body 1 3 thus it is crucial to apply a cost effective approach to eliminate the industrial pollutants from generated wastewater before being released into the aquatic environment 4 so far several studies have been conducted to address the organic dye elimination from industrial wastewater through chemical physical and biological routes such as bio degradation filtration oxidation flocculation ozonation adsorption and photodegradation 5 7 among these methods photodegradation based semiconductor materials captivated significant attention in recent years based on their low cost process immense activity and no secondary damage to the environment 8 10 the main concept of photodegradation is to apply the photocatalysis process to produce electron hole pairs hydroxyl or superoxide radicals as active agents to decompose the colloidal pollutants available in the wastewater 11 12 although several photocatalyst materials have been introduced the efficiency of photodegradation is a critical factor therefore several methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency by producing more active sites reducing particle size increasing the structure porosity and preventing the fast recombination of electron hole pairs by using dopants or nanocomposites 13 14 the application of conductive polymers cps in recent years such as polyaniline pani polypyrrole ppy polyacetylene pa and polyfuran pf with inorganic materials or carbon nanotube cnt to improve photocatalysis efficiency has captivated the attention of researchers 15 16 among different cps pani was identified as a promising material for the enhancement of photodegradation efficiency due to its simple production low cost water insolubility environmentally friendly high hole mobility slow electron hole recombination and high stability 16 19 previous studies 20 21 have reported that the pani tio2 nanocomposite nc synthesized through chemical oxidative polymerization showed notably higher photodegradation efficiency than standalone pani and tio2 in another study wei et al 22 showed that the pani tio2 nc with bionic nanopapilla structure had significant photocatalytic activity for acetone dye under ultraviolet uv light irradiation haspulat et al 23 investigated the photocatalytic performance of fe doped pani and they indicated that the surface properties of pani such as roughness could be adjusted with the addition of fe2 ions during polymerization similarly the pani fe composites displayed superior photodegradation compared to pani alone other researchers reported the great photocatalytic performance of pani b2o3 pani bivo4 pani binbo4 and pani cdo ncs against pani alone in removing organic carbon in presence of uv and natural light 24 26 in addition the combination of cnt with pani has also been introduced for the photodegradation of organic dyes due to its remarkable transport and electronic properties 27 according to its unique properties pani ncs with inorganic materials or carbon materials were prepared via different methods such as template based and template free synthesis routes the template free synthesis route is more cost effective which includes self assembly and electrospinning methods 28 29 in this route the shape and size of cps can be modified by varying dopants oxidant and monomer type and concentration dopant and oxidant to monomer molar ratio and reaction temperature and time 30 among the self assembly methods the sonochemical approach has several benefits including good and crystallinity eco friendly heating free and controllable parameters therefore it is considered as one of the most important methods for the fabrication of cps 31 in order to optimize the process parameters to obtain the highest efficiency of cps photodegradation the design of experiments doe could be applied in order to minimize the experimental expenses and time different doe methods were used for optimization of chemical processes 32 among them the response surface methodology rsm technique found to be an effective tool for analysis the change in the process response by varying the experimental variables at the same time and performing a limited number of experiments in which quadratic models can be derived 33 34 the current work investigated the photodegradation of organic dyes using synthesized pani mwcnt ncs by the sonochemical process in presence of uv light pani is a common conductive polymer used for adsorption process until today few studies discussed the application of pani for photodegradation process it is noteworthy that the application of carbon nanotubes cnts in several industrial fields has been increased due to its unique properties including unique structural metallic and electronic characteristics and large length to diameter ratio 35 in particular more recently the application of multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and polymer mwcnts ncs has been introduced for the heavy metal ions removal from aqueous medium 36 the statistical analysis method was applied to study the effects of change in the process parameters on the characterization and photodegradation efficiency of pani mwcnt ncs additionally the adsorption capacity of the synthesized ncs was investigated to clarify the effects of uv light irradiation on dye removal efficiency the removal of mb rhb and mo dye was investigated using the kinetics analysis and recyclability of the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs as far as the authors concern such a systematic investigation for pani mwcnt ncs has not been done before 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of pani mwcnt nanocomposites the pani was synthesized by ultrasonic assisted inverse solution polymerization of aniline that is discussed in section s1 of supplementary materials 37 38 the pani mwcnt ncs was synthesized through similar method as described in section s1 in supplementary materials aniline and ammonium persulfate aps were dissolved in hcl 1 m separately next specific amount of mwcnt was added to the aniline solution and stirring continued for an hour then aps solution was added drop by drop to the aniline mwcnt solution and stirring continued for half an hour the solution was then put in an ultrasonic device under certain power for a defined time later the solution was kept overnight filtered and the solid residue was washed again with methanol and deionized water finally the powder was dried in an oven at 70 c for 12 h all the chemicals used in this work were commercially available and employed without further purification table 1 summarizes the chemical components used in this study the schematic of the pani mwcnt synthesis method is shown in fig 1 the optical band gap energy eg of the obtained powder was calculated from sample reflectance using perkin elmer lambda 35 uv spectrophotometer within wavelength Œª of 190 to 1100 nm the phase evolution was studied by xrd x ray diffraction bruker d8 germany method with cu kŒ± radiation Œª 1 54 √• besides that the ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra perkinelmer waltham ma were performed using kbr pellets within the range of 400 4000 cm 1 moreover the morphology of the synthesized ncs was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem leo supra 35vp germany the specific surface area and specific pore volume were measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the average pore size was determined using barret joyner halenda bjh method micromeritics asap 2020 usa finally the zeta potential of pure pani and samples with highest and lowest optical bandgap energy was measured by zeta potential analyzer zeta nano z uk 2 2 design of experiment the design of experiment doe analysis using the box bhenken model was employed with design expert v11 software state ease usa for statistical analysis the experimental parameters were ultrasonic time 15 to 50 min ultrasonic power 30 to 80 and mwcnt wt 3 to 7 wt the selected responses were the optical bandgap energy eg and the photodegradation efficiency of three organic dyes i e mb rhb and mo the plot from the modified kubelka munk k m method associated with the eg of pani mwcnt ncs with the lowest and highest eg and of the synthesized pani is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary material the photodegradation efficiency Œ∑ was calculated using eq 1 where c0 mg l 1 was the initial dye concentration and ci mg l 1 was the dye concentration at time t min 1 Œ∑ c i c 0 c 0 100 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the photodegradation behavior of pani mwcnt ncs was investigated by observing its efficiency in the removal of both cationic organic dyes i e mb rhb and anionic organic dyes i e mo the photocatalytic reactions conducted in presence of uv light 254 nm 360 w uv lamp philips using 200 ml of 5 ppm dye solutions and 0 05 g of the synthesized nanocomposite as the photocatalyst the mixture was placed inside a black box with uv light irradiation and was subjected to irradiation for 45 min under stirring conditions the photodegradation efficiency of each sample was measured by uv vis absorbance varian cary 50 the adsorption behavior of samples associated with the highest and lowest photodegradation efficiency was investigated for a better understanding of how uv light irradiation affects organic dye removal from the solution additionally in separate experiments the photodegradation and adsorption behavior of pure pani in presence of uv light and in dark environment respectively were evaluated for comparison with the results obtained from the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs 2 4 kinetic study of photodegradation and adsorption efficiency the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were employed to investigate the mb rhb and mo dyes photodegradation kinetic behavior using pani mwcnt ncs the pseudo first order and second order kinetic models can be described as eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 lnln c i c 0 k 1 t 3 1 c i k 2 t 1 c 0 therefore the rate constants for the photodegradation experiments could be achieved from the slope of ln ci c0 and 1 ci against time diagrams 39 similarly the adsorption mechanism was investigated by pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the adsorbate capacity of the nanoparticles qt mg g 1 can be obtained from eq 4 4 q t c 0 c i v m on the other hand the equilibrium absorbate capacity qe can be achieved from eq 5 5 q e c 0 c e v m where ce mg l 1 was dye concentration at the equilibrium state m g was the adsorbent mass and v l represented the dye solution volume 40 41 by inserting qt and qe in eqs 2 and 3 the linear shapes of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for adsorption could be given as eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here the rate constants k1 and k2 for the adsorption process were calculated from the plot of ln qe qt and t qt against time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 box bhenken design the details of doe analysis of the obtained results as listed in table 2 has explained in section s2 in the supplementary material the values of eg for all the synthesized ncs are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the maximum eg of 3 32 ev was for sample run 5 with an ultrasonic time of 32 5 min ultrasonic power of 30 and 3 wt mwcnt however the minimum eg of 2 74 ev was for sample run 13 with an ultrasonic time of 32 5 min ultrasonic power of 80 and 7 wt mwcnt the optical bandgap energy calculation of synthesized pani showed that its eg was 3 4 ev the anova analysis of the obtained eg values for each experimental condition according to table 2 resulted to derive a quadratic model to express eg as a function of process variables as eq 8 which can be used to predict the eg by changing the process variables within the studied range of the experimental parameters the detail of anova analysis of the obtained eg is explained in section s3 of the supplementary materials 8 e g 3 08 0 0187 a 0 0762 b 0 2050 c 0 0075 ab 0 0100 bc 0 0017 a 2 0 0133 b 2 0 0307 c 2 where a is the ultrasonic time b is the ultrasonic power and c is the mwcnt amount 42 3 2 water content of the sorbent the amount of swelling or absorption water by the synthesized pani and the samples run 5 and run 13 associated with the highest and lowest eg was measured according to eq 9 43 9 w w w w d w w 100 where w is the percentage of water adsorb by the powder ww is the weight of the wet powder and wd is the weight of the dry powder specific amount of each powder was dried in oven for 24 h then added to the conical flask with 50 ml distilled water and left for 24 h on the magnetic stirrer at the ambient temperature 22 c then the samples were filtered weighed again the amount of absorbed water by pure pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 was 48 42 and 39 respectively 3 3 phase analysis the structure of all the nanocomposites samples was investigated using the xrd and ftir techniques and the results of samples associated with the highest and lowest eg and pani are presented in fig 2 according to fig 2 a the main peaks of pani were detected at 2Œ∏ 15 30 20 40 and 25 72 associated with the 0 1 1 0 2 0 and 2 0 0 crystal planes respectively 44 the broad diffraction peaks were corresponded to the perpendicular and parallel periodicity of pani chains which indicated the poor crystallinity of cps as a result of the replication of benzenoid and quinoid rings 44 the results of xrd analysis for the mwcnt showed a significant broad diffraction peak around 2Œ∏ 25 0 0 2 with d spacing of 0 35 nm and full width half maximum fwhm of 3 06 another broad peak with low intensity was observed at 2Œ∏ 43 1 0 0 with d spacing of 0 20 nm and full width half maximum fwhm of 4 10 it is evident from fig 2 a that the xrd diffraction patterns of pani mwcnt ncs followed the same amorphous pattern as mwcnt compared to the mwcnt and synthesized pani the xrd diffraction pattern of ncs was broadened and a narrow peak around 2Œ∏ 25 was observed this feature could be a result of mwcnt presence in the pani matrix which led to a decrease in the intensity of main peaks and material was found to be more disordered the results demonstrated that the mwcnt presence in the pani matrix impeded crystallite growth in the material 45 the profile fitting data of the xrd spectrums in fig 2 a is summarizes in table 3 according to table 3 the profile fitting data for samples run 5 and run 13 indicated the broad diffraction peak at around 25 besides that low intensity crystalline peaks were observed in both of the samples which are summarized in table s3 in supplementary materials the profile fitting showed the amorphous structure of the nanocomposites with an almost 80 degree of amorphousness this means that changing the process parameters such as changing the ratio of pani mwcnt had no significant effect on the amorphous structure of the samples a previous study by jorge et al 46 showed that the doping of pani with zno could increase the crystallinity of the nanocomposite to 30 the ftir transmission spectra of pani mwcnt and pani mwcnt ncs run 5 and run 13 are shown in fig 2 b the ftir spectra of synthesized pani indicated multiple peaks within 1570 and 1140 cm 1 region which could be related to quinoid and benzenoid ring stretching of aniline moreover the peaks at 1571 and 1482 cm 1 could be associated with the cc and cn stretching emerging from quinoid stretching and benzene rings of aniline and the peak close to 1304 cm 1 related to the cn stretching of quinoid 47 49 the peak at 1145 cm 1 could be associated with the ch in plane bending motion of aromatic rings 47 finally peak at 817 cm 1 was assigned to ch the observed peaks confirmed the successful synthesis of pani 46 the ftir spectrum for mwcnt showed intense peaks at 500 cm 1 which could be corresponded to the ch stretching peak at 1146 cm 1 related to co stretching and a peak at 1311 cm 1 correspond to cc bond stretch 50 the two peaks observed at 2854 and 2918 cm 1 were also associated with the symmetric ch bond stretching in the carboxyl group formed on the sidewall of the mwcnt 51 it can be observed from fig 2 b that the ftir patterns of pani mwcnt ncs were similar to that of pani the obtained results indicated that the pani was relatively covered the mwcnt surface according to fig 2 b with different ratios of mwcnt in the samples the positions of peaks weren t changed and no specific chemical bonding was detected between the available chemical components in the system 3 4 morphology analysis the morphology of the pure mwcnt synthesized pani and all the pani mwcnt nanocomposite samples associated with table 2 is shown in fig 3 the morphology of synthesized pani illustrates agglomerated spherical nanoparticles with an average particle size of 219 53 nm the fesem analysis data for the synthesized nanocomposites illustrate that the mwcnt was dispersed on the surface of pani nanoparticles the morphological study found that the fine pani nanoparticles were spherical in shape at the ultrasonic power of 80 on the other hand at a lower ultrasonic power of 30 coarse spherical nanoparticles were observed another interesting point is that by increasing the ultrasonic power from 30 to 80 the mwcnts were distributed more homogeneously in the matrix it was observed that with increasing ultrasonic power and time the particle size of the obtained nanocomposites decreased from around 190 nm to 103 nm the particle sizes for sample run 13 which had the lowest eg was 102 89 nm and for sample run 5 which had the highest bandgap was 191 01 nm it is worth noting that the increase in ultrasonic power does not always have a positive effect on the reduction of particle size 3 5 bet analysis the specific surface and porosity of the pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 was studied to explore the effect of ultrasonic synthesis of mwcnt doped pani using bet method fig 4 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the mentioned samples it can be observed from fig 4 a to c that the hysteresis loop for pani and pani mwcnt ncs increased sharply at a p p0 of around 0 8 demonstrating mesoporosity according to the shape of hysteresis loop for the adsorption desorption isotherms curves the bet analysis indicated that the specific surface area for pani sample run 5 and sample run 13 were 8 96 20 62 and 25 34 m2 g 1 respectively the pore size distribution of the samples using bjh method is shown in fig 4 d the pore size of the samples ranging from around 5 to 90 nm table 4 summarizes the textural properties of the pani and pani mwcnt ncs according to the obtained results the ultrasonic synthesis of pani mwcnt ncs showed a better surface area compared to pure pani thus this can lead to increase in the photodegradation and adsorption of organic dyes due to the more active sites 3 6 photocatalytic activity the reduction in the mb rhb and mo concentrations was measured from the change in the absorbance spectra of mb at 665 nm rhb at 554 nm and mo at 465 nm respectively from 5 to 45 min as shown in fig s5 in the supplementary materials fig 5 illustrates the photodegradation efficiency of mb rhb and mo dyes in the presence of synthesized pani sample run 13 and sample run 5 which were related to the highest and lowest photodegradation efficiencies of solution dyes the photodegradation efficiency values for all the experiments are summarized in table 2 the photodegradation profiles c c0 vs time in fig 5 illustrate that the initial photodegradation was quick due to the high concentration of dye followed by a slower degradation stage as the concentration of dye decreased it is evident that there was a maximum photodegradation of 62 18 in mb 59 94 in rhb and 98 39 in mo after 45 min irradiation to the uv light for the run 13 sample in comparison the synthesized pani showed photodegradation of 20 13 in mb 20 67 in rhb and 79 80 in mo dyes hence the application of pani mwcnt ncs increased the dye removal efficiency for mb and rhb dyes to about three times more than pani alone and about 1 5 times more than pani alone for mo dye the obtained results indicated that the synthesized pani mwcnt in this study showed the highest photodegradation efficiency in contrast to energy consume time and amount of pollutants used with other research work as listed in table 5 it is worth noting that the reason for the pani mwcnt s better photocatalytic efficiency on mo compared to mb and rhb could be related to the zeta potential of pani as shown in fig 6 the zeta potential for pani was about 14 8 mv and it was increased by addition of mwcnt the presence of mwcnt could facilitate the pani as conducting polymer to transform to its conductive form which resulted in the positive charges of pani mwcnt ncs this can explain the better photodegradation performance of pani mwcnt ncs for mo as anionic dye which was improved by the positive values of zeta potential 53 on the other hand pani mwcnt ncs demonstrated lower efficiency for the cationic dyes the statistical analysis of the obtained photodegradation efficiencies is explained in section s4 in the supplementary materials 3 7 adsorption test in order to investigate the adsorption of dyes in dark environments for a better understanding of uv light irradiation effects on dye removal efficiency dark tests were conducted for the pani and sample run 13 which had the highest photodegradation results as shown in fig 7 it is evident from fig 7 that even without the presence of uv light irradiation pani had the ability to adsorb the mb rhb and mo dyes this is in accordance with a previous study by vidya et al 56 which reported that pani was a good adsorbent of organic dyes according to fig 7 a the adsorption efficiency values of synthesized pani and sample run 13 in a dark environment for the mb dye were about 15 and 25 respectively when compared with photodegradation in the presence of uv light irradiation the uv light irradiation increased the dye removal efficiency by about 45 compared to the adsorption for sample run 13 another interesting point was that pani showed almost the same photodegradation and adsorption efficiencies however with the rhb dye pani showed different behaviors based on the data from fig 7 b the photodegradation efficiency of pani was higher than its adsorption under the same experimental timespan similarly the photodegradation efficiency of rhb dye for sample run 13 was higher by about 35 than its adsorption as has been mentioned in section 3 5 pani with a positive zeta potential has a high adsorption capacity for anionic dyes such as mo it can be observed from fig 7 c that in the absence of uv light irradiation pani and pani mwcnt ncs significantly removed the mo dye to up to about 70 and 95 after 45 min respectively therefore it can be said that the synthesized pani mwcnt ncs have higher photodegradation efficiencies than adsorption for the removal of cationic dyes such as mb and rhb dyes with regards to anionic dyes such as mo both the photodegradation and adsorption had high efficiencies the adsorption capacity of pani and pani mwcnt ncs sample run 13 over the experimental timespan was calculated using eq 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the qt of sample run 13 was about 6 mg g 1 after 45 min higher than that of pani 3 4 mg g 1 for mb dye regarding the rhb dyes the adsorption behavior was similar and the sample run 13 showed the final qt near to 3 mg g 1 compared to about 0 7 mg g 1 for pani on the other hand both sample run 13 and pani almost had close qt for the mo dye it should be noted that the qt of pani and pani mwcnt ncs were markedly higher for mo dye compared to mb and rhb dyes fig 8 furthermore the synthesized pani mwcnt nc sample run 13 demonstrated higher qt in mb and rhb dyes than single pani this difference in mo dye was almost negligible again this could be related to the remarkable capacity of pani in adsorbing anionic dyes compared to cationic dyes 53 3 8 kinetics study the rate limiting step of photodegradation and adsorption can be explained by analyzing the kinetics of dye removal as one of the main features of the system according to the pseudo first order kinetic model photodegradation or adsorption occurs at a very low concentration or when the system reaches equilibrium the main assumption of this model is that there was no significant chemical interaction between the dyes and photocatalyst however the pseudo second order kinetic model assumes that strong bonds can exist between the dyes and photocatalyst or adsorbent 57 table 6 summarizes the kinetic rate constants from pseudo first and second order kinetic models for the photodegradation and adsorption of mb rhb and mo dye solutions in the presence of synthesized pani the sample with the highest bandgap run 5 and the sample with the lowest bandgap run 13 respectively according to the curve fitting results of kinetic data for photodegradation the pseudo second order model showed higher r2 values this suggests that the photodegradation process follows second order kinetics the analysis of the photodegradation constants reveals that sample run 13 had a rate constant k2 of about 4 25 4 51 and 7 53 times higher than that of pani for mb rhb and mo dyes respectively the higher kinetic constants for the synthesized nanocomposites illustrate the advantage of pani mwcnt ncs over single pani for a more efficient photocatalysis process similar to photodegradation it can be observed from the model fitting of adsorption capacity with the experimental data that the pseudo second order kinetic model was well fitted to the experimental data due to the higher r2 values in table 6 for the pseudo second order compared to the pseudo first order kinetic model and the chemisorption could be the rate limiting step 58 3 9 effectiveness of the pani mwcnt nanocomposite the effectiveness of pani mwcnt nc of run 13 on the photodegradation efficiency of the organic dyes were investigated via changing the concentration of photocatalyst from 0 01 to 0 07 g at 5 ppm solution dyes and dye concentration from 1 to 15 ppm using photocatalyst of 0 05 the photodegradation efficiency at different amount of pani mwcnt nc for mb rhb and mo solution dyes is shown in fig 9 a it is evident that with increasing the amount of photocatalyst the photodegradation efficiency was improved for all the organic dyes and reached the values of 65 for mb 61 for rhb and 99 for mo dyes at 0 07 g for the sample of run 13 therefore it was concluded that increasing the amount of photocatalyst could result in the higher photodegradation efficiency fig 9 b illustrates the change in photodegradation efficiency against dye concentration it should be noted that the change in the dye concentration resulted in the change in the solution ph on the other hand the solution dye ph has a critical role and significant impact on the dye removal it was reported that higher values of ph were suitable for cationic dye and the lower values of ph showed a better performance for anionic dyes 59 60 it can be seen from fig 9 b that with increasing the dye concentration from 1 to 15 ppm the photodegradation efficiency was slightly decreased about 2 for mo dye and 6 for mb and rhb dyes from ph 1 to ph 5 and notable reduction in the photodegradation efficiency for about 5 for mo dye and 14 for mb and rhb dyes with further increase in the dye concentration up to 15 ppm the recyclability of the sample run 13 which showed the highest photodegradation efficiency was studied for five cycles to investigate the possibility of reusing the photocatalyst after each cycle the powder was filtered and washed using ethanol and distilled water next the powder dried at 70 c for 12 h the recyclability analysis was performed for all the organic dyes i e mb rhb and mo dyes the results of the recyclability experiments are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 c to e when the pani mwcnt nc was used for five cycles the photocatalytic performance slightly decreased over time fig 9 f illustrates that the photodegradation efficiency of mb decreased from 62 18 for the cycle 1 to 56 55 for cycle 5 for rhb from 59 94 to 52 56 and for mo from 98 39 to 97 06 the reduction in the photodegradation efficiency could be related to the weight loss of the sample during the recycling process the blockage of pores and reduction in active sites due to the reaction between the aromatic groups of pani mwcnt with the aromatic rings of the organic dyes overall it is evident from the obtained results in fig 9 f that there was a slight reduction in the photodegradation efficiencies which indicated good recyclability of pani mwcnt ncs 3 10 reaction mechanism it was reported that pani has higher conduction and valence bands compared to the conduction and valence bands of cnt respectively 28 in another study by umer et al 61 similar results were reported for tio2 and mwcnt the proposed mechanism for the photodegradation of organic dyes using pani mwcnt ncs is presented in fig 10 a it is expected that under uv light irradiation both pani and mwcnt excited to produce electrons and holes the excited electrons can absorb energy and shift from the valence to the conductive band of pani therefore the holes can be generated in the valence band as according to eq 10 moreover dye molecules can get photoexcited against irradiation under uv light as presented in eq 11 the key role of the mwcnt in the system is to impede the recombination rate of electron hole pairs since the work function of mwcnt is higher than that of pani another advantage of mwcnt presence in the synthesized ncs is that the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band in pani can be transferred to the mwcnt conduction band due to the close contact between two materials at the same time the difference in the bandgap energy of mwcnt and pani could act as a driving force to transfer the generated holes on the valence band of mwcnt to that of pani this is the main mechanism for effectively separating the photogenerated electrons and holes and hinder the recombination of electron hole pairs the scavenger experiments were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism and formation of active species in the photodegradation of organic dyes 62 for this reason 1 0 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa to detect oh benzoquinone bq to detect o2 and potassium iodide ki to detect h were employed and photodegradation experiments were performed with sample run 13 under uv light irradiation for 45 min the obtained results of the scavenger test are shown in fig 10 b it can be observed that the Œ∑mb Œ∑rhb and Œ∑mo markedly dropped to 14 30 25 77 and 20 66 respectively for the experiments with bq suggesting that o2 could be the main reactive component during the mb rhb and mo dyes photodegradation in the presence of pani mcwnt ncs under uv light irradiation overall the possible reaction mechanism can be presented as reactions of eqs 10 to 17 the dissolved o2 can react with the available electrons in conduction bands of pani and mwcnt to generate superoxide radical anions o2 as the conduction bands in pani and mwcnt are higher than o2 o2 reduction potential 28 the o2 radicals can then react with the water to generate the oh radicals the generated active species such as oh and o2 could react with the available cation in dye and produce degraded and colorless

trimethoxysilane hdtms the characterization results revealed that the water contact angle wca of the modified quartz sand was more than 150 and the oil contact angle oca was nearly 0 notably the modified quartz sand could be used as a filter to separate oil and water and depicted a high separation efficiency the water content in the filtrate was less than 0 5 wt in the meantime the modified quartz sand can fully separate the oil film from water by adhesion the wca of the modified quartz sand remains above 148 even after repeated test which indicated that the modified quartz sand had good stability and reusability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords quartz sand surface modification super hydrophobic super oleophilic oil water separation 1 introduction the discharge of industrial oil bearing wastewater and multiple oil spills are triggering a great damage to soil and water environment 1 3 regarding this how to treat and recycle oily wastewater has become a

employed to remove oil droplets however certain drawbacks such as unsatisfactory separation efficiency generation of secondary pollutants and high operating cost 11 13 are limiting their application in large scale treatment therefore cheap environment friendly and efficient methods are urgently needed to manage this situation 14 recently the difference of wettability between water and oil provides a new idea for separation 15 17 superwetting material can selectively wet and repel oil and water therefore this kind of materials with high separation efficiency and wide selectivity has become the main research topics 18 19 regarding this the deep bed filtration is a common method used to filter oily sewage due to its feasibility and effectiveness 20 moreover the filter media is one of the important factors affecting oil removal efficiency 21 some filter materials such as walnut shells 22 peanut shell 23 and waste bricks 24 have been used to separate water and oil these materials inevitably have some disadvantages such as poor selectivity separation performance and low adsorption capacity therefore it is necessary to enhance wettability of the filter media for the purpose of achieving a high efficiency the stronger the hydrophobicity and lipophilicity the higher will be the oil removal efficiency it is essential to take measures to improve the hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of filter material 25 for example wang et al have switched sponges from hydrophilic to hydrophobic by adding fluoridated kaolin which then exhibit high and fast adsorption capacity for oil 26 bayer et al conducted the hydrophobic treatment of woven cotton fabrics with polyurethane modified aminosilicone emulsions 27 zhang et al prepared a super hydrophobic polyacrylonitrile nanofiber membrane by electrospinning and surface modification 28 the prepared materials show high separation efficiencies however the high cost of raw materials modifiers harmful to the environment and complex modification procedures limit their practical application regarding this the quartz sand has a wide range of sources high hardness and good chemical stability and has been widely used in water treatment construction chemical and other fields 29 33 however the natural quartz sand is hydrophilic and lipophilic so it is unable to selectively filter water and oil quartz sand is mainly composed of silica and the surface is covered with many hydroxyl groups which provides the basis for surface modification 34 superhydrophobic quartz sand can be obtained by constructing rough structure and modifying it with materials which have low surface energy 35 36 therefore herein novel super hydrophobic super oleophilic quartz sand was designed which can be used to achieve selective separation of water and oil the novel super hydrophobic super oleophilic quartz sand was fabricated by constructing silica rough structure and modifying it with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane hdtms which had a low surface energy the present work introduces the modification of quartz sand and the study of its application in separating water and oil 2 material and methods 2 1 material the following materials were used quartz sand was purchased from henan zhengzhou ming hai quartz sand factory cetyl trimethoxy ammonium bromide ctab ethyl orthosilicate teos ammonia hexadecyltrimethoxysilane hdtms

sinopharm chemical reagents co ltd 2 2 surface modification of quartz sand 2 2 1 activation of quartz sand 2 mol l hcl solution was poured into a beaker which was filled with quartz sand and then reacted for 24 h the quartz sand was then washed using distilled water the pretreated quartz sand was obtained by drying at 80 c 2 2 2 construction of rough structure on quartz sand surface a certain amount of activated quartz sand was added in 100 ml anhydrous ethanol and then the ctab 50 ml 0 1 mol l was added the ph of the amalgam was adjusted to 12 using ammonia thereafter the teos was added and stirred at 25 c for 10 h after hydrolysis the quartz sand was cleaned and dried at 60 c until there was no change in weight thereafter the final product sio2 sand was obtained 37 2 2 3 surface modification of sio2 sand a certain volume of hdtms was slowly added to ethanol solution and the ph was adjusted to 4 5 with acetic acid the hdtms hydrolysate was obtained by stirring and hydrolyzing at 60 c for 1 h then 10 g sio2 sand was added and reacted at 30 c 80 c for 0 5 3 h after reaction the sand was cleaned to neutral with ethanol and distilled water and dried at 60 c to obtain hdtms sio2 sand fig 1 shows the modification process 2 3 adhesion experiment to evaluate the static oil removal performance of the modified quartz sand an adhesion test was carried out 38 10 g of the modified quartz sand was immersed into various oils for a few hours and then taken out to weigh it the following formula was used to calculate the adhesion capacity of the modified quartz sand 1 q m 1 m 0 m 0 where q mg g is the adhesion capability m 0 g is the weight of quartz sand before adhesion m 1 g is the weight of quartz sand after adhesion 2 4 oil water separation experiment to facilitate observation water was dyed with methylene blue and oil was dyed with sudan iii water and oil were mixed in a 1 1 volume ratio and separated only by gravity in this paper the effects of filling height and particle size of quartz sand on the separation performance were studied using separation flux and efficiency as indexes the separation flux q l m 2 h 1 was estimated using following equation 2 q v a t where q l m 2 h 1 is separation flux v l is the volume of liquid passing through filter a m2 is the effective filtration area t h is the permeate time gravimetric method is used to calculate the separation efficiency Œ∑ of quartz sand using following equation 3 Œ∑ m m 0 100 where Œ∑ is the separation efficiency m g and m o g represent the mass of filtrate and initial oil respectively 2 5

250xi thermofisher contact angle was measured by contact angle measuring instrument dsa25e german kruss company 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of fabrication protocol for the modified quartz sand the effects of hdtms concentration reaction temperature and reaction time on quartz sand modification were studied by single factor optimization experiment with wca oil water separation efficiency and separation flux as evaluation indexes 3 1 1 effect of hdtms concentration on wettability and separation performance the hydrolyzate with a concentration of 1 6 hdtms was prepared to react with pretreated quartz sand at 30 c for 1 h fig 2a shows that the surface wca of quartz sand firstly increases and then decreases as the concentration of hdtms increases when the concentration of hdtms was 4 the wca reached at the maximum with the increase of silane dosage the amount of grafting or coating on quartz sand was increased and the hydrophobicity gradually increased 39 when the concentration was greater than 4 the self polymerization of hdtms was increased which affected the grafting of hdtms on quartz sand and reduced the wca of the quartz sand besides fig 2b shows that the separation efficiency was above 90 and the separation flux was between 3600 l m 2 h 1 and 3800 l m 2 h 1 after modification with the increase of hdtms concentration the separation efficiency and flux were slightly improved altogether the optimal concentration of hdtms modifier was 4 3 1 2 effect of reaction temperature on wettability and separation performance the pretreated quartz sand was reacted with 4 hdtms solution at 30 80 c for 1 h as shown in the fig 2c the wca of quartz sand firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of reaction temperature the maximum surface wca was reached when the reaction temperature was 60 c indicating that 60 c was the optimal reaction temperature this might be because the grafting reaction between silane and quartz sand was beneficial when the temperature was appropriately raised at higher temperature the copolymerization reaction among silane molecules was occurred which was not promising to the modification 40 41 in addition when the temperature rises to 50 c both the separation efficiency and flux were increased hence the optimum reaction temperature was 60 c 3 1 3 effect of reaction time on wettability and separation performance a 4 hdtms solution was used to react with the pretreated quartz sand at 60 c for 0 5 3 h as shown in the fig 2e the surface wca of quartz sand was firstly increased first and then decreased as the reaction time increases and the maximum wca reached when the reaction time was 1 5 h this might be because as the reaction time increased the hydrolysis of hdtms was gradually complete so that the long alkyl chain could be well grafted on the quartz sand with the excessive increase of reaction time the hydrolysates of hdtms may self polymerize and reduce the alkyl chain grafted on the quartz sand resulting in a decrease of the wca 42 in addition as the reaction time increases to 1 5 h the separation efficiency of the modified quartz sand was slightly increased while the separation flux was change little both around 3500 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 2f hence the best condition was to modify the quartz sand with 4 hdtms at 60 c for 1 5 h 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 surface morphology fig 3 shows the surface microscopic morphology and elements of quartz sand the surface of the unmodified quartz sand was smooth with only some obvious folds while the modified quartz sand revealed many small spherical particles these micro nano bumps did form a rough surface structure on the quartz sand which greatly increased the hydrophobicity of the quartz sand 43 the eds analysis showed that the main elements of the original quartz sand were o and si while the c element appeared in the modified quartz sand the modified quartz sand was evenly distributed with si c and o element as shown in fig 3i this might be because the ethyl orthosilicate was hydrolyzed under the catalysis of ammonia and the hydroxyl group of silica was condensed with oh on quartz sand to form si o si bond polycondensation was occurred among silicon alcohols and the silica microspheres were obtained on the surface 44 in order to further study the surface properties of the material the surface roughness of original quartz sand and modified quartz sand were characterized by laser scanning confocal microscope lscm fig 4 the results shows that the surface roughness parameters sa of original quartz sand and modified quartz sand are 2 755 Œºm and 8 205 Œºm respectively further showing that the surface roughness of quartz sand was improved by modification 3 2 2 chemical composition the surface functional groups of quartz sand were analyzed fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5a the wide peaks at 3415 8 cm 1 and 3348 3 cm 1 are the stretching vibration peaks of oh indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups on quartz sand 16 the peaks at 1086 71 cm 1 and 779 30 cm 1 could be corresponded to the stretching vibration absorption of si o si bond the ir spectrums of both samples were similar indicating that the modification remains the si o si bond on the quartz sand surface 45 46 the ir spectra of the modified quartz sand indicated two new absorption peaks at 2924 34 cm 1 and 2854 44 cm 1 which might be due to the presence of ch stretching vibration peaks of ch3 and ch2 these peaks were clearly indicating that hdtms did react with the quartz sand and transplanted the long chain alkyl onto its surface 47 fig 5b shows the xps spectrum from which the original quartz sand consists of o 532 8 ev and si 103 5 ev for the modified quartz sand the absorption intensity of characteristic peaks o1s si2p and si2s decreased significantly while the absorption intensity of characteristic peaks c1s increased significantly because the modified quartz sand was covered with long chain alkyl which further identified that hdtms was grafted on its surface 48 49 3 2 3 surface wettability the stained water droplets were added on the quartz sand fig 6a b shows that water was rapidly wetting on original quartz sand while spherical droplets were formed on modified quartz sand as shown in fig 6f g when the quartz sand was put into water the original quartz sand directly sank to the bottom while the modified quartz sand floated on the water which further showed that the modified quartz sand had an excellent hydrophobicity as shown in fig 6e by measuring wca in air the wca in air of original quartz sand was 79 while that of modified quartz sand was more than 150 which further confirms the super hydrophobicity of modified quartz sand besides the quartz sand was immersed in n hexane and then water droplets were added to its surface it can be seen in fig 6c d that water was completely wetted on the original quartz sand and spherical droplets were formed on the modified quartz sand the wca in oil of original quartz sand was 59 and that of modified quartz sand was 141 as shown in fig 6e indicating that modified quartz sand had high hydrophobicity under oil this is because the oil occupied the air in the rough structure of the quartz sand forming a stable liquid solid interface when water phase was introduced the composite interface could repel the intrusion of water phase thus showing superhydrophobicity under oil 50 as can be seen from fig 6h i when the modified quartz sand contacted with n hexane stained with sudan iii on water surface n hexane could be quickly adhered by quartz sand and the adhesion process was completed within a few seconds the oca of the modified quartz sand was nearly 0 further indicating that the modified quartz sand had super hydrophilic property 3 3 adhesion ability of modified quartz sand corn oil diesel oil n hexane and dichloromethane were used as oil pollutants to study the adhesive property of quartz sand n hexane and dichloromethane were stained with sudan iii fig 7 shows the adhesion capacity of quartz sand the adhesion capacity of original quartz sand to water was 178 9 mg g while that of modified quartz sand to water was 0 8 mg g which was reduced by 99 5 for corn oil n hexane diesel oil and dichloromethane the adhesion capacity of modified quartz sand was 39 32 71 and 41 higher than that of original quartz sand respectively in short the hydrophobicity and oil adhesion capacity of quartz sand were greatly improved compared with the original quartz sand 3 4 separation performance of modified quartz sand to study the flux and separation efficiency of the prepared quartz sand a mixture of dichloromethane and water was prepared and dichloromethane was stained red with sudan iii while water was stained blue with methylene blue as shown in fig 8 the stainless steel net was fixed between two glass tubes and then filled the device with quartz sand a mixture consisting of 10 ml dichloromethane and 10 ml water was poured into the separator only the dichloromethane could pass through and only the water was trapped flux and separation efficiency could be controlled by changing the filling height of quartz sand therefore quartz sand with particle sizes of 100 300 Œºm and 300 600 Œºm were selected for oil and water separation named herein as qs1 and qs2 respectively the separation efficiency and flux of quartz sand at different filling heights 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm and 60 mm were also studied table 1 shows the oil water separation capacity of different materials 3 4 1 effect of filling height on separation efficiency the separation efficiency was greater than 95 at different filling heights regardless of the size of quartz sand as the thickness of quartz sand increases the separation efficiency gradually increased fig 9a this might be because the capillary force was improved with the rise of thickness of quartz sand which increased the repulsive resistance of water according to fig 9b the water content in the filtrate was less than 0 5 wt and gradually decreased as the quartz sand thickness was increased in addition the efficiency of qs1 was higher than that of qs2 and the water content of qs1 was lower than that of qs2 this might be because quartz sand with smaller particle size had smaller pores and better interception effect 51 3 4 2 effect of filling height on flux of quartz sand with the increase of quartz sand thickness the oil water separation flux and pure oil flux of qs1 and qs2 were gradually declined fig 10 as the thickness of quartz sand were increased from 10 mm to 60 mm the oil water separation flux of qs1 decreased from 3102 3 l m 2 h 1 to 597 8 l m 2 h 1 the pure oil n hexane flux decreased from 2512 1 l m 2 h 1 to 519 1 l m 2 h 1 the oil water separation flux of qs2 decreased from 8880 7 l m 2 h 1 to 4943 9 l m 2 h 1 and the pure oil n hexane flux decreased from 6623 3 l m 2 h 1 to 3703 1 l m 2 h 1 with the increase of the thickness of quartz sand the effective penetration distance was gradually increased resulting in a gradual decreased in flux in addition it can be found that qs1 with smaller particle size had lower oil water separation flux and pure oil flux than qs2 this might be because the pores between qs1 particles were smaller than qs2 resulting in greater flow resistance to study the stability and reusability of the prepared quartz sand the used quartz sand was cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried then the above operation was repeated after 15 times of separation the wca of the modified quartz sand was remain above 148 and the oil water separation efficiency was remain above 95 fig 11a flux decreases with increasing number of cycles due to oil fouling 56 the separation flux of the 15th cycle decreased by 34 compared with that of the first cycle fig 11b the surface morphology of the quartz sand used for 15 times of separation was characterized and it was found that the raised spheres on the surface of the modified quartz sand still exist indicating that the quartz sand had good stability fig 12 3 5 mechanism of oil water separation with quartz sand to further understand the performance of quartz sand in oil water separation the invasion pressure Œ¥p 57 59 is introduced and the mechanism is shown in fig 13 4 Œ¥p 2 Œ≥ ow r lŒ≥ ow cos Œ∏ a where Œ≥ ow is the surface tension r is the pore radius l is the pore perimeter Œ∏ is the wca or oca a is the pore size the formula above shows that the contact angle of the liquid does determine the intrusion pressure when water did contact the modified quartz sand the wca was higher than 90 and the invasion pressure was positive hence the water could not penetrate into the quartz sand filter layer fig 13a on the contrary the oca of the modified quartz sand was less than 90 and the invasion pressure was negative thus the oil phase could flow through the quartz sand filter when only gravity was acting on it as shown in fig 13b fig 13c is showing that the oil moistens the quartz sand rapidly so water is intercepting due to the presence of positive intrusion pressure during separating oil and water 3 6 imagine the application scenario of the material the release of oil into marine ecosystems or terrestrial environment does cause many environmental hazards 60 the modified quartz sand has the potential to dynamically separate oil spills from water with the help of pumps fig 14a dynamic separation characteristics would make it very useful for large leaks in addition the material could also be used to recover oil spills on land as shown in fig 14b where oil from the petroleum processing plant can penetrate through the material packing layer which is collected after leaving water trapped on the ground therefore we believe that the modified quartz sand can be used as a filter material for oil bearing wastewater treatment due to its cost efficiency and environmental friendliness 4 conclusion altogether novel super hydrophobic super oleophilic surface of quartz sand was prepared by constructing rough structure of silica and then modifying with low surface energy hexadecyl trimethoxysilane hdtms through single factor optimization experiment the best modification was to use 4 hdtms to react with quartz sand at 60 c for 1 5 h the modified quartz sand exhibited a wca of more than 150 and oca of about 0 the study indicated that the flux decreased with the increase of quartz sand filter thickness while the separation efficiency increased the flux was improved with the increase of particle size while the separation efficiency decreased after filtration the water content in the filtrate was less than 0 5 wt the separation efficiency was higher than 95 and the flux was up to 8880 7 l m 2 h 1 the mechanism of oil water separation using quartz sand was discussed which provided a certain research basis for further applications of the modified quartz sand in oil

grafted on the quartz sand resulting in a decrease of the wca 42 in addition as the reaction time increases to 1 5 h the separation efficiency of the modified quartz sand was slightly increased while the separation flux was change little both around 3500 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 2f hence the best condition was to modify the quartz sand with 4 hdtms at 60 c for 1 5 h 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 surface morphology fig 3 shows the surface microscopic morphology and elements of quartz sand the surface of the unmodified quartz sand was smooth with only some obvious folds while the modified quartz sand revealed many small spherical particles these micro nano bumps did form a rough surface structure on the quartz sand which greatly increased the hydrophobicity of the quartz sand 43 the eds analysis showed that the main elements of the original quartz sand were o and si while the c element appeared in the modified quartz sand the modified quartz sand was evenly distributed with si c and o element as shown in fig 3i this might be because the ethyl orthosilicate was hydrolyzed under the catalysis of ammonia and the hydroxyl group of silica was condensed with oh on quartz sand to form si o si bond polycondensation was occurred among silicon alcohols and the silica microspheres were obtained on the surface 44 in order to further study the surface properties of the material the surface roughness of original quartz sand and modified quartz sand were characterized by laser scanning confocal microscope lscm fig 4 the results shows that the surface roughness parameters sa of original quartz sand and modified quartz sand are 2 755 Œºm and 8 205 Œºm respectively further showing that the surface roughness of quartz sand was improved by modification 3 2 2 chemical composition the surface functional groups of quartz sand were analyzed fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5a the wide peaks at 3415 8 cm 1 and 3348 3 cm 1 are the stretching vibration peaks of oh indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups on quartz sand 16 the peaks at 1086 71 cm 1 and 779 30 cm 1 could be corresponded to the stretching vibration absorption of si o si bond the ir spectrums of both samples were similar indicating that the modification remains the si o si bond on the quartz sand surface 45 46 the ir spectra of the modified quartz sand indicated two new absorption peaks at 2924 34 cm 1 and 2854 44 cm 1 which might be due to the presence of ch stretching vibration peaks of ch3 and ch2 these peaks were clearly indicating that hdtms did react with the quartz sand and transplanted the long chain alkyl onto its surface 47 fig 5b shows the xps spectrum from which the original quartz sand consists of o 532 8 ev and si 103 5 ev for the modified quartz sand the absorption intensity of characteristic peaks o1s si2p and si2s decreased significantly while the absorption intensity of characteristic peaks c1s increased significantly because the modified quartz sand was covered with long chain alkyl which further identified that hdtms was grafted on its surface 48 49 3 2 3 surface wettability the stained water droplets were added on the quartz sand fig 6a b shows that water was rapidly wetting on original quartz sand while spherical droplets were formed on modified quartz sand as shown in fig 6f g when the quartz sand was put into water the original quartz sand directly sank to the bottom while the modified quartz sand floated on the water which further showed that the modified quartz sand had an excellent hydrophobicity as shown in fig 6e by measuring wca in air the wca in air of original quartz sand was 79 while that of modified quartz sand was more than 150 which further confirms the super hydrophobicity of modified quartz sand besides the quartz sand was immersed in n hexane and then water droplets were added to its surface it can be seen in fig 6c d that water was completely wetted on the original quartz sand and spherical droplets were formed on the modified quartz sand the wca in oil of original quartz sand was 59 and that of modified quartz sand was 141 as shown in fig 6e indicating that modified quartz sand had high hydrophobicity under oil this is because the oil occupied the air in the rough structure of the quartz sand forming a stable liquid solid interface when water phase was introduced the composite interface could repel the intrusion of water phase thus showing superhydrophobicity under oil 50 as can be seen from fig 6h i when the modified quartz sand contacted with n hexane stained with sudan iii on water surface n hexane could be quickly adhered by quartz sand and the adhesion process was completed within a few seconds the oca of the modified quartz sand was nearly 0 further indicating that the modified quartz sand had super hydrophilic property 3 3 adhesion ability of modified quartz sand corn oil diesel oil n hexane and dichloromethane were used as oil pollutants to study the adhesive property of quartz sand n hexane and dichloromethane were stained with sudan iii fig 7 shows the adhesion capacity of quartz sand the adhesion capacity of original quartz sand to water was 178 9 mg g while that of modified quartz sand to water was 0 8 mg g which was reduced by 99 5 for corn oil n hexane diesel oil and dichloromethane the adhesion capacity of modified quartz sand was 39 32 71 and 41 higher than that of original quartz sand respectively in short the hydrophobicity and oil adhesion capacity of quartz sand were greatly improved compared with the original quartz sand 3 4 separation performance of modified quartz sand to study the flux and separation efficiency of the prepared quartz sand a mixture of dichloromethane and water was prepared and dichloromethane was stained red with sudan iii while water was stained blue with methylene blue as shown in fig 8 the stainless steel net was fixed between two glass tubes and then filled the device with quartz sand a mixture consisting of 10 ml dichloromethane and 10 ml water was poured into the separator only the dichloromethane could pass through and only the water was trapped flux and separation efficiency could be controlled by changing the filling height of quartz sand therefore quartz sand with particle sizes of 100 300 Œºm and 300 600 Œºm were selected for oil and water separation named herein as qs1 and qs2 respectively the separation efficiency and flux of quartz sand at different filling heights 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm and 60 mm were also studied table 1 shows the oil water separation capacity of different materials 3 4 1 effect of filling height on separation efficiency the separation efficiency was greater than 95 at different filling heights regardless of the size of quartz sand as the thickness of quartz sand increases the separation efficiency gradually increased fig 9a this might be because the capillary force was improved with the rise of thickness of quartz sand which increased the repulsive resistance of water according to fig 9b the water content in the filtrate was less than 0 5 wt and gradually decreased as the quartz sand thickness was increased in addition the efficiency of qs1 was higher than that of qs2 and the water content of qs1 was lower than that of qs2 this might be because quartz sand with smaller particle size had smaller pores and better interception effect 51 3 4 2 effect of filling height on flux of quartz sand with the increase of quartz sand thickness the oil water separation flux and pure oil flux of qs1 and qs2 were gradually declined fig 10 as the thickness of quartz sand were increased from 10 mm to 60 mm the oil water separation flux of qs1 decreased from 3102 3 l m 2 h 1 to 597 8 l m 2 h 1 the pure oil n hexane flux decreased from 2512 1 l m 2 h 1 to 519 1 l m 2 h 1 the oil water separation flux of qs2 decreased from 8880 7 l m 2 h 1 to 4943 9 l m 2 h 1 and the pure oil n hexane flux decreased from 6623 3 l m 2 h 1 to 3703 1 l m 2 h 1 with the increase of the thickness of quartz sand the effective penetration distance was gradually increased resulting in a gradual decreased in flux in addition it can be found that qs1 with smaller particle size had lower oil water separation flux and pure oil flux than qs2 this might be because the pores between qs1 particles were smaller than qs2 resulting in greater flow resistance to study the stability and reusability of the prepared quartz sand the used quartz sand was cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried then the above operation was repeated after 15 times of separation the wca of the modified quartz sand was remain above 148 and the oil water separation efficiency was remain above 95 fig 11a flux decreases with increasing number of cycles due to oil fouling 56 the separation flux of the 15th cycle decreased by 34 compared with that of the first cycle fig 11b the surface morphology of the quartz sand used for 15 times of separation was characterized and it was found that the raised spheres on the surface of the modified quartz sand still exist indicating that the quartz sand had good stability fig 12 3 5 mechanism of oil water separation with quartz sand to further understand the performance of quartz sand in oil water separation the invasion pressure Œ¥p 57 59 is introduced and the mechanism is shown in fig 13 4 Œ¥p 2 Œ≥ ow r lŒ≥ ow cos Œ∏ a where Œ≥ ow is the surface tension r is the pore radius l is the pore perimeter Œ∏ is the wca or oca a is the pore size the formula above shows that the contact angle of the liquid does determine the intrusion pressure when water did contact the modified quartz sand the wca was higher than 90 and the invasion pressure was positive hence the water could not penetrate into the quartz sand filter layer fig 13a on the contrary the oca of the modified quartz sand was less than 90 and the invasion pressure was negative thus the oil phase could flow through the quartz sand filter when only gravity was acting on it as shown in fig 13b fig 13c is showing that the oil moistens the quartz sand rapidly so water is intercepting due to the presence of positive intrusion pressure during separating oil and water 3 6 imagine the application scenario of the material the release of oil into marine ecosystems or terrestrial environment does cause many environmental hazards 60 the modified quartz sand has the potential to dynamically separate oil spills from water with the help of pumps fig 14a dynamic separation characteristics would make it very useful for large leaks in addition the material could also be used to recover oil spills on land as shown in fig 14b where oil from the petroleum processing plant can penetrate through the material packing layer which is collected after leaving water trapped on the ground therefore we believe that the modified quartz sand can be used as a filter material for oil bearing wastewater treatment due to its cost efficiency and environmental friendliness 4 conclusion altogether novel super hydrophobic super oleophilic surface of quartz sand was prepared by constructing rough structure of silica and then modifying with low surface energy hexadecyl trimethoxysilane hdtms through single factor optimization experiment the best modification was to use 4 hdtms to react with quartz sand at 60 c for 1 5 h the modified quartz sand exhibited a wca of more than 150 and oca of about 0 the study indicated that the flux decreased with the increase of quartz sand filter thickness while the separation efficiency increased the flux was improved with the increase of particle size while the separation efficiency decreased after filtration the water content in the filtrate was less than 0 5 wt the separation efficiency was higher than 95 and the flux was up to 8880 7 l m 2 h 1 the mechanism of oil water separation using quartz sand was discussed which provided a certain research basis for further applications of the modified quartz sand in oil

13093,chlorination has been the traditional method of water disinfection with the advent of new technologies and significant issues encountered in chlorination physical methods gradually prevailed ultraviolet uv radiation technology is a physical disinfection method that has been improved rapidly in recent years this technology mainly based on uv mercury lamps has excellent potential to inactivate microorganisms in water however uv lamps are fragile and may cause the leakage of mercury into the environment as the extension of visible light emitting diodes led progress in solid state physics the nature friendly technology of uv leds has emerged this paper analyzes the performance of cylindrical water disinfection uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials using computational fluid dynamics cfd the response surface methodology rsm is used for shape optimization of the photoreactors working with one uv led at the flow rate of liter per minute lpm typical configurations including the u l and s shaped are examined the analyses provide the optimal radius and length of the photoreactors for different configurations the performance of photoreactors can be enhanced by more than 1 log of e coli by choosing the appropriate length and radius for each configuration also the choice of configuration and led location may affect the performance up to 2 log of e coli our results show that the u and s shaped photoreactors can outperform the l shaped for photoreactors made of uv reflective materials the right choice of length radius and led location can lead to 4 log of e coli for a s shaped photoreactor with a single 25 mw uvc led graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultraviolet light emitting diodes water disinfection point of use computational fluid dynamics response surface methodology 1 introduction water has always been one of the most important issues of humanity lack of access to potable water poses a threat to many people all around the globe 1 3 to avoid this problem disinfection technologies must be utilized to inactivate all microorganisms in water generally speaking the disinfection process is performed by two methods chemical and physical the most common disinfection method in the past was chlorination which is a chemical method however chlorine is ineffective against some pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia lamblia 4 the disinfection process with chlorine may also produce by products such as trihalomethanes thms which are harmful to human health 5 6 on the other hand some physical methods such as ultraviolet uv light radiation can inactivate many microorganisms in water without producing disinfection by products dbps 7 8 also uv rays do not change the color and odor of water and do not depend upon high dose limits which may endanger human s health 9 low or medium pressure mercury lamps are currently the most popular type of radiation sources of uv 10 these mercury lamps are typically designed in long cylindrical forms and cause inflexibility in the design of disinfection photoreactors moreover the fragility of these lamps and the presence of mercury as a toxic gas poses a threat to the disinfection process 11 12 other disadvantages of mercury lamps include their long warm up time large amount of electricity consumption and short lifespan about 10 k hours 9 13 such disadvantages have led researchers to turn their attention to other uv sources e g deuterium xenon microplasma lamps and light emitting diodes leds 14 uv leds which emerged with the recent growth in the manufacturing of semi conductors are excellent alternatives to the uv lamps due to their unique features the leds recombine electrons and holes across a junction to emit radiation at a wavelength that depends on the semi conductor s material the materials commonly used for uv leds are iii nitrides groups e g gallium nitride gan aluminum gallium nitride algan and aluminum nitride aln 15 although the cost of uv leds is higher than uv lamps their advantages promise an alternative and superior technology in drinking water disinfection 16 lower heat generation faster activation lower energy utilization and longer lifespan are the benefits of uv leds over the uv lamps 17 18 besides this technology is very suitable for the areas that are deprived of electricity because uv leds use a small amount of direct current dc electricity which can be supplied by a battery or solar cell another significant advantage is the small size of uv leds with adjustable wavelength creating many degrees of freedom for the design of disinfection photoreactors 19 in recent years experimental studies have been performed to analyze the effect of uv leds on various microorganisms 9 15 20 22 due to the high cost and long time associated with conducting experiments the computational fluid dynamics cfd can be an excellent alternative to study this emerging technology in general there are two frameworks for studying uv photoreactors with cfd the lagrangian and eulerian methods 23 both methods have been successfully employed for the simulation of photoreactors that work with uv lamps such that their predictions are not very different 24 25 likewise the photoreactors that work with uv leds have been simulated and analyzed by both methods 19 to obtain the uv radiation intensity within the field the radiative transport equation rte can be solved to obtain an accurate estimate of the radiation intensity within the photoreactor some crucial factors such as the reflection absorption and refraction of uv by different surfaces in the domain must be included 26 in this work we employ the discrete ordinate do model to find the intensity of uv radiation within the framework of our cfd solver nonetheless the most challenging part in the simulation of uv led photoreactors is the modeling of radiation source which has been tackled by several methods in previous studies one way is to find the radiation distribution from the die surface inside the package and consider the refraction reflection and absorption of uv by the quartz window typically installed in front of the die 27 28 in this strategy it is possible to estimate the radiation intensity behind the quartz window by an exhaustive procedure which is unnecessary for water disinfection usages in some other studies the distribution of uv irradiance was assumed to be uniform within the considered view angle of leds 20 29 30 which works only for some specific leds an alternative is to consider the led as a point source with lambertian radiation profile 31 32 in such a profile it is assumed that the radiant intensity varies with the cosine of the polar angle within the view angle of the led it is clear that such a strategy may not always work for arbitrary radiation profiles a more accurate way of estimating the irradiance distribution is to represent the radiation profile of uv leds by curve fitting 16 19 33 in this method it is assumed that the radiation profile of uv leds is independent of the azimuthal angle and only changes with radial distance from the point source in this work we have adopted this strategy as we have assumed that the uv led source is a small transparent surface on which the power and direction of rays are obtained by fitting a curve based on the radiation profile of a uv led the small size of uv leds prevents many size limitations in the design of photoreactors with uv lamps and increases the degree of freedom in the design of uv led photoreactors as a result the design parameters including those directly related to the led as well as the geometry of photoreactors must be optimized as an example jenny et al 34 optimized the location of uv leds the number of active leds and the choice of wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm for a low capacity uv led water disinfection photoreactor 0 2 l min 1 the performance optimization was carried out for two scenarios a dual objective optimization to maximize the microbial inactivation and to minimize the power supply a single objective optimization to minimize power supply while 2 log inactivation of e coli is surely obtained in this paper we consider the shape optimization of water disinfection uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials with cylindrical configurations the performance evaluation is obtained using an eulerian cfd model which is validated by experimental data available in the literature also we utilize the response surface methodology rsm to obtain the optimal length and radius for different configurations of the photoreactors finally the six different common configurations investigated in our work are compared to find the most appropriate one in terms of water disinfection 2 modeling and simulation structure in this section we present the major steps of our cfd simulation this includes the description of the geometries used in our work and our meshing strategy the governing equations and boundary conditions implemented to simulate different phenomena inside the photoreactors and the details of the numerical algorithms employed to solve the equations 2 1 geometry and mesh in this work we consider single led photoreactors to place the led inside the photoreactors there are two obvious choices parallel irradiation mode and cross irradiation mode 17 considering that the disinfection photoreactors must be designed in a way that all microorganisms are equally inactivated the parallel irradiation mode is closer to such an ideal condition since fluid particles will receive a more uniform amounts of uv irradiation as a result the led is placed on one of the two ends of the cylindrical photoreactor this arrangement is also easier to manufacture and is often used in commercial applications the current uv led photoreactors that are used in real applications have circular or square cross sections with an effective diameter of up to 5 cm r 2 5 cm and a length of up to 20 cm l 20 cm 19 29 35 36 38 in this research we will perform the analysis and optimization of cylindrical photoreactors to comply with the typical dimensions of photoreactors we allow the radius and length to change as 1 5 cm r 4 cm and 10 cm l 30 cm respectively such dimensions are quite suitable for small industrial point of use pou and laboratory applications in this work six common configurations of uv led photoreactors are investigated fig 1 as is common these configurations are classified as u l and s shaped photoreactors based on the arrangement of inlets and outlets it is assumed that the diameter of the inlet and outlet ports of the photoreactors is 1 cm also the length of the inlet pipes is assumed to be 10 cm to ensure that a fully developed flow enters the photoreactor to obtain the numerical solution for different variables of uv photoreactors the computational domain must be decomposed in our work we employed the ansys meshing software to tessellate the computational domain with unstructured meshes the cells are mostly of the tetrahedral type except for the five layers of prisms with the inflation rate of 1 2 which were used near the walls to capture the sharp gradient of the flow variables in the boundary layer region the number of cells is variable between 400 000 to 2400 000 depending on the volume of the photoreactors fig 2 shows the unstructured mesh used for configuration 1 schematically 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions to model the disinfection process within uv led photoreactors different governing equations must be solved with appropriate boundary conditions in this section we provide a full explanation of the governing equations and boundary conditions needed to model uv intensity fluid flow and disinfection kinetics within the photoreactors 2 2 1 radiation to obtain the distribution of uv intensity within the photoreactors the radiative transport equation rte is solved as 1 s i r s a œÉ s i r s a i b t œÉ s 0 4 œÄ œï s s i r s dœâ s where s is the direction vector i is the radiation intensity r is the position vector a is the absorption coefficient œÉ s is the scattering coefficient i b is the radiation intensity of a black body t is the local temperature œï is the phase function s is the direction vector of scattering and œâ is the spatial angle for the solution of rte two assumptions are considered first the ray scattering is ignored as disinfection is the final stage of water treatment and water soluble particles are not large enough to cause scattering second the black body spectral emissive power for photoreactor s temperature range and the uv wavelength range are negligible therefore the thermal radiation can be ignored due to the low temperature of the water and walls of photoreactors 39 as a result the modeling does not require the coupling of energy equation and rte using these assumptions rte is simplified as 2 i s i 0 s e 0 l adx where i and i 0 are the radiation intensity at the distance of l and the source respectively as described we use the do model to solve rte using ansys fluent software this method works based on a finite number of discrete solid angles which is associated with a vector direction fixed in the coordinate system the solid angle of a sphere which is 4œÄ steradian is discretized into 8n Œ∏ n œï solid angles where n Œ∏ and n œï are the number of divisions in the polar and azimuthal directions in this work we have used n Œ∏ n œï 5 as our numerical results show that this provides enough resolutions for the solution of rte as mentioned earlier the challenging part of the simulation is to model the radiation source whose accuracy influences the overall prediction of the cfd model in this study the radiation profile of a known uv led was obtained by curve fitting as suggested by wu et al 37 we consider the uv led as a monochromatic semi transparent wall on which the power and direction of rays are obtained by fitting a curve on the radiation profile of a specific uv led the monochromatic source at the wavelength of 275 nm is used as a reasonable assumption since the study of ref 16 showed that this causes the maximum error of 0 3 for the 4 leds utilized in their work in fact the rays are attributed to different locations on the semi transparent wall fig 3a to find the radius of the circular semi transparent surface green circle the refraction of the rays emitted with the angle of Œ∏ max is considered from the air to the quartz window and from the quartz window to water it is also assumed that 7 of the radiative energy is dissipated by the refraction and the reflection of quartz window installed in front of the leds as reported in ref 16 although the quartz window used in their study is in the form of a tube the curvature of the radius of the tube is 50 times larger than the distance between the led die and the tube as a result the amount of energy dissipation in our case with a flat quartz window is almost similar the power of the leds is considered to be 25 mw the led radiation profile is considered as balloon shape as shown in fig 3b according to the proposed radiation profile the maximum amount of radiation is emitted at an angle of zero the amount of relative radiation intensity decreases as the polar angle increases the half viewing angle Œ∏ 1 2 is 52 5o 0 916 rad in the presented radiation profile as seen the radiation intensity sharply decreases beyond the half viewing angle and tends to almost zero therefore an approximation of zero radiation intensity can be used for the polar angles greater than this limit 33 for led used in this study the power beyond the half viewing angle is less than 6 of the total led power the relative intensity of the radiation can be defined as the intensity of radiation at any angle relative to the angle of zero as 3 re Œ∏ i Œ∏ i 0 the curve fitting for the radiation profile of the uv led used in this work fig 3b provides the relative intensity as 4 re Œ∏ 0 3446 Œ∏ 3 0 9909 Œ∏ 2 0 0724 Œ∏ 0 9986 0 Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 2 0 Œ∏ 1 2 Œ∏ œÄ 2 note that the relative intensity for the polar angles beyond the half viewing angle is set to zero the other walls of the photoreactors are considered as opaque surfaces with the uv reflectivity of 70 which is close to the uv reflectivity of aluminum at 275 nm 40 as we assume a monochromatic radiation source the reflectivity of photoreactor s material at the peak wavelength is considered the reflected beams may be specular or diffuse or a combination of these two modes the type of reflection depends on the surface material and the smoothness of the surface on smoother surfaces the reflection is closer to the specular mode in the fully specular mode the angle of reflection is exactly equal to the angle at which the beam strikes the surface however the beam is reflected evenly at all different angles in the fully diffuse mode at a higher diffuse fraction the reflection mode is closer to the diffused mode 26 in this study we have set the diffuse fraction of all inner walls to be 70 meaning that 30 of the beams are reflected in the specular mode the rest is diffuse 2 2 2 fluid flow model in most of engineering applications the fluid flow regime is turbulent in this work the reynolds number associated with the flow in the main body of photoreactors is above 10 000 for all cases so the flow is considered to be turbulent there are several approaches for the modeling of turbulent flows in many engineering problems including turbulent flows inside uv photoreactors the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans modeling has provided acceptable results 41 as a consequence the extra computational costs associated with the direct numerical simulation dns and or large eddy simulation les of turbulent flows is not essential therefore we use the system of incompressible rans equations to model the fluid flow within the photoreactors the conservation of mass and momentum equations are 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u j u i x j 1 œÅ p x i ŒΩ 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j where u is the time averaged velocity p is the time averaged pressure œÅ is the fluid density and ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid to provide a closure for the system of rans equation a turbulence model is needed to express the reynolds stresses u i u j in terms of the time averaged velocity components for this purpose we use the realizable k Œµ model which has been previously successful for the same type of flows within uv photoreactors 19 23 to consider the effect of solid walls on the turbulent flow we use the standard wall functions of k Œµ model in this way it is not essential to provide a mesh with the extra fine wall spacing which is required to capture the viscous sub layer near the walls considering that the flow is turbulent and it has jet type flow features for the configurations studied in this work we use the same turbulence model near wall mesh spacing and wall functions as the ones used for annular uv lamp photoreactors these choices have proved to be accurate for uv lamp photoreactors as we compared the flow field with piv measurements in our recent work 42 to solve the flow equations the volumetric flow rate of 1 liter per minute lpm is prescribed at the inlet such a flow rate is acceptable for most pou applications as mentioned the length of the inlet pipe is considered ten times of its diameter to ensure fully developed flow condition in addition the no slip condition is considered for photoreactor s walls the atmospheric pressure at the outlet is also prescribed 2 2 3 kinetics of inactivation to formulate the kinetics of microbial inactivation several models have been suggested 43 44 traditionally chick watson s first order kinetic model has been used for the simulation of water disinfection uv photoreactors 45 7 log n n 0 kd where n and n 0 are the instantaneous and initial number of microorganisms that have not lost replicability per unit volume k is the inactivation rate constant which is estimated from experimental data for different microorganisms and d is the uv dose the uv dose is the exposure time integral of uv intensity i which is received by each microorganism that passes through the photoreactor 8 d 0 t i dt to obtain the distribution of inactivation ratio within photoreactors in the eulerian framework a convection diffusion transport equation can be solved for r n n 0 as 42 9 r t x i u i r x i d eff r x i s where u i is the time averaged velocity components introduced in eq 6 d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient and s is the volumetric rate of destruction of microorganisms in water note that d eff is considered as ŒΩ t sc t where ŒΩ t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity and sc t is the turbulent schmidt number the molecular diffusion is negligible due to the large size of microorganisms compared to water molecules for similar flow conditions other studies suggest sc t 0 7 19 46 moreover s which works as the sink term of eq 9 can be obtained from the inactivation kinetics as 10 s ln 10 ir df dd where i is the uv radiation intensity and f is the dose response function which is attained by doing experiments on the inactivation of different microorganisms in this work we focus on e coli atcc 11229 as a common indicator microorganism the dose response function of this microorganism at the wavelength of 254 nm is given as 47 11 log n 0 n 0 2678 d d 3 7 0 8223 d 3 7 0 99094 d 3 7 considering that the uv led is modeled as a monochromatic radiation source at the wavelength of 275 nm the effective power of the led is used the effective power is computed based on the germicidal efficiency of e coli at the wavelength of 275 nm based on the action spectrum of this microorganism it should be noted that the action spectrum indicates the relative amount by which uv at different wavelengths is effective compared to 254 nm in the inactivation of a microorganism based on the action spectrum of the target microorganism of this work the germicidal efficiency is 1 01 19 meaning that the response of e coli atcc 11229 to uv at 275 nm is almost identical to uv at 254 nm to solve the transport equation of inactivation ratio eq 9 the constant inactivation ratio of one is set for the inlet and mass flux of zero is prescribed at the outlet and walls 2 3 discretization and numerical method in this study we used the commercial cfd package of ansys fluent which is a cell based finite volume solver for unstructured meshes in our simulations the working fluid is set to be water with the density of 998 2 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity of 1 003 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 the simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm has been utilized to solve the governing equation of the flow fields as noted the do model is used to solve rte a user defined scalar uds is employed for the solution of the inactivation ratio the sink term and effective diffusivity of the convection diffusion equation of inactivation ratio are introduced to the solver by user defined functions udfs the second order and second order upwind schemes are used for the pressure and convective terms of the momentum equations whereas the first order upwind and the third order monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws muscl were used for the do and microorganism transport equations respectively the governing equations are solved up until the l2 norm of the residuals drops below 10 5 except for the do model equation where the threshold is set at 10 6 fig 4 shows the flowchart of simulation for the uv led photoreactors considered in this paper 3 response surface methodology as mentioned earlier the objective of this work is to find the optimal length and radius of photoreactors in each of the six configurations introduced in section 2 1 for this purpose we employed the design exploration module of ansys software to provide the response surfaces of microbial inactivation in terms of length and radius for each of the configurations to create the response surfaces the design points must be initially determined the choice of these points can control the accuracy and speed of response surfaces among different options available in the design exploration module to generate the design points we used the optimal space filling osf design algorithm where the number of design points does not depend on the number of parameters and there is no limit to the number of samples as a result a study is required to ensure that the shape of response surfaces is independent of the number of samples in this work we tested 60 80 and 100 sampling points the differences between the response surfaces were negligible between 80 and 100 samples therefore we used 100 design points for all of the configurations in addition the max min distance algorithm was employed to maximize the minimum distance between two design points to attain a desirable coverage of the entire space after determining the design points the response surface must be created for the output of interest which is the log reduction value lrv logn 0 n of the photoreactors we used the genetic aggregation ga method for the generation of response surfaces after evaluating the output at all of the 100 points in this method the selection configuration and generation of the best response surface is automatically performed the most suited surface is selected based on genetic algorithm where the population of different response surfaces are generated in parallel and the fitness function of each surface is used to find the best one the ga response surface is obtained by the combination of several surfaces being attained by a crossover operation in the genetic algorithm the ga response surface can be written as an ensemble using a weighted average of different response surfaces meta models if all independent models constructed for a given answer have the same accuracy an acceptable form for the overall answer is a simple average of the sub models this is not usually the case as some sub models are more accurate than others therefore independent models must be multiplied by weight factors to increase the final answer s accuracy using a weighted sum formula a set of sub models to approximate the answer can be expressed as 12 y ens x i 1 n m w i y i x where y ens is the prediction of the ensemble n m is the number of response surfaces w i is the weight factor of the i th response surface and y i is the prediction obtained by the i th response surface note that the weight factors must satisfy the following conditions 13 i 1 n m w i 1 w i 0 1 i n m the accuracy of approximations can be measured using different criteria each of which can be used for a particular purpose the most common criterion is the root mean square error rmse in which the mean square deviation of the approximations from the observed values is measured to estimate the best weight factors in eq 12 the design explorer module minimizes the rmse of the design points on y ens eq 14 and also the rmse of the same design points based on the cross validation of y ens eq 15 which is known as the predicted residual error sum of squares press 14 rmse y x 1 n j 1 n m y x j y ens x j 2 15 press y ens x 1 n j 1 n m y x j y ens j x j 2 note that in eq 15 y ens j is defined as 16 y ens j x i 1 n m w i y i j x where y i j is the prediction of the i th response surface obtained without the j th design point which is used for cross validation this strategy is known as the leave one out validation technique 4 results and discussion 4 1 mesh independence study to obtain the appropriate mesh size for the simulations a mesh independence study was carried out the lrv obtained by the photoreactor was chosen as the output of interest to calculate the grid convergence index gci gci is a method of estimating the discretization error which is described as error percentage of the output for successive mesh refinements this method is considered as the extension of well known richardson s extrapolation and provides a confidence bound in which the numerical solution will likely to be using the procedure described by celik et al 48 it is possible to determine lrv in the range of lrv 1 gci lrv 1 gci with 95 confidence as a result a smaller value of gci provides a more confident measure of the output the study was conducted for u shaped configuration 1 l shaped configuration 3 and s shaped configuration 5 photoreactors with r 2 cm l 15 cm and the flow rate of 1 lpm three different meshes were used for each configuration in this study the lrv obtained on each mesh is tabulated in table 1 the gci values of 0 21 0 30 and 0 15 were obtained for the lrv of the target photoreactors which verifies that the sizing of the medium mesh in each case is good enough to obtain mesh independent results therefore we have used the same mesh spacing for all the other cases considered in this work 4 2 validation to validate the correctness of our cfd simulations we must compare the results of our model with the data available in the literature for this purpose we have chosen two validation test cases from the literature 1 a photoreactor with cross irradiation mode in which the uv led has the specifications of the led we used for our simulations 19 2 a u shaped photoreactor which works in the parallel irradiation mode and has the same flow pattern as the ones we study in this paper 49 4 2 1 cross irradiation mode keshavarzfathy and taghipour 19 conducted experimental and numerical studies on a uv led photoreactor at three different volumetric flow rates of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 lpm in this photoreactor which is schematically shown in fig 5a four leds have been installed on the body of the photoreactor to provide cross irradiation mode the photoreactor s length and diameter are 17 cm and 5 cm respectively the centers of leds are 3 2 cm apart the germicidal power for leds 1 to 4 is 17 43 10 36 12 11 and 22 19 mw respectively the radiation profile for each led is the same as fig 3b which is balloon shape with half viewing angle of 52 5o the absorption coefficient of water is 0 877 m 1 the far side wall of the photoreactor is made of plexiglass fig 5b shows the distribution of radiation intensity obtained by our cfd model inside the test photoreactor this distribution is reasonably consistent with the cfd results reported by keshavarzfathy and taghipour 19 the small discrepancy can be attributed to the finite number of discrete solid angles used in the do model first order accuracy of the numerical solution of rte and also the fact that the led power beyond the half viewing angle is ignored in our model fig 5c shows the contours of fluid velocity obtained by our model at the flow rate of 0 15 lpm in addition we compared the values of lrv computed by our model with the cfd and experimental values reported for e coli and ms2 microorganisms such a comparison is important as the effect of all important parameters in radiation and hydrodynamics is observed in this output we compared the lrv for both microorganisms as seen in fig 6 for e coli the differences between our cfd results and experimental data are 7 0 5 and 10 for the flow rates of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 lpm respectively for ms2 these differences are 7 4 and 8 8 for the flow rates of 0 25 and 0 6 lpm respectively it should be noted that our cfd simulation is subject to different sources of numerical and modeling errors and also the experiment is concerned with measurement errors and biological uncertainties as a result this amount of difference is acceptable although the difference is variable at different flow rates as stated by sozzi 23 the difference of about 20 is quite normal between the experimental and numerical results 4 2 2 parallel irradiation mode considering that the simulation accuracy is dependent upon the accuracy of flow field we also need to validate our model for a case with similar flow patterns for this purpose we chose the work by wu et al 49 in which the effect of several parameters such as led power and radiation pattern water uvt and volumetric flow rate were studied on the microbial inactivation efficiency in their work a u shaped photoreactor with the length of 100 mm is considered and the inner body of the photoreactor is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe which has uv reflectivity of 98 a single led with the radiant power of 60 mw half viewing angle of 65 and the peak wavelength of 268 nm is installed near the inlet of the photoreactor the microbial performance is evaluated for bacteriophage qŒ≤ whose dose response curve is given fig 7a shows the streamlines predicted by our model for the volumetric flow rate of 0 5 lpm which matches perfectly with the cfd results of wu et al 49 the microbial inactivation of qŒ≤ is also compared with their experimental and cfd results for four flow rates in the range of 0 5 2 0 lpm as shown in fig 7b the results validate the accuracy of our model for a u shaped photoreactor it should also be noted that for the two other configurations l and s shaped the flow is jet type and has similar features as the u shaped configuration 4 3 response surface analysis in this section the results obtained from rsm are shown to determine how the variation of dimensions in photoreactors with different configurations affects their performance it should be noted that the distribution of radiation intensity is identical in all of the configurations since there is one single led at one side of the photoreactors fig 8 shows the radiation intensity in the mid plane of a photoreactor with the length of 22 cm and radius of 1 75 cm the fluid flow is less uniform near the inlet as will be shown later there is a high velocity region near the inlet where the fluid particles experience a short residence time in all configurations if the single led is located near the inlet the uv fluence rate within the reactor is similar but the flow velocity is faster near the inlet which leads to lower uv dose of the photoreactors as a result it is more efficient to place the single led near the outlet where the flow has become uniform so that we get a more uniform distribution of uv dose between fluid s particles and thus higher microbial inactivation this suggests that the performance of configurations 1 3 and 5 is considerably higher than that of configurations 2 4 and 6 respectively therefore we do not consider rsm for configurations 2 4 and 6 fig 9 depicts the distribution of velocity magnitude and inactivation ratio in the mid plane of u s and l shaped photoreactors length of 22 cm and radius of 1 75 cm with the volumetric flow rate of 1 lpm for the u shaped and s shaped geometries there is a high velocity region near the inlet that goes from the bottom of photoreactors the high velocity is the consequence of the inlet flow which looks like a jet impinging on the body of the photoreactor the flow becomes more uniform as it goes along the reactor compared to the s shaped fig 9e the velocity magnitude of the u shaped fig 9a is more uniform as there is less variation of velocity magnitude across the photoreactor this can be attributed to the fact that the outlet is located on the top side and is farther from the high velocity region caused by the impinging jet of the inlet at the bottom of the u shaped photoreactor as a result the high velocity jet should be dissipated in a sense to provide conditions for the exit of fluid from the top as seen the placement of the single led near the outlet is beneficial since the high radiation intensity is absorbed in the region with more uniform velocity distribution this causes less uv dose scattering in the photoreactor the inactivation ratio which is one at the inlet remains high in the high velocity region and becomes almost uniform near the outlet for the l shaped geometry the inlet flow looks like an axis symmetric jet which gets dissipated along the reactor the flow becomes almost uniform after the entrance region and a narrow high velocity region appears near the outlet note that this configuration is preferred over its counterpart configuration 4 where a non symmetric flow pattern appears due to the high velocity region at the bottom of the main body similar to configuration 1 moreover the led is closer to the uniform region in configuration 3 which improves the performance as seen the inactivation ratio is high in the entrance region and then decreases uniformly along the reactor as the flow becomes uniform the higher inactivation near the wall is due to lower velocity to see how the placement of led and reactor s configuration affects the microbial inactivation the contours of inactivation ratio at the outlet of all six configurations is shown in fig 10 for r 1 75 cm and l 22 cm as seen the placement of led near the inlet makes the disinfection process less effective using rsm it is possible to see how lrv changes with the dimension of each configuration fig 11 shows the response surface obtained by lrv at the 100 design points for the range of 1 5 cm r 4 cm and 10 cm l 30 cm for the fitted surfaces the value of rmse is 0 998 0 982 and 0 999 for the u l s shaped configurations respectively to have a closer look at the performance of each configuration in different lengths and radii the contour plots of lrv are shown in fig 12 to make sure that the fitted surface is accurate the cfd results obtained at the design points located on the boundaries of the sampling space r 1 5 4 cm and l 10 30 cm are plotted as circular symbols for the u shaped photoreactor the increase in the length is advantageous as this increases the residence time inside the reactor however lrv decreases at a specific length for some values of radius and increases once again as the length increases this can be observed in fig 12a for r 3 5 cm green line where lrv decreases at about l 25 cm and increases once again at about l 28 cm to explain this behavior it is important to consider the high velocity region at the bottom of the photoreactor and its distance from the led to obtain a higher microbial disinfection it is critical to have uniform distribution of uv dose in a reactor it can be argued that the effect of that region in the overall performance is important up to a particular length l 28 cm in this case the competition between the increased residence time and decreased radiation intensity due to farther distance from the led for those fluid particles exist in the high velocity region determines lrv in this case the importance of increasing residence time dominates up to l 25 cm and the decreased uv intensity dominates in the range of 25 l 28 cm beyond this limit the high velocity region gets far from the led and falls in a dark region which receives very negligible uv intensity under this condition the increase of length always improves the performance as the contribution of the entrance region is very negligible over the total length fig 13 shows the contours of inactivation ratio for the three lengths of this case the magnitude of inactivation ratio near the inlet and the end of the high velocity region of the bottom reveals how the change of length affects the amount of disinfection in this case the variation of lrv with the photoreactor radius is also presented in fig 12b it should be noted that the increase of radius decreases the average velocity and the volumetric average radiation intensity within the photoreactor in these reactors there is a competition between the effect of increased residence time lower averaged velocity and decreased uv intensity for short reactors the increase of residence time is always the winner so that the increase of radius leads to the decrease of lrv for the l shaped photoreactor the behavior of lrv is more monotone compared to the u shaped configuration which can be attributed to the axis symmetric distribution of velocity and uv intensity in an l shaped photoreactor as is clear the increase of length increases lrv this is due to the larger residence time and more effective uv radiation near the outlet where the flow is more uniform however the length at which lrv rapidly increases changes with the radius of the photoreactor note that the change in radius affects the average velocity and more importantly the length of the entrance region it is worth mentioning that this length is dependent on the ratio of surface areas of inlet pipe and the main body at a particular length at each radius the flow becomes very uniform and the performance increases beyond this length this length is dependent on the reynolds number of the incoming flow and also the expansion ratio r r where r is the radius of the inlet pipe in our cases this length can be formulated as l e 0 016 r r 1 2 as depicted in fig 12d there is one optimal radius at each length where the interaction of averaged velocity and uv intensity provides the best performance note that the increase in radius increases the residence time but that decreases the volumetric average radiation intensity the choice of radius at a particular length can change the performance by more than 1 log of e coli at this flow rate for a short reactor l 10 cm however the entrance region does not terminate and the performance is almost independent of radius for the s shaped photoreactor the increase of length improves the performance at larger radii where the uv intensity is lower in these cases the increase of length increases the residence time in smaller radii the change of length changes lrv only slightly as the uv intensity is the key factor and the flow does not become uniform the variation of lrv with the radius of s shaped photoreactor is shown in fig 12f in shorter photoreactors the high velocity region covers a large fraction of the whole body as a result it is important to have a high uv intensity therefore the increase of radius which decreases uv intensity exacerbates the performance in addition the increase of radius provides a shortcut for water to exit the reactor without impinging on the bottom wall which slows down the fluid flow and thus lrv decreases for longer reactors however the increase of radius is effective as the residence time becomes more important 4 4 comparison of different configurations to compare the performance of different configurations the dimensions at which the highest lrv is obtained by each configuration 1 3 and 5 is selected these dimensions are given in table 2 not surprisingly the best performance of each configuration is obtained at the largest length as that provides the highest residence time but the optimal radius is different also the lrv was calculated for the same dimensions but with the opposite placement of led configurations 2 4 and 6 in each case fig 14 shows the comparison of different configurations as explained before the performance of odd number configurations is superior to their counter parts also the best performance of s shaped and u shaped configurations outperforms the l shaped configuration this can be described by the fact that the photoreactors studied in this paper are made of uv reflective material and thus the amount of uv intensity is high enough near the walls where the u and s shaped photoreactors have high velocity regions for the l shaped photoreactor the high velocity region is mostly near the center where the uv intensity is not proportionally high in other words the variation of velocity across the photoreactor is larger than the variation of uv intensity considering that the optimal performance of a photoreactor is obtained when the velocity and radiation field match perfectly we can conclude that the u and s shaped configurations are more efficient for this type of photoreactors however it is possible to have a more effective l shaped photoreactor for a specific combination of length and radius as seen the difference between two configurations may be as high as 2 log of e coli at the flow rate of 1 lpm 5 conclusions in this paper we studied the performance of cylindrical uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials and one single led six different configurations where the position of inlet outlet and led are different were investigated to evaluate the performance of each case an eulerian cfd model was used the radiation of profile of the led was simulated using a curve fitting approach where the effect of ray refraction was considered the distribution of the inactivation ratio was found by solving a convection diffusion equation in which the rate of microorganism destruction is added by a sink term the validity of the cfd model was assessed by comparing lrv at the outlet with the cfd and experimental data available for two test photoreactors in the literature for each configuration 100 design points where 1 5 cm r 4 and 10 cm l 30 cm were obtained within the search space using the max min distance algorithm to have a uniform coverage of the entire space as expected the overall performance of the photoreactors is influenced by the combination of residence time and uv radiation intensity in general it is possible to say that the effect of increasing the length is the increase of residence time and improvement of microbial inactivation however the increase of radius changes the two critical factors residence time and uv intensity in opposite directions for the radiation patterns of the led used and the structure of the photoreactors with uv reflective materials hence the performance is determined by the competition of these factors in each case our results showed that the u and s shaped configurations work better if the proper dimensions are selected this is due to the fact that the radiation intensity is high near the walls of photoreactors with reflective materials and such configurations produce high velocity jets near the wall as well nevertheless the response surface of lrv is more monotone and predictable in the case of l shaped photoreactors due to more symmetry in the flow for l shaped photoreactors the performance increases very rapidly after an entrance length above which the flow becomes very uniform in addition our results proved that the placement of led near the outlet is more effective in all of the cases this can be explained by a more uniform distribution of velocity near the led resulting a more uniform dose distribution the results showed that the choice of l 30 cm and r 4 cm enhances the microbial inactivation of the s shaped photoreactor close to 4 log of e coli for a 25 mw uv led and at the flow rate of 1 lpm the wrong placement of led near the inlet would decrease this performance down to less than 2 log of e coli for the same geometry this difference is less severe for the u and l shaped photoreactors it is also important to notice that a longer reactor is almost always beneficial due to longer residence time this can be concluded by the fact that the best case of each configuration occurs at the largest studied length declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13093,chlorination has been the traditional method of water disinfection with the advent of new technologies and significant issues encountered in chlorination physical methods gradually prevailed ultraviolet uv radiation technology is a physical disinfection method that has been improved rapidly in recent years this technology mainly based on uv mercury lamps has excellent potential to inactivate microorganisms in water however uv lamps are fragile and may cause the leakage of mercury into the environment as the extension of visible light emitting diodes led progress in solid state physics the nature friendly technology of uv leds has emerged this paper analyzes the performance of cylindrical water disinfection uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials using computational fluid dynamics cfd the response surface methodology rsm is used for shape optimization of the photoreactors working with one uv led at the flow rate of liter per minute lpm typical configurations including the u l and s shaped are examined the analyses provide the optimal radius and length of the photoreactors for different configurations the performance of photoreactors can be enhanced by more than 1 log of e coli by choosing the appropriate length and radius for each configuration also the choice of configuration and led location may affect the performance up to 2 log of e coli our results show that the u and s shaped photoreactors can outperform the l shaped for photoreactors made of uv reflective materials the right choice of length radius and led location can lead to 4 log of e coli for a s shaped photoreactor with a single 25 mw uvc led graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultraviolet light emitting diodes water disinfection point of use computational fluid dynamics response surface methodology 1 introduction water has always been one of the most important issues of humanity lack of access to potable water poses a threat to many people all around the globe 1 3 to avoid this problem disinfection technologies must be utilized to inactivate all microorganisms in water generally speaking the disinfection process is performed by two methods chemical and physical the most common disinfection method in the past was chlorination which is a chemical method however chlorine is ineffective against some pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia lamblia 4 the disinfection process with chlorine may also produce by products such as trihalomethanes thms which are harmful to human health 5 6 on the other hand some physical methods such as ultraviolet uv light radiation can inactivate many microorganisms in water without producing disinfection by products dbps 7 8 also uv rays do not change the color and odor of water and do not depend upon high dose limits which may endanger human s health 9 low or medium pressure mercury lamps are currently the most popular type of radiation sources of uv 10 these mercury lamps are typically designed in long cylindrical forms and cause inflexibility in the design of disinfection photoreactors moreover the fragility of these lamps and the presence of mercury as a toxic gas poses a threat to the disinfection process 11 12 other disadvantages of mercury lamps include their long warm up time large amount of electricity consumption and short lifespan about 10 k hours 9 13 such disadvantages have led researchers to turn their attention to other uv sources e g deuterium xenon microplasma lamps and light emitting diodes leds 14 uv leds which emerged with the recent growth in the manufacturing of semi conductors are excellent alternatives to the uv lamps due to their unique features the leds recombine electrons and holes across a junction to emit radiation at a wavelength that depends on the semi conductor s material the materials commonly used for uv leds are iii nitrides groups e g gallium nitride gan aluminum gallium nitride algan and aluminum nitride aln 15 although the cost of uv leds is higher than uv lamps their advantages promise an alternative and superior technology in drinking water disinfection 16 lower heat generation faster activation lower energy utilization and longer lifespan are the benefits of uv leds over the uv lamps 17 18 besides this technology is very suitable for the areas that are deprived of electricity because uv leds use a small amount of direct current dc electricity which can be supplied by a battery or solar cell another significant advantage is the small size of uv leds with adjustable wavelength creating many degrees of freedom for the design of disinfection photoreactors 19 in recent years experimental studies have been performed to analyze the effect of uv leds on various microorganisms 9 15 20 22 due to the high cost and long time associated with conducting experiments the computational fluid dynamics cfd can be an excellent alternative to study this emerging technology in general there are two frameworks for studying uv photoreactors with cfd the lagrangian and eulerian methods 23 both methods have been successfully employed for the simulation of photoreactors that work with uv lamps such that their predictions are not very different 24 25 likewise the photoreactors that work with uv leds have been simulated and analyzed by both methods 19 to obtain the uv radiation intensity within the field the radiative transport equation rte can be solved to obtain an accurate estimate of the radiation intensity within the photoreactor some crucial factors such as the reflection absorption and refraction of uv by different surfaces in the domain must be included 26 in this work we employ the discrete ordinate do model to find the intensity of uv radiation within the framework of our cfd solver nonetheless the most challenging part in the simulation of uv led photoreactors is the modeling of radiation source which has been tackled by several methods in previous studies one way is to find the radiation distribution from the die surface inside the package and consider the refraction reflection and absorption of uv by the quartz window typically installed in front of the die 27 28 in this strategy it is possible to estimate the radiation intensity behind the quartz window by an exhaustive procedure which is unnecessary for water disinfection usages in some other studies the distribution of uv irradiance was assumed to be uniform within the considered view angle of leds 20 29 30 which works only for some specific leds an alternative is to consider the led as a point source with lambertian radiation profile 31 32 in such a profile it is assumed that the radiant intensity varies with the cosine of the polar angle within the view angle of the led it is clear that such a strategy may not always work for arbitrary radiation profiles a more accurate way of estimating the irradiance distribution is to represent the radiation profile of uv leds by curve fitting 16 19 33 in this method it is assumed that the radiation profile of uv leds is independent of the azimuthal angle and only changes with radial distance from the point source in this work we have adopted this strategy as we have assumed that the uv led source is a small transparent surface on which the power and direction of rays are obtained by fitting a curve based on the radiation profile of a uv led the small size of uv leds prevents many size limitations in the design of photoreactors with uv lamps and increases the degree of freedom in the design of uv led photoreactors as a result the design parameters including those directly related to the led as well as the geometry of photoreactors must be optimized as an example jenny et al 34 optimized the location of uv leds the number of active leds and the choice of wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm for a low capacity uv led water disinfection photoreactor 0 2 l min 1 the performance optimization was carried out for two scenarios a dual objective optimization to maximize the microbial inactivation and to minimize the power supply a single objective optimization to minimize power supply while 2 log inactivation of e coli is surely obtained in this paper we consider the shape optimization of water disinfection uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials with cylindrical configurations the performance evaluation is obtained using an eulerian cfd model which is validated by experimental data available in the literature also we utilize the response surface methodology rsm to obtain the optimal length and radius for different configurations of the photoreactors finally the six different common configurations investigated in our work are compared to find the most appropriate one in terms of water disinfection 2 modeling and simulation structure in this section we present the major steps of our cfd simulation this includes the description of the geometries used in our work and our meshing strategy the governing equations and boundary conditions implemented to simulate different phenomena inside the photoreactors and the details of the numerical algorithms employed to solve the equations 2 1 geometry and mesh in this work we consider single led photoreactors to place the led inside the photoreactors there are two obvious choices parallel irradiation mode and cross irradiation mode 17 considering that the disinfection photoreactors must be designed in a way that all microorganisms are equally inactivated the parallel irradiation mode is closer to such an ideal condition since fluid particles will receive a more uniform amounts of uv irradiation as a result the led is placed on one of the two ends of the cylindrical photoreactor this arrangement is also easier to manufacture and is often used in commercial applications the current uv led photoreactors that are used in real applications have circular or square cross sections with an effective diameter of up to 5 cm r 2 5 cm and a length of up to 20 cm l 20 cm 19 29 35 36 38 in this research we will perform the analysis and optimization of cylindrical photoreactors to comply with the typical dimensions of photoreactors we allow the radius and length to change as 1 5 cm r 4 cm and 10 cm l 30 cm respectively such dimensions are quite suitable for small industrial point of use pou and laboratory applications in this work six common configurations of uv led photoreactors are investigated fig 1 as is common these configurations are classified as u l and s shaped photoreactors based on the arrangement of inlets and outlets it is assumed that the diameter of the inlet and outlet ports of the photoreactors is 1 cm also the length of the inlet pipes is assumed to be 10 cm to ensure that a fully developed flow enters the photoreactor to obtain the numerical solution for different variables of uv photoreactors the computational domain must be decomposed in our work we employed the ansys meshing software to tessellate the computational domain with unstructured meshes the cells are mostly of the tetrahedral type except for the five layers of prisms with the inflation rate of 1 2 which were used near the walls to capture the sharp gradient of the flow variables in the boundary layer region the number of cells is variable between 400 000 to 2400 000 depending on the volume of the photoreactors fig 2 shows the unstructured mesh used for configuration 1 schematically 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions to model the disinfection process within uv led photoreactors different governing equations must be solved with appropriate boundary conditions in this section we provide a full explanation of the governing equations and boundary conditions needed to model uv intensity fluid flow and disinfection kinetics within the photoreactors 2 2 1 radiation to obtain the distribution of uv intensity within the photoreactors the radiative transport equation rte is solved as 1 s i r s a œÉ s i r s a i b t œÉ s 0 4 œÄ œï s s i r s dœâ s where s is the direction vector i is the radiation intensity r is the position vector a is the absorption coefficient œÉ s is the scattering coefficient i b is the radiation intensity of a black body t is the local temperature œï is the phase function s is the direction vector of scattering and œâ is the spatial angle for the solution of rte two assumptions are considered first the ray scattering is ignored as disinfection is the final stage of water treatment and water soluble particles are not large enough to cause scattering second the black body spectral emissive power for photoreactor s temperature range and the uv wavelength range are negligible therefore the thermal radiation can be ignored due to the low temperature of the water and walls of photoreactors 39 as a result the modeling does not require the coupling of energy equation and rte using these assumptions rte is simplified as 2 i s i 0 s e 0 l adx where i and i 0 are the radiation intensity at the distance of l and the source respectively as described we use the do model to solve rte using ansys fluent software this method works based on a finite number of discrete solid angles which is associated with a vector direction fixed in the coordinate system the solid angle of a sphere which is 4œÄ steradian is discretized into 8n Œ∏ n œï solid angles where n Œ∏ and n œï are the number of divisions in the polar and azimuthal directions in this work we have used n Œ∏ n œï 5 as our numerical results show that this provides enough resolutions for the solution of rte as mentioned earlier the challenging part of the simulation is to model the radiation source whose accuracy influences the overall prediction of the cfd model in this study the radiation profile of a known uv led was obtained by curve fitting as suggested by wu et al 37 we consider the uv led as a monochromatic semi transparent wall on which the power and direction of rays are obtained by fitting a curve on the radiation profile of a specific uv led the monochromatic source at the wavelength of 275 nm is used as a reasonable assumption since the study of ref 16 showed that this causes the maximum error of 0 3 for the 4 leds utilized in their work in fact the rays are attributed to different locations on the semi transparent wall fig 3a to find the radius of the circular semi transparent surface green circle the refraction of the rays emitted with the angle of Œ∏ max is considered from the air to the quartz window and from the quartz window to water it is also assumed that 7 of the radiative energy is dissipated by the refraction and the reflection of quartz window installed in front of the leds as reported in ref 16 although the quartz window used in their study is in the form of a tube the curvature of the radius of the tube is 50 times larger than the distance between the led die and the tube as a result the amount of energy dissipation in our case with a flat quartz window is almost similar the power of the leds is considered to be 25 mw the led radiation profile is considered as balloon shape as shown in fig 3b according to the proposed radiation profile the maximum amount of radiation is emitted at an angle of zero the amount of relative radiation intensity decreases as the polar angle increases the half viewing angle Œ∏ 1 2 is 52 5o 0 916 rad in the presented radiation profile as seen the radiation intensity sharply decreases beyond the half viewing angle and tends to almost zero therefore an approximation of zero radiation intensity can be used for the polar angles greater than this limit 33 for led used in this study the power beyond the half viewing angle is less than 6 of the total led power the relative intensity of the radiation can be defined as the intensity of radiation at any angle relative to the angle of zero as 3 re Œ∏ i Œ∏ i 0 the curve fitting for the radiation profile of the uv led used in this work fig 3b provides the relative intensity as 4 re Œ∏ 0 3446 Œ∏ 3 0 9909 Œ∏ 2 0 0724 Œ∏ 0 9986 0 Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 2 0 Œ∏ 1 2 Œ∏ œÄ 2 note that the relative intensity for the polar angles beyond the half viewing angle is set to zero the other walls of the photoreactors are considered as opaque surfaces with the uv reflectivity of 70 which is close to the uv reflectivity of aluminum at 275 nm 40 as we assume a monochromatic radiation source the reflectivity of photoreactor s material at the peak wavelength is considered the reflected beams may be specular or diffuse or a combination of these two modes the type of reflection depends on the surface material and the smoothness of the surface on smoother surfaces the reflection is closer to the specular mode in the fully specular mode the angle of reflection is exactly equal to the angle at which the beam strikes the surface however the beam is reflected evenly at all different angles in the fully diffuse mode at a higher diffuse fraction the reflection mode is closer to the diffused mode 26 in this study we have set the diffuse fraction of all inner walls to be 70 meaning that 30 of the beams are reflected in the specular mode the rest is diffuse 2 2 2 fluid flow model in most of engineering applications the fluid flow regime is turbulent in this work the reynolds number associated with the flow in the main body of photoreactors is above 10 000 for all cases so the flow is considered to be turbulent there are several approaches for the modeling of turbulent flows in many engineering problems including turbulent flows inside uv photoreactors the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans modeling has provided acceptable results 41 as a consequence the extra computational costs associated with the direct numerical simulation dns and or large eddy simulation les of turbulent flows is not essential therefore we use the system of incompressible rans equations to model the fluid flow within the photoreactors the conservation of mass and momentum equations are 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u j u i x j 1 œÅ p x i ŒΩ 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j where u is the time averaged velocity p is the time averaged pressure œÅ is the fluid density and ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid to provide a closure for the system of rans equation a turbulence model is needed to express the reynolds stresses u i u j in terms of the time averaged velocity components for this purpose we use the realizable k Œµ model which has been previously successful for the same type of flows within uv photoreactors 19 23 to consider the effect of solid walls on the turbulent flow we use the standard wall functions of k Œµ model in this way it is not essential to provide a mesh with the extra fine wall spacing which is required to capture the viscous sub layer near the walls considering that the flow is turbulent and it has jet type flow features for the configurations studied in this work we use the same turbulence model near wall mesh spacing and wall functions as the ones used for annular uv lamp photoreactors these choices have proved to be accurate for uv lamp photoreactors as we compared the flow field with piv measurements in our recent work 42 to solve the flow equations the volumetric flow rate of 1 liter per minute lpm is prescribed at the inlet such a flow rate is acceptable for most pou applications as mentioned the length of the inlet pipe is considered ten times of its diameter to ensure fully developed flow condition in addition the no slip condition is considered for photoreactor s walls the atmospheric pressure at the outlet is also prescribed 2 2 3 kinetics of inactivation to formulate the kinetics of microbial inactivation several models have been suggested 43 44 traditionally chick watson s first order kinetic model has been used for the simulation of water disinfection uv photoreactors 45 7 log n n 0 kd where n and n 0 are the instantaneous and initial number of microorganisms that have not lost replicability per unit volume k is the inactivation rate constant which is estimated from experimental data for different microorganisms and d is the uv dose the uv dose is the exposure time integral of uv intensity i which is received by each microorganism that passes through the photoreactor 8 d 0 t i dt to obtain the distribution of inactivation ratio within photoreactors in the eulerian framework a convection diffusion transport equation can be solved for r n n 0 as 42 9 r t x i u i r x i d eff r x i s where u i is the time averaged velocity components introduced in eq 6 d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient and s is the volumetric rate of destruction of microorganisms in water note that d eff is considered as ŒΩ t sc t where ŒΩ t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity and sc t is the turbulent schmidt number the molecular diffusion is negligible due to the large size of microorganisms compared to water molecules for similar flow conditions other studies suggest sc t 0 7 19 46 moreover s which works as the sink term of eq 9 can be obtained from the inactivation kinetics as 10 s ln 10 ir df dd where i is the uv radiation intensity and f is the dose response function which is attained by doing experiments on the inactivation of different microorganisms in this work we focus on e coli atcc 11229 as a common indicator microorganism the dose response function of this microorganism at the wavelength of 254 nm is given as 47 11 log n 0 n 0 2678 d d 3 7 0 8223 d 3 7 0 99094 d 3 7 considering that the uv led is modeled as a monochromatic radiation source at the wavelength of 275 nm the effective power of the led is used the effective power is computed based on the germicidal efficiency of e coli at the wavelength of 275 nm based on the action spectrum of this microorganism it should be noted that the action spectrum indicates the relative amount by which uv at different wavelengths is effective compared to 254 nm in the inactivation of a microorganism based on the action spectrum of the target microorganism of this work the germicidal efficiency is 1 01 19 meaning that the response of e coli atcc 11229 to uv at 275 nm is almost identical to uv at 254 nm to solve the transport equation of inactivation ratio eq 9 the constant inactivation ratio of one is set for the inlet and mass flux of zero is prescribed at the outlet and walls 2 3 discretization and numerical method in this study we used the commercial cfd package of ansys fluent which is a cell based finite volume solver for unstructured meshes in our simulations the working fluid is set to be water with the density of 998 2 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity of 1 003 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 the simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm has been utilized to solve the governing equation of the flow fields as noted the do model is used to solve rte a user defined scalar uds is employed for the solution of the inactivation ratio the sink term and effective diffusivity of the convection diffusion equation of inactivation ratio are introduced to the solver by user defined functions udfs the second order and second order upwind schemes are used for the pressure and convective terms of the momentum equations whereas the first order upwind and the third order monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws muscl were used for the do and microorganism transport equations respectively the governing equations are solved up until the l2 norm of the residuals drops below 10 5 except for the do model equation where the threshold is set at 10 6 fig 4 shows the flowchart of simulation for the uv led photoreactors considered in this paper 3 response surface methodology as mentioned earlier the objective of this work is to find the optimal length and radius of photoreactors in each of the six configurations introduced in section 2 1 for this purpose we employed the design exploration module of ansys software to provide the response surfaces of microbial inactivation in terms of length and radius for each of the configurations to create the response surfaces the design points must be initially determined the choice of these points can control the accuracy and speed of response surfaces among different options available in the design exploration module to generate the design points we used the optimal space filling osf design algorithm where the number of design points does not depend on the number of parameters and there is no limit to the number of samples as a result a study is required to ensure that the shape of response surfaces is independent of the number of samples in this work we tested 60 80 and 100 sampling points the differences between the response surfaces were negligible between 80 and 100 samples therefore we used 100 design points for all of the configurations in addition the max min distance algorithm was employed to maximize the minimum distance between two design points to attain a desirable coverage of the entire space after determining the design points the response surface must be created for the output of interest which is the log reduction value lrv logn 0 n of the photoreactors we used the genetic aggregation ga method for the generation of response surfaces after evaluating the output at all of the 100 points in this method the selection configuration and generation of the best response surface is automatically performed the most suited surface is selected based on genetic algorithm where the population of different response surfaces are generated in parallel and the fitness function of each surface is used to find the best one the ga response surface is obtained by the combination of several surfaces being attained by a crossover operation in the genetic algorithm the ga response surface can be written as an ensemble using a weighted average of different response surfaces meta models if all independent models constructed for a given answer have the same accuracy an acceptable form for the overall answer is a simple average of the sub models this is not usually the case as some sub models are more accurate than others therefore independent models must be multiplied by weight factors to increase the final answer s accuracy using a weighted sum formula a set of sub models to approximate the answer can be expressed as 12 y ens x i 1 n m w i y i x where y ens is the prediction of the ensemble n m is the number of response surfaces w i is the weight factor of the i th response surface and y i is the prediction obtained by the i th response surface note that the weight factors must satisfy the following conditions 13 i 1 n m w i 1 w i 0 1 i n m the accuracy of approximations can be measured using different criteria each of which can be used for a particular purpose the most common criterion is the root mean square error rmse in which the mean square deviation of the approximations from the observed values is measured to estimate the best weight factors in eq 12 the design explorer module minimizes the rmse of the design points on y ens eq 14 and also the rmse of the same design points based on the cross validation of y ens eq 15 which is known as the predicted residual error sum of squares press 14 rmse y x 1 n j 1 n m y x j y ens x j 2 15 press y ens x 1 n j 1 n m y x j y ens j x j 2 note that in eq 15 y ens j is defined as 16 y ens j x i 1 n m w i y i j x where y i j is the prediction of the i th response surface obtained without the j th design point which is used for cross validation this strategy is known as the leave one out validation technique 4 results and discussion 4 1 mesh independence study to obtain the appropriate mesh size for the simulations a mesh independence study was carried out the lrv obtained by the photoreactor was chosen as the output of interest to calculate the grid convergence index gci gci is a method of estimating the discretization error which is described as error percentage of the output for successive mesh refinements this method is considered as the extension of well known richardson s extrapolation and provides a confidence bound in which the numerical solution will likely to be using the procedure described by celik et al 48 it is possible to determine lrv in the range of lrv 1 gci lrv 1 gci with 95 confidence as a result a smaller value of gci provides a more confident measure of the output the study was conducted for u shaped configuration 1 l shaped configuration 3 and s shaped configuration 5 photoreactors with r 2 cm l 15 cm and the flow rate of 1 lpm three different meshes were used for each configuration in this study the lrv obtained on each mesh is tabulated in table 1 the gci values of 0 21 0 30 and 0 15 were obtained for the lrv of the target photoreactors which verifies that the sizing of the medium mesh in each case is good enough to obtain mesh independent results therefore we have used the same mesh spacing for all the other cases considered in this work 4 2 validation to validate the correctness of our cfd simulations we must compare the results of our model with the data available in the literature for this purpose we have chosen two validation test cases from the literature 1 a photoreactor with cross irradiation mode in which the uv led has the specifications of the led we used for our simulations 19 2 a u shaped photoreactor which works in the parallel irradiation mode and has the same flow pattern as the ones we study in this paper 49 4 2 1 cross irradiation mode keshavarzfathy and taghipour 19 conducted experimental and numerical studies on a uv led photoreactor at three different volumetric flow rates of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 lpm in this photoreactor which is schematically shown in fig 5a four leds have been installed on the body of the photoreactor to provide cross irradiation mode the photoreactor s length and diameter are 17 cm and 5 cm respectively the centers of leds are 3 2 cm apart the germicidal power for leds 1 to 4 is 17 43 10 36 12 11 and 22 19 mw respectively the radiation profile for each led is the same as fig 3b which is balloon shape with half viewing angle of 52 5o the absorption coefficient of water is 0 877 m 1 the far side wall of the photoreactor is made of plexiglass fig 5b shows the distribution of radiation intensity obtained by our cfd model inside the test photoreactor this distribution is reasonably consistent with the cfd results reported by keshavarzfathy and taghipour 19 the small discrepancy can be attributed to the finite number of discrete solid angles used in the do model first order accuracy of the numerical solution of rte and also the fact that the led power beyond the half viewing angle is ignored in our model fig 5c shows the contours of fluid velocity obtained by our model at the flow rate of 0 15 lpm in addition we compared the values of lrv computed by our model with the cfd and experimental values reported for e coli and ms2 microorganisms such a comparison is important as the effect of all important parameters in radiation and hydrodynamics is observed in this output we compared the lrv for both microorganisms as seen in fig 6 for e coli the differences between our cfd results and experimental data are 7 0 5 and 10 for the flow rates of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 lpm respectively for ms2 these differences are 7 4 and 8 8 for the flow rates of 0 25 and 0 6 lpm respectively it should be noted that our cfd simulation is subject to different sources of numerical and modeling errors and also the experiment is concerned with measurement errors and biological uncertainties as a result this amount of difference is acceptable although the difference is variable at different flow rates as stated by sozzi 23 the difference of about 20 is quite normal between the experimental and numerical results 4 2 2 parallel irradiation mode considering that the simulation accuracy is dependent upon the accuracy of flow field we also need to validate our model for a case with similar flow patterns for this purpose we chose the work by wu et al 49 in which the effect of several parameters such as led power and radiation pattern water uvt and volumetric flow rate were studied on the microbial inactivation efficiency in their work a u shaped photoreactor with the length of 100 mm is considered and the inner body of the photoreactor is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe which has uv reflectivity of 98 a single led with the radiant power of 60 mw half viewing angle of 65 and the peak wavelength of 268 nm is installed near the inlet of the photoreactor the microbial performance is evaluated for bacteriophage qŒ≤ whose dose response curve is given fig 7a shows the streamlines predicted by our model for the volumetric flow rate of 0 5 lpm which matches perfectly with the cfd results of wu et al 49 the microbial inactivation of qŒ≤ is also compared with their experimental and cfd results for four flow rates in the range of 0 5 2 0 lpm as shown in fig 7b the results validate the accuracy of our model for a u shaped photoreactor it should also be noted that for the two other configurations l and s shaped the flow is jet type and has similar features as the u shaped configuration 4 3 response surface analysis in this section the results obtained from rsm are shown to determine how the variation of dimensions in photoreactors with different configurations affects their performance it should be noted that the distribution of radiation intensity is identical in all of the configurations since there is one single led at one side of the photoreactors fig 8 shows the radiation intensity in the mid plane of a photoreactor with the length of 22 cm and radius of 1 75 cm the fluid flow is less uniform near the inlet as will be shown later there is a high velocity region near the inlet where the fluid particles experience a short residence time in all configurations if the single led is located near the inlet the uv fluence rate within the reactor is similar but the flow velocity is faster near the inlet which leads to lower uv dose of the photoreactors as a result it is more efficient to place the single led near the outlet where the flow has become uniform so that we get a more uniform distribution of uv dose between fluid s particles and thus higher microbial inactivation this suggests that the performance of configurations 1 3 and 5 is considerably higher than that of configurations 2 4 and 6 respectively therefore we do not consider rsm for configurations 2 4 and 6 fig 9 depicts the distribution of velocity magnitude and inactivation ratio in the mid plane of u s and l shaped photoreactors length of 22 cm and radius of 1 75 cm with the volumetric flow rate of 1 lpm for the u shaped and s shaped geometries there is a high velocity region near the inlet that goes from the bottom of photoreactors the high velocity is the consequence of the inlet flow which looks like a jet impinging on the body of the photoreactor the flow becomes more uniform as it goes along the reactor compared to the s shaped fig 9e the velocity magnitude of the u shaped fig 9a is more uniform as there is less variation of velocity magnitude across the photoreactor this can be attributed to the fact that the outlet is located on the top side and is farther from the high velocity region caused by the impinging jet of the inlet at the bottom of the u shaped photoreactor as a result the high velocity jet should be dissipated in a sense to provide conditions for the exit of fluid from the top as seen the placement of the single led near the outlet is beneficial since the high radiation intensity is absorbed in the region with more uniform velocity distribution this causes less uv dose scattering in the photoreactor the inactivation ratio which is one at the inlet remains high in the high velocity region and becomes almost uniform near the outlet for the l shaped geometry the inlet flow looks like an axis symmetric jet which gets dissipated along the reactor the flow becomes almost uniform after the entrance region and a narrow high velocity region appears near the outlet note that this configuration is preferred over its counterpart configuration 4 where a non symmetric flow pattern appears due to the high velocity region at the bottom of the main body similar to configuration 1 moreover the led is closer to the uniform region in configuration 3 which improves the performance as seen the inactivation ratio is high in the entrance region and then decreases uniformly along the reactor as the flow becomes uniform the higher inactivation near the wall is due to lower velocity to see how the placement of led and reactor s configuration affects the microbial inactivation the contours of inactivation ratio at the outlet of all six configurations is shown in fig 10 for r 1 75 cm and l 22 cm as seen the placement of led near the inlet makes the disinfection process less effective using rsm it is possible to see how lrv changes with the dimension of each configuration fig 11 shows the response surface obtained by lrv at the 100 design points for the range of 1 5 cm r 4 cm and 10 cm l 30 cm for the fitted surfaces the value of rmse is 0 998 0 982 and 0 999 for the u l s shaped configurations respectively to have a closer look at the performance of each configuration in different lengths and radii the contour plots of lrv are shown in fig 12 to make sure that the fitted surface is accurate the cfd results obtained at the design points located on the boundaries of the sampling space r 1 5 4 cm and l 10 30 cm are plotted as circular symbols for the u shaped photoreactor the increase in the length is advantageous as this increases the residence time inside the reactor however lrv decreases at a specific length for some values of radius and increases once again as the length increases this can be observed in fig 12a for r 3 5 cm green line where lrv decreases at about l 25 cm and increases once again at about l 28 cm to explain this behavior it is important to consider the high velocity region at the bottom of the photoreactor and its distance from the led to obtain a higher microbial disinfection it is critical to have uniform distribution of uv dose in a reactor it can be argued that the effect of that region in the overall performance is important up to a particular length l 28 cm in this case the competition between the increased residence time and decreased radiation intensity due to farther distance from the led for those fluid particles exist in the high velocity region determines lrv in this case the importance of increasing residence time dominates up to l 25 cm and the decreased uv intensity dominates in the range of 25 l 28 cm beyond this limit the high velocity region gets far from the led and falls in a dark region which receives very negligible uv intensity under this condition the increase of length always improves the performance as the contribution of the entrance region is very negligible over the total length fig 13 shows the contours of inactivation ratio for the three lengths of this case the magnitude of inactivation ratio near the inlet and the end of the high velocity region of the bottom reveals how the change of length affects the amount of disinfection in this case the variation of lrv with the photoreactor radius is also presented in fig 12b it should be noted that the increase of radius decreases the average velocity and the volumetric average radiation intensity within the photoreactor in these reactors there is a competition between the effect of increased residence time lower averaged velocity and decreased uv intensity for short reactors the increase of residence time is always the winner so that the increase of radius leads to the decrease of lrv for the l shaped photoreactor the behavior of lrv is more monotone compared to the u shaped configuration which can be attributed to the axis symmetric distribution of velocity and uv intensity in an l shaped photoreactor as is clear the increase of length increases lrv this is due to the larger residence time and more effective uv radiation near the outlet where the flow is more uniform however the length at which lrv rapidly increases changes with the radius of the photoreactor note that the change in radius affects the average velocity and more importantly the length of the entrance region it is worth mentioning that this length is dependent on the ratio of surface areas of inlet pipe and the main body at a particular length at each radius the flow becomes very uniform and the performance increases beyond this length this length is dependent on the reynolds number of the incoming flow and also the expansion ratio r r where r is the radius of the inlet pipe in our cases this length can be formulated as l e 0 016 r r 1 2 as depicted in fig 12d there is one optimal radius at each length where the interaction of averaged velocity and uv intensity provides the best performance note that the increase in radius increases the residence time but that decreases the volumetric average radiation intensity the choice of radius at a particular length can change the performance by more than 1 log of e coli at this flow rate for a short reactor l 10 cm however the entrance region does not terminate and the performance is almost independent of radius for the s shaped photoreactor the increase of length improves the performance at larger radii where the uv intensity is lower in these cases the increase of length increases the residence time in smaller radii the change of length changes lrv only slightly as the uv intensity is the key factor and the flow does not become uniform the variation of lrv with the radius of s shaped photoreactor is shown in fig 12f in shorter photoreactors the high velocity region covers a large fraction of the whole body as a result it is important to have a high uv intensity therefore the increase of radius which decreases uv intensity exacerbates the performance in addition the increase of radius provides a shortcut for water to exit the reactor without impinging on the bottom wall which slows down the fluid flow and thus lrv decreases for longer reactors however the increase of radius is effective as the residence time becomes more important 4 4 comparison of different configurations to compare the performance of different configurations the dimensions at which the highest lrv is obtained by each configuration 1 3 and 5 is selected these dimensions are given in table 2 not surprisingly the best performance of each configuration is obtained at the largest length as that provides the highest residence time but the optimal radius is different also the lrv was calculated for the same dimensions but with the opposite placement of led configurations 2 4 and 6 in each case fig 14 shows the comparison of different configurations as explained before the performance of odd number configurations is superior to their counter parts also the best performance of s shaped and u shaped configurations outperforms the l shaped configuration this can be described by the fact that the photoreactors studied in this paper are made of uv reflective material and thus the amount of uv intensity is high enough near the walls where the u and s shaped photoreactors have high velocity regions for the l shaped photoreactor the high velocity region is mostly near the center where the uv intensity is not proportionally high in other words the variation of velocity across the photoreactor is larger than the variation of uv intensity considering that the optimal performance of a photoreactor is obtained when the velocity and radiation field match perfectly we can conclude that the u and s shaped configurations are more efficient for this type of photoreactors however it is possible to have a more effective l shaped photoreactor for a specific combination of length and radius as seen the difference between two configurations may be as high as 2 log of e coli at the flow rate of 1 lpm 5 conclusions in this paper we studied the performance of cylindrical uv led photoreactors made of uv reflective materials and one single led six different configurations where the position of inlet outlet and led are different were investigated to evaluate the performance of each case an eulerian cfd model was used the radiation of profile of the led was simulated using a curve fitting approach where the effect of ray refraction was considered the distribution of the inactivation ratio was found by solving a convection diffusion equation in which the rate of microorganism destruction is added by a sink term the validity of the cfd model was assessed by comparing lrv at the outlet with the cfd and experimental data available for two test photoreactors in the literature for each configuration 100 design points where 1 5 cm r 4 and 10 cm l 30 cm were obtained within the search space using the max min distance algorithm to have a uniform coverage of the entire space as expected the overall performance of the photoreactors is influenced by the combination of residence time and uv radiation intensity in general it is possible to say that the effect of increasing the length is the increase of residence time and improvement of microbial inactivation however the increase of radius changes the two critical factors residence time and uv intensity in opposite directions for the radiation patterns of the led used and the structure of the photoreactors with uv reflective materials hence the performance is determined by the competition of these factors in each case our results showed that the u and s shaped configurations work better if the proper dimensions are selected this is due to the fact that the radiation intensity is high near the walls of photoreactors with reflective materials and such configurations produce high velocity jets near the wall as well nevertheless the response surface of lrv is more monotone and predictable in the case of l shaped photoreactors due to more symmetry in the flow for l shaped photoreactors the performance increases very rapidly after an entrance length above which the flow becomes very uniform in addition our results proved that the placement of led near the outlet is more effective in all of the cases this can be explained by a more uniform distribution of velocity near the led resulting a more uniform dose distribution the results showed that the choice of l 30 cm and r 4 cm enhances the microbial inactivation of the s shaped photoreactor close to 4 log of e coli for a 25 mw uv led and at the flow rate of 1 lpm the wrong placement of led near the inlet would decrease this performance down to less than 2 log of e coli for the same geometry this difference is less severe for the u and l shaped photoreactors it is also important to notice that a longer reactor is almost always beneficial due to longer residence time this can be concluded by the fact that the best case of each configuration occurs at the largest studied length declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13094,one of the major focuses in the field of sewage is the development of low pressure driven and high efficiency filtration membrane particularly for removing extremely low concentration heavy metals cations a new type of polyvinyl chloride pvc blended ultrafiltration uf membrane was fabricated to reject heavy metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 from simulated waters using micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf in this research the positively charged pvc uf membrane was fabricated by blending pvc and amphiphilic poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate pmd which was in situ quaternized by methyl iodide ch3i then the pvc pmd blended membrane was fabricated via nonsolvent induced phase separation nips process the membranes pore morphology surface chemical compositions surface charge water contact angle mechanical strength and water flux were investigated in detail the influence of ph transmembrane pressure sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs concentration on the filtration of pure sdbs solution was studied sdbs was subsequently used as surfactant to remove heavy metal ions by micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf for a molar ratio of 40 1 sdbs metal cation the rejection of feed solution containing 10 ppm metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 surpassed 96 with meuf method the results showed that the prepared membrane had low pressure driven and high efficiency performance which provided a potential solution for the high efficiency removal of trace heavy metals cations keywords polyvinylchloride poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate heavy metal cations sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate micellar enhanced ultrafiltration 1 introduction heavy metal cations including zinc zn2 lead pb2 copper cu2 nickel ni2 cadmium cd2 mercury hg2 chromium cr3 and cro4 2 silver ag etc are of the greatest concern in the treatment of wastewaters because once entering the ecosystem they will persist accumulate and migrate seriously affecting living organisms health and safety 1 wastewater containing heavy metal ions from industrial production such as tanning coal refining electroplating industry metal mining and working battery industry automobile manufacturing cosmetic products leather preparation fertilizer industry photographic industry and so on is eventually discharged into the environment 2 therefore the treatment of heavy metal ions in sewage is one of crucial focuses in terms of ecological environment protection and human survival sorts of conventional technologies including the chemical precipitation liquid liquid extraction electrodialysis ion exchange and adsorption have been used to for wastewater treatment from various industrial effluents 3 however these techniques are ineffective at a large scale especially at low heavy metals concentration researchers are looking for more attractive methods to overcome some of the inherent shortcomings of the above mentioned technologies nowadays membrane technology has been widely used as an effective separation technology to remove pollutants from wastewater and has attracted more and more attention 4 membrane technologies including reverse osmosis ro 5 7 microfiltration mf 8 ultrafiltration uf 9 11 and nanofiltration nf 12 14 etc has the advantages of low investment cost high efficiency energy saving small equipment floor space selective separation and no secondary pollution it is extremely true when treating wastewater containing trace amounts of heavy metal ions as we all know ro and nf technologies are often used to effectively remove ions in sewage however high operating pressure low efficiency and high energy consumption limit their application uf membrane technology also requires pressure driven and its main advantages over ro nf are higher efficiency and lower energy consumption although membrane technology has bright application prospects in the field of wastewater treatment 15 16 there are still many problems in practical application thus researchers are still looking for better methods such as developing new membrane materials and combining membranes with other technologies etc micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf combines the micelles adsorption properties with the uf membrane retention capacity and has been proven to be a viable technology for removing low concentration pollutants from wastewater 17 the surfactants are used in sewage treatment because of its unique amphiphilicity which can change the interfacial properties of the surfaces and water 18 surfactants are amphiphilic small molecules composed of hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic segments or tails when the concentration of surfactant in the aqueous solution is higher than its critical micelle concentration cmc large aggregates called micelles are formed the choice of surfactant type mainly depend on the detailed meuf processes if heavy metal cations in sewage are to be removed negatively charged surfactants need to be chosen to form ion pair complex the ion pair complex is rejected during filtration process heavy metal cations are adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged micelles through electrostatic interaction after that these micelles together with the captured heavy metal cations are separated from wastewater through the uf membrane with suitable pore size 19 the main advantages of meuf technology are as follows i low operating pressure ii high separation efficiency iii compact equipment structure and small floor space iv low energy consumption and v recovery of heavy metals from sewage 20 most meuf research used anionic sodium dodecylsulfate sds to remove heavy metal cations in sewage 21 24 but the cmc of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs 1 2 mm is lower than that of sds 8 3 mm at 25 c generally if cmc is very high small amount of surfactant will be leached into water during the filtration process the leached surfactant increases the biological or chemical oxygen demand which will be a trouble for sewage treatment plants in addition to chemical surfactants biosurfactants are also used in the meuf process biosurfactants i e rhamnolipid have received great attention due to their low cmc biodegradable non toxic eco friendly and renewable properties 25 however the high cost of biosurfactants limit the practical application thus sdbs is selected as an anionic surfactant to remove heavy metal cations via the meuf process the meuf process used in this study to remove heavy metal cations is shown in fig 1 nowadays one of the most used membrane materials is polyvinyl chloride pvc it has the characteristic of wide sources low price stable chemical and physical properties high mechanical strength and long acid and alkali resistance 26 27 hence pvc has more advantages than other polymers in the field of membrane preparation while pvc membranes with excellent function still needs to be pursued generally it is considered feasible to endow pvc membrane charge to improve its metal ion separation ability 28 to date various methods including polymer blending coating lbl layer by layer assembly plasma modification high energy radiation grafting and so on have been widely used for pvc membrane modification 29 32 for instance zhang et al 33 produced a positively charged membrane by

into trimethylamine solution cui et al 35 manufactured positively charged pvc blended nf membrane by cross linking and quaternization although the above work is very excellent there are still something the matter with high energy consumption of high energy radiation grafting low interfacial adhesion of lbl 36 and coating 37 etc the blending of amphiphilic copolymers and membrane matrix material is a better way to improve membrane performance in the field of membrane manufacturing amphiphilic copolymer 38 contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments the hydrophobic segments are entangled with the matrices while the hydrophilic segments provide functional units for the membrane recently various porous membranes have been successfully manufactured by blending amphiphilic copolymers with commercial membrane matrix materials to improve membrane performance therefore polymer blending is selected to endow the pvc membrane with charged characteristic in this research there are electrostatic repulsion interactions between materials of the identical charge although less widely reported 18 heavy metal ions could be effectively removed by meuf though electrostatic repulsion between ions and membrane in view of this expectation a new type of strong positively charged pvc blended uf membrane was fabricated aiming to assess the performance of meuf using sdbs the positively charged membrane was fabricated by blending pvc and pmd which was in situ quaternized by methyl iodide ch3i the in situ quaternized tertiary amine groups will endow the membrane surface strong positive charge which is beneficial for improving heavy metal cations rejection due to electrostatic repulsion finally the blending uf membrane was fabricated via nonsolvent induced phase separation

respectively other solvents and reagents used were of analytical grade all solvents and reagents were used directly without further purification all the water used was deionized water 2 2 membrane preparation and characterization the pvc pmd blended membrane and the strong positively charged membrane were fabricated via nips process the formulations of casting solutions were listed in table 1 the details of membrane fabrication were as follows firstly certain amounts of pvc resin pmd peg 400 and peg 20 000 were dissolved in dmac by constant stirring at 60 c for at least 8 h until homogeneous solutions obtained after standing for 30 min the casting solution was released bubbles under centrifugation for 10 min it was then spread on dry and clean glass plate with a 250 mm thick casting knife subsequently the liquid film and the glass plate was immersed in coagulation bath i e deionized water 30 c for 10 min finally after being thoroughly rinsed with ionized water the membrane was stored in deionized water for later use the obtained pvc pmd blended membrane was named as m1 to obtain the strong positively charged membrane quaternization process using ch3i was shown in fig 1 the details were as follows pmd was dissolved in dmac and stirred continuously at 60 c for 1 h then 1 ml ch3i was added after reaction for 4 h certain amounts of pvc peg 400 and peg 20 000 were added into casting solution until a homogeneous solution formed after standing for 30 min the casting solution was released bubbles under centrifugation for 10 min the subsequent membrane fabrication via nips process was as the same as m1 the obtained quaternized membrane was named m2 the top surface bottom surface and cross sectional morphologies of dried m1 and m2 were observed by field emitting scanning electronic microscopy fesem quanta250 feg fei usa the m1 and m2 samples should be sputtered with gold layer before observation the m1 and m2 cross sections were prepared by liquid nitrogen freezing fracture technique the membranes surface roughness was measured via atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker germany the membranes surface chemical compositions were detected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa the m1 and m2 surface charge were detected by a surface electro kinetic analyzer surpass antonpaar gmbh austria ranged from ph 3 to ph 10 the results of the zeta potential were the average of three measurements potassium chloride kcl 1 mmol l 1 aqueous solution was used as testing solution during the surface zeta potential measurement the water contact angle of membrane was measured by a contact angle goniometer oca20 data physics germany at room temperature water contact angles were measured at ten different locations for the samples and averaged to minimize errors 2 3 mechanical strength measurement the mechanical strength of the membranes was measured by a universal mechanical testing machine axm350 10kn testometric co uk the thickness of the samples was measured with the calipers dried membranes were cut into rectangle strips with a dimension of 50 mm 10 mm length width and were conducted with tensile rate at 10 mm min each membrane was tested three times and the average value was taken as the final result 2 4 membrane performance measurement flux and solute rejection of the membrane were measured by a dead end uf test cell amiconxfuf04701 millipore usa 90 ml volume 15 cm2 filtration area a 400 rpm stirring rate at room temperature in all experiments membrane pure water permeability pwp l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated from the ratio of volume flux l m 2 h 1 to transmembrane pressure tmp bar various molecular weight peg solutions with concentration of 300 ppm were used to estimate the representative membranes pore sizes and their distribution according to the reference 39 different trace ions cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 10 ppm solutions were used to investigate the rejections of m1 and m2 tow towards divalent heavy metal cations the metal ion concentrations in permeate and feed solutions were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes varian 715 es agilent technologies pegs and sdbs concentrations were measured by total organic carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan solute rejection r was determined by the following formula of r 1 c p cf 100 c p and cf are the solute concentrations in permeate and feed respectively all the results were the average of three replication 2 5 membrane cleaning procedure after each meuf experiment run the membrane was cleaned thoroughly based on the following procedures 1 cleaning with deionized water without pressure until there was no foam 2 washing with an aqueous hcl solution ph 3 0 and an aqueous naoh solution ph 10 0 at 0 05 mpa for 20 min respectively 3 filtering through membrane with a large amount of deionized water again until the ph returned to neutral 4 finally measuring whether its membrane permeability was recovered to 95 of the initial flux or not otherwise continued to clean with deionized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the membranes the top surface bottom surface and cross sectional photographs of m1 and m2 observed by fesem are shown in fig 2a the top surfaces of m1 and m2 are dense at 10 000 magnification and there is no obvious pores the bottom surfaces exhibit open pores with a large number of nanopores clearly the cross section is fulfilled with sponge like asymmetrical gradient structures besides sponge like cross section including a thin skin layer and porous spongy sub layer can be seen from upper part of cross section morphology in larger magnification according to the phase separation kinetics once the liquid film was immersed in water the top surface of the film solidified immediately and then the solvent dmac and the coagulation bath deionized water were dispersed with each other resultly polymer rich regions and polymer lean regions of the film were formed however surface solidification was suppressed 40 since peg 20 000 and hydrophilic dma segments presenting in the casting solutions of the blended systems slowed the exchange rates of solvent and non solvent during phase separation consequently membrane top surface did not solidify at once resulting in the quick water permeation into the liquid film as a result the polymer lean region could not form macrovoids before the polymer rich phase gelled hence the membrane cross section preferred to form a sponge like structure 41 the prepared membranes 3d topology images are shown in fig 2b the dark areas represented the valleys on the membrane surface and the bright areas indicated the peaks on the membrane surface according to afm data the mean square roughness ra of m1 and m2 were 1 24 nm and 1 31 nm respectively indicating that the surfaces were smooth and similar pore size and its distribution of m1 and m2 were analyzed by the solute transport model which was based on pegs rejection data 39 the mean effective pore size of m1 and m2 membranes were 12 68 nm and 14 82 nm fig 3a respectively therefore m1 and m2 membranes were the ultrafiltration membranes since dma was more hydrophilic after being in situ quaternized once the liquid film was immersed in the coagulation bath deionized water more coagulation bath entered the liquid film as a result polymer lean region was enlarged in order to balance the increase in interfacial energy between the polymer rich region and the polymer lean region finally the size of the polymer lean region became larger during the liquid liquid phase separation process more coagulation bath entered the liquid film of m2 than that of m1 therefore the pore size of m2 was larger xps measurement was used to reveal the membranes surface chemical compositions and the results of chemical composition were shown in fig 3b the membranes xps spectra were similar however the weight percentage of dma groups in m2 surface layer 10 nm depth was 26 12 wt table 2 calculated from the molar content of n and cl elements and the weight percentage of dma groups in m1 surface layer was 22 72 wt which was lower than that of m2 it was found that the experimental values of the content of dma groups on the membranes surface of m1 and m2 are both higher than their theoretical values i e 13 17 wt it indicated that significant surface segregation occurred during the m1 and m2 preparation process it was mainly because the hydrophilic dma groups had a stronger affinity for water than the hydrophobic mma groups and pvc matrix during the phase separation process the dma groups migrated to the membranes surface faster than the mma groups resulting in a higher dma content on the membrane surface than the principal part after quaternization the dma groups in m2 were more hydrophilic so the content of dma groups on the surface of m2 membrane was higher than that in m1 the enrichment ratio the ratio of the dma content on the surface of the membrane to the dma content in the blended polymer of m1 and m2 were 1 73 and 1 98 respectively table 2 in order to determine the degree of quaternization the n 1 s peak in the xps spectrum of m2 was segmented and curve fitted as shown in the inset of fig 3b components with binding energies of approximately 402 7 ev and 401 9 ev belonged to n ch3 3 and n ch3 2 respectively the quaternization degree the ratio of n ch3 3 to n ch3 3 n ch3 2 of m2 was 58 58 this data quantitatively showed that the quaternization operation was effective to characterize the surface charge of the membrane the zeta potential was measured and shown in fig 4a the m1 exhibited weak positive charge and its isoelectric point was at ph 9 3 like most amino polymers 42 while m2 showed completely positive charge over the entire test ph range i e the surface zeta potential was higher than 54 mv it revealed that there were many quaternary ammonium groups on the m2 membrane the strong positive charge of the membrane could effectively enhance the electrostatic repulsion between the micelles adsorbed heavy metal cations and the membrane the hydrophilicity was characterized by measuring the water contact angle of each membrane and the results are shown in fig 4b a lower water contact angle represents the stronger hydrophilic of the membrane the results showed that the water contact angle of the pure pvc membrane was the highest i e 104 0 the water contact angles of m1 and m2 were 83 0 and 69 4 respectively suggesting that the hydrophilicity of the blend membranes had been improved moreover m2 showed a lower water contact angle i e 69 4 this difference inferred that the quaternized membrane i e m2 behaved better hydrophilicity 3 2 mechanical strength the tensile strength and elongation ratio at break were determined and shown in the table 3 the tensile strength and elongation at break of the m1 and m2 were lower than those of pvc membrane the reason was that the introduction of highly polar poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate pmd reduced the aggregative state of pvc segments in addition the introduced pmd also led to the expansion of the polymer matrix and thus chain movement increased it had been noted that the mechanical strengths of m1 and m2 were similar 3 3 permeability and ph dependence of membranes the permeability of m1 and m2 were measured under different transmembrane pressures tmp through pure water filtration experiments the experiments measured three cycles it could be seen from fig 5a and b that the permeation flux of the membranes was linearly related to the loaded tmp during the 0 5 3 bar up and down cycle indicating that the membranes had good mechanical strength and pressure resistance the pwp of m1 and m2 were 103 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 180 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively one reason was that m2 had larger pore size fig 3a and the other was that the hydrophilicity of m2 increased after quaternization which was consistent with the water contact angle data fig 4b fig 5c showed the pwp of m1 and m2 in different ph media indicating that the membranes pwp remained stable over a wide ph range 3 4 filtration of sdbs solutions the uf processes of sdbs solutions csdbs 3 cmc 3 6 mm were investigated with the parameters of ph tmp and sdbs concentration respectively ph is an important parameter that determines the nature of sdbs 18 it could be clearly seen from fig 6a that as the ph e g 3 5 6 5 7 9 and 11 increased the sdbs rejection of these two membranes increased along with the increase of ph and sdbs rejection of the membranes remained almost constant for ph values over 6 it was attributed to the decrease in the number of charged head groups at low ph resulting in a decrease in the aggregation number of sdbs micelles since the used deionized water ph was about 6 5 and for the convenience of subsequent experiments ph was set as 6 5 0 2 in the further research because an excessively high ph might cause heavy metal cations to precipitate in the form of oxyhydroxides hydroxides or oxides 43 fig 6b showed that the flux values of sdbs solution were 70 l m 2 h 1 and 130 l m 2 h 1 for m1 and m2 respectively then tmp was changed to research the removal ability of sdbs as shown in table 4 higher tmp resulted in sdbs higher removal rate at low sdbs concentrations about 0 5 cmc when the sdbs concentration exceeded 50 cmc the effect of tmp on the removal rate of sdbs was negligible this tendency was attributed to the phenomenon of concentration polarization and the accumulation of retained micelles on the membrane surface the adhesion of sdbs surfactant monomers to the membrane surface increases with the increase of tmp it caused the formation of a thicker filtering cake on the membrane surface at higher applied pressures thereby increasing the rejection 44 on the other hand under the action of pressure gradient unbalanced charge distribution was formed on both sides of the membrane as a result the total ions concentration near the membrane surface and osmotic pressure increased the streaming potential that depended on tmp was generated it might improve the sdbs rejection according to table 4 with sdbs concentration increasing sdbs rejection of m2 increased from 13 33 for sdbs 0 5 cmc to 99 14 for sdbs 100 cmc at 1 bar theoretically when the concentration of sdbs is lower than its cmc surfactant does not form micelles in the bulk solution and exists in the form of monomers however as the initial concentration of sdbs increased e g from 0 5 cmc to 1 cmc its rejection increased rapidly e g at 3 bar from 21 19 to 90 13 for m1 from 23 22 to 91 95 for m2 the reason for this unusual behavior were as follows when the concentration was lower than cmc sdbs might form micelles near the membrane surface due to the hydrophilicity and charge of the membrane and concentration polarization when surfactant concentration was 10 cmc high sdbs rejection 95 was obtained which was probably due to the size of the sdbs micelles larger than that of the membrane pores 3 5 cadmium removal from solution after comprehensively studying the relationship between sdbs rejection behavior and concentration tmp the removal of heavy metal ions as typical pollutants was then investigated here cadmium ion cd2 was first studied as an sample where the concentration of cd2 was 10 ppm about 0 089 mm and the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was varied from 0 to 50 1 cd2 ions rejection was related to the solution ph value that was because sdbs micelles could not efficiently bind to cd2 ions due to the competitive adsorption of h and cd2 at low ph while the heavy metal cations were prone to precipitate at high ph 44 thus the filtration experiments were operated at ph 6 5 for the m1 and m2 membranes the results of cd2 rejection was shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a cd2 removal increased with increasing of the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 for both membranes and the removal efficiency of m2 was higher than that of m1 cd2 rejections for m2 membrane were 98 3 and 99 8 when the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was 40 1 and 50 1 respectively it could be seen from fig 7b that the flux of both membranes decreased as the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 increased the flux of m1 decreased from 103 l m 2 h 1 to 66 l m 2 h 1 while the flux of m2 decreased from 180 l m 2 h 1 to 121 l m 2 h 1 when the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was 0 50 1 3 6 removal of heavy metal ion after studying the meuf of cd2 with sdbs the removal of other heavy metal ions e g co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 was also investigated via meuf using sdbs to compare the removal performance of the proposed membranes for different divalent metal cations all divalent metal cations used their nitrate hydrate to eliminate the possible influence of different anions on the results the filtration experiment was operated at ph 6 5 and the molar ratio of sdbs to divalent metal cation was set at 0 and 40 1 fig 8 as already discussed for cd2 the divalent metal cation rejection of uf membrane was low in the absence of the surfactant regardless of the absence or presence of sdbs surfactant the rejection of m1 for divalent metal cations was lower than that of m2 which was due to the electrostatic repulsion between strongly positively charged m2 and divalent metal cations or the micelles that adsorbed the divalent metal cations for m2 membrane when the molar ratio of sdbs to divalent metal cation was 40 1 divalent metal cation rejections were in all cases higher than 96 that was co2 96 1 ni2 96 8 cu2 98 1 and zn2 97 4 while the flux values were around 90 l m 2 h 1 that clearly showed that m2 membrane had excellent performance to remove trace metal cations via sdbs micellar enhanced ultrafiltration the heavy metal ions removal effect of m2 via meuf in this research was compared with the previous related work the results were listed in table 5 it was found that the involved membranes had lower rejection of heavy metal ions in refs 45 47 the works mentioned in refs 46 48 49 had higher rejection for heavy metal ions but the cations concentration was high and the use of sds indicated higher amount of surfactant in the water phase due to its high cmc which led to sub pollution although the results reported in refs 19 50 had high rejection the use of biosurfactants rhl meant higher costs however m2 membrane obtained in this research possessed high rejection of trace heavy metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 at lower operated pressure and reduced secondary pollution due to the use of sdbs the comparison primarily infers that the obtained positively charged pvc membrane m2 has excellent separation performance for trace heavy metal cations 4 conclusions this study provided a novel membrane for the separation of trace metal cations from wastewaters via meuf process the positively charged pvc uf membrane m2 was facilely fabricated by in situ quaternization this membrane possessed strong positive charge with the mean pore size of 14 82 nm m2 membrane could effectively remove different trace divalent metal cations 10 ppm cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 from single divalent cations simulated solution under low operating pressure all of those divalent metal cations rejection was over 96 and the water fluxes were obtained 90 l m 2 h 1 the high rejection and flux advantages of m2 indicated its practical application in removing trace heavy metal cations from sewage via meuf therefore m2 had the characteristics of low energy consumption and high removal efficiency and had a better application prospect this research provided a new method for removing heavy metal ions in sewage via meuf declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13094,one of the major focuses in the field of sewage is the development of low pressure driven and high efficiency filtration membrane particularly for removing extremely low concentration heavy metals cations a new type of polyvinyl chloride pvc blended ultrafiltration uf membrane was fabricated to reject heavy metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 from simulated waters using micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf in this research the positively charged pvc uf membrane was fabricated by blending pvc and amphiphilic poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate pmd which was in situ quaternized by methyl iodide ch3i then the pvc pmd blended membrane was fabricated via nonsolvent induced phase separation nips process the membranes pore morphology surface chemical compositions surface charge water contact angle mechanical strength and water flux were investigated in detail the influence of ph transmembrane pressure sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs concentration on the filtration of pure sdbs solution was studied sdbs was subsequently used as surfactant to remove heavy metal ions by micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf for a molar ratio of 40 1 sdbs metal cation the rejection of feed solution containing 10 ppm metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 surpassed 96 with meuf method the results showed that the prepared membrane had low pressure driven and high efficiency performance which provided a potential solution for the high efficiency removal of trace heavy metals cations keywords polyvinylchloride poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate heavy metal cations sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate micellar enhanced ultrafiltration 1 introduction heavy metal cations including zinc zn2 lead pb2 copper cu2 nickel ni2 cadmium cd2 mercury hg2 chromium cr3 and cro4 2 silver ag etc are of the greatest concern in the treatment of wastewaters because once entering the ecosystem they will persist accumulate and migrate seriously affecting living organisms health and safety 1 wastewater containing heavy metal ions from industrial production such as tanning coal refining electroplating industry metal mining and working battery industry automobile manufacturing cosmetic products leather preparation fertilizer industry photographic industry and so on is eventually discharged into the environment 2 therefore the treatment of heavy metal ions in sewage is one of crucial focuses in terms of ecological environment protection and human survival sorts of conventional technologies including the chemical precipitation liquid liquid extraction electrodialysis ion exchange and adsorption have been used to for wastewater treatment from various industrial effluents 3 however these techniques are ineffective at a large scale especially at low heavy metals concentration researchers are looking for more attractive methods to overcome some of the inherent shortcomings of the above mentioned technologies nowadays membrane technology has been widely used as an effective separation technology to remove pollutants from wastewater and has attracted more and more attention 4 membrane technologies including reverse osmosis ro 5 7 microfiltration mf 8 ultrafiltration uf 9 11 and nanofiltration nf 12 14 etc has the advantages of low investment cost high efficiency energy saving small equipment floor space selective separation and no secondary pollution it is extremely true when treating wastewater containing trace amounts of heavy metal ions as we all know ro and nf technologies are often used to effectively remove ions in sewage however high operating pressure low efficiency and high energy consumption limit their application uf membrane technology also requires pressure driven and its main advantages over ro nf are higher efficiency and lower energy consumption although membrane technology has bright application prospects in the field of wastewater treatment 15 16 there are still many problems in practical application thus researchers are still looking for better methods such as developing new membrane materials and combining membranes with other technologies etc micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf combines the micelles adsorption properties with the uf membrane retention capacity and has been proven to be a viable technology for removing low concentration pollutants from wastewater 17 the surfactants are used in sewage treatment because of its unique amphiphilicity which can change the interfacial properties of the surfaces and water 18 surfactants are amphiphilic small molecules composed of hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic segments or tails when the concentration of surfactant in the aqueous solution is higher than its critical micelle concentration cmc large aggregates called micelles are formed the choice of surfactant type mainly depend on the detailed meuf processes if heavy metal cations in sewage are to be removed negatively charged surfactants need to be chosen to form ion pair complex the ion pair complex is rejected during filtration process heavy metal cations are adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged micelles through electrostatic interaction after that these micelles together with the captured heavy metal cations are separated from wastewater through the uf membrane with suitable pore size 19 the main advantages of meuf technology are as follows i low operating pressure ii high separation efficiency iii compact equipment structure and small floor space iv low energy consumption and v recovery of heavy metals from sewage 20 most meuf research used anionic sodium dodecylsulfate sds to remove heavy metal cations in sewage 21 24 but the cmc of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs 1 2 mm is lower than that of sds 8 3 mm at 25 c generally if cmc is very high small amount of surfactant will be leached into water during the filtration process the leached surfactant increases the biological or chemical oxygen demand which will be a trouble for sewage treatment plants in addition to chemical surfactants biosurfactants are also used in the meuf process biosurfactants i e rhamnolipid have received great attention due to their low cmc biodegradable non toxic eco friendly and renewable properties 25 however the high cost of biosurfactants limit the practical application thus sdbs is selected as an anionic surfactant to remove heavy metal cations via the meuf process the meuf process used in this study to remove heavy metal cations is shown in fig 1 nowadays one of the most used membrane materials is polyvinyl chloride pvc it has the characteristic of wide sources low price stable chemical and physical properties high mechanical strength and long acid and alkali resistance 26 27 hence pvc has more advantages than other polymers in the field of membrane preparation while pvc membranes with excellent function still needs to be pursued generally it is considered feasible to endow pvc membrane charge to improve its metal ion separation ability 28 to date various methods including polymer blending coating lbl layer by layer assembly plasma modification high energy radiation grafting and so on have been widely used for pvc membrane modification 29 32 for instance zhang et al 33 produced a positively charged membrane by polydopamine biomimetic adhesion and grafting poly ethylene imine on the surface of polyethersulfone psf wu et al 34 prepared a positively charged quaternized pvc uf membrane by immersing pvc membrane into trimethylamine solution cui et al 35 manufactured positively charged pvc blended nf membrane by cross linking and quaternization although the above work is very excellent there are still something the matter with high energy consumption of high energy radiation grafting low interfacial adhesion of lbl 36 and coating 37 etc the blending of amphiphilic copolymers and membrane matrix material is a better way to improve membrane performance in the field of membrane manufacturing amphiphilic copolymer 38 contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments the hydrophobic segments are entangled with the matrices while the hydrophilic segments provide functional units for the membrane recently various porous membranes have been successfully manufactured by blending amphiphilic copolymers with commercial membrane matrix materials to improve membrane performance therefore polymer blending is selected to endow the pvc membrane with charged characteristic in this research there are electrostatic repulsion interactions between materials of the identical charge although less widely reported 18 heavy metal ions could be effectively removed by meuf though electrostatic repulsion between ions and membrane in view of this expectation a new type of strong positively charged pvc blended uf membrane was fabricated aiming to assess the performance of meuf using sdbs the positively charged membrane was fabricated by blending pvc and pmd which was in situ quaternized by methyl iodide ch3i the in situ quaternized tertiary amine groups will endow the membrane surface strong positive charge which is beneficial for improving heavy metal cations rejection due to electrostatic repulsion finally the blending uf membrane was fabricated via nonsolvent induced phase separation

preparation and characterization the pvc pmd blended membrane and the strong positively charged membrane were fabricated via nips process the formulations of casting solutions were listed in table 1 the details of membrane fabrication were as follows firstly certain amounts of pvc resin pmd peg 400 and peg 20 000 were dissolved in dmac by constant stirring at 60 c for at least 8 h until homogeneous solutions obtained after standing for 30 min the casting solution was released bubbles under centrifugation for 10 min it was then spread on dry and clean glass plate with a 250 mm thick

membrane was stored in deionized water for later use the obtained pvc pmd blended membrane was named as m1 to obtain the strong positively charged membrane quaternization process using ch3i was shown

10kn testometric co uk the thickness of the samples was measured with the calipers dried membranes were cut into rectangle strips with a dimension of 50 mm 10 mm length width and were conducted with tensile rate at 10 mm min each membrane was tested three times and the average value was taken as the final result 2 4 membrane performance measurement flux and solute rejection of the membrane were measured by a dead end uf test cell amiconxfuf04701 millipore usa 90 ml volume 15 cm2 filtration area a 400 rpm stirring rate at room temperature in all experiments membrane pure water permeability pwp l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated from the ratio of volume flux l m 2 h 1 to transmembrane pressure tmp bar various molecular weight peg solutions with concentration of 300 ppm were used to estimate the representative membranes pore sizes and their distribution according to the reference 39 different trace ions cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 10 ppm solutions were used to investigate the rejections of m1 and m2 tow towards divalent heavy metal cations the metal ion concentrations in permeate and feed solutions were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes varian 715 es agilent technologies pegs and sdbs concentrations were measured by total organic carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan solute rejection r was determined by the following formula of r 1 c p cf 100 c p and cf are the solute concentrations in permeate and feed respectively all the results were the average of three replication 2 5 membrane cleaning procedure after each meuf experiment run the membrane was cleaned thoroughly based on the following procedures 1 cleaning with deionized water without pressure until there was no foam 2 washing with an aqueous hcl solution ph 3 0 and an aqueous naoh solution ph 10 0 at 0 05 mpa for 20 min respectively 3 filtering through membrane with a large amount of deionized water again until the ph returned to neutral 4 finally measuring whether its membrane permeability was recovered to 95 of the initial flux or not otherwise continued to clean with deionized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the membranes the top surface bottom surface and cross sectional photographs of m1 and m2 observed by fesem are shown in fig 2a the top surfaces of m1 and m2 are dense at 10 000 magnification and there is no obvious pores the bottom surfaces exhibit open pores with a large number of nanopores clearly the cross section is fulfilled with sponge like asymmetrical gradient structures besides sponge like cross section including a thin skin layer and porous spongy sub layer can be seen from upper part of cross section morphology in larger magnification according to the phase separation kinetics once the liquid film was immersed in water the top surface of the film solidified immediately and then the solvent dmac and the coagulation bath deionized water were dispersed with each other resultly polymer rich regions and polymer lean regions of the film were formed however surface solidification was suppressed 40 since peg 20 000 and hydrophilic dma segments presenting in the casting solutions of the blended systems slowed the exchange rates of solvent and non solvent during phase separation consequently membrane top surface did not solidify at once resulting in the quick water permeation into the liquid film as a result the polymer lean region could not form macrovoids before the polymer rich phase gelled hence the membrane cross section preferred to form a sponge like structure 41 the prepared membranes 3d topology images are shown in fig 2b the dark areas represented the valleys on the membrane surface and the bright areas indicated the peaks on the membrane surface according to afm data the mean square roughness ra of m1 and m2 were 1 24 nm and 1 31 nm respectively indicating that the surfaces were smooth and similar pore size and its distribution of m1 and m2 were analyzed by the solute transport model which was based on pegs rejection data 39 the mean effective pore size of m1 and m2 membranes were 12 68 nm and 14 82 nm fig 3a respectively therefore m1 and m2 membranes were the ultrafiltration membranes since dma was more hydrophilic after being in situ quaternized once the liquid film was immersed in the coagulation bath deionized water more coagulation bath entered the liquid film as a result polymer lean region was enlarged in order to balance the increase in interfacial energy between the polymer rich region and the polymer lean region finally the size of the polymer lean region became larger during the liquid liquid phase separation process more coagulation bath entered the liquid film of m2 than that of m1 therefore the pore size of m2 was larger xps measurement was used to reveal the membranes surface chemical compositions and the results of chemical composition were shown in fig 3b the membranes xps spectra were similar however the weight percentage of dma groups in m2 surface layer 10 nm depth was 26 12 wt table 2 calculated from the molar content of n and cl elements and the weight percentage of dma groups in m1 surface layer was 22 72 wt which was lower than that of m2 it was found that the experimental values of the content of dma groups on the membranes surface of m1 and m2 are both higher than their theoretical values i e 13 17 wt it indicated that significant surface segregation occurred during the m1 and m2 preparation process it was mainly because the hydrophilic dma groups had a stronger affinity for water than the hydrophobic mma groups and pvc matrix during the phase separation process the dma groups migrated to the membranes surface faster than the mma groups resulting in a higher dma content on the membrane surface than the principal part after quaternization the dma groups in m2 were more hydrophilic so the content of dma groups on the surface of m2 membrane was higher than that in m1 the enrichment ratio the ratio of the dma content on the surface of the membrane to the dma content in the blended polymer of m1 and m2 were 1 73 and 1 98 respectively table 2 in order to determine the degree of quaternization the n 1 s peak in the xps spectrum of m2 was segmented and curve fitted as shown in the inset of fig 3b components with binding energies of approximately 402 7 ev and 401 9 ev belonged to n ch3 3 and n ch3 2 respectively the quaternization degree the ratio of n ch3 3 to n ch3 3 n ch3 2 of m2 was 58 58 this data quantitatively showed that the quaternization operation was effective to characterize the surface charge of the membrane the zeta potential was measured and shown in fig 4a the m1 exhibited weak positive charge and its isoelectric point was at ph 9 3 like most amino polymers 42 while m2 showed completely positive charge over the entire test ph range i e the surface zeta potential was higher than 54 mv it revealed that there were many quaternary ammonium groups on the m2 membrane the strong positive charge of the membrane could effectively enhance the electrostatic repulsion between the micelles adsorbed heavy metal cations and the membrane the hydrophilicity was characterized by measuring the water contact angle of each membrane and the results are shown in fig 4b a lower water contact angle represents the stronger hydrophilic of the membrane the results showed that the water contact angle of the pure pvc membrane was the highest i e 104 0 the water contact angles of m1 and m2 were 83 0 and 69 4 respectively suggesting that the hydrophilicity of the blend membranes had been improved moreover m2 showed a lower water contact angle i e 69 4 this difference inferred that the quaternized membrane i e m2 behaved better hydrophilicity 3 2 mechanical strength the tensile strength and elongation ratio at break were determined and shown in the table 3 the tensile strength and elongation at break of the m1 and m2 were lower than those of pvc membrane the reason was that the introduction of highly polar poly methyl methacrylate co dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate pmd reduced the aggregative state of pvc segments in addition the introduced pmd also led to the expansion of the polymer matrix and thus chain movement increased it had been noted that the mechanical strengths of m1 and m2 were similar 3 3 permeability and ph dependence of membranes the permeability of m1 and m2 were measured under different transmembrane pressures tmp through pure water filtration experiments the experiments measured three cycles it could be seen from fig 5a and b that the permeation flux of the membranes was linearly related to the loaded tmp during the 0 5 3 bar up and down cycle indicating that the membranes had good mechanical strength and pressure resistance the pwp of m1 and m2 were 103 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 180 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively one reason was that m2 had larger pore size fig 3a and the other was that the hydrophilicity of m2 increased after quaternization which was consistent with the water contact angle data fig 4b fig 5c showed the pwp of m1 and m2 in different ph media indicating that the membranes pwp remained stable over a wide ph range 3 4 filtration of sdbs solutions the uf processes of sdbs solutions csdbs 3 cmc 3 6 mm were investigated with the parameters of ph tmp and sdbs concentration respectively ph is an important parameter that determines the nature of sdbs 18 it could be clearly seen from fig 6a that as the ph e g 3 5 6 5 7 9 and 11 increased the sdbs rejection of these two membranes increased along with the increase of ph and sdbs rejection of the membranes remained almost constant for ph values over 6 it was attributed to the decrease in the number of charged head groups at low ph resulting in a decrease in the aggregation number of sdbs micelles since the used deionized water ph was about 6 5 and for the convenience of subsequent experiments ph was set as 6 5 0 2 in the further research because an excessively high ph might cause heavy metal cations to precipitate in the form of oxyhydroxides hydroxides or oxides 43 fig 6b showed that the flux values of sdbs solution were 70 l m 2 h 1 and 130 l m 2 h 1 for m1 and m2 respectively then tmp was changed to research the removal ability of sdbs as shown in table 4 higher tmp resulted in sdbs higher removal rate at low sdbs concentrations about 0 5 cmc when the sdbs concentration exceeded 50 cmc the effect of tmp on the removal rate of sdbs was negligible this tendency was attributed to the phenomenon of concentration polarization and the accumulation of retained micelles on the membrane surface the adhesion of sdbs surfactant monomers to the membrane surface increases with the increase of tmp it caused the formation of a thicker filtering cake on the membrane surface at higher applied pressures thereby increasing the rejection 44 on the other hand under the action of pressure gradient unbalanced charge distribution was formed on both sides of the membrane as a result the total ions concentration near the membrane surface and osmotic pressure increased the streaming potential that depended on tmp was generated it might improve the sdbs rejection according to table 4 with sdbs concentration increasing sdbs rejection of m2 increased from 13 33 for sdbs 0 5 cmc to 99 14 for sdbs 100 cmc at 1 bar theoretically when the concentration of sdbs is lower than its cmc surfactant does not form micelles in the bulk solution and exists in the form of monomers however as the initial concentration of sdbs increased e g from 0 5 cmc to 1 cmc its rejection increased rapidly e g at 3 bar from 21 19 to 90 13 for m1 from 23 22 to 91 95 for m2 the reason for this unusual behavior were as follows when the concentration was lower than cmc sdbs might form micelles near the membrane surface due to the hydrophilicity and charge of the membrane and concentration polarization when surfactant concentration was 10 cmc high sdbs rejection 95 was obtained which was probably due to the size of the sdbs micelles larger than that of the membrane pores 3 5 cadmium removal from solution after comprehensively studying the relationship between sdbs rejection behavior and concentration tmp the removal of heavy metal ions as typical pollutants was then investigated here cadmium ion cd2 was first studied as an sample where the concentration of cd2 was 10 ppm about 0 089 mm and the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was varied from 0 to 50 1 cd2 ions rejection was related to the solution ph value that was because sdbs micelles could not efficiently bind to cd2 ions due to the competitive adsorption of h and cd2 at low ph while the heavy metal cations were prone to precipitate at high ph 44 thus the filtration experiments were operated at ph 6 5 for the m1 and m2 membranes the results of cd2 rejection was shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a cd2 removal increased with increasing of the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 for both membranes and the removal efficiency of m2 was higher than that of m1 cd2 rejections for m2 membrane were 98 3 and 99 8 when the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was 40 1 and 50 1 respectively it could be seen from fig 7b that the flux of both membranes decreased as the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 increased the flux of m1 decreased from 103 l m 2 h 1 to 66 l m 2 h 1 while the flux of m2 decreased from 180 l m 2 h 1 to 121 l m 2 h 1 when the molar ratio of sdbs to cd2 was 0 50 1 3 6 removal of heavy metal ion after studying the meuf of cd2 with sdbs the removal of other heavy metal ions e g co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 was also investigated via meuf using sdbs to compare the removal performance of the proposed membranes for different divalent metal cations all divalent metal cations used their nitrate hydrate to eliminate the possible influence of different anions on the results the filtration experiment was operated at ph 6 5 and the molar ratio of sdbs to divalent metal cation was set at 0 and 40 1 fig 8 as already discussed for cd2 the divalent metal cation rejection of uf membrane was low in the absence of the surfactant regardless of the absence or presence of sdbs surfactant the rejection of m1 for divalent metal cations was lower than that of m2 which was due to the electrostatic repulsion between strongly positively charged m2 and divalent metal cations or the micelles that adsorbed the divalent metal cations for m2 membrane when the molar ratio of sdbs to divalent metal cation was 40 1 divalent metal cation rejections were in all cases higher than 96 that was co2 96 1 ni2 96 8 cu2 98 1 and zn2 97 4 while the flux values were around 90 l m 2 h 1 that clearly showed that m2 membrane had excellent performance to remove trace metal cations via sdbs micellar enhanced ultrafiltration the heavy metal ions removal effect of m2 via meuf in this research was compared with the previous related work the results were listed in table 5 it was found that the involved membranes had lower rejection of heavy metal ions in refs 45 47 the works mentioned in refs 46 48 49 had higher rejection for heavy metal ions but the cations concentration was high and the use of sds indicated higher amount of surfactant in the water phase due to its high cmc which led to sub pollution although the results reported in refs 19 50 had high rejection the use of biosurfactants rhl meant higher costs however m2 membrane obtained in this research possessed high rejection of trace heavy metal cations e g cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 at lower operated pressure and reduced secondary pollution due to the use of sdbs the comparison primarily infers that the obtained positively charged pvc membrane m2 has excellent separation performance for trace heavy metal cations 4 conclusions this study provided a novel membrane for the separation of trace metal cations from wastewaters via meuf process the positively charged pvc uf membrane m2 was facilely fabricated by in situ quaternization this membrane possessed strong positive charge with the mean pore size of 14 82 nm m2 membrane could effectively remove different trace divalent metal cations 10 ppm cd2 co2 ni2 cu2 and zn2 from single divalent cations simulated solution under low operating pressure all of those divalent metal cations rejection was over 96 and the water fluxes were obtained 90 l m 2 h 1 the high rejection and flux advantages of m2 indicated its practical application in removing trace heavy metal cations from sewage via meuf therefore m2 had the characteristics of low energy consumption and high removal efficiency and had a better application prospect this research provided a new method for removing heavy metal ions in sewage via meuf declaration of competing interest the authors declare
