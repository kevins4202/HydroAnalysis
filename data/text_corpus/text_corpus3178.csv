15890,here we present an improved water quality index wqi model for assessment of coastal water quality using cork harbour ireland as the case study the model involves the usual four wqi components selection of water quality indicators for inclusion sub indexing of indicator values sub index weighting and sub index aggregation with improvements to make the approach more objective and data driven and less susceptible to eclipsing and ambiguity errors the model uses the machine learning algorithm xgboost to rank and select water quality indicators for inclusion based on relative importance to overall water quality status of the ten indicators for which data were available transparency dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen bod5 chlorophyll temperature and orthophosphate were selected for summer while total organic nitrogen dissolved inorganic nitrogen ph transparency and dissolved oxygen were selected for winter linear interpolation functions developed using national recommended guideline values for coastal water quality are used for sub indexing of water quality indicators and the xgboost rankings are used in combination with the rank order centroid weighting method to determine sub index weight values eight sub index aggregation functions were tested five from existing wqi models and three proposed by the authors the computed indices were compared with those obtained using a multiple linear regression mlr approach and r2 and rmse used as indicators of aggregation function performance the weighted quadratic mean function r2 0 91 rmse 4 4 for summer r2 0 97 rmse 3 1 for winter and the unweighted arithmetic mean function r2 0 92 rmse 3 2 for summer r2 0 97 rmse 3 2 for winter proposed by the authors were identified as the best functions and showed reduced eclipsing and ambiguity problems compared to the others graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword water quality water quality index model coastal waters machine learning algorithm rank order centroid method aggregation function 1 introduction surface water quality poses significant environmental sociological and economic risks in many parts of the world as such sustainable management of water resource has become a challenge of critical importance due to population growth industrialisation and urbanisation observed over many decades freshwater usage and wastewater production have significantly increased javed et al 2017 uddin et al 2018 both human activities and natural processes have caused a continuous degradation of surface water quality in recent decades many countries have adopted a range of policies and guidelines to manage surface water quality and provide more effective water resource management in order to reverse this negative trend member states of the european union eu for example adopted the water framework directive wfd in 2000 and it has been an effective instrument for the management of the quality of water and its ecosystem carsten von der ohe et al 2007 zotou et al 2018 the wfd envisaged the achievement of at least a good environmental status of all waterbodies such as coastal and transitional water rivers and lakes by 2015 carsten von der ohe et al 2007 epa 2001 the wfd and other similar frameworks rely on assessment of water quality in recent years a range of tools and techniques has been developed to assess the quality of surface waters and diagnose the health of aquatic ecosystems water quality index wqi models are an example wqi models use mathematical algorithms to convert available water quality indicator monitoring data into a single number which can be used as a measure of water quality the method is relatively easy to apply and its results are easy to interpret by both professionals and non experts abbasi and abbasi 2012 nives 1999 sutadian et al 2018 uddin et al 2021 wqi models typically consist of four components water quality indicator selection sub indexing indicator weighting and index aggregation over the years some components of wqi models have been modified and or newly developed an extensive review of existing wqi models and their evolution is presented in uddin et al 2021 along with a critical discussion of model structures applications sources of model uncertainty and eclipsing problems indicator selection and sub index weighting are two of the prime sources of uncertainty in the implementation of a wqi model sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 uddin et al 2022a traditionally both have been conducted based either on a literature review of the importance and contribution of a given indicator to the overall water quality lumb et al 2011a or on the opinions and judgements of experts sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 however these approaches have received much criticism as they are overly complex and rather subjective abbasi and abbasi 2012 they can lead to inclusion of irrelevant indicators or omission of important ones and to the attribution of weightings that are not truly reflective of real world indicator importance determination of weightings is particularly open to error while a decisionmaker may be quite comfortable ranking indicators based on their relative importance they will likely struggle with the precision imposed by the eliciting of exact weights this is true even for a group of experts who may struggle to agree on a ranking of indicators never mind precise weightings recently some studies have used more objective mathematical approaches for indicator selection such as logistic regression models uddin et al 2022b ewaid et al 2018 feng et al 2018 huan et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2017 and machine learning algorithms azhar and thomas 2019 das et al 2017 jović et al 2015 momenzadeh et al 2019 here we use the extreme gradient boosting xgboost machine learning algorithm to rank indicators based on their measured values and influence on water quality status indicator selection and weightings are then determined based on the ranking with the rank order centroid method used to attribute weights another important component of a wqi model is the sub index function which allows conversion of indicator concentrations into dimensionless values sub index generation has been reported in several studies to be one of the main sources of uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 as the process can conceal the integral information of water quality lumb et al 2011b sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 to address these issues sub index functions were developed in this study using surface water quality guidelines adopted by the environmental protection agency epa ireland the final and most crucial component of a wqi model is the aggregation function which determines the overall index various wqi aggregation functions have been intercompared in the literature mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 zotou et al 2019 and significant variations in formulations has been found gupta et al 2003 zotou et al 2018 several studies report that the aggregation function is another source of model uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2016 in this study eight aggregation functions weighted and unweighted are tested and their effects on wqi scores examined five of the functions are commonly used in existing wqi models and three are proposed new by the authors the aim of this research was to develop an improved objective wqi methodology for assessing coastal water quality to date most wqi models have been developed for river and lakes and to the best of our knowledge no wqi models that have been specifically developed for coastal water quality assessment the novel aspects of the research are the 1 utilization of the xgboost machine learning algorithm for selection of key water quality indicators for inclusion in the wqi 2 development of new sub indexing functions specifically for coastal waters which convert water quality indicator data into dimensionless values without losing any information 3 calculation of indicator weight values using mathematical formulae to reduce reliance on expert opinion 4 determination of the most accurate aggregation function by comparing different weighted and unweighted functions and finally 5 development of a wqi method for assessing coastal water quality that is systematic objective and aided by machine learning the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study domain section 3 provides a concise description of materials and methods section 4 presents results and discusses the methodology and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions 2 model study area cork harbour cork harbour located on the southwest coast of ireland was selected as the case study site it is the largest natural harbour in ireland and is a macro tidal estuary with a typical spring tide range of 4 2 m at the entrance to the harbour hartnett and nash 2015 water depths are generally relatively shallow with much of the estuary having a depth of less than 5 m on spring tides at low water a major portion of the harbour area is exposed to mudflats and sandflats fig 1 the harbour deepens towards the mouth in the main channel to depths of about 30 m a number of rivers flow into the estuary the largest being the river lee which flows through cork city and accounts for approximately 75 of the freshwater delivered to the estuary uddin et al 2020 cork harbour is heavily populated and industrialized cork city located at the mouth of the river lee is home to a population of approximately 125 000 when its immediate suburbs are included the population rises to approximately 200 000 hartnett and nash 2015 the city is the industrial hub of the irish southwest region and the surrounding hinterlands are subject to relatively intense agricultural activities which impact water quality in the region like much of ireland agriculture is widespread in the river lee catchment which covers an area of approximately 1 200 km2 additionally effluent discharges fig 2 from seven wastewater treatment plants wwtps which further impact water quality in the harbour epa 2016 for the purpose of regional evaluation the cork harbour domain was divided into three regions delineated with the red lines in fig 1 1 upper harbour including river lee river glashaboy north channel and river owenacurra 2 lower harbour including passage west and passage east and 3 outer harbour including river owenboy and the main channel of the harbour 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collation water quality in cork harbour is monitored by the irish epa at 36 stations as part of the national monitoring programme the epa have a comprehensive quality control quality assurance system in place to ensure that data generated by the national monitoring programme are reliable and of sufficient accuracy and precision see epa 2021 for more detail water samples are typically gathered at approximately high and low tides on two dates during winter october march and two dates during summer april september this study used data from 29 of the 36 monitoring stations fig 2 for the calendar year october 2019 september 2020 the stations were selected based on availability of a full suite of water quality indicator data and coverage of the full extents of the harbour for consistency only samples taken from 1 m below the water surface were used data for eleven water quality indicators were available salinity sal water temperature temp ph transparency tran dissolved oxygen dox biological oxygen demand bod5 total organic nitrogen ton ammoniacal nitrogen amn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp and chlorophyll a chl as a measure of algae data were depth averaged and seasonal average concentrations of the water quality indicators were obtained by calculating the mean of the measurements in a particular season summer or winter this produced singular summer and winter values for each indicator at each station see annex 1 a and 1 b for values 3 2 methodology for wqi model development the wqi model consists of four components a indicator selection process b sub index function c indicator weighting process and d aggregation function these are now described for the developed methodology 3 2 1 indicator selection process machine learning techniques use programmed algorithms that analyse input data or features to predict output values within an acceptable range of accuracy in doing so they attribute relative importance to input variables based on their influence on model output and can therefore potentially be used for identifying significant water quality indicators from datasets chen et al 2020 muttil and chau 2007 in this study an initial assessment of four machine learning algorithms including 1 decision tree 2 random forest 3 boruta and 4 xgboost was performed using the cork summer data as the test dataset as explained in the next section the water quality indicator data were used as the model input and a computed water quality status based on the indicator data was the desired model output xgboost achieved the highest prediction accuracy for water quality status 97 compared to 92 for random forest 79 for boruta and 72 for decision tree and was therefore chosen for the wqi indicator selection process xgboost is a widely used ensemble machine learning technique that uses a gradient boosting framework naghibi et al 2020 tanha et al 2020 it is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms due to lower prediction errors compared to other algorithms islam khan et al 2021 unlike regular machine learning techniques which train a single model or an ensemble of models in isolation of each other boosting techniques train models in succession with each new model being trained to correct the errors of the previous ones and then added to the ensemble model gradient boosting techniques specifically train new models to predict the residuals errors of previous models ogutu et al 2011 a number of studies have utilized xgboost to extract the key variables of water quality for developing models huan et al 2020 naghibi et al 2020 here we implemented the xgboost algorithm for selection of important indicators using the approach of huan et al 2020 this involved the following four steps 3 2 1 1 input data ten water quality indicators were used as inputs to the xgboost model salinity although not used as a direct model input was used for obtaining the standard threshold values of coastal water quality the summer and winter data for the ten water quality indicators at the 29 monitoring stations were used to determine a water quality status at each station which was used as the desired xgboost output water quality status was determined by comparing measured data values with the recommended water quality standards given in table 1 where coastal water quality standards were available site specific values were determined using median salinity values and the irish epa s assessment of trophic status of estuaries and bays in ireland atsebi system see toner et al 2005 for details where coastal water quality standards were not available the most appropriate bathing or surface water quality standards were used instead in annex 1 c the detailed applicable values of each of the criteria for the entire range of salinities are tabulated by comparing measured values with the standard values an initial water quality status was determined using a simple binary function if all water quality indicator values met the guideline values the water quality status was assigned a binary value of 0 indicating unpolluted if any water quality indicator failed to meet the guideline values then a binary value of 1 was assigned indicating polluted status the water quality data and associated water quality status for each monitoring station are presented in annex 1 a and 1 b 3 2 1 2 model validation evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm requires the use of different train and test datasets the input data were therefore randomly split into two groups a training group containing data from 23 80 stations and a testing group containing data from the remaining 6 20 stations the simplest method of evaluation of model performance uses one training dataset and one test dataset but this can result in high variance and over fitting over fitting is a major concern for machine learning algorithms it occurs when the model fits overly closely to its training data including noise or random fluctuations and cannot then perform well when applied to other unseen data thus yielding poor model accuracy k fold cross validation can be used to protect against over fitting ghatak 2017 natekin and knoll 2013 this involves dividing the input data set randomly into k number of segments or folds one segment of data is reserved for testing the performance of the model while all other segments are used for training a model is then fit to the training data and subsequently used to predict the test data this is repeated k number of times using a different segment as the training data each time until each segment has served as both a training and test dataset the overall model performance is taken as the average of each fold s results a 5 fold cross validation technique was employed here to reduce variance and the risk of over fitting 3 2 1 3 xgboost hyperparameter tuning in machine learning hyperparameters are parameters whose values control the learning process and must be tuned for each application the grid search optimization method was used to adjust xgboost s hyperparameters to increase model prediction accuracy huan et al 2020 touzani et al 2018 a grid of different combinations of hyperparameter values was constructed models were developed for each point of the optimisation grid and the rmse of model predictions calculated using eq 1 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where n is the number of pairs of observed predicted water quality status i e the number of monitoring stations y i is the observed status determined in step i and y i is the xgboost model predicted value for each optimisation grid point the average rmse was calculated across the 5 folds of the k fold cross validation and the optimal grid point and thus best combination of hyperindicator values was identified as that with the smallest rmse the optimized indicators determined for this study are listed in table 6 while table 7 shows the average rmses for each of the five folds of the final optimised model 3 2 1 4 indicator importance xgboost can rank features based on their relative importance it determines the importance of a feature using the model s structural gain at each segment of a decision tree malohlava et al 2017 touzani et al 2018 the more a feature is used to make key decisions within a decision trees the higher its relative importance for a single decision tree t breiman et al 1984 proposed the following equation to estimate the importance of a feature xl see hastie 2009 2 i l 2 t t 1 j 1 i t 2 i v t l where i t 2 is the maximal improvement in squared error risk for each node splitting j is the number of leaf nodes in the xgboost decision tree v t is the variable used to partition the region associate with each node t and i l 2 t for a particular feature is the sum of the improvement in squared error risk over all internal nodes for which that feature was chosen as the splitting variable the global importance of a feature can then be easily estimated by averaging the feature importance across all decision trees as 3 i l 2 1 m m 1 m i l 2 t m where i l 2 is the averaged value of the feature importance measure i l 2 across all m decision trees in the model 3 2 2 establishing sub index rules sub index si rules are used to transform the measured values of water quality indicators into dimensionless values generally using a scale of 0 100 with 0 and 100 indicating poor and excellent status of the indicator respectively many researchers have found that si functions have significantly contributed to wqi model uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2016 thus sub indexing is a crucial step in wqis a range of techniques have been used to generate si values for water quality indicators see uddin et al 2021 and sutadian et al 2016 for examples a number of wqi models use interpolation techniques to establish si values using limits set by recommended guideline values from legislative standards uddin et al 2021 while others directly use the actual indicator concentration as the si value ei g dinius 1987 and said et al 2004 for all water quality indicators excluding temp we developed linear interpolation rescaling functions eqs 4 6 to compute si values using the threshold guideline values presented in table 1 for temp we applied a binary rule table 2 shows how si values are determined in combination with eqs 4 6 4 s i s i u s i l s i u w q m s t d u s t d l 5 s i w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u 6 s i s i u s i l w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u in eqs 4 6 s i l and s i u are the lower and upper limits of possible si values 0 and 100 respectively s t d l and s t d u are the lower and upper threshold values and w q m is the measured water quality indicator concentration 3 2 3 obtaining indicator weight values indicator weight values should reflect the relative importance of the water quality indicators included in the wqi here a novel objective weighting approach is employed combining two processes i the xgboost ranking of indicators and ii the rank order centroid roc weights method which is used to attribute weightings based on rank this combined approach is fundamentally different from the more subjective methods e g expert opinion used in the literature and designed to reduce the risk of eclipsing caused by inappropriate weightings the roc approach is a relatively simple way of assigning weights to a ranked list of items it takes the ranks as inputs and converts them to weights the maximum error of the weights is minimised by identifying the centroid of all possible weights whilst maintaining the rank order roszkowska 2013 the method has been used extensively for solving multi criteria decision making problems in a range of scientific research the roc weights of a set of n variables ranked from i 1 to n are calculated according to 7 w i 1 n i 1 n 1 i 3 2 4 aggregation process aggregation is the final stage of a wqi model its purpose is to convert multi indicator water quality information into a single value that expresses the overall status of water quality three categories of aggregation functions are commonly used in wqi modelling weighted unweighted and multiplicative functions lumb et al 2011a sutadian et al 2018 several studies have addressed wqi model uncertainty issues related to aggregation functions smith 1990 in this research the performances of eight different aggregation functions were compared functions from five existing wqi models were selected i national sanitation foundation nsf index ii scottish research development department srdd index iii canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme index iv hanh index and v west java wj index and three new functions were proposed i weighted quadratic mean wqm ii arithmetic mean am and iii root mean square rms to compare with the traditional aggregation approaches and help select the best method for calculating wqi values in terms of addressing the existing problems in wqi models table 3 provides an overview of the aggregation functions and their properties 3 2 5 wqi model score interpretation the final output of the wqi model is a numerical score the index that typically ranges from 0 100 the score is commonly interpreted with the help of a classification scheme that defines classes of water quality classification schemes vary between models with different models sometimes assigning different classes of water quality for the same score table 4 shows the classification schemes of the five models whose aggregation functions were tested to enable comparison of the aggregation functions we proposed a new classification scheme which could be applied to the scores from all of the aggregation functions table 5 presents the classification which comprises four classes of water quality ranging from good to poor with higher index scores indicating better water quality the new classification scheme was developed by analysing the classifications and corresponding index intervals for schemes in table 4 and attempting to generalize these for example poor status in the new scheme has a range of 0 29 the upper limit here was guided by the corresponding upper limits of 24 for very bad in nsf 29 for severely polluted in srdd 44 for poor in ccme 25 for poor in hanh and 25 for poor in west java 3 3 analysis of wqi model sensitivity the multilinear regression mlr technique was used to assess the level of sensitivity in the wqi models this technique has been employed in several water quality studies to investigate the effect of model predictors on the response the approach involved the prediction of wqi scores using both mlr and the aggregation functions and comparison of the results using the coefficient of determination or r2 value to predict wqi values using mlr the same indicators and values included in the wqi model were used i e seven indicators for summer and five indicators for winter mlr analysis was carried out using regression learner apps in matlab 2021b to develop the besting fitting mlr function of the following form 8 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where y is the mlr predicted wqi score x n is the mlr input value for the nth water quality indicator b 0 is the regression constant and b n is the regression coefficient for the nth indicator to compare with unweighted wqi functions x n in eq 16 was simply set to the corresponding sub index value sin whereas to compare with weighted functions sub index values were multiplied by their corresponding weights i e xn sin wn once the mlr wqi scores were predicted scatter plots were produced to visualize the relationship between the original and mlr predicted wqi scores and obtain the r2 from the linear fit model to analyse the sensitivity of wqi model three other common statistical measures of model performance were also used to help assess model sensitivity and uncertainty these were i root mean squared error rmse ii mean absolute error mae and iii mean squared error mse defined as follows 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 10 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean of the predicted values 4 results and discussion the following sections present results from the xgboost model validation exercise the various stages of the wqi model process and comparative analysis of the eight aggregation functions assessed 4 1 xgboost validation table 6 shows the final tuned hyperparameter values for the xgboost model obtained using the grid search optimization method these were the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the lowest rmses between the predicted and observed water quality statuses the average rmses are presented in table 7 for each of the five folds of the final optimised model a maximum tree depth of 10 was used for the summer analysis and 6 for winter to increase the maximum effects of interactions between variables a learning rate of 0 05 and 0 01 were applied for 3400 and 600 trials for summer and winter respectively whereas model training and testing accuracy was found to be 0 96 and 0 67 for the summer and 1 for both the winter respectively which are acceptable levels of accuracy another measure of model performance is the auc roc area under the curve receiver operating characteristics curve feng et al 2018 huan et al 2020 of particular interest is the auc value with a value of 1 indicating an excellent model and 0 indicating a poor model walter 2005 table 7 shows the auc values for the 5 folds of the optimised model for both the summer and winter seasons the auc was estimated 0 98 and 1 respectively for all of the training iterations the log loss error is a commonly used probability based metric which can be plotted for each model iteration to produce a model learning curve which shows how model performance varies with each iteration fig 3 presents the model learning curves for the training and test datasets for both summer and winter for the optimized model the x axis shows the number of iterations of trees added to the ensemble and the y axis shows the log loss of the model as desired the log loss error reduces with each iteration showing improved model performance both figures show that the model performance is better during training blue line than testing red line as would be expected the test model performance is better for the winter season but the summer performance is also acceptable 4 2 analysis of wqi model components this section of the study presents results from each of the wqi s four model components to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology to cork harbour 4 2 1 indicator selection the validated xgboost model was used to select water quality indicators for inclusion in the wqi of cork harbour based on their relative importance in terms of contribution to water quality status xgboost outputs an importance matrix with a number of different importance metrics one of these metrics the importance score is used here to rank indicators as it implies the relative contribution of the respective indicators to the model calculated by taking each indicator s contribution for each tree in the model table 8 shows the relative importance results obtained from the xgboost algorithm seven of the ten water quality variables were determined as important for summer and five were deemed important for winter the highest importance scores obtained for summer were tran din temp and chl whereas the lowest importance scores were calculated for amn mrp and bod5 for winter the highest importance values were obtained for ton and din and the lowest for tran and dox while the selection of indicators was broadly in line with those of previous studies chen et al 2020 nong et al 2020 wu et al 2021 most wqi studies have previously assigned the highest priority to dox however this key difference is likely due to the fact that most previous studies were focussed on fresh waterbodies while this one is focussed on marine waters 4 2 1 1 reliability of xgboost output using outlier detection analysis fig 4 provides a statistical overview of the summer and winter indicator values input to the xgboost model these variables obviously have impact on water quality in cork harbour over the study period comparatively a significant statistical difference was found in water quality variables between seasons in cork harbour the maximum standard deviation was found for chl dox din and ton for summer while it was observed for dox din and ton for winter this means these indicators concentrations are not distributed evenly in cork harbour over the monitoring periods for the determination of water quality indicator impacts on the xgboost model outlier detection analysis was carried out on the water quality dataset fig 4 presents the results of the whisker box plots analysis for detecting data outliers of the model input variables outlier results were validated using dixon s q test see rorabacher 1991 for details because this technique is widely used in statistics for the identification and rejection of outliers as shown in fig 4 chl dox bod5 ph and temp are normally distributed during summer while dox din amn ph temp ton and tran are normally distributed during winter these water quality indicators had a significant positive effect on the xgboost model and these indicators meet with the coastal water quality standard values on the other hand outliers were detected for mrp din amn ton and tran during summer and for chl mrp and bod5 in winter the outlier results indicate that these water quality indicators had extremely negative impacts on water quality in cork harbour consequently the average wqi value in cork harbour decreases due to these variables but as can be seen from table 8 above xgboost does not regard ton as a critical variable for the summer season nor chl bod5 and mrp for the winter season when the results are compared to the standard values of coastal water quality it is seen that the xgboost algorithm does not completely accurately identify the most influential indicators of water quality although the xgboost algorithm is widely used in machine learning techniques for selecting critical attributes in a dataset these results show that it should be used with care when identifying critical water quality indicators 4 2 2 si function fig 5 shows the summer si values calculated using eqs 4 7 for all ten water quality indicators at all of the monitoring stations each black dot represents the si value at a particular station for the particular indicator si 100 indicates excellent water quality while si 0 indicates the poorest water quality the values are presented in tabular form in annex 1 f and 1 g a number of studies have revealed that the sub indexing method is one of the major contributors to uncertainty in wqi models abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2018 juwana et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 commonly uncertainty is produced by the si method when it estimates smaller values without any input indicators exceeding the critical indicator thresholds another complication arises when the si function estimates higher values for input indicators that exceed the critical indicator thresholds these types of problems are well known as ambiguity in wqi models to avoid model ambiguity from this step the present research proposed three si functions that were implemented based on appropriate coastal water quality standards comparison of the si graphs in fig 5 with the si functions and standards in table 2 show that a larger si value is only calculated when the actual concentration of the indicator fall below or within the permissible thresholds otherwise a smaller si value is calculated the si results obtained from eqs 4 6 can be compared using the statistical summary in fig 6 a significant difference was found between the summer and winter si values relatively higher si values were obtained during summer than winter looking at the individual indicators the largest ranges were found for tran din and chl during summer and for tran din and ton during winter tran had the greatest range of variation ranging from 0 to 100 with an average and standard deviation of 68 46 and 58 6 49 for the summer and winter seasons respectively din values ranged from 0 to 97 in the summer and 0 to 87 in the winter with an average and standard deviation of 43 4 43 in the summer and 21 4 31 in the winter chl summer values ranged from 27 to 93 with an average and standard deviation of 62 5 22 while ton winter values ranged from 0 to 93 with an average and standard deviation of 30 6 35 regarding spatial variation of si in the harbour si values were lower in the upper and lower harbour and higher in the outer harbour annex 1 f 1 g this is as expected as fig 2 shows that all of the wwtps that discharge effluent to the harbour are located in the upper and lower harbour regions taken as a whole the results of si functions appear to reflect the true state of the water quality indicators in cork harbour the si functions presented here are fundamentally different from existing si procedures in the literature because they are developed specifically for coastal water quality 4 2 3 weight factor table 9 presents the weights calculated for the ranked indicators using the roc method the weights follow the same order as the rankings of model indicators with tran din temp and chl having the largest weight values for the summer and ton din and ph having the highest weight values for winter the weighting method used here should reduce model uncertainty compared to other models which use weightings based on expert opinions 4 2 4 aggregation function wqi scores eight different aggregation functions were used to calculate wqi values in this study the aggregation functions were classified into two types for analysis i weighted functions and ii unweighted functions fig 7 shows the range of wqi scores computed by each function throughout cork harbour for the summer and winter periods as might be expected wqi values were significantly different between functions the effect of using a weighting in the aggregation function is very clear in general the weighted functions produced a much greater spread of scores and lower mean scores in both summer and winter the weighted functions appear to be much more sensitive to the input water quality values directly comparing the nsf scores which uses a weighted arithmetic mean wam function with those from the unweighted arithmetic mean function am the same observations can be made with the exception of the hanh function weighted function scores showed much greater seasonal variation than the unweighted function scores again indicating that the weighted functions are more sensitive to the input water quality values finally the ccme model function appears to be highly insensitive to variations in the input water quality data it produced very similar scores for both summer and winter and very little variation in scores across the harbour this may be due to eclipsing problems commonly the eclipsing problem occurs due to overestimation of the wqi index by the aggregation function most commonly eclipsing occurs when some water quality indicator values exceed their critical levels but the overall index does not reflect this the extent to which eclipsing affected the aggregation functions was determined by checking compliance of the water quality measurements for the indicators included in the wqi models with their guideline values to determine the numbers of breaches of the guideline values at each monitoring station these numbers were then compared with the typical number of breaches of recommended guideline values that might be expected for a wqi classification table 10 for example one would not expect any breach of guideline values for any indicator where a classification of good status was determined by the model for any station if the number of breaches was greater than expected for a particular water quality status then the aggregation function was deemed to have overestimated the water quality status and if the number of breaches was less than expected then the function was deemed to have underestimated the status annex 1 d and 1 e present the occurrences of eclipsing for the different wqi aggregation functions the results are summarised in table 11 which shows the total numbers of instances of eclipsing for each function from table 11 eclipsing is seen to occur for all aggregation functions during both seasons instances of eclipsing were more prevalent for the weighted functions the nsf srdd and wj functions all resulted in much higher eclipsing numbers than the highest of the unweighted functions 25 for ccme of the weighted functions the wqm method was clearly the best performer in terms of eclipsing with just 17 instances compared to the next best of 37 for nsf of the unweighted functions the am method resulted in the lowest number 9 compared to 15 and 17 for rms and hanh respectively there was a slight seasonal bias towards eclipsing with 5 of the 8 functions yielding higher instances in winter than summer there also appeared to be a spatial bias towards eclipsing as during both seasons across all functions the majority of cases of eclipsing were found in monitoring sites in the upper harbour see annex 1 d and 1 e the underestimating eclipsing problem was observed more often across all aggregation functions with the exception of the ccme function which suffered more from overestimation 20 of the 25 ccme instances of eclipsing were overestimation during summer the ccme function determined good water quality status at many monitoring locations in cork harbour even though some of the water quality indicators at those locations exceeded the guideline values all 12 summer instances of eclipsing were overestimation for winter 8 of the 13 eclipsing instances were overestimation it can be concluded that the ccme displays a consistent bias towards attributing higher water quality status even when that is not the case ambiguity is another important source of the wqi model uncertainty ambiguity hides the actual water quality information contained in the model inputs consequently the model produces considerable uncertainty that results in the misclassification of water quality for environmental managers or assessors commonly two types of ambiguity contribute to uncertainty type i underestimation ambiguity if the aggregation function estimates a smaller index without any of the sub indices exceeding the critical level nearly zero or unacceptable value type ii overestimation ambiguity if the aggregation function estimates a larger index with one or more sub indices exceeding the critical level nearly zero or unacceptable value the results show type i ambiguity having occurred in the weighted srdd and wj models during both seasons the aggregation functions have calculated lower index values but the si values do not reflect this annex 1 f 1 g type ii ambiguity occurred in the unweighted ccme methodology for both seasons with higher index values calculated for all monitoring locations even though the si values contain some low values relatively the nsf and wqm and unweighted am and rms aggregation methods produce indices during both seasons that reflect the true quality of the water another significant aspect of the aggregation functions is the relationship between them to assess the similarity of model results the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated with r software using the ggcorplot package the statistical significance level was set at 0 01 as shown in fig 8 all wqi functions with the exception of the ccme were highly positively associated with one another for both seasons 4 3 spatio temporal variability of different wqi methods fig 9 presents the wqi scores computed at each monitoring location by the different aggregation functions it can be seen that the wqi scores varied significantly across the monitoring locations in cork harbour during both seasons higher wqi values were found in the lower and outer harbour for all functions comparatively lower values were found in the upper monitoring stations of harbour over the study period for all of the wqi functions there was a significant temporal variation between seasons the results of the wqi models show that the water quality in the harbour degrades significantly during the winter at all monitoring sites the advanced geo statistical empirical bayesian kriging ebk technique was utilized to spatially interpolate calculated wqi scores at the monitoring stations onto the whole domain of cork harbour esri 2016 mcmanus et al 2020 rahman and harding 2016 a detailed description of the procedure can be found in uddin et al 2020 figs 10 and 11 show the spatial and temporal variations of wqi scores in cork harbour throughout the summer and winter seasons respectively relatively all of the functions computed higher wqi scores in the outer habour while lower index scores were obtained in the upper habour according to recent studies the upper harbour has received significant pollutant loads from a variety of sources over the years including farmlands wwtps industries etc epa 2018 hartnett and nash 2015 there was a greater difference in spatial variation between the weighted and unweighted techniques over the study periods fig 12 shows the spatial variation in the standard deviations of the indices computed by the different wqi models during both seasons the wqi scores predicted by the different models at monitoring stations in the upper harbour varied significantly more than those predicted by the different models in the lower and outer areas of the harbour when comparing the weighted and unweighted models the unweighted method had the lowest deviation during the summer season while the weighted methods had the highest during the winter season the results show that the spatial distribution of water quality factors can have a significant impact on the wqi model because a higher density of diverse water quality was observed in the present study in the upper harbour 4 4 comparative analysis of wqi model performance mlr analysis was used to predict wqi scores in order to compare model performance all statistical analyses were conducted at a significance level of 0 05 r2 rmse mse and mae were used to evaluate the performance of the mlr models versus the wqi functions the r2 for the regression analysis of wqi scores are shown in figs 13 16 for the weighted summer and winter and unweighted summer and winter aggregation models looking at the weighted models a significant difference was found between seasons over the models similarly high levels of agreement r2 0 9 were observed for all unweighted functions for the summer while poorer agreements were observed in winter for the nsf wj and particularly the srdd models the wqm model showed highest levels of agreement with 91 and 97 of prediction variance in summer and winter respectively in contrast there is a significant variation in r2 values for the unweighted prediction models during both seasons a higher proportion of variance 92 and 97 respectively for summer and winter is explained by the am model than any other unweighted model there were also high levels of correlation for the rms model 89 and 79 of the variance was explained for summer and winter respectively poor correlations were found for the ccme model with just 72 and 70 of variance explained in summer and winter respectively rmse mae and mse statistical metrics for the mlr models are shown in fig 17 smaller values close to zero of the metrics indicate better performance of the mlr model as shown in fig 17 during both seasons rmse mae and mse are lowest for the weighted wqm models while the highest prediction errors was calculated for the srdd and wj models respectively in contrast the unweighted hanh model exhibits the highest errors during both seasons the hanh model performance varied significantly between seasons the highest rmse mae and mse were found during the winter season whereas the lowest during the summer season the results of the performance metrics reveal that of the weighted models the wqm wqi model exhibits excellent performance and the best fit for the predicted wqi scores overall the am and ccme models had the lowest model error for both seasons ranking the models in terms of sensitivity it was found that the wqm aggregation function was more sensitive than other aggregation functions this approach also had less error than other weighted methods based on the mlr model performance metrics the methodology has a distinct advantage in terms of eclipsing and ambiguity problems over the other methodologies the nsf function while being less sensitive than the wqm showed better sensitivity than the wj and the srdd models looking at the unweighted functions the pooret sensitivity was found for the ccme and hanh functions in the summer and winter seasons respectively whereas the am showed high sensitivity during both seasons model performances were ranked see table 12 taking on the r2 values from figs 13 16 above as a measure of model sensitivity and the rmse values from fig 17 as a measure of prediction error taking the weighted models as an example models were first scored from 1 4 separately for each metric with 1 indicating best performance and 4 worst these scores were then added giving each metric equal weighting and the models ranked based on the cumulative scores for the weighted models table 12 shows that the wqm model was ranked first for both seasons for the unweighted models the am model was ranked first for both seasons 5 comparison of water quality statuses the ultimate goal of the wqi model is to assess water quality and determine its status for the purpose of coastal water quality assessment the results presented thus far suggest that the weighted wqm and unweighted am approaches are the most appropriate techniques for calculating wqi scores as they suffered least from eclipsing and ambiguity difficulties fig 18 shows the computed water quality status at 29 monitoring stations in cork harbour for the wqm and the am methods table 13 provides the percentage of stations attributed particular statuses by the two methods in summer the wqm method classified 72 of stations as fair and 28 good while the am method classified 69 as fair and 31 good from fig 18 a and b it can be seen that fair water quality was found in the upper part of the harbour river lee glashaboy river and river owenacurra for both methods in the area that is most strongly affected by urban pressures epa 2017 during the winter period the wqm method classified 38 of stations as marginal 48 as fair and 14 as good whereas the am method classified 38 of stations as marginal 45 as fair and 17 good as seen in fig 18 c and d the poorest water quality was assessed in the upper harbour by both methods while the best water quality was found in the lower and outer harbour however the qualitative assessment of wqi models showed a significant spatial variation of water quality classes in cork harbour this could be due to the combined impacts of various edaphic and non edaphic activities on harbour water xia et al 2015 a number of factors can contribute to poor water quality including industrial effluents home waste and agricultural activities farming fishing etc in the upper harbour in this study all wqi methods used the same indicators and si values to calculate wqi the results of the study show that there are considerable differences in wqi model outcomes for similar water quality inputs the differences are therefore entirely due to the different aggregation functions and use of weighted versus unweighted aggregation functions 6 conclusion the main aim of this study was to develop an improved wqi methodology for assessment of coastal water quality this was achieved by using the xgboost machine learning algorithm to identify water quality indicators for inclusion in a wqi model using the xgboost rankings the rank order centroid weighting method to attribute sub index weightings and testing a large number of aggregation functions to determine their input on model performance the key conclusions from the research are as follows xgboost can be used to objectively rank water quality indicators based on their significance in terms of water quality although xgboost was shown to work well here it requires further investigation using longer term datasets its s use requires both input i e indicator data and some desired output which here was an initial water quality status determined using binary analysis of the indicator data however the xgboost ranking is sensitive to the desired output and it should therefore be carefully chosen the rank order centroid weighting method is a useful means of objectively weighting the indicators in a wqi model but it must be used in conjunction with some ranking method such as the xgboost method use of objective mathematical approaches like these have the potential to reduce model uncertainty that might be introduced by the use of rankings weightings based on expert opinion which can obviously vary between expert the assessment of aggregation functions found that a weighted quadratic mean aggregation function and an unweighted arithmetic mean function resulted in the lowest instances of eclipsing and ambiguity and are therefore recommended for wqi approaches however the present study only used one year of monitoring data and their performance in mutli year analyses should be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors state that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that the work

15890,here we present an improved water quality index wqi model for assessment of coastal water quality using cork harbour ireland as the case study the model involves the usual four wqi components selection of water quality indicators for inclusion sub indexing of indicator values sub index weighting and sub index aggregation with improvements to make the approach more objective and data driven and less susceptible to eclipsing and ambiguity errors the model uses the machine learning algorithm xgboost to rank and select water quality indicators for inclusion based on relative importance to overall water quality status of the ten indicators for which data were available transparency dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen bod5 chlorophyll temperature and orthophosphate were selected for summer while total organic nitrogen dissolved inorganic nitrogen ph transparency and dissolved oxygen were selected for winter linear interpolation functions developed using national recommended guideline values for coastal water quality are used for sub indexing of water quality indicators and the xgboost rankings are used in combination with the rank order centroid weighting method to determine sub index weight values eight sub index aggregation functions were tested five from existing wqi models and three proposed by the authors the computed indices were compared with those obtained using a multiple linear regression mlr approach and r2 and rmse used as indicators of aggregation function performance the weighted quadratic mean function r2 0 91 rmse 4 4 for summer r2 0 97 rmse 3 1 for winter and the unweighted arithmetic mean function r2 0 92 rmse 3 2 for summer r2 0 97 rmse 3 2 for winter proposed by the authors were identified as the best functions and showed reduced eclipsing and ambiguity problems compared to the others graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword water quality water quality index model coastal waters machine learning algorithm rank order centroid method aggregation function 1 introduction surface water quality poses significant environmental sociological and economic risks in many parts of the world as such sustainable management of water resource has become a challenge of critical importance due to population growth industrialisation and urbanisation observed over many decades freshwater usage and wastewater production have significantly increased javed et al 2017 uddin et al 2018 both human activities and natural processes have caused a continuous degradation of surface water quality in recent decades many countries have adopted a range of policies and guidelines to manage surface water quality and provide more effective water resource management in order to reverse this negative trend member states of the european union eu for example adopted the water framework directive wfd in 2000 and it has been an effective instrument for the management of the quality of water and its ecosystem carsten von der ohe et al 2007 zotou et al 2018 the wfd envisaged the achievement of at least a good environmental status of all waterbodies such as coastal and transitional water rivers and lakes by 2015 carsten von der ohe et al 2007 epa 2001 the wfd and other similar frameworks rely on assessment of water quality in recent years a range of tools and techniques has been developed to assess the quality of surface waters and diagnose the health of aquatic ecosystems water quality index wqi models are an example wqi models use mathematical algorithms to convert available water quality indicator monitoring data into a single number which can be used as a measure of water quality the method is relatively easy to apply and its results are easy to interpret by both professionals and non experts abbasi and abbasi 2012 nives 1999 sutadian et al 2018 uddin et al 2021 wqi models typically consist of four components water quality indicator selection sub indexing indicator weighting and index aggregation over the years some components of wqi models have been modified and or newly developed an extensive review of existing wqi models and their evolution is presented in uddin et al 2021 along with a critical discussion of model structures applications sources of model uncertainty and eclipsing problems indicator selection and sub index weighting are two of the prime sources of uncertainty in the implementation of a wqi model sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 uddin et al 2022a traditionally both have been conducted based either on a literature review of the importance and contribution of a given indicator to the overall water quality lumb et al 2011a or on the opinions and judgements of experts sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 however these approaches have received much criticism as they are overly complex and rather subjective abbasi and abbasi 2012 they can lead to inclusion of irrelevant indicators or omission of important ones and to the attribution of weightings that are not truly reflective of real world indicator importance determination of weightings is particularly open to error while a decisionmaker may be quite comfortable ranking indicators based on their relative importance they will likely struggle with the precision imposed by the eliciting of exact weights this is true even for a group of experts who may struggle to agree on a ranking of indicators never mind precise weightings recently some studies have used more objective mathematical approaches for indicator selection such as logistic regression models uddin et al 2022b ewaid et al 2018 feng et al 2018 huan et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2017 and machine learning algorithms azhar and thomas 2019 das et al 2017 jović et al 2015 momenzadeh et al 2019 here we use the extreme gradient boosting xgboost machine learning algorithm to rank indicators based on their measured values and influence on water quality status indicator selection and weightings are then determined based on the ranking with the rank order centroid method used to attribute weights another important component of a wqi model is the sub index function which allows conversion of indicator concentrations into dimensionless values sub index generation has been reported in several studies to be one of the main sources of uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 as the process can conceal the integral information of water quality lumb et al 2011b sutadian et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 to address these issues sub index functions were developed in this study using surface water quality guidelines adopted by the environmental protection agency epa ireland the final and most crucial component of a wqi model is the aggregation function which determines the overall index various wqi aggregation functions have been intercompared in the literature mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 zotou et al 2019 and significant variations in formulations has been found gupta et al 2003 zotou et al 2018 several studies report that the aggregation function is another source of model uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2016 in this study eight aggregation functions weighted and unweighted are tested and their effects on wqi scores examined five of the functions are commonly used in existing wqi models and three are proposed new by the authors the aim of this research was to develop an improved objective wqi methodology for assessing coastal water quality to date most wqi models have been developed for river and lakes and to the best of our knowledge no wqi models that have been specifically developed for coastal water quality assessment the novel aspects of the research are the 1 utilization of the xgboost machine learning algorithm for selection of key water quality indicators for inclusion in the wqi 2 development of new sub indexing functions specifically for coastal waters which convert water quality indicator data into dimensionless values without losing any information 3 calculation of indicator weight values using mathematical formulae to reduce reliance on expert opinion 4 determination of the most accurate aggregation function by comparing different weighted and unweighted functions and finally 5 development of a wqi method for assessing coastal water quality that is systematic objective and aided by machine learning the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study domain section 3 provides a concise description of materials and methods section 4 presents results and discusses the methodology and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions 2 model study area cork harbour cork harbour located on the southwest coast of ireland was selected as the case study site it is the largest natural harbour in ireland and is a macro tidal estuary with a typical spring tide range of 4 2 m at the entrance to the harbour hartnett and nash 2015 water depths are generally relatively shallow with much of the estuary having a depth of less than 5 m on spring tides at low water a major portion of the harbour area is exposed to mudflats and sandflats fig 1 the harbour deepens towards the mouth in the main channel to depths of about 30 m a number of rivers flow into the estuary the largest being the river lee which flows through cork city and accounts for approximately 75 of the freshwater delivered to the estuary uddin et al 2020 cork harbour is heavily populated and industrialized cork city located at the mouth of the river lee is home to a population of approximately 125 000 when its immediate suburbs are included the population rises to approximately 200 000 hartnett and nash 2015 the city is the industrial hub of the irish southwest region and the surrounding hinterlands are subject to relatively intense agricultural activities which impact water quality in the region like much of ireland agriculture is widespread in the river lee catchment which covers an area of approximately 1 200 km2 additionally effluent discharges fig 2 from seven wastewater treatment plants wwtps which further impact water quality in the harbour epa 2016 for the purpose of regional evaluation the cork harbour domain was divided into three regions delineated with the red lines in fig 1 1 upper harbour including river lee river glashaboy north channel and river owenacurra 2 lower harbour including passage west and passage east and 3 outer harbour including river owenboy and the main channel of the harbour 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collation water quality in cork harbour is monitored by the irish epa at 36 stations as part of the national monitoring programme the epa have a comprehensive quality control quality assurance system in place to ensure that data generated by the national monitoring programme are reliable and of sufficient accuracy and precision see epa 2021 for more detail water samples are typically gathered at approximately high and low tides on two dates during winter october march and two dates during summer april september this study used data from 29 of the 36 monitoring stations fig 2 for the calendar year october 2019 september 2020 the stations were selected based on availability of a full suite of water quality indicator data and coverage of the full extents of the harbour for consistency only samples taken from 1 m below the water surface were used data for eleven water quality indicators were available salinity sal water temperature temp ph transparency tran dissolved oxygen dox biological oxygen demand bod5 total organic nitrogen ton ammoniacal nitrogen amn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp and chlorophyll a chl as a measure of algae data were depth averaged and seasonal average concentrations of the water quality indicators were obtained by calculating the mean of the measurements in a particular season summer or winter this produced singular summer and winter values for each indicator at each station see annex 1 a and 1 b for values 3 2 methodology for wqi model development the wqi model consists of four components a indicator selection process b sub index function c indicator weighting process and d aggregation function these are now described for the developed methodology 3 2 1 indicator selection process machine learning techniques use programmed algorithms that analyse input data or features to predict output values within an acceptable range of accuracy in doing so they attribute relative importance to input variables based on their influence on model output and can therefore potentially be used for identifying significant water quality indicators from datasets chen et al 2020 muttil and chau 2007 in this study an initial assessment of four machine learning algorithms including 1 decision tree 2 random forest 3 boruta and 4 xgboost was performed using the cork summer data as the test dataset as explained in the next section the water quality indicator data were used as the model input and a computed water quality status based on the indicator data was the desired model output xgboost achieved the highest prediction accuracy for water quality status 97 compared to 92 for random forest 79 for boruta and 72 for decision tree and was therefore chosen for the wqi indicator selection process xgboost is a widely used ensemble machine learning technique that uses a gradient boosting framework naghibi et al 2020 tanha et al 2020 it is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms due to lower prediction errors compared to other algorithms islam khan et al 2021 unlike regular machine learning techniques which train a single model or an ensemble of models in isolation of each other boosting techniques train models in succession with each new model being trained to correct the errors of the previous ones and then added to the ensemble model gradient boosting techniques specifically train new models to predict the residuals errors of previous models ogutu et al 2011 a number of studies have utilized xgboost to extract the key variables of water quality for developing models huan et al 2020 naghibi et al 2020 here we implemented the xgboost algorithm for selection of important indicators using the approach of huan et al 2020 this involved the following four steps 3 2 1 1 input data ten water quality indicators were used as inputs to the xgboost model salinity although not used as a direct model input was used for obtaining the standard threshold values of coastal water quality the summer and winter data for the ten water quality indicators at the 29 monitoring stations were used to determine a water quality status at each station which was used as the desired xgboost output water quality status was determined by comparing measured data values with the recommended water quality standards given in table 1 where coastal water quality standards were available site specific values were determined using median salinity values and the irish epa s assessment of trophic status of estuaries and bays in ireland atsebi system see toner et al 2005 for details where coastal water quality standards were not available the most appropriate bathing or surface water quality standards were used instead in annex 1 c the detailed applicable values of each of the criteria for the entire range of salinities are tabulated by comparing measured values with the standard values an initial water quality status was determined using a simple binary function if all water quality indicator values met the guideline values the water quality status was assigned a binary value of 0 indicating unpolluted if any water quality indicator failed to meet the guideline values then a binary value of 1 was assigned indicating polluted status the water quality data and associated water quality status for each monitoring station are presented in annex 1 a and 1 b 3 2 1 2 model validation evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm requires the use of different train and test datasets the input data were therefore randomly split into two groups a training group containing data from 23 80 stations and a testing group containing data from the remaining 6 20 stations the simplest method of evaluation of model performance uses one training dataset and one test dataset but this can result in high variance and over fitting over fitting is a major concern for machine learning algorithms it occurs when the model fits overly closely to its training data including noise or random fluctuations and cannot then perform well when applied to other unseen data thus yielding poor model accuracy k fold cross validation can be used to protect against over fitting ghatak 2017 natekin and knoll 2013 this involves dividing the input data set randomly into k number of segments or folds one segment of data is reserved for testing the performance of the model while all other segments are used for training a model is then fit to the training data and subsequently used to predict the test data this is repeated k number of times using a different segment as the training data each time until each segment has served as both a training and test dataset the overall model performance is taken as the average of each fold s results a 5 fold cross validation technique was employed here to reduce variance and the risk of over fitting 3 2 1 3 xgboost hyperparameter tuning in machine learning hyperparameters are parameters whose values control the learning process and must be tuned for each application the grid search optimization method was used to adjust xgboost s hyperparameters to increase model prediction accuracy huan et al 2020 touzani et al 2018 a grid of different combinations of hyperparameter values was constructed models were developed for each point of the optimisation grid and the rmse of model predictions calculated using eq 1 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where n is the number of pairs of observed predicted water quality status i e the number of monitoring stations y i is the observed status determined in step i and y i is the xgboost model predicted value for each optimisation grid point the average rmse was calculated across the 5 folds of the k fold cross validation and the optimal grid point and thus best combination of hyperindicator values was identified as that with the smallest rmse the optimized indicators determined for this study are listed in table 6 while table 7 shows the average rmses for each of the five folds of the final optimised model 3 2 1 4 indicator importance xgboost can rank features based on their relative importance it determines the importance of a feature using the model s structural gain at each segment of a decision tree malohlava et al 2017 touzani et al 2018 the more a feature is used to make key decisions within a decision trees the higher its relative importance for a single decision tree t breiman et al 1984 proposed the following equation to estimate the importance of a feature xl see hastie 2009 2 i l 2 t t 1 j 1 i t 2 i v t l where i t 2 is the maximal improvement in squared error risk for each node splitting j is the number of leaf nodes in the xgboost decision tree v t is the variable used to partition the region associate with each node t and i l 2 t for a particular feature is the sum of the improvement in squared error risk over all internal nodes for which that feature was chosen as the splitting variable the global importance of a feature can then be easily estimated by averaging the feature importance across all decision trees as 3 i l 2 1 m m 1 m i l 2 t m where i l 2 is the averaged value of the feature importance measure i l 2 across all m decision trees in the model 3 2 2 establishing sub index rules sub index si rules are used to transform the measured values of water quality indicators into dimensionless values generally using a scale of 0 100 with 0 and 100 indicating poor and excellent status of the indicator respectively many researchers have found that si functions have significantly contributed to wqi model uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2016 thus sub indexing is a crucial step in wqis a range of techniques have been used to generate si values for water quality indicators see uddin et al 2021 and sutadian et al 2016 for examples a number of wqi models use interpolation techniques to establish si values using limits set by recommended guideline values from legislative standards uddin et al 2021 while others directly use the actual indicator concentration as the si value ei g dinius 1987 and said et al 2004 for all water quality indicators excluding temp we developed linear interpolation rescaling functions eqs 4 6 to compute si values using the threshold guideline values presented in table 1 for temp we applied a binary rule table 2 shows how si values are determined in combination with eqs 4 6 4 s i s i u s i l s i u w q m s t d u s t d l 5 s i w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u 6 s i s i u s i l w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u in eqs 4 6 s i l and s i u are the lower and upper limits of possible si values 0 and 100 respectively s t d l and s t d u are the lower and upper threshold values and w q m is the measured water quality indicator concentration 3 2 3 obtaining indicator weight values indicator weight values should reflect the relative importance of the water quality indicators included in the wqi here a novel objective weighting approach is employed combining two processes i the xgboost ranking of indicators and ii the rank order centroid roc weights method which is used to attribute weightings based on rank this combined approach is fundamentally different from the more subjective methods e g expert opinion used in the literature and designed to reduce the risk of eclipsing caused by inappropriate weightings the roc approach is a relatively simple way of assigning weights to a ranked list of items it takes the ranks as inputs and converts them to weights the maximum error of the weights is minimised by identifying the centroid of all possible weights whilst maintaining the rank order roszkowska 2013 the method has been used extensively for solving multi criteria decision making problems in a range of scientific research the roc weights of a set of n variables ranked from i 1 to n are calculated according to 7 w i 1 n i 1 n 1 i 3 2 4 aggregation process aggregation is the final stage of a wqi model its purpose is to convert multi indicator water quality information into a single value that expresses the overall status of water quality three categories of aggregation functions are commonly used in wqi modelling weighted unweighted and multiplicative functions lumb et al 2011a sutadian et al 2018 several studies have addressed wqi model uncertainty issues related to aggregation functions smith 1990 in this research the performances of eight different aggregation functions were compared functions from five existing wqi models were selected i national sanitation foundation nsf index ii scottish research development department srdd index iii canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme index iv hanh index and v west java wj index and three new functions were proposed i weighted quadratic mean wqm ii arithmetic mean am and iii root mean square rms to compare with the traditional aggregation approaches and help select the best method for calculating wqi values in terms of addressing the existing problems in wqi models table 3 provides an overview of the aggregation functions and their properties 3 2 5 wqi model score interpretation the final output of the wqi model is a numerical score the index that typically ranges from 0 100 the score is commonly interpreted with the help of a classification scheme that defines classes of water quality classification schemes vary between models with different models sometimes assigning different classes of water quality for the same score table 4 shows the classification schemes of the five models whose aggregation functions were tested to enable comparison of the aggregation functions we proposed a new classification scheme which could be applied to the scores from all of the aggregation functions table 5 presents the classification which comprises four classes of water quality ranging from good to poor with higher index scores indicating better water quality the new classification scheme was developed by analysing the classifications and corresponding index intervals for schemes in table 4 and attempting to generalize these for example poor status in the new scheme has a range of 0 29 the upper limit here was guided by the corresponding upper limits of 24 for very bad in nsf 29 for severely polluted in srdd 44 for poor in ccme 25 for poor in hanh and 25 for poor in west java 3 3 analysis of wqi model sensitivity the multilinear regression mlr technique was used to assess the level of sensitivity in the wqi models this technique has been employed in several water quality studies to investigate the effect of model predictors on the response the approach involved the prediction of wqi scores using both mlr and the aggregation functions and comparison of the results using the coefficient of determination or r2 value to predict wqi values using mlr the same indicators and values included in the wqi model were used i e seven indicators for summer and five indicators for winter mlr analysis was carried out using regression learner apps in matlab 2021b to develop the besting fitting mlr function of the following form 8 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where y is the mlr predicted wqi score x n is the mlr input value for the nth water quality indicator b 0 is the regression constant and b n is the regression coefficient for the nth indicator to compare with unweighted wqi functions x n in eq 16 was simply set to the corresponding sub index value sin whereas to compare with weighted functions sub index values were multiplied by their corresponding weights i e xn sin wn once the mlr wqi scores were predicted scatter plots were produced to visualize the relationship between the original and mlr predicted wqi scores and obtain the r2 from the linear fit model to analyse the sensitivity of wqi model three other common statistical measures of model performance were also used to help assess model sensitivity and uncertainty these were i root mean squared error rmse ii mean absolute error mae and iii mean squared error mse defined as follows 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 10 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean of the predicted values 4 results and discussion the following sections present results from the xgboost model validation exercise the various stages of the wqi model process and comparative analysis of the eight aggregation functions assessed 4 1 xgboost validation table 6 shows the final tuned hyperparameter values for the xgboost model obtained using the grid search optimization method these were the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the lowest rmses between the predicted and observed water quality statuses the average rmses are presented in table 7 for each of the five folds of the final optimised model a maximum tree depth of 10 was used for the summer analysis and 6 for winter to increase the maximum effects of interactions between variables a learning rate of 0 05 and 0 01 were applied for 3400 and 600 trials for summer and winter respectively whereas model training and testing accuracy was found to be 0 96 and 0 67 for the summer and 1 for both the winter respectively which are acceptable levels of accuracy another measure of model performance is the auc roc area under the curve receiver operating characteristics curve feng et al 2018 huan et al 2020 of particular interest is the auc value with a value of 1 indicating an excellent model and 0 indicating a poor model walter 2005 table 7 shows the auc values for the 5 folds of the optimised model for both the summer and winter seasons the auc was estimated 0 98 and 1 respectively for all of the training iterations the log loss error is a commonly used probability based metric which can be plotted for each model iteration to produce a model learning curve which shows how model performance varies with each iteration fig 3 presents the model learning curves for the training and test datasets for both summer and winter for the optimized model the x axis shows the number of iterations of trees added to the ensemble and the y axis shows the log loss of the model as desired the log loss error reduces with each iteration showing improved model performance both figures show that the model performance is better during training blue line than testing red line as would be expected the test model performance is better for the winter season but the summer performance is also acceptable 4 2 analysis of wqi model components this section of the study presents results from each of the wqi s four model components to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology to cork harbour 4 2 1 indicator selection the validated xgboost model was used to select water quality indicators for inclusion in the wqi of cork harbour based on their relative importance in terms of contribution to water quality status xgboost outputs an importance matrix with a number of different importance metrics one of these metrics the importance score is used here to rank indicators as it implies the relative contribution of the respective indicators to the model calculated by taking each indicator s contribution for each tree in the model table 8 shows the relative importance results obtained from the xgboost algorithm seven of the ten water quality variables were determined as important for summer and five were deemed important for winter the highest importance scores obtained for summer were tran din temp and chl whereas the lowest importance scores were calculated for amn mrp and bod5 for winter the highest importance values were obtained for ton and din and the lowest for tran and dox while the selection of indicators was broadly in line with those of previous studies chen et al 2020 nong et al 2020 wu et al 2021 most wqi studies have previously assigned the highest priority to dox however this key difference is likely due to the fact that most previous studies were focussed on fresh waterbodies while this one is focussed on marine waters 4 2 1 1 reliability of xgboost output using outlier detection analysis fig 4 provides a statistical overview of the summer and winter indicator values input to the xgboost model these variables obviously have impact on water quality in cork harbour over the study period comparatively a significant statistical difference was found in water quality variables between seasons in cork harbour the maximum standard deviation was found for chl dox din and ton for summer while it was observed for dox din and ton for winter this means these indicators concentrations are not distributed evenly in cork harbour over the monitoring periods for the determination of water quality indicator impacts on the xgboost model outlier detection analysis was carried out on the water quality dataset fig 4 presents the results of the whisker box plots analysis for detecting data outliers of the model input variables outlier results were validated using dixon s q test see rorabacher 1991 for details because this technique is widely used in statistics for the identification and rejection of outliers as shown in fig 4 chl dox bod5 ph and temp are normally distributed during summer while dox din amn ph temp ton and tran are normally distributed during winter these water quality indicators had a significant positive effect on the xgboost model and these indicators meet with the coastal water quality standard values on the other hand outliers were detected for mrp din amn ton and tran during summer and for chl mrp and bod5 in winter the outlier results indicate that these water quality indicators had extremely negative impacts on water quality in cork harbour consequently the average wqi value in cork harbour decreases due to these variables but as can be seen from table 8 above xgboost does not regard ton as a critical variable for the summer season nor chl bod5 and mrp for the winter season when the results are compared to the standard values of coastal water quality it is seen that the xgboost algorithm does not completely accurately identify the most influential indicators of water quality although the xgboost algorithm is widely used in machine learning techniques for selecting critical attributes in a dataset these results show that it should be used with care when identifying critical water quality indicators 4 2 2 si function fig 5 shows the summer si values calculated using eqs 4 7 for all ten water quality indicators at all of the monitoring stations each black dot represents the si value at a particular station for the particular indicator si 100 indicates excellent water quality while si 0 indicates the poorest water quality the values are presented in tabular form in annex 1 f and 1 g a number of studies have revealed that the sub indexing method is one of the major contributors to uncertainty in wqi models abbasi and abbasi 2012 sutadian et al 2018 juwana et al 2016 uddin et al 2021 commonly uncertainty is produced by the si method when it estimates smaller values without any input indicators exceeding the critical indicator thresholds another complication arises when the si function estimates higher values for input indicators that exceed the critical indicator thresholds these types of problems are well known as ambiguity in wqi models to avoid model ambiguity from this step the present research proposed three si functions that were implemented based on appropriate coastal water quality standards comparison of the si graphs in fig 5 with the si functions and standards in table 2 show that a larger si value is only calculated when the actual concentration of the indicator fall below or within the permissible thresholds otherwise a smaller si value is calculated the si results obtained from eqs 4 6 can be compared using the statistical summary in fig 6 a significant difference was found between the summer and winter si values relatively higher si values were obtained during summer than winter looking at the individual indicators the largest ranges were found for tran din and chl during summer and for tran din and ton during winter tran had the greatest range of variation ranging from 0 to 100 with an average and standard deviation of 68 46 and 58 6 49 for the summer and winter seasons respectively din values ranged from 0 to 97 in the summer and 0 to 87 in the winter with an average and standard deviation of 43 4 43 in the summer and 21 4 31 in the winter chl summer values ranged from 27 to 93 with an average and standard deviation of 62 5 22 while ton winter values ranged from 0 to 93 with an average and standard deviation of 30 6 35 regarding spatial variation of si in the harbour si values were lower in the upper and lower harbour and higher in the outer harbour annex 1 f 1 g this is as expected as fig 2 shows that all of the wwtps that discharge effluent to the harbour are located in the upper and lower harbour regions taken as a whole the results of si functions appear to reflect the true state of the water quality indicators in cork harbour the si functions presented here are fundamentally different from existing si procedures in the literature because they are developed specifically for coastal water quality 4 2 3 weight factor table 9 presents the weights calculated for the ranked indicators using the roc method the weights follow the same order as the rankings of model indicators with tran din temp and chl having the largest weight values for the summer and ton din and ph having the highest weight values for winter the weighting method used here should reduce model uncertainty compared to other models which use weightings based on expert opinions 4 2 4 aggregation function wqi scores eight different aggregation functions were used to calculate wqi values in this study the aggregation functions were classified into two types for analysis i weighted functions and ii unweighted functions fig 7 shows the range of wqi scores computed by each function throughout cork harbour for the summer and winter periods as might be expected wqi values were significantly different between functions the effect of using a weighting in the aggregation function is very clear in general the weighted functions produced a much greater spread of scores and lower mean scores in both summer and winter the weighted functions appear to be much more sensitive to the input water quality values directly comparing the nsf scores which uses a weighted arithmetic mean wam function with those from the unweighted arithmetic mean function am the same observations can be made with the exception of the hanh function weighted function scores showed much greater seasonal variation than the unweighted function scores again indicating that the weighted functions are more sensitive to the input water quality values finally the ccme model function appears to be highly insensitive to variations in the input water quality data it produced very similar scores for both summer and winter and very little variation in scores across the harbour this may be due to eclipsing problems commonly the eclipsing problem occurs due to overestimation of the wqi index by the aggregation function most commonly eclipsing occurs when some water quality indicator values exceed their critical levels but the overall index does not reflect this the extent to which eclipsing affected the aggregation functions was determined by checking compliance of the water quality measurements for the indicators included in the wqi models with their guideline values to determine the numbers of breaches of the guideline values at each monitoring station these numbers were then compared with the typical number of breaches of recommended guideline values that might be expected for a wqi classification table 10 for example one would not expect any breach of guideline values for any indicator where a classification of good status was determined by the model for any station if the number of breaches was greater than expected for a particular water quality status then the aggregation function was deemed to have overestimated the water quality status and if the number of breaches was less than expected then the function was deemed to have underestimated the status annex 1 d and 1 e present the occurrences of eclipsing for the different wqi aggregation functions the results are summarised in table 11 which shows the total numbers of instances of eclipsing for each function from table 11 eclipsing is seen to occur for all aggregation functions during both seasons instances of eclipsing were more prevalent for the weighted functions the nsf srdd and wj functions all resulted in much higher eclipsing numbers than the highest of the unweighted functions 25 for ccme of the weighted functions the wqm method was clearly the best performer in terms of eclipsing with just 17 instances compared to the next best of 37 for nsf of the unweighted functions the am method resulted in the lowest number 9 compared to 15 and 17 for rms and hanh respectively there was a slight seasonal bias towards eclipsing with 5 of the 8 functions yielding higher instances in winter than summer there also appeared to be a spatial bias towards eclipsing as during both seasons across all functions the majority of cases of eclipsing were found in monitoring sites in the upper harbour see annex 1 d and 1 e the underestimating eclipsing problem was observed more often across all aggregation functions with the exception of the ccme function which suffered more from overestimation 20 of the 25 ccme instances of eclipsing were overestimation during summer the ccme function determined good water quality status at many monitoring locations in cork harbour even though some of the water quality indicators at those locations exceeded the guideline values all 12 summer instances of eclipsing were overestimation for winter 8 of the 13 eclipsing instances were overestimation it can be concluded that the ccme displays a consistent bias towards attributing higher water quality status even when that is not the case ambiguity is another important source of the wqi model uncertainty ambiguity hides the actual water quality information contained in the model inputs consequently the model produces considerable uncertainty that results in the misclassification of water quality for environmental managers or assessors commonly two types of ambiguity contribute to uncertainty type i underestimation ambiguity if the aggregation function estimates a smaller index without any of the sub indices exceeding the critical level nearly zero or unacceptable value type ii overestimation ambiguity if the aggregation function estimates a larger index with one or more sub indices exceeding the critical level nearly zero or unacceptable value the results show type i ambiguity having occurred in the weighted srdd and wj models during both seasons the aggregation functions have calculated lower index values but the si values do not reflect this annex 1 f 1 g type ii ambiguity occurred in the unweighted ccme methodology for both seasons with higher index values calculated for all monitoring locations even though the si values contain some low values relatively the nsf and wqm and unweighted am and rms aggregation methods produce indices during both seasons that reflect the true quality of the water another significant aspect of the aggregation functions is the relationship between them to assess the similarity of model results the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated with r software using the ggcorplot package the statistical significance level was set at 0 01 as shown in fig 8 all wqi functions with the exception of the ccme were highly positively associated with one another for both seasons 4 3 spatio temporal variability of different wqi methods fig 9 presents the wqi scores computed at each monitoring location by the different aggregation functions it can be seen that the wqi scores varied significantly across the monitoring locations in cork harbour during both seasons higher wqi values were found in the lower and outer harbour for all functions comparatively lower values were found in the upper monitoring stations of harbour over the study period for all of the wqi functions there was a significant temporal variation between seasons the results of the wqi models show that the water quality in the harbour degrades significantly during the winter at all monitoring sites the advanced geo statistical empirical bayesian kriging ebk technique was utilized to spatially interpolate calculated wqi scores at the monitoring stations onto the whole domain of cork harbour esri 2016 mcmanus et al 2020 rahman and harding 2016 a detailed description of the procedure can be found in uddin et al 2020 figs 10 and 11 show the spatial and temporal variations of wqi scores in cork harbour throughout the summer and winter seasons respectively relatively all of the functions computed higher wqi scores in the outer habour while lower index scores were obtained in the upper habour according to recent studies the upper harbour has received significant pollutant loads from a variety of sources over the years including farmlands wwtps industries etc epa 2018 hartnett and nash 2015 there was a greater difference in spatial variation between the weighted and unweighted techniques over the study periods fig 12 shows the spatial variation in the standard deviations of the indices computed by the different wqi models during both seasons the wqi scores predicted by the different models at monitoring stations in the upper harbour varied significantly more than those predicted by the different models in the lower and outer areas of the harbour when comparing the weighted and unweighted models the unweighted method had the lowest deviation during the summer season while the weighted methods had the highest during the winter season the results show that the spatial distribution of water quality factors can have a significant impact on the wqi model because a higher density of diverse water quality was observed in the present study in the upper harbour 4 4 comparative analysis of wqi model performance mlr analysis was used to predict wqi scores in order to compare model performance all statistical analyses were conducted at a significance level of 0 05 r2 rmse mse and mae were used to evaluate the performance of the mlr models versus the wqi functions the r2 for the regression analysis of wqi scores are shown in figs 13 16 for the weighted summer and winter and unweighted summer and winter aggregation models looking at the weighted models a significant difference was found between seasons over the models similarly high levels of agreement r2 0 9 were observed for all unweighted functions for the summer while poorer agreements were observed in winter for the nsf wj and particularly the srdd models the wqm model showed highest levels of agreement with 91 and 97 of prediction variance in summer and winter respectively in contrast there is a significant variation in r2 values for the unweighted prediction models during both seasons a higher proportion of variance 92 and 97 respectively for summer and winter is explained by the am model than any other unweighted model there were also high levels of correlation for the rms model 89 and 79 of the variance was explained for summer and winter respectively poor correlations were found for the ccme model with just 72 and 70 of variance explained in summer and winter respectively rmse mae and mse statistical metrics for the mlr models are shown in fig 17 smaller values close to zero of the metrics indicate better performance of the mlr model as shown in fig 17 during both seasons rmse mae and mse are lowest for the weighted wqm models while the highest prediction errors was calculated for the srdd and wj models respectively in contrast the unweighted hanh model exhibits the highest errors during both seasons the hanh model performance varied significantly between seasons the highest rmse mae and mse were found during the winter season whereas the lowest during the summer season the results of the performance metrics reveal that of the weighted models the wqm wqi model exhibits excellent performance and the best fit for the predicted wqi scores overall the am and ccme models had the lowest model error for both seasons ranking the models in terms of sensitivity it was found that the wqm aggregation function was more sensitive than other aggregation functions this approach also had less error than other weighted methods based on the mlr model performance metrics the methodology has a distinct advantage in terms of eclipsing and ambiguity problems over the other methodologies the nsf function while being less sensitive than the wqm showed better sensitivity than the wj and the srdd models looking at the unweighted functions the pooret sensitivity was found for the ccme and hanh functions in the summer and winter seasons respectively whereas the am showed high sensitivity during both seasons model performances were ranked see table 12 taking on the r2 values from figs 13 16 above as a measure of model sensitivity and the rmse values from fig 17 as a measure of prediction error taking the weighted models as an example models were first scored from 1 4 separately for each metric with 1 indicating best performance and 4 worst these scores were then added giving each metric equal weighting and the models ranked based on the cumulative scores for the weighted models table 12 shows that the wqm model was ranked first for both seasons for the unweighted models the am model was ranked first for both seasons 5 comparison of water quality statuses the ultimate goal of the wqi model is to assess water quality and determine its status for the purpose of coastal water quality assessment the results presented thus far suggest that the weighted wqm and unweighted am approaches are the most appropriate techniques for calculating wqi scores as they suffered least from eclipsing and ambiguity difficulties fig 18 shows the computed water quality status at 29 monitoring stations in cork harbour for the wqm and the am methods table 13 provides the percentage of stations attributed particular statuses by the two methods in summer the wqm method classified 72 of stations as fair and 28 good while the am method classified 69 as fair and 31 good from fig 18 a and b it can be seen that fair water quality was found in the upper part of the harbour river lee glashaboy river and river owenacurra for both methods in the area that is most strongly affected by urban pressures epa 2017 during the winter period the wqm method classified 38 of stations as marginal 48 as fair and 14 as good whereas the am method classified 38 of stations as marginal 45 as fair and 17 good as seen in fig 18 c and d the poorest water quality was assessed in the upper harbour by both methods while the best water quality was found in the lower and outer harbour however the qualitative assessment of wqi models showed a significant spatial variation of water quality classes in cork harbour this could be due to the combined impacts of various edaphic and non edaphic activities on harbour water xia et al 2015 a number of factors can contribute to poor water quality including industrial effluents home waste and agricultural activities farming fishing etc in the upper harbour in this study all wqi methods used the same indicators and si values to calculate wqi the results of the study show that there are considerable differences in wqi model outcomes for similar water quality inputs the differences are therefore entirely due to the different aggregation functions and use of weighted versus unweighted aggregation functions 6 conclusion the main aim of this study was to develop an improved wqi methodology for assessment of coastal water quality this was achieved by using the xgboost machine learning algorithm to identify water quality indicators for inclusion in a wqi model using the xgboost rankings the rank order centroid weighting method to attribute sub index weightings and testing a large number of aggregation functions to determine their input on model performance the key conclusions from the research are as follows xgboost can be used to objectively rank water quality indicators based on their significance in terms of water quality although xgboost was shown to work well here it requires further investigation using longer term datasets its s use requires both input i e indicator data and some desired output which here was an initial water quality status determined using binary analysis of the indicator data however the xgboost ranking is sensitive to the desired output and it should therefore be carefully chosen the rank order centroid weighting method is a useful means of objectively weighting the indicators in a wqi model but it must be used in conjunction with some ranking method such as the xgboost method use of objective mathematical approaches like these have the potential to reduce model uncertainty that might be introduced by the use of rankings weightings based on expert opinion which can obviously vary between expert the assessment of aggregation functions found that a weighted quadratic mean aggregation function and an unweighted arithmetic mean function resulted in the lowest instances of eclipsing and ambiguity and are therefore recommended for wqi approaches however the present study only used one year of monitoring data and their performance in mutli year analyses should be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors state that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that the work

15891,the mechanisms controlling arsenic as enrichment and mobilization associated with human health risk assessment of groundwater in the longdong basin located in the southern part of the loess plateau china have been yet unexplained this uncertainty is partly attributed to a poor understanding of groundwater arsenic management to address this problem this study investigated the occurrence and spatial distribution of as in unconfined groundwater ug and confined groundwater cg in the study area integrated self organizing maps som and geochemical modeling to elucidate the mechanisms controlling as release and mobilization in groundwater and conducted a health risk assessment of groundwater as the results showed that 13 6 of ug samples n 66 and 22 4 of cg samples n 98 exceeded the who guideline limit of as 10 μg l the detailed hydrogeochemical studies showed that as enrichment groundwater is dominated by cl na type and gaillardet diagram indicated that evaporites weathering may contribute to as mobilization in cg the som analysis combined with spearman s correlation coefficient quantified the negative correlation between as and redox potential dissolved oxygen so4 2 no3 and the positive correlation between as and hco3 mn in ug in cg as is positively correlated to ph and negatively to electrical conductivity so4 2 fe and mn the saturation indices of the mineral phases indicates an insignificant relationship between as and fe we conclude that under oxidizing conditions evaporative controls and the desorption of fe oxides under alkaline and high salinity conditions are the dominant mechanisms controlling as release and mobilization in groundwater in addition exposure to groundwater as through drinking water posed potential risk of carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on children and adults this study contributes to groundwater as management and sustainable safe groundwater supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic

to 2 d component planes nguyen et al 2015 pandey et al 2015 yin et al 2021 however an important feature of som is the visual interpretation of the nonlinear relationship between variables santos et al 2020 which can be coupled with hydrogeochemical analysis to delineate the mechanisms controlling groundwater hydrochemistry prior studies mostly used linear correlation to represent the relationship between as and physical and chemical parameters kumar et al 2017 mahanta et al 2015 mushtaq et al 2018 however the hydrogeochemical processes associated with as mobilization has a nonlinear relationship with as concentration smedley and kinniburgh 2013 which determines the complex mechanism of as mobilization in groundwater so far som combined with spearman s correlation analysis and

semi arid areas groundwater is a long term source of drinking water and people are exposed to arsenic for a long time and there is a risk of adverse effects on the human body long term exposure to arsenic could have potentially carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on human health known as arsenic poisoning disease which can lead to some cancers such as skin bladder kidney and lung cancer as well as vascular disease ahmed et al 2021 finding out the health risks of groundwater as in a specific area will conduce to understand the environmental and geological effects of as the threat of as to human body can be quantitatively represented by a health risk assessment model which were used to examine whether exposure to as could increase incidence of the adverse effects on human health chandrajith et al 2020 machado et al 2020 rinklebe et al 2019 two as speciation i e as iii as v were observed in nature and the toxicity of as iii is 60 times that of as v coddington 1986 nevertheless both of them are related to human toxicity because as v is first reduced to as iii followed by methylated in the human digestive system therefore this study mainly focuses on total as concentration in groundwater due to the fundamental difference of aquifer materials between unconfined aquifer i e quaternary pleistocene loess and confined aquifer i e cretaceous sandstone more importantly an obvious difference is that the occurrence and distribution characteristics of as in unconfined and confined aquifers therefore the distinguishing assessments of the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects of as in unconfined and confined aquifers based on health risk assessment model are of great guiding significance for the safe and sustainable groundwater supply to date no literature has deciphered the detailed hydrogeochemical processes associated with groundwater as mobilization in the study area making it a novel contribution to understanding the controlling mechanism of as mobilization the objectives of this study were to delineate the occurrence characteristic of as in unconfined groundwater ug and confined groundwater cg identify the controlling mechanisms of as enrichment in groundwater and evaluate the health risk i e carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk of as in groundwater for these purposes we integrated statistical methods self organizing maps som and geochemical modeling to elucidate as distribution hydrogeochemical characteristics of as enrichment groundwater and the main mechanisms affecting as mobilization in groundwater based on the physical and chemical parameters additionally the health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the as induced potential health risk including carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks 2 study area 2 1 topography and meteorology the study area belongs to the gully area of the loess plateau in the middle reaches of the yellow river the geomorphological characteristics are dominated loess hills the terrain is high on the east north and west and low in the middle and south fig 1 thus forming a basin the climate characteristics of the study area are mainly manifested as low precipitation high evaporation and low humidity the precipitation is unevenly distributed in time and space from a spatial perspective the precipitation decreases from south to north while the annual precipitation in the north is only 350 mm zhao et al 2013 in terms of the temporal variability of precipitation which is concentrated in july to september accounting for 70 of the annual precipitation the spatial variation of evaporation is increasing from south to north the evaporation is generally 2 5 4 times the precipitation and the potential evaporation in the north reaches 1700 mm there are three rivers i e malian river pu river and hulu river in the study area malian river the secondary tributary of the wei river is the main river in the study area 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is widely distributed in the lower cretaceous k1 with large thickness gentle occurrence and wide spreading range which is an important water bearing horizon the baoan group is mainly distributed in the study area which can be divided into four rock groups i e luohe formation k1l huanhe formation k1h luohandong formation k1lh and jingchuan formation k1jc based on the characteristics of lithology and lithofacies figure s1 the water bearing formations in the study area mainly includes the cretaceous clastic water bearing system i e luohe formation huanhe formation and luohandong formation and the quaternary loose rock water bearing system respectively which refers to confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer respectively the confined and unconfined aquifers have different patterns of occurrence burial conditions distribution ranges and circulation characteristics forming the relatively independent aquifers the occurrence laws burial conditions distribution ranges and circulation characteristics of each water bearing formation are different which constitutes a relatively independent unified water bearing body 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis groundwater samples from unconfined

cations and trace element analysis groundwater samples were acidified to ph 2 in the field with ultrapure hno3 and were collected in 500 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles for laboratory analysis however non acidified samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for anion and other water quality parameters analysis all the groundwater samples were stored in a refrigerator

show that the relative standard deviation rsd is less than 5 during the test the national standard samples and groundwater samples were spiked for recovery analysis to check the recovery rate data reliability was checked by calculating the charge balance error cbe and the data with cbe greater than 10 was excluded moreover the censored data i e the measured data below dl were considered when they constituted less than 30 of total number of samples and three quarters of each variable s dl was assigned to them ultimately the groundwater samples used for hydrogeochemical analysis som analysis and statistical analysis in this study were 66 ug samples and 98 cg samples 3 3 self organizing maps som algorithm som also known as kohonen map is an unsupervised artificial neural network which is trained using competitive learning strategies and relying on the competition between neurons to gradually optimize the network som uses the neighborhood function to maintain the original topology of the input data the network structure of som consists of an input layer and an output layer i e competitive layer each input layer is an m dimensional vector x x1 x2 xm determined by m variables of data set li et al 2018c melo et al 2019 the output layer is a two dimensional 2 d discrete visual map which is composed of n neurons i e nodes connected in hexagonal lattice the som algorithm was used to investigate the main affecting factors controlling the mechanism of as enrichment in groundwater there are no strict rules for determining the number of neurons park et al 2014 which was selected according to a heuristic equation 5 n n represents the number of samples vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 based on this the som with different map sizes were trained and the architectures from 8 5 and 7 7 were selected as the appropriate number of output neurons in ug and cg respectively som is most commonly used for cluster analysis since the main goal of this study is to determine the correlation between as and various physical and chemical parameters we did not use som for cluster analysis but used it for correlation hunting therefore each component plane that preserving the original topology was used to identify the correlation between as and the other parameters the pairwise correlations can be determined by comparing the color patterns presented by the component planes similar color patterns of two maps represent the possibility of a positive correlation between the corresponding variables while the opposite color patterns indicate the negative correlation to quantify the nonlinear correlation between as and the other physical and chemical parameters spearman s correlation coefficient ρ a nonparametric measure of rank correlation was used to calculate the as maps and the other maps based on som analysis in this study som analysis was performed using the som toolbox2 1 vatanen et al 2015 the toolbox was free available at https github com ilarinieminen som toolbox for software matlab 2014b in addition the spearman s ρ was calculated through ms excel 3 4 geochemical modeling the geochemical processes including oxidation or reductive dissolution of as bearing sulfide minerals e g feass and fe hydroxide which promotes as release from minerals into groundwater geochemical modeling is an effective tool to reveal the mechanism of as release caused by these processes in this study the phreeqc was used to calculated saturation index si log iap kt iap is the ion activity product while kt is the equilibrium constant of various as bearing minerals to determine the types of minerals controlling as in groundwater the steps for calculating si by phreeqc can be found in text s1 in supplementary material gaillardet diagram depicts the na normalized molar ratio mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na to identify the mineral chemical weathering and to examine the main controlling lithology gaillardet et al 1999 the gaillardet diagram is divided into three end members which are carbonates silicates and evaporites moreover eh ph diagram pourbaix diagram can be used to delineate the speciation and condition under which as exists stably in an aqueous system with a specific potential redox condition and ph villa lojo et al 1997 3 5 health risk assessment model this study evaluated the effects of as in groundwater on human health based on the health risk assessment model recommended by the usepa usepa 1989 and ministry of ecology and environment of the p r china meec 2020 health risk assessment includes the following four steps 3 5 1 hazard identification in this study the hazard was represented by arsenic concentration in groundwater the world health organization has set a threshold of 10 μg l of arsenic in drinking water most of the study area is a semi arid area safe water supply and water treatment facilities are not guaranteed and groundwater is the main source of drinking water arsenic in groundwater enters the human body through the drinking water pathway and is associated with an increased incidence of certain adverse health effects e g cancer 3 5 2 dose response relationship a dose response relationship describes the correlation between the likelihood and severity of adverse health effects and dose exposure to contaminants usepa 2018 understanding the dose response relationship can help estimate health risks and prevent future arsenic poisoning in arsenic prevailing areas there are two dose response relationship 1 nonlinear dose response relationship the nonlinear dose response relationship is derived from the threshold assumption which is defined as the dose at which no harmful effects are expected to occur the reference dose rfd is widely used to represent this dose which is defined as an estimate of a daily exposure to the human population including sensitive population that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime usepa 2018 rfd has been widely used to many studies and is usually assigned as 3 0 10 4 mg kg day navoni et al 2014 phan et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the nonlinear dose response relationship is widely used to assess carcinogenic effects 1 linear dose response relationship a linear dose response relationship indicates that there is no threshold for toxicity and there is theoretically no exposure level to a chemical arsenic in this study a slope factor sf is used to characterize this linear relationship which is defined as the risk of exposure levels falling along a straight line linear dose response relationship is often used to estimate cancer risk 3 5 3 exposure assessment exposure assessment measures or estimates the magnitude frequency and duration of exposure to as drinking water exposure to as is one of the significant exposure route the calculation model is as follow usepa 1989 1 d i c w i r e f e d b w a t where di the daily intake of groundwater for drinking through oral pathway mg kg d cw as concentration in groundwater mg l ir ingestion rate of groundwater l d ef exposure frequency d yr in this study a daily exposure frequency 365 d yr is selected considering the long time average contact rate means 1989 ed exposure duration yr indicating the number of years that individual exposure to as through drinking water over a lifetime bw average body weight over the exposure period kg at average time of exposure d in this study at ed 365 for non carcinogenic effects and for carcinogenic effects at the expected average lifespan 365 in this study at is 76 9 years old which can be accessed from the website of qingyang the administrative district to which the study area belongs municipal health commission http wsjk zgqingyang gov cn 3 5 4 risk assessment health risks include carcinogenic risks and non carcinogenic risks for carcinogenic risk assessment representing the additional risk of contracting cancer in a person s lifetime which can be estimated using the model recommended by usepa the formula is as follows 2 c r d i s f where cr represents the probability of an individual developing cancer sf denotes the carcinogenic slope factor equal to 1 5 mg kg d usepa 2018 which can be used to convert estimated daily intakes of exposure to incremental risk of an individual developing cancer means 1989 the acceptable limit of cancer risk was set to 1 10 4 shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq quantifies the risk of non carcinogenic effects which is expressed by the following formula 3 n c h q d i r f d where nchq represents the quantitative carcinogenic effects rfd represents the reference dose equal to 3 4 10 4 mg kg d usepa 2018 when hchq is greater than 1 representing the possibility of exposure to cancer risk shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 arsenic concentration in groundwater as concentrations in ug and cg were investigated fig 2 the as concentration in cg showed a wider range 0 4 48 4 μg l with a median concentration of 5 35 μg l while as concentration in ug ranges from 0 9 to 22 2 μg l with a median concentration of 3 85 μg l the median and 90th percentile as concentrations in ug were 3 9 and 13 μg l respectively fig 2b in cg however the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 5 and 14 μg l respectively in ug and cg 13 6 and 22 4 of samples exceeded the drinking water limits of 10 μg l who 2011 for as respectively the spatial distribution of arsenic in ug and cg in the study area is shown in fig 3 high as groundwater 10 μg l is mainly distributed in low lying areas that is the valleys of rivers which are groundwater drainage areas in hydrogeology figure s2 this distribution may be due to the slow groundwater flow rate which caused the accumulation of as in this zone which suggested the hydrological control of as mobilization on the whole as concentrations in cg and ug in the northwest of the study area are relatively high which may be related to the original geological environment and lithofacies paleogeography e g high salinity groundwater the following sections will introduce the controlling mechanisms of high as groundwater 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of arsenic enrichment groundwater the descriptive statistics of various physical and chemical parameters in groundwater i e ug and cg were shown in table 1 the ph was alkaline and spanned 7 3 8 32 mean 7 76 sd 0 23 and 7 1 8 62 mean 7 81 sd 0 27 respectively the groundwater salinity in ug and cg varied significantly with ec values spanning 0 26 10 34 ms cm mean 1 79 ms cm sd 2 07 ms cm and 0 44 12 44 ms cm mean 3 80 ms cm sd 2 55 ms cm as well as tds ranging from 260 to 9080 mg l and 289 14 041 mg l respectively in addition 27 3 of ug samples and 81 6 of cg samples showed tds value greater than 1000 mg l the cations in ug and cg were both dominated by na with the mean concentration of 258 54 and 736 5 mg l respectively so4 2 was the dominant anion in ug mean 371 54 mg l sd 642 58 mg l and cg mean 1203 mg l sd 956 53 mg l followed by cl with the mean concentration of 317 31 and 451 mg l in ug and cg respectively the mean concentration of ca2 and mg2 were 87 55 and 93 mg l in ug while the mean value of 95 9 and 55 5 mg l in cg respectively table 1 piper trilinear diagram delineate the possible hydrogeochemical facies of as enrichment groundwater in addition the piper trilinear diagram was used to highlight the variations in as concentrations with changing hydrogeochemistry the results suggested that na cl type groundwater dominantly associated with as enrichment groundwater fig 4 which indicated that the possible contribution of high salinity to high as groundwater wang et al 2019a 4 3 deciphering the nonlinear relationship between as and physicochemical parameters using som the physical and chemical variables e g ph orp do ec na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f tds cod fe mn representing the geochemical process controlling the release and mobilization of as were presented in the 2 d component planes using som fig 5 which helps quantify the relationships between as and multiple variables the as toroidal map showed that the maximum values of arsenic component plane toroidal map is located in the lower left corner of the map the minimum values of arsenic component plane in ug is located in the upper right corner of the map while the minimum values in cg is in the upper right of the map the correlations between multiple variables could be determined by maintaining the same relative topological distribution values in pairs between component planes to quantify the nonlinear relationship between as and multiple variables based on som analysis results the spearman s correlation coefficient fig 6 was used to represent the influence of different parameters on as concentrations based on the output of som the as concentration in cg was observed to increase with the increasing ph and has a positive correlation ρ 0 57 while as in ug has no obvious correlation with ph which may indicate that the different controlling mechanism of as in ug and cg the relationship between as concentration and ph is mainly manifested in that acid base conditions control the desorption or adsorption of as from the arsenate arsenite mineral surface ayotte et al 2003 kim et al 2012 nicolli et al 2010 although the positive correlation between as and ph has been reported in previous studies and higher ph leads to an increase in the desorption rate of arsenate however high as concentration 10 μg l does not always appear with high ph in groundwater ayotte et al 2003 in this study a weak correlation between as and ph was observed in ug which indicated that ph has minimum effect on as enrichment and mobilization additionally alkaline conditions may contribute to the desorption and enrichment of as in groundwater zeng et al 2018 and ph ranges from 7 5 to 8 1 in ug with high as concentration while the ph spans from 7 7 to 8 4 in cg fig s3a bicarbonate can promote the mobilization of as by competing for adsorption sites and forming arsenic bicarbonate complexes bhattacharya et al 2006 kim et al 2003 guo et al 2011 as well as extracting as from fe mn oxyhydroxides in the sediment anawar et al 2004 however a poor correlation of as with hco3 was observed fig 6b fig s3f the complex correlation between as and hco3 indicates that the mobilization of as is affected by many factors and there are many sources of hco3 most of groundwater samples with high as concentration have lower so4 2 concentration fig s3b and the negative correlation between as and so4 2 was observed ug ρ 0 40 cg ρ 0 73 fig 6 which may be caused by the so4 2 promoting as release from the surface of sediments into groundwater through surface competitive adsorption ayotte et al 2003 cheng et al 2009 li et al 2018b radu et al 2005 moreover it may indicate that as could not directly mobilized from as bearing sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite halim et al 2009 harvey et al 2005 the complex correlation between as and no3 was observed ug ρ 0 5 cg ρ 0 36 as shown in fig 6 exhibiting that low no3 concentration exists in high as concentration in ug the reason may be that the no3 reduction denitrification occurred then the subsequent redox sequence of as v reduction limits the reduction of arsenic zhang et al 2018a zeng et al 2018 however the thermodynamically stable no3 environment is still sufficiently oxidizing as evidenced by orp which hinders the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe mn oxides according to the redox sequence o2 no3 fe3 so4 2 ch4 during the no3 reduction i g denitrification stage arsenic is adsorbed on fe mn oxides minerals and is rarely released into groundwater postma et al 2007 xie et al 2009 moreover the insignificant correlation between as and no3 was observed in cg indicating that no3 is not closely associated with high as groundwater as concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with dissolved fe concentration ρ 0 66 in cg fig 6b which may indicate that fe precipitates in the form of fe oxides hydroxides in an oxidizing environment or high ph conditions shakoor et al 2018 therefore it can promote the release of as due to water rock interface reactions generally the release of as may be associated with the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides or hydroxides smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however the poor correlation between dissolved fe and as in ug fig 6a indicated a low possibility that as may result from the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides or hydroxides under this environment so4 2 was reduced to s2 and combine with fe mn to form arsenic containing minerals resulting in a decrease of fe mn concentration zeng et al 2018 the orp in ug ranges from 14 to 287 mv while span from 52 to 219 mv in cg fig 6 showed that the correlation between as and orp is not significant which indicated that redox conditions are not the only factor that controls the release and mobilization processes of as and other factors also play a crucial role 4 4 controlling mechanisms of arsenic in groundwater hydrogeochemical processes control the release and mobilization of arsenic hydrogeochemical processes appear to be controlling arsenic adsorption and its mobilization in groundwater mushtaq et al 2018 li et al 2020 among the hydrogeochemical processes include water rock interaction bibi et al 2021 oxidative dissolution processes of as bearing sulfide minerals like feass hussain et al 2021 reductive dissolution and desorption of as from fe oxides oxyhydroxides or clay minerals bhattacharya et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2011 which were responsible for as mobilization in groundwater the oxidation reaction process of as bearing sulfide minerals e g arsenopyrite was responsible for the processes of as release in groundwater das et al 1996 schreiber et al 2000 which was illustrated as f e a s s 7 2 o 2 4 h 2 o f e o h 3 a s o 4 3 s o 4 2 5 h f e s a s s 7 2 o 2 h 2 o f e 3 s o 4 2 a s o 4 3 2 h f e s 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o f e o h 3 2 h 2 s o 4 arsenopyrite feass is very soluble and usually cannot reach its solubility product therefore ferric hydroxide plays a more important role in controlling the concentration of dissolved arsenic however the negative correlation between as and so4 2 was observed fig 6 which does not support the hypothesis that as is derived from as bearing sulfide minerals the different speciation of as and fe in groundwater under reducing and oxidizing conditions result in different mechanisms of as release the eh ph diagram shows as speciation and oxidation reduction conditions at a particular ph and redox potential a common understanding of as speciation in aqueous solution is that as usually presents as arsenious acid i e h3aso30 h2aso3 and as iii and arsenic acid i e h2aso4 haso4 2 and as v nguyen and itoi 2009 identifying the speciation of as is of significance because as iii is more toxic than as v coddington 1986 the eh ph diagram of as suggests that the dominant as species in ug and cg was haso4 2 fig 7 a which was present under oxidizing conditions only one sample in cg is plotted on the stability field of h3aso30 which was present under reducing conditions for the iron speciation groundwater samples were plotted in the field of hematite fe2o3 fig 7b which indicated that iron oxides fe2o3 could play an important role in the release of as by comparing the arsenic release mechanisms in other countries with arsenic affected groundwater we concluded that polizzotto et al 2008 elucidated the mechanism of arsenic release under the control of reducing environment without sulfate reduction as the most common mechanism that can explain the release of arsenic from sediments or minerals it has been confirmed by some studies on the mechanism of groundwater arsenic enrichment in many areas of the world such as hetao basin guo et al 2008 datong basin xie et al 2009 yangtze river basin schaefer et al 2017 mekong river basin kocar et al 2008 and red river delta buschmann and berg 2009 eiche et al 2008 in this study however oxidative conditions prevailed in aquifers the groundwater is characterized by weak alkaline alkaline 7 5 8 5 high eh 200 mv which is similar to other previously published literatures mushtaq et al 2018 bibi et al 2021 nicolli et al 2010 this arsenic release mechanism represents that desorption of arsenic bearing fe oxides in oxidative conditions and competitive adsorption under moderate high ph conditions control arsenic release smedley and kinniburgh 2002 effects of desorption of arsenic at high ph under oxidizing conditions as enrichment groundwater is mostly neutral weakly alkaline fig 8 in ug and cg the correlation between as and hco3 was not significant fig 8a fig 8b as enrichment groundwater has high hco3 concentration was widely reported however relatively low concentrations of as are sometimes observed in groundwater with high hco3 which indicated that hco3 has a negligible effect on as adsorption biswas et al 2014 high hco3 concentration in groundwater under alkaline conditions could be associated with the precipitation of calcite and dolomite table 3 leading to as adsorption on calcite which explains the insignificant correlation between as and ca2 fig 8e fig 8f this could be contributed to as co precipitation with calcite or adsorption on ca arsenate supported by xie et al 2008 and ahn 2012 most of high arsenic 10 μg l groundwater samples are accompanied by weak alkaline alkaline 7 5 ph 8 5 and oxidative environments orp 100 mv fig 8c fig 8d this groundwater environment e g ph orp is similar to other areas mushtaq et al 2018 bibi et al 2021 nicolli et al 2010 which possibly indicated that contribution of the desorption of arsenic bearing fe oxides to arsenic release under oxidizing conditions prior studies have shown that iron precipitates in the form of fe oxides under oxidation and high ph conditions and plays an important role in the adsorption and desorption of as in groundwater which could be supported by smedley and kinniburgh 2002 under oxygen and near neutral aquifer conditions as is mainly adsorbed on the surface of fe oxides in the form of arsenate the increase in ph caused by rock weathering and related cation exchange leads to the desorption of as from the mineral surface moreover similar oxidation geochemical conditions e g high ph and alkalinity are related to as concentration on the control of as release in northern mexico argentina and spain were reported bundschuh et al 2004 giménez forcada and smedley 2014 nicolli et al 2012 evaporative process controls on the release and mobilization of as evaporative concentration and evaporites minerals weathering also contribute to the release and mobilization of as groundwater especially in arid and semi arid areas jia et al 2017 mladenov et al 2014 nicolli et al 2010 ortega guerrero 2017 wang et al 2019a gaillardet diagram fig 9 showed that most elevated as concentrations 10 μg l in cg were plotted in and near evaporites weathering zones which indicated that the contribution of evaporites weathering to as enrichment and mobilization in cg for confined aquifers due to lithofacies and paleogeographic conditions e g paleoclimate paleohydrology paleotopography sedimentary facies composition and distribution the aquifer medium has high soluble salt content and there are a large number of evaporite minerals then water rock interactions contribute to the high salinity groundwater hou et al 2008 xie et al 2004 and high salinity groundwater may facilitate the desorption of arsenic from oxides fe mn oxides surfaces into groundwater jia et al 2017 role of possible mineral phases in arsenic release and mobilization using phreeqc the adsorption and release of arsenic on fe mn oxide or oxyhydroxide are the result of the processes of minerals dissolution and precipitation which are determined by saturation index si the si of possible mineral phases were represented in table 2 geochemical modeling suggested that the positive si values were observed for fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases including goethite mean 6 16 in ug and 8 13 in cg hematite mean 14 50 in ug and 18 28 in cg and fe oh 3 mean 0 35 in ug and 2 24 in cg which indicated that the aquatic geochemical environment is conducive to the precipitation of these mineral phases shakoor et al 2018 additionally as concentration is related to the si of goethite hematite and fe oh 3 figure s4 which implied that fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases could possibly the main factor controlling the release of as for the result that as was desorbed from minerals into groundwater zhang et al 2017a carbonate minerals may also be responsible for arsenic retention release in aquifers rasool et al 2016 because co3 2 may form complexes at fe oxide surface sites and displace arsenic from mineral sediment surfaces leading to arsenic release into groundwater anawar et al 2004 in addition arsenic associated with carbonate minerals is susceptible to changes in wet and dry patterns and changes in water quality components such as ph and salinity lemonte et al 2017 geochemical modeling showed that unsaturated si 0 aquifer conditions prevail in unconfined and confined aquifers with regard to fe mn carbonate minerals including rhodochrosite mnco3 mean 2 10 in ug and 0 85 in cg and siderite feco3 mean 1 43 in ug and 1 41 in cg suggesting that iron and manganese carbonate minerals are unlikely to precipitate as determined by negative value of si this further indicated that these minerals phases may have not potential role in sorption desorption of as in groundwater bibi et al 2011 although the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxide has been widely considered as the significant mechanism of as release fendorf et al 2010 hasan et al 2009 pal et al 2002 zhang et al 2017a which was supported by the as mobilization in reducing aquifers of bangladesh mcarthur et al 2001 mladenov et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the oxidation conditions prevailing in groundwater in the study area were not sufficient to provide the conditions for the reductive dissolution of fe oxides the as enrichment in groundwater could be attributed to the desorption of fe oxides under high ph and salinity conditions to release as from the minerals into groundwater amini et al 2008 which is consistent with the alkaline condition represented by the ph range of most of the groundwater samples in this study 4 5 health risk assessment of arsenic the survey results of parameters e g bw ir age used to calculate health risks non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq cancer risk cr are shown in table 3 the non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq and cancer risk cr denotes the probability of adverse non carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects from exposure of as the calculation results fig 10 and table s1 highlight the human health risks associated with exposure to groundwater as the results showed that ug and cg can pose potential health concerns to both children and adult for the non carcinogenic risk cg has greater potential to pose non carcinogenic effects caused by arsenic on children and adult than ug fig 10 table s1 the mean nchq values remained 1 0 for adult mean 0 75 range 0 13 3 10 sd 0 67 while it is greater than 1 0 for children mean 1 05 range 0 18 4 34 sd 0 94 in ug from the perspective of the area ratio of non carcinogenic risk 28 8 and 48 9 of samples exceeds the maximum acceptable nchq value i e 1 0 in ug and cg respectively in cg the mean nchq value was greater than 1 0 for children mean 1 43 range 0 08 9 54 sd 1 34 and was less than 1 0 for adult mean 0 85 range 0 05 5 64 sd 0 79 for samples with nchq value greater than 1 0 the arsenic concentration in groundwater may pose potential non carcinogenic risk li et al 2018a ravindra and mor 2019 shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and the potential threat to children was greater than adult the carcinogenic risk assessment results showed that the mean cr values were greater than the maximum acceptable cr value recommended by us epa 1 10 4 epa 2011 for children mean 4 72 10 4 range 0 80 10 4 19 68 10 4 sd 4 24 10 4 and for adult mean 3 35 10 4 range 0 57 10 4 13 97 10 4 sd 3 01 10 4 in ug moreover in cg the greater potential carcinogenic risk for children mean 6 45 10 4 range 0 35 10 4 42 9 10 4 sd 6 03 10 4 and for adult mean 3 81 10 4 range 0 21 10 4 25 4 10 4 sd 3 57 10 4 were observed groundwater samples with cr value greater than the threshold limit indicated that population exposed to as contaminated groundwater may be threatened by considerable cancer risk phan et al 2010 tabassum et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study the detailed hydrogeochemical studies of ug and cg were performed and further integrating som and geochemical modeling to delineate the controlling mechanism of as release and mobilization in addition the health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the potential carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on children and adults caused by drinking water 1 detailed hydrogeochemical studies demonstrated that high as groundwater as 10 μg l is predominantly of cl na type followed by na hco3 type in addition gaillardet diagram indicated that evaporates weathering may contribute to the release and mobilization of as in cg 2 the som analysis interprets the complex nonlinear relationship between as and physicochemical parameters and the results suggested that as is negatively correlated to orp do so42 no3 and cod and positively correlated to hco3 and mn in ug in cg the as is positively correlated to ph and negatively correlated to ec so42 fe and mn these relationships decipher the hydrogeochemical processes that control as mobilization in groundwater 3 geochemical modeling results indicated that fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases e g goethite hematite and fe oh 3 were saturated which was conducive to precipitate the precipitation of these mineral phases explained the insignificant correlation between fe and as 4 fe oxide hydroxide mineral phases could possibly be considered as the main factor controlling as releasing due to the desorption of as from minerals 5 the oxidation of as bearing sulfides and the reductive dissolution of iron manganese oxyhydroxides are not the control mechanisms for the release and mobilization of as in the study area 6 the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects of exposure to groundwater as for children are greater than that for adults the health risks caused by drinking as contaminated water for cg are greater than that for ug

15891,the mechanisms controlling arsenic as enrichment and mobilization associated with human health risk assessment of groundwater in the longdong basin located in the southern part of the loess plateau china have been yet unexplained this uncertainty is partly attributed to a poor understanding of groundwater arsenic management to address this problem this study investigated the occurrence and spatial distribution of as in unconfined groundwater ug and confined groundwater cg in the study area integrated self organizing maps som and geochemical modeling to elucidate the mechanisms controlling as release and mobilization in groundwater and conducted a health risk assessment of groundwater as the results showed that 13 6 of ug samples n 66 and 22 4 of cg samples n 98 exceeded the who guideline limit of as 10 μg l the detailed hydrogeochemical studies showed that as enrichment groundwater is dominated by cl na type and gaillardet diagram indicated that evaporites weathering may contribute to as mobilization in cg the som analysis combined with spearman s correlation coefficient quantified the negative correlation between as and redox potential dissolved oxygen so4 2 no3 and the positive correlation between as and hco3 mn in ug in cg as is positively correlated to ph and negatively to electrical conductivity so4 2 fe and mn the saturation indices of the mineral phases indicates an insignificant relationship between as and fe we conclude that under oxidizing conditions evaporative controls and the desorption of fe oxides under alkaline and high salinity conditions are the dominant mechanisms controlling as release and mobilization in groundwater in addition exposure to groundwater as through drinking water posed potential risk of carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on children and adults this study contributes to groundwater as management and sustainable safe groundwater supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic

quality worldwide including bangladesh farooq et al 2010 halim et al 2009 nickson et al 2000 india sarkar et al 2010 vietnam polya et al 2008 thailand jones et al 2008 northern china he and charlet 2013 guo et al 2014a rodriguez lado et al 2013 argentina francisca and perez 2009 zabala et al 2016 chile pell et al 2013 the united states ayotte et al 2015 foust jr et al 2004 schreiber et al 2000 mexico armienta and segovia 2008 wurl et al 2014 the as concentration of 10 μg l was considered as the world health organization who provisional guideline value for drinking water identifying the occurrence of as concentrations in groundwater and the controlling mechanisms of as release is of great significance for as risk management the hydrogeochemical characteristics of as enrichment groundwater demonstrate that the sources and mobilization processes are associated with various factors mahanta et al 2015 including the redox conditions e g oxidation of as bearing sulfides and the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe mn oxyhydroxides guo et al 2008 kumar et al 2010 liu and wu 2019 adsorption desorption mechanism zhang et al 2017 the role of mineral phases e g fe mn oxide and

2020 2018b prior studies showed that the groundwater is characterized by high concentrations of nh4 dissolved mn dissolved fe and fe ii and low concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in the yinchuan basin guo et al 2014b in addition evaporative concentration controls the as enrichment in groundwater and the evaporites weathering increases groundwater salinity and the more alkaline ph leads to the desorption of as mladenov et al 2014 nicolli et al 2010 wang et al 2019a therefore elaborating the relationship between as concentrations and hydrogeochemical characteristics conduce to understand the as mobilization in groundwater machine learning ml has gradually become a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis eda of environmental variables pearce et al 2011 sahoo et al 2017 sahour et al 2020 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 singh et al 2014 and been widely used in hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality classification li et al 2018c sahour et al 2020 wu et al 2020 among several common ml algorithms self organizing maps som an unsupervised ml method is widely used to identify the mechanism of geochemical processes controlling hydrogeochemistry by mapping high dimensional data to 2 d component planes nguyen et al 2015 pandey et al 2015 yin et al 2021 however an important feature of som is the visual interpretation of the nonlinear relationship between variables santos et al 2020 which can be coupled with hydrogeochemical analysis to delineate the mechanisms controlling groundwater hydrochemistry prior studies mostly used linear correlation to represent the relationship between as and physical and chemical parameters kumar et al 2017 mahanta et al 2015 mushtaq et al 2018 however the hydrogeochemical processes associated with as mobilization has a nonlinear relationship with as concentration smedley and kinniburgh 2013 which determines the complex mechanism of as mobilization in groundwater so far som combined with spearman s correlation analysis and integrating geochemical modeling to decipher the release and mobilization of as in different aquifers have severally been reported the main objective of applying som in this study is to decipher the nonlinear relationship between as and physicochemical parameters and further integrate som with geochemical modeling to evaluate the nonlinearly coupled geochemical processes thereby delineating the controlling mechanisms of as release as contaminated groundwater poses a threat to human health through multiple pathways e g groundwater surface water and routes e g drinking daily diet skin contact of which ingestion through drinking water is crucial berg et al 2001 greco et al 2019 pontius et al 1994 tabassum et al 2019 ur rehman et al 2020 the study area longdong basin most areas belong to semi arid areas groundwater is a long term source of drinking water and people are exposed to arsenic for a long time and there is a risk of adverse effects on the human body long term exposure to arsenic could have potentially carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on human health known as arsenic poisoning disease which can lead to some cancers such as skin bladder kidney and lung cancer as well as vascular disease ahmed et al 2021 finding out the health risks of groundwater as in a specific area will conduce to understand the environmental and geological effects of as the threat of as to human body can be quantitatively represented by a health risk assessment model which were used to examine whether exposure to as could increase incidence of the adverse effects on human health chandrajith et al 2020 machado et al 2020 rinklebe et al 2019 two as speciation i e as iii as v were observed in nature and the toxicity of as iii is 60 times that of as v coddington 1986 nevertheless both of them are related to human toxicity because as v is first reduced to as iii followed by methylated in the human digestive system therefore this study mainly focuses on total as concentration in groundwater due to the fundamental difference of aquifer materials between unconfined aquifer i e quaternary pleistocene loess and confined aquifer i e cretaceous sandstone more importantly an obvious difference is that the occurrence and distribution characteristics of as in unconfined and confined aquifers therefore the distinguishing assessments of the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects of as in unconfined and confined aquifers based on health risk assessment model are of great guiding significance for the safe and sustainable groundwater supply to date no literature has deciphered the detailed hydrogeochemical processes associated with groundwater as mobilization in the study area making it a novel contribution to understanding the controlling mechanism of as mobilization the objectives of this study were to delineate the occurrence characteristic of as in unconfined groundwater ug and confined groundwater cg identify the controlling mechanisms of as enrichment in groundwater and evaluate the health risk i e carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk of as in groundwater for these purposes we integrated statistical methods self organizing maps som and geochemical modeling to elucidate as distribution hydrogeochemical characteristics of as enrichment groundwater and the main mechanisms affecting as mobilization in groundwater based on the physical and chemical parameters additionally the health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the as induced potential health risk including carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks 2 study area 2 1 topography and meteorology the study area belongs to the gully area of the loess plateau in the middle reaches of the yellow river the geomorphological characteristics are dominated loess hills the terrain is high on the east north and west and low in the middle and south fig 1 thus forming a basin the climate characteristics of the study area are mainly manifested as low precipitation high evaporation and low humidity the precipitation is unevenly distributed in time and space from a spatial perspective the precipitation decreases from south to north while the annual precipitation in the north is only 350 mm zhao et al 2013 in terms of the temporal variability of precipitation which is concentrated in july to september accounting for 70 of the annual precipitation the spatial variation of evaporation is increasing from south to north the evaporation is generally 2 5 4 times the precipitation and the potential evaporation in the north reaches 1700 mm there are three rivers i e malian river pu river and hulu river in the study area malian river the secondary tributary of the wei river is the main river in the study area 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is widely distributed in the lower cretaceous k1 with large thickness gentle occurrence and wide spreading range which is an important water bearing horizon the baoan group is mainly distributed in the study area which can be divided into four rock groups i e luohe formation k1l huanhe formation k1h luohandong formation k1lh and jingchuan formation k1jc based on the characteristics of lithology and lithofacies figure s1 the water bearing formations in the study area mainly includes the cretaceous clastic water bearing system i e luohe formation huanhe formation and luohandong formation and the quaternary loose rock water bearing system respectively which refers to confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer respectively the confined and unconfined aquifers have different patterns of occurrence burial conditions distribution ranges and circulation characteristics forming the relatively independent aquifers the occurrence laws burial conditions distribution ranges and circulation characteristics of each water bearing formation are different which constitutes a relatively independent unified water bearing body 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis groundwater samples from unconfined aquifers 67 samples and confined aquifers 98 samples in the study area have been collected from public water supply wells enterprise owned wells private wells or hand dug wells during october to november 2020 fig 1 before sampling the groundwater of each well should be pumped for at least 10 15 min field based parameters such as temperature ph electrical conductively ec oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a multi parameter portable instrument hanna hi9828 all groundwater samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm membrane filter for major cations and trace element analysis groundwater samples were acidified to ph 2 in the field with ultrapure hno3 and were collected in 500 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles for laboratory analysis however non acidified samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for anion and other water quality parameters analysis all the groundwater samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c in dark and transported to the laboratory for analysis within seven days of sampling inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes was used to analyze k na ca2 mg2 mn fe ion chromatography was used to measure the concentration of anions f cl so4 2 no3 the titration method measures hco3 and co3 2 arsenic in groundwater was measured by atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs with a detection limit of 0 3 μg l all physicochemical parameters were expressed in mg l na k ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 so4 2 cl no3 f tds cod fe mn and μg l as the detection limits dl of parameters were fe 0 02 mg l mn 0 004 mg l no3 0 016 mg l 3 2 data quality control water quality is controlled by setting a certain proportion 10 full program blank samples and field parallel samples the test results show that the relative standard deviation rsd is less than 5 during the test the national standard samples and groundwater samples were spiked for recovery analysis to check the recovery rate data reliability was checked by calculating the charge balance error cbe and the data with cbe greater than 10 was excluded moreover the censored data i e the measured data below dl were considered when they constituted less than 30 of total number of samples and three quarters of each variable s dl was assigned to them ultimately the groundwater samples used for hydrogeochemical analysis som analysis and statistical analysis in this study were 66 ug samples and 98 cg samples 3 3 self organizing maps som algorithm som also known as kohonen map is an unsupervised artificial neural network which is trained using competitive learning strategies and relying on the competition between neurons to gradually optimize the network som uses the neighborhood function to maintain the original topology of the input data the network structure of som consists of an input layer and an output layer i e competitive layer each input layer is an m dimensional vector x x1 x2 xm determined by m variables of data set li et al 2018c melo et al 2019 the output layer is a two dimensional 2 d discrete visual map which is composed of n neurons i e nodes connected in hexagonal lattice the som algorithm was used to investigate the main affecting factors controlling the mechanism of as enrichment in groundwater there are no strict rules for determining the number of neurons park et al 2014 which was selected according to a heuristic equation 5 n n represents the number of samples vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 based on this the som with different map sizes were trained and the architectures from 8 5 and 7 7 were selected as the appropriate number of output neurons in ug and cg respectively som is most commonly used for cluster analysis since the main goal of this study is to determine the correlation between as and various physical and chemical parameters we did not use som for cluster analysis but used it for correlation hunting therefore each component plane that preserving the original topology was used to identify the correlation between as and the other parameters the pairwise correlations can be determined by comparing the color patterns presented by the component planes similar color patterns of two maps represent the possibility of a positive correlation between the corresponding variables while the opposite color patterns indicate the negative correlation to quantify the nonlinear correlation between as and the other physical and chemical parameters spearman s correlation coefficient ρ a nonparametric measure of rank correlation was used to calculate the as maps and the other maps based on som analysis in this study som analysis was performed using the som toolbox2 1 vatanen et al 2015 the toolbox was free available at https github com ilarinieminen som toolbox for software matlab 2014b in addition the spearman s ρ was calculated through ms excel 3 4 geochemical modeling the geochemical processes including oxidation or reductive dissolution of as bearing sulfide minerals e g feass and fe hydroxide which promotes as release from minerals into groundwater geochemical modeling is an effective tool to reveal the mechanism of as release caused by these processes in this study the phreeqc was used to calculated saturation index si log iap kt iap is the ion activity product while kt is the equilibrium constant of various as bearing minerals to determine the types of minerals controlling as in groundwater the steps for calculating si by phreeqc can be found in text s1 in supplementary material gaillardet diagram depicts the na normalized molar ratio mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na to identify the mineral chemical weathering and to examine the main controlling lithology gaillardet et al 1999 the gaillardet diagram is divided into three end members which are carbonates silicates and evaporites moreover eh ph diagram pourbaix diagram can be used to delineate the speciation and condition under which as exists stably in an aqueous system with a specific potential redox condition and ph villa lojo et al 1997 3 5 health risk assessment model this study evaluated the effects of as in groundwater on human health based on the health risk assessment model recommended by the usepa usepa 1989 and ministry of ecology and environment of the p r china meec 2020 health risk assessment includes the following four steps 3 5 1 hazard identification in this study the hazard was represented by arsenic concentration in groundwater the world health organization has set a threshold of 10 μg l of arsenic in drinking water most of the study area is a semi arid area safe water supply and water treatment facilities are not guaranteed and groundwater is the main source of drinking water arsenic in groundwater enters the human body through the drinking water pathway and is associated with an increased incidence of certain adverse health effects e g cancer 3 5 2 dose response relationship a dose response relationship describes the correlation between the likelihood and severity of adverse health effects and dose exposure to contaminants usepa 2018 understanding the dose response relationship can help estimate health risks and prevent future arsenic poisoning in arsenic prevailing areas there are two dose response relationship 1 nonlinear dose response relationship the nonlinear dose response relationship is derived from the threshold assumption which is defined as the dose at which no harmful effects are expected to occur the reference dose rfd is widely used to represent this dose which is defined as an estimate of a daily exposure to the human population including sensitive population that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime usepa 2018 rfd has been widely used to many studies and is usually assigned as 3 0 10 4 mg kg day navoni et al 2014 phan et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the nonlinear dose response relationship is widely used to assess carcinogenic effects 1 linear dose response relationship a linear dose response relationship indicates that there is no threshold for toxicity and there is theoretically no exposure level to a chemical arsenic in this study a slope factor sf is used to characterize this linear relationship which is defined as the risk of exposure levels falling along a straight line linear dose response relationship is often used to estimate cancer risk 3 5 3 exposure assessment exposure assessment measures or estimates the magnitude frequency and duration of exposure to as drinking water exposure to as is one of the significant exposure route the calculation model is as follow usepa 1989 1 d i c w i r e f e d b w a t where di the daily intake of groundwater for drinking through oral pathway mg kg d cw as concentration in groundwater mg l ir ingestion rate of groundwater l d ef exposure frequency d yr in this study a daily exposure frequency 365 d yr is selected considering the long time average contact rate means 1989 ed exposure duration yr indicating the number of years that individual exposure to as through drinking water over a lifetime bw average body weight over the exposure period kg at average time of exposure d in this study at ed 365 for non carcinogenic effects and for carcinogenic effects at the expected average lifespan 365 in this study at is 76 9 years old which can be accessed from the website of qingyang the administrative district to which the study area belongs municipal health commission http wsjk zgqingyang gov cn 3 5 4 risk assessment health risks include carcinogenic risks and non carcinogenic risks for carcinogenic risk assessment representing the additional risk of contracting cancer in a person s lifetime which can be estimated using the model recommended by usepa the formula is as follows 2 c r d i s f where cr represents the probability of an individual developing cancer sf denotes the carcinogenic slope factor equal to 1 5 mg kg d usepa 2018 which can be used to convert estimated daily intakes of exposure to incremental risk of an individual developing cancer means 1989 the acceptable limit of cancer risk was set to 1 10 4 shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq quantifies the risk of non carcinogenic effects which is expressed by the following formula 3 n c h q d i r f d where nchq represents the quantitative carcinogenic effects rfd represents the reference dose equal to 3 4 10 4 mg kg d usepa 2018 when hchq is greater than 1 representing the possibility of exposure to cancer risk shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 arsenic concentration in groundwater as concentrations in ug and cg were investigated fig 2 the as concentration in cg showed a wider range 0 4 48 4 μg l with a median concentration of 5 35 μg l while as concentration in ug ranges from 0 9 to 22 2 μg l with a median concentration of 3 85 μg l the median and 90th percentile as concentrations in ug were 3 9 and 13 μg l respectively fig 2b in cg however the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 5 and 14 μg l respectively in ug and cg 13 6 and 22 4 of samples exceeded the drinking water limits of 10 μg l who 2011 for as respectively the spatial distribution of arsenic in ug and cg in the study area is shown in fig 3 high as groundwater 10 μg l is mainly distributed in low lying areas that is the valleys of rivers which are groundwater drainage areas in hydrogeology figure s2 this distribution may be due to the slow groundwater flow rate which caused the accumulation of as in this zone which suggested the hydrological control of as mobilization on the whole as concentrations in cg and ug in the northwest of the study area are relatively high which may be related to the original geological environment and lithofacies paleogeography e g high salinity groundwater the following sections will introduce the controlling mechanisms of high as groundwater 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of arsenic enrichment groundwater the descriptive statistics of various physical and chemical parameters in groundwater i e ug and cg were shown in table 1 the ph was alkaline and spanned 7 3 8 32 mean 7 76 sd 0 23 and 7 1 8 62 mean 7 81 sd 0 27 respectively the groundwater salinity in ug and cg varied significantly with ec values spanning 0 26 10 34 ms cm mean 1 79 ms cm sd 2 07 ms cm and 0 44 12 44 ms cm mean 3 80 ms cm sd 2 55 ms cm as well as tds ranging from 260 to 9080 mg l and 289 14 041 mg l respectively in addition 27 3 of ug samples and 81 6 of cg samples showed tds value greater than 1000 mg l the cations in ug and cg were both dominated by na with the mean concentration of 258 54 and 736 5 mg l respectively so4 2 was the dominant anion in ug mean 371 54 mg l sd 642 58 mg l and cg mean 1203 mg l sd 956 53 mg l followed by cl with the mean concentration of 317 31 and 451 mg l in ug and cg respectively the mean concentration of ca2 and mg2 were 87 55 and 93 mg l in ug while the mean value of 95 9 and 55 5 mg l in cg respectively table 1 piper trilinear diagram delineate the possible hydrogeochemical facies of as enrichment groundwater in addition the piper trilinear diagram was used to highlight the variations in as concentrations with changing hydrogeochemistry the results suggested that na cl type groundwater dominantly associated with as enrichment groundwater fig 4 which indicated that the possible contribution of high salinity to high as groundwater wang et al 2019a 4 3 deciphering the nonlinear relationship between as and physicochemical parameters using som the physical and chemical variables e g ph orp do ec na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f tds cod fe mn representing the geochemical process controlling the release and mobilization of as were presented in the 2 d component planes using som fig 5 which helps quantify the relationships between as and multiple variables the as toroidal map showed that the maximum values of arsenic component plane toroidal map is located in the lower left corner of the map the minimum values of arsenic component plane in ug is located in the upper right corner of the map while the minimum values in cg is in the upper right of the map the correlations between multiple variables could be determined by maintaining the same relative topological distribution values in pairs between component planes to quantify the nonlinear relationship between as and multiple variables based on som analysis results the spearman s correlation coefficient fig 6 was used to represent the influence of different parameters on as concentrations based on the output of som the as concentration in cg was observed to increase with the increasing ph and has a positive correlation ρ 0 57 while as in ug has no obvious correlation with ph which may indicate that the different controlling mechanism of as in ug and cg the relationship between as concentration and ph is mainly manifested in that acid base conditions control the desorption or adsorption of as from the arsenate arsenite mineral surface ayotte et al 2003 kim et al 2012 nicolli et al 2010 although the positive correlation between as and ph has been reported in previous studies and higher ph leads to an increase in the desorption rate of arsenate however high as concentration 10 μg l does not always appear with high ph in groundwater ayotte et al 2003 in this study a weak correlation between as and ph was observed in ug which indicated that ph has minimum effect on as enrichment and mobilization additionally alkaline conditions may contribute to the desorption and enrichment of as in groundwater zeng et al 2018 and ph ranges from 7 5 to 8 1 in ug with high as concentration while the ph spans from 7 7 to 8 4 in cg fig s3a bicarbonate can promote the mobilization of as by competing for adsorption sites and forming arsenic bicarbonate complexes bhattacharya et al 2006 kim et al 2003 guo et al 2011 as well as extracting as from fe mn oxyhydroxides in the sediment anawar et al 2004 however a poor correlation of as with hco3 was observed fig 6b fig s3f the complex correlation between as and hco3 indicates that the mobilization of as is affected by many factors and there are many sources of hco3 most of groundwater samples with high as concentration have lower so4 2 concentration fig s3b and the negative correlation between as and so4 2 was observed ug ρ 0 40 cg ρ 0 73 fig 6 which may be caused by the so4 2 promoting as release from the surface of sediments into groundwater through surface competitive adsorption ayotte et al 2003 cheng et al 2009 li et al 2018b radu et al 2005 moreover it may indicate that as could not directly mobilized from as bearing sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite halim et al 2009 harvey et al 2005 the complex correlation between as and no3 was observed ug ρ 0 5 cg ρ 0 36 as shown in fig 6 exhibiting that low no3 concentration exists in high as concentration in ug the reason may be that the no3 reduction denitrification occurred then the subsequent redox sequence of as v reduction limits the reduction of arsenic zhang et al 2018a zeng et al 2018 however the thermodynamically stable no3 environment is still sufficiently oxidizing as evidenced by orp which hinders the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe mn oxides according to the redox sequence o2 no3 fe3 so4 2 ch4 during the no3 reduction i g denitrification stage arsenic is adsorbed on fe mn oxides minerals and is rarely released into groundwater postma et al 2007 xie et al 2009 moreover the insignificant correlation between as and no3 was observed in cg indicating that no3 is not closely associated with high as groundwater as concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with dissolved fe concentration ρ 0 66 in cg fig 6b which may indicate that fe precipitates in the form of fe oxides hydroxides in an oxidizing environment or high ph conditions shakoor et al 2018 therefore it can promote the release of as due to water rock interface reactions generally the release of as may be associated with the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides or hydroxides smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however the poor correlation between dissolved fe and as in ug fig 6a indicated a low possibility that as may result from the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides or hydroxides under this environment so4 2 was reduced to s2 and combine with fe mn to form arsenic containing minerals resulting in a decrease of fe mn concentration zeng et al 2018 the orp in ug ranges from 14 to 287 mv while span from 52 to 219 mv in cg fig 6 showed that the correlation between as and orp is not significant which indicated that redox conditions are not the only factor that controls the release and mobilization processes of as and other factors also play a crucial role 4 4 controlling mechanisms of arsenic in groundwater hydrogeochemical processes control the release and mobilization of arsenic hydrogeochemical processes appear to be controlling arsenic adsorption and its mobilization in groundwater mushtaq et al 2018 li et al 2020 among the hydrogeochemical processes include water rock interaction bibi et al 2021 oxidative dissolution processes of as bearing sulfide minerals like feass hussain et al 2021 reductive dissolution and desorption of as from fe oxides oxyhydroxides or clay minerals bhattacharya et al 2006 ravenscroft et al 2011 which were responsible for as mobilization in groundwater the oxidation reaction process of as bearing sulfide minerals e g arsenopyrite was responsible for the processes of as release in groundwater das et al 1996 schreiber et al 2000 which was illustrated as f e a s s 7 2 o 2 4 h 2 o f e o h 3 a s o 4 3 s o 4 2 5 h f e s a s s 7 2 o 2 h 2 o f e 3 s o 4 2 a s o 4 3 2 h f e s 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o f e o h 3 2 h 2 s o 4 arsenopyrite feass is very soluble and usually cannot reach its solubility product therefore ferric hydroxide plays a more important role in controlling the concentration of dissolved arsenic however the negative correlation between as and so4 2 was observed fig 6 which does not support the hypothesis that as is derived from as bearing sulfide minerals the different speciation of as and fe in groundwater under reducing and oxidizing conditions result in different mechanisms of as release the eh ph diagram shows as speciation and oxidation reduction conditions at a particular ph and redox potential a common understanding of as speciation in aqueous solution is that as usually presents as arsenious acid i e h3aso30 h2aso3 and as iii and arsenic acid i e h2aso4 haso4 2 and as v nguyen and itoi 2009 identifying the speciation of as is of significance because as iii is more toxic than as v coddington 1986 the eh ph diagram of as suggests that the dominant as species in ug and cg was haso4 2 fig 7 a which was present under oxidizing conditions only one sample in cg is plotted on the stability field of h3aso30 which was present under reducing conditions for the iron speciation groundwater samples were plotted in the field of hematite fe2o3 fig 7b which indicated that iron oxides fe2o3 could play an important role in the release of as by comparing the arsenic release mechanisms in other countries with arsenic affected groundwater we concluded that polizzotto et al 2008 elucidated the mechanism of arsenic release under the control of reducing environment without sulfate reduction as the most common mechanism that can explain the release of arsenic from sediments or minerals it has been confirmed by some studies on the mechanism of groundwater arsenic enrichment in many areas of the world such as hetao basin guo et al 2008 datong basin xie et al 2009 yangtze river basin schaefer et al 2017 mekong river basin kocar et al 2008 and red river delta buschmann and berg 2009 eiche et al 2008 in this study however oxidative conditions prevailed in aquifers the groundwater is characterized by weak alkaline alkaline 7 5 8 5 high eh 200 mv which is similar to other previously published literatures mushtaq et al 2018 bibi et al 2021 nicolli et al 2010 this arsenic release mechanism represents that desorption of arsenic bearing fe oxides in oxidative conditions and competitive adsorption under moderate high ph conditions control arsenic release smedley and kinniburgh 2002 effects of desorption of arsenic at high ph under oxidizing conditions as enrichment groundwater is mostly neutral weakly alkaline fig 8 in ug and cg the correlation between as and hco3 was not significant fig 8a fig 8b as enrichment groundwater has high hco3 concentration was widely reported however relatively low concentrations of as are sometimes observed in groundwater with high hco3 which indicated that hco3 has a negligible effect on as adsorption biswas et al 2014 high hco3 concentration in groundwater under alkaline conditions could be associated with the precipitation of calcite and dolomite table 3 leading to as adsorption on calcite which explains the insignificant correlation between as and ca2 fig 8e fig 8f this could be contributed to as co precipitation with calcite or adsorption on ca arsenate supported by xie et al 2008 and ahn 2012 most of high arsenic 10 μg l groundwater samples are accompanied by weak alkaline alkaline 7 5 ph 8 5 and oxidative environments orp 100 mv fig 8c fig 8d this groundwater environment e g ph orp is similar to other areas mushtaq et al 2018 bibi et al 2021 nicolli et al 2010 which possibly indicated that contribution of the desorption of arsenic bearing fe oxides to arsenic release under oxidizing conditions prior studies have shown that iron precipitates in the form of fe oxides under oxidation and high ph conditions and plays an important role in the adsorption and desorption of as in groundwater which could be supported by smedley and kinniburgh 2002 under oxygen and near neutral aquifer conditions as is mainly adsorbed on the surface of fe oxides in the form of arsenate the increase in ph caused by rock weathering and related cation exchange leads to the desorption of as from the mineral surface moreover similar oxidation geochemical conditions e g high ph and alkalinity are related to as concentration on the control of as release in northern mexico argentina and spain were reported bundschuh et al 2004 giménez forcada and smedley 2014 nicolli et al 2012 evaporative process controls on the release and mobilization of as evaporative concentration and evaporites minerals weathering also contribute to the release and mobilization of as groundwater especially in arid and semi arid areas jia et al 2017 mladenov et al 2014 nicolli et al 2010 ortega guerrero 2017 wang et al 2019a gaillardet diagram fig 9 showed that most elevated as concentrations 10 μg l in cg were plotted in and near evaporites weathering zones which indicated that the contribution of evaporites weathering to as enrichment and mobilization in cg for confined aquifers due to lithofacies and paleogeographic conditions e g paleoclimate paleohydrology paleotopography sedimentary facies composition and distribution the aquifer medium has high soluble salt content and there are a large number of evaporite minerals then water rock interactions contribute to the high salinity groundwater hou et al 2008 xie et al 2004 and high salinity groundwater may facilitate the desorption of arsenic from oxides fe mn oxides surfaces into groundwater jia et al 2017 role of possible mineral phases in arsenic release and mobilization using phreeqc the adsorption and release of arsenic on fe mn oxide or oxyhydroxide are the result of the processes of minerals dissolution and precipitation which are determined by saturation index si the si of possible mineral phases were represented in table 2 geochemical modeling suggested that the positive si values were observed for fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases including goethite mean 6 16 in ug and 8 13 in cg hematite mean 14 50 in ug and 18 28 in cg and fe oh 3 mean 0 35 in ug and 2 24 in cg which indicated that the aquatic geochemical environment is conducive to the precipitation of these mineral phases shakoor et al 2018 additionally as concentration is related to the si of goethite hematite and fe oh 3 figure s4 which implied that fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases could possibly the main factor controlling the release of as for the result that as was desorbed from minerals into groundwater zhang et al 2017a carbonate minerals may also be responsible for arsenic retention release in aquifers rasool et al 2016 because co3 2 may form complexes at fe oxide surface sites and displace arsenic from mineral sediment surfaces leading to arsenic release into groundwater anawar et al 2004 in addition arsenic associated with carbonate minerals is susceptible to changes in wet and dry patterns and changes in water quality components such as ph and salinity lemonte et al 2017 geochemical modeling showed that unsaturated si 0 aquifer conditions prevail in unconfined and confined aquifers with regard to fe mn carbonate minerals including rhodochrosite mnco3 mean 2 10 in ug and 0 85 in cg and siderite feco3 mean 1 43 in ug and 1 41 in cg suggesting that iron and manganese carbonate minerals are unlikely to precipitate as determined by negative value of si this further indicated that these minerals phases may have not potential role in sorption desorption of as in groundwater bibi et al 2011 although the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxide has been widely considered as the significant mechanism of as release fendorf et al 2010 hasan et al 2009 pal et al 2002 zhang et al 2017a which was supported by the as mobilization in reducing aquifers of bangladesh mcarthur et al 2001 mladenov et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the oxidation conditions prevailing in groundwater in the study area were not sufficient to provide the conditions for the reductive dissolution of fe oxides the as enrichment in groundwater could be attributed to the desorption of fe oxides under high ph and salinity conditions to release as from the minerals into groundwater amini et al 2008 which is consistent with the alkaline condition represented by the ph range of most of the groundwater samples in this study 4 5 health risk assessment of arsenic the survey results of parameters e g bw ir age used to calculate health risks non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq cancer risk cr are shown in table 3 the non carcinogenic hazard quotient nchq and cancer risk cr denotes the probability of adverse non carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects from exposure of as the calculation results fig 10 and table s1 highlight the human health risks associated with exposure to groundwater as the results showed that ug and cg can pose potential health concerns to both children and adult for the non carcinogenic risk cg has greater potential to pose non carcinogenic effects caused by arsenic on children and adult than ug fig 10 table s1 the mean nchq values remained 1 0 for adult mean 0 75 range 0 13 3 10 sd 0 67 while it is greater than 1 0 for children mean 1 05 range 0 18 4 34 sd 0 94 in ug from the perspective of the area ratio of non carcinogenic risk 28 8 and 48 9 of samples exceeds the maximum acceptable nchq value i e 1 0 in ug and cg respectively in cg the mean nchq value was greater than 1 0 for children mean 1 43 range 0 08 9 54 sd 1 34 and was less than 1 0 for adult mean 0 85 range 0 05 5 64 sd 0 79 for samples with nchq value greater than 1 0 the arsenic concentration in groundwater may pose potential non carcinogenic risk li et al 2018a ravindra and mor 2019 shah et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and the potential threat to children was greater than adult the carcinogenic risk assessment results showed that the mean cr values were greater than the maximum acceptable cr value recommended by us epa 1 10 4 epa 2011 for children mean 4 72 10 4 range 0 80 10 4 19 68 10 4 sd 4 24 10 4 and for adult mean 3 35 10 4 range 0 57 10 4 13 97 10 4 sd 3 01 10 4 in ug moreover in cg the greater potential carcinogenic risk for children mean 6 45 10 4 range 0 35 10 4 42 9 10 4 sd 6 03 10 4 and for adult mean 3 81 10 4 range 0 21 10 4 25 4 10 4 sd 3 57 10 4 were observed groundwater samples with cr value greater than the threshold limit indicated that population exposed to as contaminated groundwater may be threatened by considerable cancer risk phan et al 2010 tabassum et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study the detailed hydrogeochemical studies of ug and cg were performed and further integrating som and geochemical modeling to delineate the controlling mechanism of as release and mobilization in addition the health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the potential carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects on children and adults caused by drinking water 1 detailed hydrogeochemical studies demonstrated that high as groundwater as 10 μg l is predominantly of cl na type followed by na hco3 type in addition gaillardet diagram indicated that evaporates weathering may contribute to the release and mobilization of as in cg 2 the som analysis interprets the complex nonlinear relationship between as and physicochemical parameters and the results suggested that as is negatively correlated to orp do so42 no3 and cod and positively correlated to hco3 and mn in ug in cg the as is positively correlated to ph and negatively correlated to ec so42 fe and mn these relationships decipher the hydrogeochemical processes that control as mobilization in groundwater 3 geochemical modeling results indicated that fe oxides hydroxides mineral phases e g goethite hematite and fe oh 3 were saturated which was conducive to precipitate the precipitation of these mineral phases explained the insignificant correlation between fe and as 4 fe oxide hydroxide mineral phases could possibly be considered as the main factor controlling as releasing due to the desorption of as from minerals 5 the oxidation of as bearing sulfides and the reductive dissolution of iron manganese oxyhydroxides are not the control mechanisms for the release and mobilization of as in the study area 6 the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects of exposure to groundwater as for children are greater than that for adults the health risks caused by drinking as contaminated water for cg are greater than that for ug

15892,reported herein is an investigation of the impact of water quality parameters on the formation of carbonate radical anion co 3 and hydroxyl radical h o in uv sodium percarbonate uv spc system versus in uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 system for bisphenol a bpa degradation in water pathways of co 3 oxidation of bpa were proposed in this study based on the evolution of direct transformation products of bpa observed in this study the degradation of bpa in the uv spc system was slower than that in the uv h2o2 system in the secondary effluents collected from a local wastewater treatment plant due to the significant impact of coexisting constituents in the matrices on the former system single water quality parameter e g solution ph common anion or natural organic matter affected radical formations and bpa degradation in the uv spc system in a way similar to that in the uv h2o2 system namely the rise of solution ph decreased the steady state concentration of h o resulting in a decrease in the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa k o b s chloride anion and sulfate anion played a negligible role over the examined concentrations nitrate anion slightly suppressed the reaction at the concentration of 20 mm bicarbonate anion decreased the steady state concentrations of both co 3 and h o exerting significant inhibition on bpa degradation different extents of h o scavenging were observed for different types of natural organic matter in the order of fulvic acid mixed nom humic acid however the impact was generally less pronounced on bpa degradation in the uv spc system than that in the uv h2o2 system due to the existence of co 3 the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of co 3 based oxidation and new scientific information regarding the impact of water quality parameters on bpa degradation in the sytems of uv spc and uv h2o2 from the aspect of reactive radical formation which have reference value for uv spc application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aops carbonate radical anion hydroxyl radical steady state concentrations transformation pathways 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is an essential compound for synthesizing epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics that are widely used in the manufacture of many products such as plastic bottles food can linings and food beverage storage containers staples et al 1998 from 1993 to 2007 the weight of bpa released into the environment increased nearly 5 times from 109 tons staples et al 1998 to 500 tons usepa 2010 such extensive use of bpa has caused great concern on its potential damage to environmental sustainability the occurrence of bpa in a variety of media such as water air and soil has been reported fan et al 2021 parto et al 2021 vandenberg et al 2007 evidence has shown that exposure to bpa at environmental concentrations is detrimental to wildlife over time crain et al 2007 sharma and chadha 2021 epidemiological studies have indicated that bpa exposure can induce adverse health consequences including cancer endocrine disorder metabolic disturbance and neurodevelopment problems gao et al 2021 goralczyk 2021 mercogliano et al 2021 senra and lúcia fonseca 2021 for these reasons finding efficient technologies for bpa removal from wastewater is essential for effective protention of environmental and public safety uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 system has been extensively studied and applied for wastewater treatment in contrast the knowledge of physical chemical characteristics and environmental friendliness of uv sodium percarbonate uv spc system remains scarce in the literature our previous study gao et al 2020 reported that bpa could be effectively degraded at ph 8 5 in milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 at similar degradation rates both hydroxyl radical h o and carbonate radical anion co 3 were generated in the uv spc system for bpa degradation eqs 1 5 although the second order rate constant of co 3 towards bpa k c o 3 b p a 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 was smaller than that of h o k h o b p a 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 the steady state concentration of co 3 co 3 ss 2 3 10 12 m was significantly higher than that observed for h o h o ss 1 82 10 14 m in the same work four pathways of bpa degradation in the uv spc system were proposed based on the identified transformation products tps the above mentioned work gao et al 2020 generates interest on the role of co 3 in bpa transformation in uv spc system however that work neither differentiated the specific pathways of bpa transformation by co 3 from the comprehensive oxidation in uv spc system nor investigated the impact of water quality parameters e g solution ph common anions and natural organic matter nom on bpa degradation in uv spc system in this study the particular mechanism of bpa transformation by co 3 was investigated by tracking the evolution of direct tps of bpa transformed by co 3 the impact of solution ph 3 0 8 5 and 10 7 common anions c l so 4 2 no 3 and hco 3 and nom fulvic acid fa humic acid ha and mixed nom on the formation of both reactive radicals and the bpa degradation in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 was investigated because common water quality parameters may interfere in the formation of co 3 and h o through eq 1 17 listed in table 1 moreover bpa degradation in the secondary effluents before chlorination from a regional wastewater treatment plant wwtp was performed to evaluate the real impact of water qualities on bpa degradation in the uv spc system the overall objective of this study is to contribute a better understanding of the reaction mechanism of bpa transformation by co 3 to enrich the body of knowledge for uv spc system and to provide insights into the potential of uv spc sysem as an alternative to uv h2o2 system in specific scenarios and cases for wastewater treatment 2

about other chemicals please see text s1 provided in supplementary material sm solution ph was adjusted with h2so4 and maintained with sodium carbonate itself dissociated from spc or phosphate buffer the measured values of examined water quality parameters before and after corresponding experiments of single parameter impact are presented in table 2 the field water samples used in this study were secondary effluents before chlorination collected from a regional wwtp in march we mar june we jun september we sep and december we dec and directly applied without any further processing related water qualities of these samples are summarized in table 3 2 2 photochemical degradation and analytical methods since the literature does not report any information regarding the uv spectrum for spc activation we performed a scan of light absorbance for spc over 200 400 nm uv wavelength range in the non vacuum environment the obtained spectrum fig s1 shows that uv with wavelength shorter than 300 nm is good for spc activation however too short wavelength requires too high energy input and the uv light used in most applied technologies is emitted from low pressure lamps at a wavelength of 253 7 nm usepa 1999 thus uv 253 7 was chosen in this study to activate spc for uv spc system in consideration of compatibility to existing water and wastewater treatment processes and energy efficiency the degradation experiments either for bpa removal or tp analysis purpose were adapted from those described in our previously published paper gao et al 2020 please refer to text s2 in sm for more details the methods used for the measurement of bpa concentration and the identification of tps were similar to those reported in the same paper as degradation experiments gao et al 2020 the methods for determination of water quality parameters were described in detail in sm the statistical analysis was adapted from published manual lai et al 2022 for more information please see text s3 in sm 2 3

obs f steady state concentrations of h o and co 3 were assumed in this study since the concentrations of h2o2 and carbonate species did not change significantly before and after experiments the bpa

2020 the calculation of h o ss and co 3 ss was described in detail in the same paper gao et al 2020 briefly the competitive degradation of bpa and phoh in the uv spc system is expressed by eqs 21 22

direct uv photolysis control and in uv spc t buoh system because bpa degradation in the direct uv photolysis control is almost negligible as observed in our previous work gao et al 2020 and excess t buoh k h o t b u o h t b u o h k h o b p a b p a can quench bpa reaction with h o bpa transformation in the uv spc t buoh system is primarily attributed to co 3 oxidation the tps found for each system and their evolution profiles with uv fluence are shown in tables s2 s4 under direct uv photolysis bpa degradation was extremely slow and insignificant yet we still managed to detect the hydroxylated tps a1 a3 quinone tps a2 a3 and single ring tp c1 in this system suggesting that direct uv photolysis of bpa occurs mainly through hydroxylation of phenolic ring quinonation of phenolic ring and cleavage of the linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group moreover all tps appeared from the beginning and continuously accumulated over the entire test range of uv fluence table s3 which means bpa is being continuously transformed into these tps this result confirms that uv photolysis of bpa is slow and therefore may be not able to achieve complete oxidation in the uv spc t buoh system the hydroxylated tps quinone tps and single ring tps were also detected and the relative abundance of these tps was much higher than that observed in the direct uv photolysis this implies that the phenolic ring and the linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group are common reactive sites for direct uv photolysis and co 3 oxidation of bpa in addition isopropylidene modified tps were only detected in the uv spc t buoh system which suggests that co 3 attack can activate the isopropylidene group facilitating bpa degradation as for carboxylic tps they were uniquely detected in the uv spc t buoh system indicating that co 3 oxidation of bpa realizes the cleavage of benzene ring and therefore is a more complete oxidation process than direct uv photolysis the evolution of tps with uv fluence in the uv spc t buoh system table s4 shows that single hydroxylated tps were formed at uv fluence between 0 1009 mj cm 2 above 1009 mj cm 2 multi hydroxylated tps started to form and were extensively detected at high uv fluence this demonstrates that multi hydroxylation of bpa is relatively difficult and slower than single hydroxylation it is worth mentioning that hydroxylated tps of b1 b2 c1 c2 and c5 c6 were consecutively evolved indicating that ring hydroxylation of isopropylidene modified tps and single ring tps occurs after isopropylidene modification and cleavage of linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group in addition the massive production of carboxylic tps at higher uv fluences confirms that ring cleavage is the result of continuous oxidation based on the discussion above the pathways of bpa degradation by co 3 was proposed as depicted in fig 1 a hydroxylation the interaction of co 3 with the electron rich phenolic ring causes instability in the electron configuration of aromatic ring one electron is transferred from the phenolic ring to co 3 generating a bpa radical cation the addition of a hydroxyl group to the bpa radical cation at the ortho position of phenolic ring carbon no 2 or 4 in water containing molecular oxygen induces hydroxylation of bpa the hydroxylation of bpa increases the density of electron on the phenolic ring leading to multi hydroxylation of phenolic ring following the same mechanism b oxidation demethylation the attack of co 3 to isopropylidene group abstracts a hydrogen atom and initiates a series of radical chain oxidation processes in the oxic environment forming a demethylated bpa radical d bpa radical and then isopropylidene modified tps the phenolic rings of isopropylidene modified tps are hydroxylated afterwards via the same mechanism as hydroxylation c homolytic cleavage the addition of hydroxyl group to bpa radical cation at the para position of phenolic ring carbon no 4 induces homolytic cleavage of the benzylic bond forming hydroquinone and 4 isopropylphenol radicals this also can be achieved by secondary β scission as mentioned in our previous paper gao et al 2020 water solvent turns the 4 isopropylphenol radical into corresponding alcohols ketones and alkenes afterwards hydroxylation of the phenolic rings of generated tps is carried out ultimately continuous oxidation of tps generates carboxylic tps and small molecular acids step by step until complete mineralization of bpa as opposed to the general pathways of bpa degradation in uv spc system proposed in our previous paper gao et al 2020 which are a combined result of h o and co 3 oxidation the reaction pathways proposed here are specific to bpa transformation by co 3 a step further from our previous work the discussion in this section confirms the initiation of phenolic ring oxidation by co 3 through one electron transfer proposes a new mechanism for isopropylidene modification through oxidation demethylation by co 3 and a new mechanism for isopropylidene bridge cleavage via homolytic cleavage according to the chemical properties of co 3 and finds that co 3 attack can activate the isopropylidene group to facilitate bpa degradation 3 2 bpa degradation in the secondary effluents to evaluate the general impact of water qualities on the treatment performance of uv spc process bpa degradation was conducted in the secondary effluents from a regional wwtp collected in different months these water samples are different from the ones reported in our previous work regarding collection time and water qualities refer to section 2 1 for more information about these samples the results of bpa degradation by uv spc process were compared with those by uv h2o2 as shown in fig 2 bpa degradation by uv spc process was not as efficient as that by uv h2o2 process in the secondary effluents without ph change and at neutral alkaline ph the acidification of matrix significantly increased the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa degradation by uv spc process k o b s u v s p c to the level equal to or higher than the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa degradation by uv h2o2 process k o b s u v h 2 o 2 the efficiencies of bpa degradation by uv spc and uv h2o2 processes were reported to be comparable in milli q water gao et al 2020 so the obviously smaller k o b s u v s p c than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 in the secondary effluents underlines the stronger interference of water qualities on bpa degradation by uv spc process than on bpa degradation by uv h2o2 multi parameter variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning for the data obtained from the above experiments were performed to evaluate the individual contributions of measured water quality parameters of collected secondary effluents to the total impact of water qualities on bpa degradation in the uv spc system in these matrices the obtained contribution percentages are displayed in fig 2b which shows the independent contributions of ph toc and alkalinity to the total impact of secondary effluent qualities are 59 39 34 63 and 10 22 respectively this means ph toc and alkalinity are three major water quality parameters that impact bpa degradation in the uv spc system in secondary effluents this result is consistent with the observations in the impact of single water quality parameter on bpa degradation as discussed in the following sections where the change of ph toc and hco 3 significantly altered the efficiency of bpa degradation in uv spc system in the following sections bpa degradation in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 with different ph common anions and nom were investigated to shed light on the understanding of how these water quality parameters affect bpa degradation and how they interfere in the formation of h o and co 3 in these systems 3 3 impact of solution ph to study the impact of solution ph on bpa degradation and the formation of reactive radicals in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 milli q water was used as reaction solution to exclude interferences from other water quality parameters solution ph of 3 0 8 5 and 10 7 were chosen to mimic the ph conditions of concentrated landfill leachate ph 3 finished sewage ph 8 5 and water dissolving of 1 m spc ph 10 7 the increase of ph decreased k o b s in both systems fig 3a one possible cause can be the decrease of h o ss for the following two reasons first the concentration of h o h o increases with the increase of ph for example the h o at ph 3 0 is only about 10 5 μm while the h o at ph 10 7 increases to over 500 μm because the quantum yield of h o produced in uv photolysis of h2o2 remains constant at different ph khan et al 2014 the scavenging of h o by h o eq 6 decreases h o ss in the alkaline environment second the phenolic ring of bpa is gradually deprotonated into phenolate anion with the increase of ph clara et al 2004 westall et al 1985 the phenolate anion has strong uv absorbance gillam and stern 1954 thus competing against h2o2 for uv radiation photons resulting in the decrease of h o generation the determined steady state concentrations of reactive radicals radical ss fig 3b at different ph confirms the decrease of h o ss in both systems when the solution ph was increased from 3 0 to 10 7 the h o ss in the uv h2o2 system decreased from 1 0 10 12 m to 2 3 10 13 m the h o ss in the uv spc system decreased from 3 9 10 14 m to 3 3 10 16 m in uv spc system the speciation of bpa at high ph values can be another cause of decreased value of k o b s according to reported data in literature clara et al 2004 staples et al 1998 the pka value of bpa falls between 9 6 11 3 which means bpa is more likely to be electronegative at ph 9 6 because co 3 is negatively charged as well the electrostatic repulsion between co 3 and bpa decreases the reactivity of co 3 towards bpa resulting in the decreased efficiency of bpa degradation in the akaline conditions moreover the co 3 ss remained around 1 8 10 12 m in the examined ph range of 3 0 10 7 fig 3b demonstrating the negligible impact of solution ph on co 3 formation the increase of solution ph from 3 0 to 10 7 increased r c o 3 from 39 to 79 indicating that bpa oxidation by co 3 increases with the increase of solution ph the r c o 3 r t o t a l increased from 43 at ph 3 0 to 99 at ph 10 7 illustrating that co 3 gradually becomes the key species responsible for bpa degradation as the solution ph increases because the ph impact on bpa degradation in the uv spc system is mitigated by such responses of co 3 k o b s u v s p c decreased more slowly than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 with the increase of solution ph 3 4 impact of common anions anions that are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environment may pose beneficial or adverse effects on the performance of different aops parsons 2004 four common anions in water i e c l so 4 2 no 3 and hco 3 were chosen in this study to investigate the impact of common anions at four common concentrations 0 5 10 and 20 mm at ph 8 5 the dominant species of carbonic system is hco 3 thus the impact of hco 3 instead of the impact of co 3 2 was investigated in this study as shown in fig 4a d the impact of the chosen anions on bpa degradation in the uv spc system were similar to that observed in the uv h2o2 system specifically c l and so 4 2 had negligible impact no 3 at concentration of 20 mm slightly inhibited bpa degradation and hco 3 significantly decreased k o b s at all examined concentrations possible reactions of c l in both systems are shown in eqs 8 11 neta et al 1988 reported that eq 10 11 only take place under acidic condition and are negligible at ph 8 5 the formation and dissociation of clo h eqs 8 9 occurs at comparable rates and c l is nonreactive with co 3 therefore c l had little influence on bpa degradation the influence of so 4 2 on bpa degradation was negligible in both systems it is consistent with the fact that neither h o nor co 3 appreciably reacts with so 4 2 no 3 a well known photosensitizer can initiate a series of reactions under light irradiation producing reactive nitrogen species rns e g ono o o 2 no o no 2 no 2 n o under the experimental condition in this study i e ph 8 5 and uv λ 253 7 nm the dominant reactions are expressed in eqs 12 14 huang et al huang et al 2018 found that bpa could be degraded in uv no 3 system ascribed to rns oxidation and the rate of bpa degradation in the uv no 3 system was significantly enhanced in the presence of hco 3 however in this study a slight inhibition was observed on the degradation of bpa in both systems with the addition of 20 mm no 3 this is likely because 1 the quantum yield of no 3 φ 0 102 0 002 eq 12 and φ 0 037 0 004 eq 14 is significantly lower than the quantum yield of h2o2 φ 1 eq 1 thus rns cannot be sufficiently generated in the uv systems containing h2o2 2 at high concentration of 20 mm the photosensitization of no 3 considerably decreases the incident photons for h2o2 activation and the generated rns scavenges h o eq 13 in the system hco 3 displayed significant inhibition on the degradation of bpa in both systems and the inhibiting effect increased with the increasing concentration of hco 3 hco 3 addition of hco 3 into uv h2o2 system renders uv h2o2 system the ability to generate co 3 following the same reactions as those in uv spc system eqs 1 3 this is supported by the data displayed in fig 4e where the values of h o ss and co 3 ss in the the uv h2o2 system after addition of hco 3 were similar to those in the uv spc system the plunge of h o ss after the addition of hco 3 eq 2 is the reason for the sudden drop of k o b s in both systems the gradual lower of co 3 ss as a result of the increased importance of eq 7 in hco 3 rich solutions explains why the k o b s gradually decreases with the increase of hco 3 in the meanwhile the r h o and r c o 3 decreased proportionally to k o b s and the r c o 3 rtotal kept nearly constant regardless of hco 3 change fig 4f in addition the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the uv h2o2 system remained between 81 and 88 after the addition of hco 3 scatter line with empty triangle in fig 4f the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the uv spc system was kept between 83 and 89 although the addition of 5 mm hco 3 increased r c o 3 r t o t a l from 70 to 88 due to the sharp decrease of h o ss scatter line with solid circle in fig 4f this points out that co 3 is the main species responsible for bpa degradation in the presence of 5 20 mm hco 3 in both systems 3 5 impact of different types of natural organic matter in addition to common anions nom is another category of substances present in natural waters that can significantly affect radical based aops autin et al 2013 fan et al 2013 li and hu 2018 in order to investigate the impact of nom on the degradation of bpa in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 different types of nom from suwannee river fa ha and mixed nom were spiked into reaction solutions at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 the results displayed in fig 5a demonstrate that all types of nom inhibited the degradation of bpa in both systems with the inhibiting effects being increased as the concentration of nom nom was further increased this could be because 1 nom scavenges both reactive radicals of h o and co 3 2 nom absorbs the incident light absorbance 253 7 nm in table 2 decreasing the light availability for the generation of h o and the subsequent generation of co 3 3 the formation of nom bpa complex decreases the accessibility of bpa by co 3 and ho as shown in fig 5b the h o ss in the uv spc system decreased from 1 77 10 14 m without nom to 6 31 10 15 m 4 47 10 15 m and 2 18 10 15 m in the presence of 20 mg l 1 toc of ha mixed nom and fa respectively the co 3 ss in the uv spc system decreased from 1 9 10 12 m to 3 03 10 13 m 5 12 10 13 m and 4 80 10 13 m respectively the h o ss in the uv h2o2 system decreased from 6 50 10 13 m to 3 35 10 13 m 1 96 10 13 m and 1 85 10 13 m respectively different types of nom inhibited bpa degradation in both systems following the sequence of fa mixed nom ha with the presence of different types of nom at the concentration of 20 mm mg l 1 toc the co 3 ss in fig 5b stay close to each other in fig 5c are similar to each other the decrease of h o ss and r h o follows the order of fa mixed nom ha therefore the different inhibiting effects of different types of nomis related to the different effects of different types of nom on the formation of h o which can be explained by light shadowing effect and photosensitivity as presented in table 2 the uv absorbance of different types of nom is generally in the order of fa mixed nom ha the more light is absorbed by nom the less light is available for radical generation recent studies bodhipaksha et al 2017 loiselle et al 2012 mccabe and arnold 2017 schmitt et al 2017 have shown that nom can undergo photochemical reactions by which nom with large molecular weight and active functional groups is excited from ground state 1nom to excited state 3nom under uv or uv vis irradiation eq 15 3nom can transfer energy to dissolved oxygen or water generating reactive species such as 1o2 and h o eq 16 17 which can promote the degradation of certain organics in case of bpa the oxidation of bpa by 3nom generated reactive species is supposed to be mainly achieved by h o because the redox potential of 1o2 e 1 o 2 o 2 0 65 v krumova and cosa 2016 is much lower than that of h o e h o h 2 o 2 33 v krumova and cosa 2016 therefore the inhibiting effect of nom on bpa degradation can be mitigated by the photosensitive reactions as described above as reported by luo et al 2018 fa mainly consists of small molecules 100 g mole 1 molecular weight 10 000 g mole 1 and is a mixture of linear carbon chains and cyclic organic acids these components determine that fa is less photosensitive and mainly exhibits scavenging effect on the contrary ha consists of large molecules molecular weight 50 000 g mole 1 and has aromatic or carbon rings containing oxygen hydrogen nitrogen or sulfur luo et al 2018 such composition of ha makes ha highly photosensitive resulting in the least decrease of h o ss because mixed nom contains both fa and ha the impact of mixed nom is expected to fall between ha and fa under this background co 3 oxidation of bpa contributes more to bpa degradation in the presence of fa than that in the presence of the other types of nom for example as displayed in fig 5c the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of fa at 20 mg l 1 toc was 82 8 the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of mixed nom at 20 mg l 1 toc was 67 2 the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of ha at 20 mg l 1 toc was 51 2 moreover the different inhibiting effect of different types of nom may be also asscoiated with the different complexation ability of different types of nom it has been reported that nom tend to combine with nonpolar hydrophobic organic compounds e g dialkyl phthalate ogner and schnitzer 1970 via trapping the nonpolar organics in a microscopic hydrophobic environment formed by a micellar or double layer inner structure or bonding these organics with ionic and hydrogen bonds gaffney et al 1996 in comparison with ha fa has more carboxylic phenolic and ketonic groups which possess ionic and hydrogen bonds and are building blocks of a microscopic hydrophobic inner structure therefore fa may be easier to combine with bpa to form fa bpa complex in which form bpa is wrapped by fa molecule increasing the steric hindrance for co 3 h o to reach bpa molecules and thus the degradation of bpa is more inhibited by fa than by ha with mixed nom in between 4 conclusions this study focused on the evaluation of the impact of water quality parameters on the formation of reactive radicals and the bpa degradation in the uv spc system the pathways of bpa transformation by co 3 were proposed for the first time the potential of uv spc system for wastewater treatment was assessed first with bpa degradation in the secondary effluents collected from a local wwtp and second with the impact of various water quality parameters i e ph common anions and nom on bpa degradation based on the results obtained and the discussion presented the following conclusions are drawn co 3 initiates bpa degradation via hydroxylation of the phenolic ring oxidation demethylation of the isopropylidene group and homolytic cleavage of the linking bond between isopropylidene and the aromatic ring co 3 oxidation can activate the isopropylidene group to accelerate bpa degradation in comparison to direct uv photolysis the increase of ph from 3 to 10 7 decreases the h o ss resulting in a decrease of k o b s in both systems the addition of hco 3 decreases both h o ss and co 3 ss leading to a significant decrease of k o b s in both systems nom shows little impact on the formation of co 3 while decreases h o ss in the order of fa mixed nom ha causing the corresponding decrease of k o b s the results from this study provide information on the kinetics and mechanism of bpa transformation in uv spc system the evaluation of the impact of water quality parameters provides insights towards the optimization of uv spc system for bpa degradation and gathers more information on the application potential of this

15892,reported herein is an investigation of the impact of water quality parameters on the formation of carbonate radical anion co 3 and hydroxyl radical h o in uv sodium percarbonate uv spc system versus in uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 system for bisphenol a bpa degradation in water pathways of co 3 oxidation of bpa were proposed in this study based on the evolution of direct transformation products of bpa observed in this study the degradation of bpa in the uv spc system was slower than that in the uv h2o2 system in the secondary effluents collected from a local wastewater treatment plant due to the significant impact of coexisting constituents in the matrices on the former system single water quality parameter e g solution ph common anion or natural organic matter affected radical formations and bpa degradation in the uv spc system in a way similar to that in the uv h2o2 system namely the rise of solution ph decreased the steady state concentration of h o resulting in a decrease in the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa k o b s chloride anion and sulfate anion played a negligible role over the examined concentrations nitrate anion slightly suppressed the reaction at the concentration of 20 mm bicarbonate anion decreased the steady state concentrations of both co 3 and h o exerting significant inhibition on bpa degradation different extents of h o scavenging were observed for different types of natural organic matter in the order of fulvic acid mixed nom humic acid however the impact was generally less pronounced on bpa degradation in the uv spc system than that in the uv h2o2 system due to the existence of co 3 the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of co 3 based oxidation and new scientific information regarding the impact of water quality parameters on bpa degradation in the sytems of uv spc and uv h2o2 from the aspect of reactive radical formation which have reference value for uv spc application

a bpa is an essential compound for synthesizing epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics that are widely used in the manufacture of many products such as plastic bottles food can linings and food beverage storage containers staples et al 1998 from 1993 to 2007 the weight of bpa released into the environment increased nearly 5 times from 109 tons staples et al 1998 to 500 tons usepa 2010 such extensive use of bpa has caused great concern on its potential damage to environmental sustainability the occurrence of bpa in a variety of media such as water air and soil has been reported fan et al 2021 parto et al 2021 vandenberg et al 2007 evidence has shown that exposure to bpa at environmental concentrations is detrimental to wildlife over time crain et al 2007 sharma and chadha 2021 epidemiological studies have indicated that bpa exposure can induce adverse health consequences including cancer endocrine disorder metabolic disturbance and neurodevelopment problems gao et al 2021 goralczyk 2021 mercogliano et al 2021 senra and lúcia fonseca 2021 for these reasons finding efficient technologies for bpa removal from wastewater is essential for effective protention of environmental and public safety uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 system has been extensively studied and applied for wastewater treatment in contrast the knowledge of physical chemical characteristics and environmental friendliness of uv sodium percarbonate uv spc system remains scarce in the literature our previous study gao et al 2020 reported that bpa could be effectively degraded at ph 8 5 in milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 at similar degradation rates both hydroxyl radical h o and carbonate radical anion co 3 were generated in the uv spc system for bpa degradation eqs 1 5 although the second order rate constant of co 3 towards bpa k c o 3 b p a 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 was smaller than that of h o k h o b p a 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 the steady state concentration of co 3 co 3 ss 2 3 10 12 m was significantly higher than that observed for h o h o ss 1 82 10 14 m in the same work four pathways of bpa degradation in the uv spc system were proposed based on the identified transformation products tps the above mentioned work gao et al 2020 generates interest on the role of co 3 in bpa transformation in uv spc system however that work neither differentiated the specific pathways of bpa transformation by co 3 from the comprehensive oxidation in uv spc system nor investigated the impact of water quality parameters e g solution ph common anions and natural organic matter nom on bpa degradation in uv spc system in this study the particular mechanism of bpa transformation by co 3 was investigated by tracking the evolution of direct tps of bpa transformed by co 3 the impact of solution ph 3 0 8 5 and 10 7 common anions c l so 4 2 no 3 and hco 3 and nom fulvic acid fa humic acid ha and mixed nom on the formation of both reactive radicals and the bpa degradation in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 was investigated because common water quality parameters may interfere in the formation of co 3 and h o through eq 1 17 listed in table 1 moreover bpa degradation in the secondary effluents before chlorination from a regional wastewater treatment plant wwtp was performed to evaluate the real impact of water qualities on bpa degradation in the uv spc system the overall objective of this study is to contribute a better understanding of the reaction mechanism of bpa transformation by co 3 to enrich the body of knowledge for uv spc system and to provide insights into the potential of uv spc sysem as an alternative to uv h2o2 system in specific scenarios and cases for wastewater treatment 2

about other chemicals please see text s1 provided in supplementary material sm solution ph was adjusted with h2so4 and maintained with sodium carbonate itself dissociated from spc or phosphate buffer the measured values of examined water quality parameters before and after corresponding experiments of single parameter impact are presented in table 2 the field water samples used in this study were secondary effluents before chlorination collected from a regional wwtp in march we mar june we jun september we sep and december we dec and directly applied without any further processing related water qualities of these samples are summarized in table 3 2 2 photochemical degradation and analytical methods since the literature does not report any information regarding the uv spectrum for spc activation we performed a scan of light absorbance for spc over 200 400 nm uv wavelength range in the non vacuum environment the obtained spectrum fig s1 shows that uv with wavelength shorter than 300 nm is good for spc activation however too short wavelength requires too high energy input and the uv light used in most applied technologies is emitted from low pressure lamps at a wavelength of 253 7 nm usepa 1999 thus uv 253 7 was chosen in this study to activate spc for uv spc system in consideration of compatibility to existing water and wastewater treatment processes and energy efficiency the degradation experiments either for bpa removal or tp analysis purpose were adapted from those described in our previously published paper gao et al 2020 please refer to text s2 in sm for more details the methods used for the measurement of bpa concentration and the identification of tps were similar to those reported in the same paper as degradation experiments gao et al 2020 the methods for determination of water quality parameters were described in detail in sm the statistical analysis was adapted from published manual lai et al 2022 for more information please see text s3 in sm 2 3

obs f steady state concentrations of h o and co 3 were assumed in this study since the concentrations of h2o2 and carbonate species did not change significantly before and after experiments the bpa

2020 the calculation of h o ss and co 3 ss was described in detail in the same paper gao et al 2020 briefly the competitive degradation of bpa and phoh in the uv spc system is expressed by eqs 21 22

direct uv photolysis control and in uv spc t buoh system because bpa degradation in the direct uv photolysis control is almost negligible as observed in our previous work gao et al 2020 and excess t buoh k h o t b u o h t b u o h k h o b p a b p a can quench bpa reaction with h o bpa transformation in the uv spc t buoh system is primarily attributed to co 3 oxidation the tps found for each system and their evolution profiles with uv fluence are shown in tables s2 s4 under direct uv photolysis bpa degradation was extremely slow and insignificant yet we still managed to detect the hydroxylated tps a1 a3 quinone tps a2 a3 and single ring tp c1 in this system suggesting that direct uv photolysis of bpa occurs mainly through hydroxylation of phenolic ring quinonation of phenolic ring and cleavage of the linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group moreover all tps appeared from the beginning and continuously accumulated over the entire test range of uv fluence table s3 which means bpa is being continuously transformed into these tps this result confirms that uv photolysis of bpa is slow and therefore may be not able to achieve complete oxidation in the uv spc t buoh system the hydroxylated tps quinone tps and single ring tps were also detected and the relative abundance of these tps was much higher than that observed in the direct uv photolysis this implies that the phenolic ring and the linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group are common reactive sites for direct uv photolysis and co 3 oxidation of bpa in addition isopropylidene modified tps were only detected in the uv spc t buoh system which suggests that co 3 attack can activate the isopropylidene group facilitating bpa degradation as for carboxylic tps they were uniquely detected in the uv spc t buoh system indicating that co 3 oxidation of bpa realizes the cleavage of benzene ring and therefore is a more complete oxidation process than direct uv photolysis the evolution of tps with uv fluence in the uv spc t buoh system table s4 shows that single hydroxylated tps were formed at uv fluence between 0 1009 mj cm 2 above 1009 mj cm 2 multi hydroxylated tps started to form and were extensively detected at high uv fluence this demonstrates that multi hydroxylation of bpa is relatively difficult and slower than single hydroxylation it is worth mentioning that hydroxylated tps of b1 b2 c1 c2 and c5 c6 were consecutively evolved indicating that ring hydroxylation of isopropylidene modified tps and single ring tps occurs after isopropylidene modification and cleavage of linking bond between phenolic ring and isopropylidene group in addition the massive production of carboxylic tps at higher uv fluences confirms that ring cleavage is the result of continuous oxidation based on the discussion above the pathways of bpa degradation by co 3 was proposed as depicted in fig 1 a hydroxylation the interaction of co 3 with the electron rich phenolic ring causes instability in the electron configuration of aromatic ring one electron is transferred from the phenolic ring to co 3 generating a bpa radical cation the addition of a hydroxyl group to the bpa radical cation at the ortho position of phenolic ring carbon no 2 or 4 in water containing molecular oxygen induces hydroxylation of bpa the hydroxylation of bpa increases the density of electron on the phenolic ring leading to multi hydroxylation of phenolic ring following the same mechanism b oxidation demethylation the attack of co 3 to isopropylidene group abstracts a hydrogen atom and initiates a series of radical chain oxidation processes in the oxic environment forming a demethylated bpa radical d bpa radical and then isopropylidene modified tps the phenolic rings of isopropylidene modified tps are hydroxylated afterwards via the same mechanism as hydroxylation c homolytic cleavage the addition of hydroxyl group to bpa radical cation at the para position of phenolic ring carbon no 4 induces homolytic cleavage of the benzylic bond forming hydroquinone and 4 isopropylphenol radicals this also can be achieved by secondary β scission as mentioned in our previous paper gao et al 2020 water solvent turns the 4 isopropylphenol radical into corresponding alcohols ketones and alkenes afterwards hydroxylation of the phenolic rings of generated tps is carried out ultimately continuous oxidation of tps generates carboxylic tps and small molecular acids step by step until complete mineralization of bpa as opposed to the general pathways of bpa degradation in uv spc system proposed in our previous paper gao et al 2020 which are a combined result of h o and co 3 oxidation the reaction pathways proposed here are specific to bpa transformation by co 3 a step further from our previous work the discussion in this section confirms the initiation of phenolic ring oxidation by co 3 through one electron transfer proposes a new mechanism for isopropylidene modification through oxidation demethylation by co 3 and a new mechanism for isopropylidene bridge cleavage via homolytic cleavage according to the chemical properties of co 3 and finds that co 3 attack can activate the isopropylidene group to facilitate bpa degradation 3 2 bpa degradation in the secondary effluents to evaluate the general impact of water qualities on the treatment performance of uv spc process bpa degradation was conducted in the secondary effluents from a regional wwtp collected in different months these water samples are different from the ones reported in our previous work regarding collection time and water qualities refer to section 2 1 for more information about these samples the results of bpa degradation by uv spc process were compared with those by uv h2o2 as shown in fig 2 bpa degradation by uv spc process was not as efficient as that by uv h2o2 process in the secondary effluents without ph change and at neutral alkaline ph the acidification of matrix significantly increased the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa degradation by uv spc process k o b s u v s p c to the level equal to or higher than the observed pseudo first order rate constant of bpa degradation by uv h2o2 process k o b s u v h 2 o 2 the efficiencies of bpa degradation by uv spc and uv h2o2 processes were reported to be comparable in milli q water gao et al 2020 so the obviously smaller k o b s u v s p c than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 in the secondary effluents underlines the stronger interference of water qualities on bpa degradation by uv spc process than on bpa degradation by uv h2o2 multi parameter variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning for the data obtained from the above experiments were performed to evaluate the individual contributions of measured water quality parameters of collected secondary effluents to the total impact of water qualities on bpa degradation in the uv spc system in these matrices the obtained contribution percentages are displayed in fig 2b which shows the independent contributions of ph toc and alkalinity to the total impact of secondary effluent qualities are 59 39 34 63 and 10 22 respectively this means ph toc and alkalinity are three major water quality parameters that impact bpa degradation in the uv spc system in secondary effluents this result is consistent with the observations in the impact of single water quality parameter on bpa degradation as discussed in the following sections where the change of ph toc and hco 3 significantly altered the efficiency of bpa degradation in uv spc system in the following sections bpa degradation in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 with different ph common anions and nom were investigated to shed light on the understanding of how these water quality parameters affect bpa degradation and how they interfere in the formation of h o and co 3 in these systems 3 3 impact of solution ph to study the impact of solution ph on bpa degradation and the formation of reactive radicals in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 milli q water was used as reaction solution to exclude interferences from other water quality parameters solution ph of 3 0 8 5 and 10 7 were chosen to mimic the ph conditions of concentrated landfill leachate ph 3 finished sewage ph 8 5 and water dissolving of 1 m spc ph 10 7 the increase of ph decreased k o b s in both systems fig 3a one possible cause can be the decrease of h o ss for the following two reasons first the concentration of h o h o increases with the increase of ph for example the h o at ph 3 0 is only about 10 5 μm while the h o at ph 10 7 increases to over 500 μm because the quantum yield of h o produced in uv photolysis of h2o2 remains constant at different ph khan et al 2014 the scavenging of h o by h o eq 6 decreases h o ss in the alkaline environment second the phenolic ring of bpa is gradually deprotonated into phenolate anion with the increase of ph clara et al 2004 westall et al 1985 the phenolate anion has strong uv absorbance gillam and stern 1954 thus competing against h2o2 for uv radiation photons resulting in the decrease of h o generation the determined steady state concentrations of reactive radicals radical ss fig 3b at different ph confirms the decrease of h o ss in both systems when the solution ph was increased from 3 0 to 10 7 the h o ss in the uv h2o2 system decreased from 1 0 10 12 m to 2 3 10 13 m the h o ss in the uv spc system decreased from 3 9 10 14 m to 3 3 10 16 m in uv spc system the speciation of bpa at high ph values can be another cause of decreased value of k o b s according to reported data in literature clara et al 2004 staples et al 1998 the pka value of bpa falls between 9 6 11 3 which means bpa is more likely to be electronegative at ph 9 6 because co 3 is negatively charged as well the electrostatic repulsion between co 3 and bpa decreases the reactivity of co 3 towards bpa resulting in the decreased efficiency of bpa degradation in the akaline conditions moreover the co 3 ss remained around 1 8 10 12 m in the examined ph range of 3 0 10 7 fig 3b demonstrating the negligible impact of solution ph on co 3 formation the increase of solution ph from 3 0 to 10 7 increased r c o 3 from 39 to 79 indicating that bpa oxidation by co 3 increases with the increase of solution ph the r c o 3 r t o t a l increased from 43 at ph 3 0 to 99 at ph 10 7 illustrating that co 3 gradually becomes the key species responsible for bpa degradation as the solution ph increases because the ph impact on bpa degradation in the uv spc system is mitigated by such responses of co 3 k o b s u v s p c decreased more slowly than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 with the increase of solution ph 3 4 impact of common anions anions that are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environment may pose beneficial or adverse effects on the performance of different aops parsons 2004 four common anions in water i e c l so 4 2 no 3 and hco 3 were chosen in this study to investigate the impact of common anions at four common concentrations 0 5 10 and 20 mm at ph 8 5 the dominant species of carbonic system is hco 3 thus the impact of hco 3 instead of the impact of co 3 2 was investigated in this study as shown in fig 4a d the impact of the chosen anions on bpa degradation in the uv spc system were similar to that observed in the uv h2o2 system specifically c l and so 4 2 had negligible impact no 3 at concentration of 20 mm slightly inhibited bpa degradation and hco 3 significantly decreased k o b s at all examined concentrations possible reactions of c l in both systems are shown in eqs 8 11 neta et al 1988 reported that eq 10 11 only take place under acidic condition and are negligible at ph 8 5 the formation and dissociation of clo h eqs 8 9 occurs at comparable rates and c l is nonreactive with co 3 therefore c l had little influence on bpa degradation the influence of so 4 2 on bpa degradation was negligible in both systems it is consistent with the fact that neither h o nor co 3 appreciably reacts with so 4 2 no 3 a well known photosensitizer can initiate a series of reactions under light irradiation producing reactive nitrogen species rns e g ono o o 2 no o no 2 no 2 n o under the experimental condition in this study i e ph 8 5 and uv λ 253 7 nm the dominant reactions are expressed in eqs 12 14 huang et al huang et al 2018 found that bpa could be degraded in uv no 3 system ascribed to rns oxidation and the rate of bpa degradation in the uv no 3 system was significantly enhanced in the presence of hco 3 however in this study a slight inhibition was observed on the degradation of bpa in both systems with the addition of 20 mm no 3 this is likely because 1 the quantum yield of no 3 φ 0 102 0 002 eq 12 and φ 0 037 0 004 eq 14 is significantly lower than the quantum yield of h2o2 φ 1 eq 1 thus rns cannot be sufficiently generated in the uv systems containing h2o2 2 at high concentration of 20 mm the photosensitization of no 3 considerably decreases the incident photons for h2o2 activation and the generated rns scavenges h o eq 13 in the system hco 3 displayed significant inhibition on the degradation of bpa in both systems and the inhibiting effect increased with the increasing concentration of hco 3 hco 3 addition of hco 3 into uv h2o2 system renders uv h2o2 system the ability to generate co 3 following the same reactions as those in uv spc system eqs 1 3 this is supported by the data displayed in fig 4e where the values of h o ss and co 3 ss in the the uv h2o2 system after addition of hco 3 were similar to those in the uv spc system the plunge of h o ss after the addition of hco 3 eq 2 is the reason for the sudden drop of k o b s in both systems the gradual lower of co 3 ss as a result of the increased importance of eq 7 in hco 3 rich solutions explains why the k o b s gradually decreases with the increase of hco 3 in the meanwhile the r h o and r c o 3 decreased proportionally to k o b s and the r c o 3 rtotal kept nearly constant regardless of hco 3 change fig 4f in addition the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the uv h2o2 system remained between 81 and 88 after the addition of hco 3 scatter line with empty triangle in fig 4f the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the uv spc system was kept between 83 and 89 although the addition of 5 mm hco 3 increased r c o 3 r t o t a l from 70 to 88 due to the sharp decrease of h o ss scatter line with solid circle in fig 4f this points out that co 3 is the main species responsible for bpa degradation in the presence of 5 20 mm hco 3 in both systems 3 5 impact of different types of natural organic matter in addition to common anions nom is another category of substances present in natural waters that can significantly affect radical based aops autin et al 2013 fan et al 2013 li and hu 2018 in order to investigate the impact of nom on the degradation of bpa in the systems of uv spc and uv h2o2 different types of nom from suwannee river fa ha and mixed nom were spiked into reaction solutions at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 the results displayed in fig 5a demonstrate that all types of nom inhibited the degradation of bpa in both systems with the inhibiting effects being increased as the concentration of nom nom was further increased this could be because 1 nom scavenges both reactive radicals of h o and co 3 2 nom absorbs the incident light absorbance 253 7 nm in table 2 decreasing the light availability for the generation of h o and the subsequent generation of co 3 3 the formation of nom bpa complex decreases the accessibility of bpa by co 3 and ho as shown in fig 5b the h o ss in the uv spc system decreased from 1 77 10 14 m without nom to 6 31 10 15 m 4 47 10 15 m and 2 18 10 15 m in the presence of 20 mg l 1 toc of ha mixed nom and fa respectively the co 3 ss in the uv spc system decreased from 1 9 10 12 m to 3 03 10 13 m 5 12 10 13 m and 4 80 10 13 m respectively the h o ss in the uv h2o2 system decreased from 6 50 10 13 m to 3 35 10 13 m 1 96 10 13 m and 1 85 10 13 m respectively different types of nom inhibited bpa degradation in both systems following the sequence of fa mixed nom ha with the presence of different types of nom at the concentration of 20 mm mg l 1 toc the co 3 ss in fig 5b stay close to each other in fig 5c are similar to each other the decrease of h o ss and r h o follows the order of fa mixed nom ha therefore the different inhibiting effects of different types of nomis related to the different effects of different types of nom on the formation of h o which can be explained by light shadowing effect and photosensitivity as presented in table 2 the uv absorbance of different types of nom is generally in the order of fa mixed nom ha the more light is absorbed by nom the less light is available for radical generation recent studies bodhipaksha et al 2017 loiselle et al 2012 mccabe and arnold 2017 schmitt et al 2017 have shown that nom can undergo photochemical reactions by which nom with large molecular weight and active functional groups is excited from ground state 1nom to excited state 3nom under uv or uv vis irradiation eq 15 3nom can transfer energy to dissolved oxygen or water generating reactive species such as 1o2 and h o eq 16 17 which can promote the degradation of certain organics in case of bpa the oxidation of bpa by 3nom generated reactive species is supposed to be mainly achieved by h o because the redox potential of 1o2 e 1 o 2 o 2 0 65 v krumova and cosa 2016 is much lower than that of h o e h o h 2 o 2 33 v krumova and cosa 2016 therefore the inhibiting effect of nom on bpa degradation can be mitigated by the photosensitive reactions as described above as reported by luo et al 2018 fa mainly consists of small molecules 100 g mole 1 molecular weight 10 000 g mole 1 and is a mixture of linear carbon chains and cyclic organic acids these components determine that fa is less photosensitive and mainly exhibits scavenging effect on the contrary ha consists of large molecules molecular weight 50 000 g mole 1 and has aromatic or carbon rings containing oxygen hydrogen nitrogen or sulfur luo et al 2018 such composition of ha makes ha highly photosensitive resulting in the least decrease of h o ss because mixed nom contains both fa and ha the impact of mixed nom is expected to fall between ha and fa under this background co 3 oxidation of bpa contributes more to bpa degradation in the presence of fa than that in the presence of the other types of nom for example as displayed in fig 5c the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of fa at 20 mg l 1 toc was 82 8 the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of mixed nom at 20 mg l 1 toc was 67 2 the r c o 3 r t o t a l in the presence of ha at 20 mg l 1 toc was 51 2 moreover the different inhibiting effect of different types of nom may be also asscoiated with the different complexation ability of different types of nom it has been reported that nom tend to combine with nonpolar hydrophobic organic compounds e g dialkyl phthalate ogner and schnitzer 1970 via trapping the nonpolar organics in a microscopic hydrophobic environment formed by a micellar or double layer inner structure or bonding these organics with ionic and hydrogen bonds gaffney et al 1996 in comparison with ha fa has more carboxylic phenolic and ketonic groups which possess ionic and hydrogen bonds and are building blocks of a microscopic hydrophobic inner structure therefore fa may be easier to combine with bpa to form fa bpa complex in which form bpa is wrapped by fa molecule increasing the steric hindrance for co 3 h o to reach bpa molecules and thus the degradation of bpa is more inhibited by fa than by ha with mixed nom in between 4 conclusions this study focused on the evaluation of the impact of water quality parameters on the formation of reactive radicals and the bpa degradation in the uv spc system the pathways of bpa transformation by co 3 were proposed for the first time the potential of uv spc system for wastewater treatment was assessed first with bpa degradation in the secondary effluents collected from a local wwtp and second with the impact of various water quality parameters i e ph common anions and nom on bpa degradation based on the results obtained and the discussion presented the following conclusions are drawn co 3 initiates bpa degradation via hydroxylation of the phenolic ring oxidation demethylation of the isopropylidene group and homolytic cleavage of the linking bond between isopropylidene and the aromatic ring co 3 oxidation can activate the isopropylidene group to accelerate bpa degradation in comparison to direct uv photolysis the increase of ph from 3 to 10 7 decreases the h o ss resulting in a decrease of k o b s in both systems the addition of hco 3 decreases both h o ss and co 3 ss leading to a significant decrease of k o b s in both systems nom shows little impact on the formation of co 3 while decreases h o ss in the order of fa mixed nom ha causing the corresponding decrease of k o b s the results from this study provide information on the kinetics and mechanism of bpa transformation in uv spc system the evaluation of the impact of water quality parameters provides insights towards the optimization of uv spc system for bpa degradation and gathers more information on the application potential of this

15893,with the massive use and discarding of plastic products plastic particles including nanoplastics nps which are continuously released under the action of environmental factors are posing greater risk to the ecosystem and human health nps exposed to the environment experience aging which can significantly change their physical and chemical properties and affect their environmental behavior here we examined the adsorption behavior of polystyrene nanoplastic psnp aging by ultraviolet uv exposure on different minerals goethite magnetite kaolinite and montmorillonite aging not only changes the surface morphology of psnp but also increases the surface negative charge and produces a large number of oxygen containing functional groups ofgs incubation of aged psnp with minerals indicated that iron oxides goethite and magnetite showed stronger interactions with aged psnp than pristine psnp and there was an interaction between clay minerals and aged psnp the adsorption experiments and scanning electron microscopy sem suggested that the higher adsorption capacity of a mineral surface to aged psnp may be related to electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra after adsorption showed that the adsorption affinity between the functional groups was different and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis further indicated that the mineral preferentially adsorbed the aged psnp in accordance with the order of ofgs the findings provide a theoretical basis for scientific evaluation of ecological risks of nps in the environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene nanoplastic ultraviolet aging minerals adsorption electrostatic interaction 1 introduction plastics are known as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century and have been widely used in various industries due to mass production koelmans et al 2014 the total consumption of plastics in countries around the world has reached 300 million tons per year but less than 10 can be recycled shen et al 2020 the emergence of plastic waste is quickly becoming an urgent environmental pollution problem worldwide china is a major country in the production and use of plastics accounting for approximately a quarter of the world s plastic products produced and used every year jiang et al 2020 in this process plastics inevitably enter the environment leading to the widespread existence of plastic debris in oceans cai et al 2018b wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017b rivers di and wang 2018 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a lakes mao et al 2020a su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the atmosphere liu et al 2019c soil ding et al 2020b he et al 2018 liu et al 2018 and sediments peng et al 2017 in the environment plastic debris can slowly biodegrade or break down into small particles after weathering and ultraviolet radiation duan et al 2021 mao et al 2020b sait et al 2021 particles with a size 100 nm are called nanoplastics nps li et al 2017 heavy metals and organic pollutants with high toxicity are easily enriched on the surface of nps which enter organisms through different ways and pass along the food chain thus causing joint toxic effects on organisms and even human health ma et al 2020 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b therefore scientific assessment of the environmental behavior and ecological risks of nps is crucial after being released into the aquatic system nps may undergo a process of aggregation which affects their fate and transportation and poses potential risks to the natural environment besseling et al 2017 da costa et al 2016 wang et al 2021b minerals with large surface areas and functional groups are widely present in water as active substances and are important components of sediments and soils han et al 2008 previous studies showed that minerals are of great importance to the environmental processes of pollutants for instance bacteria were absorbed on hematite according to electrostatic attraction in the soil and underground environment yan et al 2016 wang et al 2013 found that iron oxides can change the electrostatic force on the surface of biochar by combining with it and reducing its migration ability in the environment yun and jin 2020 found that the mineral surface had a higher adsorption affinity for dissolved organic matter dom leached from microplastics which may be related to both ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction similar to dom and biochar once nps enter the environment they interact with active substances in the environment this changes the interface properties surface activity and chemical properties of nps thus affecting their environmental behaviors li et al 2019 our previous studies found that the distribution characteristics of unaged polystyrene nanoplastic psnp on different minerals were mainly affected by electrostatic interactions while iron oxides had an important influence on the distribution of psnp zhang et al 2020 it has been reported that plastics including nps can undergo various aging processes and that their surface is oxidized to produce more oxygen containing functional groups ofgs such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups than fresh plastics bracco et al 2018 singh et al 2002 the aging process of nps in the environment may change their colloidal stability making them more concentrated or dispersed in water thus affecting the environmental fate of other pollutants such as heavy metals and hydrophilic organic pollutants liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019d however the effect of these natural aging processes on the interaction between nps and minerals remains unclear and this hinders our understanding of the overall fate and impact of nps in ecosystems to understand such effects we investigated polystyrene nanoplastic psnp of 50 100 nm in diameter as a representative model of nanoplastic alimi et al 2018 and four typical minerals goethite magnetite montmorillonite and kaolinite with different surface charges that widely exist in the environment psnp was aged for different days by uv irradiation to obtain two aged psnps with diverse surfaces and constitutive properties the adsorption properties between aged psnp and minerals were investigated and changes in surface morphology and functional groups were examined based on these results we attempted to uncover the interaction mechanism between aged psnp and minerals in addition we assessed the effect of ph on the interaction these findings will advance our understanding of the behavior and ecological risks of nps under environmentally relevant conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kaolinite and montmorillonite were purchased from fluka germany goethite and magnetite were purchased from sigma united states all minerals were passed through a 0 15 mm screen for subsequent use to obtain aged psnp the standard psnp solution macklin 25000 mg l dispersed uniformly at 50 100 nm was diluted with deionized water and then ultrasonicated at 100 w 20 khz kq 300de shumei for 30 min to prepare the psnp suspension 250 mg l the suspension was aged by ultraviolet radiation cai et al 2018a liu et al 2019b briefly the psnp suspension in h2o2 10 vol was added to a quartz tube and irradiated under uv light 500 w mercury lamps for 1 or 5 days at 25 c the two samples were denoted uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 respectively an aged psnp stock solution of 250 mg l was prepared and diluted to the desired concentrations of 0 5 1 5 20 and 50 mg l in ultrapure water to be used as the comparative calculation standard to determine the aged psnp concentration in subsequent experiments the concentrations of the aged psnp were measured using flow cytometry cytoflex beckman based on pre established calibration curves of psnp before and after aging which correlated the mass concentrations of psnp to number concentrations fig s1 since the aging process of psnp in the environment may change their colloidal stability colloidal stability experiments were performed briefly 20 mg l pristine psnp uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 were added to the brown glass vial and ultrasonicated at 100 w for 30 min then the vials were allowed to stand for 10 days and samples were taken at 1 3 5 7 and 10 days to measure the concentration and hydrodynamic diameter 2 2 adsorption experiments to preliminarily judge the interaction between aged psnp and minerals the absorbance of minerals in the presence of aged psnp at 800 nm od800 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis the preliminary experiment is provided in text s1 of the supplementary material the interaction between aged psnp and minerals was further studied by batch adsorption experiments for the kinetic adsorption experiment aged psnp solutions with 20 mg l concentrations were prepared and then each glass vial was filled with 20 ml of aged psnp solution and 0 015 g of minerals kaolinite montmorillonite goethite and magnetite the mixture was shaken in a thermostatic oscillator thz 98c yiheng shanghai 25 c 150 rpm and the samples were collected at various times 0 25 0 5 1 3 5 7 12 24 36 and 48 h the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min to remove the minerals from the aged psnp suspension then 5 ml of supernatant was taken cautiously to measure the concentrations of aged psnp using flow cytometry the experiment was repeated twice for each group in the adsorption isotherm experiment different amounts of adsorbents 0 01 0 01 0 015 0 015 and 0 02 g were added to brown vials containing aged psnp solutions at 1 5 10 20 and 30 mg l after shaking the solution samples were centrifuged 30 min 3000 rpm and then 5 ml of supernatant was removed for detection each group was repeated twice the details of the adsorption models are described in text s2 2 3 effect of ph on adsorption the ph values of the solution were adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 using koh and hno3 and each glass vial received 0 015 g of adsorbent and 20 ml of aged psnp solution at 20 mg l glass vials were placed in a thermostatic oscillator and shaken at 25 c at 150 rpm for 24 h then the samples were centrifuged 30 min 3000 rpm and 5 ml of supernatant was collected for analysis each group had three parallel samples as a reference 2 4 dissolved fe3 from goethite and magnetite and their impacts on aged psnp aggregation goethite and magnetite release fe ions in aqueous solutions to determine whether the dissolved fe ions affect the interaction of aged psnp and iron oxides we studied the effects of fe3 on the aggregation and sedimentation of aged psnp the concentration of fe ions was detected through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icaprq thermo fisher the aged psnp aggregation was determined by measuring the hydrodynamic diameter the detailed information is described in text s3 2 5 ftir and 2d cos analysis ftir spectrometry vetex70 bruker was employed to monitor the changes in functional groups of aged psnp and its mixtures with minerals at different times each spectrum was investigated and subtracted from the baseline in a scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 and resolution of 2 cm 1 the details are described in text s4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was applied to examine the origins of the ir peaks of the samples using 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan the 2d cos data were processed via matlab r2010a mathworks inc prior to the 2d cos analysis all ftir spectra were normalized baseline corrected and denoised by savitzky golay smoothing more details of the 2d cos analysis are supplied in text s5 2 6 characterization of minerals and aged psnp for minerals and aged psnp an appropriate amount of minerals that passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and psnp under different uv irradiation times was collected for characterization for minerals and aged psnp mixtures the residue after removal of the supernatant from the above adsorption experiments was dried and then characterized for both minerals and aged psnp scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei czech republic was used to characterize the morphologies and physical dimensions autosorb 1 quantachrome usa was used to determine the surface areas by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface chemical information of aged psnp was obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher escalab 250xi a nanolaser particle size analyzer zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk was applied to measure the point of zero charge pzc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of aged psnp aging processes i e uv exposure greatly altered the surface properties of psnp fig 1 as shown in fig 1a the pristine psnp particles were spherical and showed relatively smooth surfaces without cracks or other defects with an increase in uv irradiation time the morphological features i e surface smoothness size and shape of uv psnp1 fig 1b were significantly different from those of untreated psnp with rougher surfaces and holes after aging of 5 days the surface became much more irregular and some debris was observed fig 1c which may be caused by the embrittlement and fragmentation of the material horton et al 2017 on the whole as the aging time increased the shape of the psnp gradually shrank and cracks and pits gradually appeared on the surface xps data ftir spectra and 2d cos maps were employed to elucidate the aging process and mechanisms of psnp compared with the pristine psnp the uv treated psnp had abundant surface ofgs varying in carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy hydroxyl groups fig 1d e and f the ftir spectra data were basically consistent with the differences in the surface oxidation degree of the three materials mentioned above as shown in fig s2a due to the stretching vibration of c h in the aromatic ring and main chain the spectrum of the pristine psnp showed major peaks in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 whereas peaks at 1605 1483 1453 758 and 697 cm 1 were attributed to the skeleton vibration and deformation of c h kaczmarek et al 2008 additional bands appeared in the spectra of the aged psnp for instance a peak c o stretching was appeared at 1667 cm 1 with increasing of aging time c o and o c o stretching bands at 1030 cm 1 and 1716 cm 1 were also observed peaks at 1376 cm 1 were caused by c oh tensile ding et al 2020a the above band intensity increased with increasing uv irradiation time indicating that psnp was aged after uv irradiation the 2d cos data further confirmed this result the cross peaks in the synchronous maps fig s2b represent the frequency bands with coupled sources or related sources a positive sign indicates that the band intensity changes in the same direction and a negative sign indicates the opposite direction zhou et al 2017 the results suggested that the major ftir peaks changed concurrently during the aging process there were six major autopeaks recognized at 1030 1376 1483 1605 1667 and 1716 cm 1 along the diagonal of aged psnp moreover positive and negative signs of cross peaks were observed in the synchronous maps table s1 and fig s2b indicating that almost all of the cross peaks were asynchronized during the aging process with increasing aging time the peak intensity at 1667 cm 1 which corresponds to c o was the highest followed by the peaks at 1483 c h and 1030 cm 1 c o and the lowest was at 1483 cm 1 according to the rules of noda 2018a the sign of the cross peaks in the asynchronous map fig s2c table s1 suggested the order of the aging process of psnp as 1667 c o 1376 c oh 1483 c h 1030 c o 1716 o c o 1605 cm 1 c h the first occurrence of the functional group in the psnp aging process was c o on the aromatic ring followed by c h on the aromatic ring these results indicated that abundant ofgs were produced on the psnp surface under uv irradiation the ofgs could be generated by c h bond tertiary c atom breaking hydrogen extraction of peroxy radicals coo disproportionation of alkoxy radicals co and radical driven continuous oxidation duan et al 2022 yousif and haddad 2013 in this process the ofgs were gradually formed by c oh c o and carbonyl bands c o the charge properties of psnp at different solution ph values usually estimated through the measurements of zeta potentials provide a mechanized understanding of the adsorption behavior of psnp on mineral surfaces safiur rahman et al 2013 the zeta potential of psnp was detected in the ph range of 2 0 to 11 0 in this study fig s3a all psnp samples showed negative zeta potentials at ph values greater than 2 0 additionally the charge properties of the three psnp samples i e pristine and uv aged samples were significantly different at any given ph compared with the pristine psnp the aged psnp exhibited a stronger negative charge for instance the zeta potentials at ph 7 of the pristine and uv psnp2 samples were 24 63 mv and 35 83 mv respectively this is due to the acidic function of psnp generating carboxyl containing photolysis byproducts after uv irradiation psnp with more negative charges is more likely to be adsorbed on minerals with net positive charge on the surface through electrostatic attraction while minerals with net negative charge on the surface are less adsorbed because of electrostatic repulsion comparing the pzcs of the four minerals fig s4 it can be deduced that the psnp after uv irradiation is more easily adsorbed on goethite and magnetite than pristine psnp however the difference in adsorption affinity between montmorillonite and kaolinite may not be pronounced in addition colloid stability experiments suggested that the psnp suspension whether it was treated with uv light was stable within 10 days fig s3b and c 3 2 effect of aged psnp on minerals the od800 was detected to preliminarily study the interactions between the four minerals and aged psnp fig 2 a compared with that of pristine psnp the od800 of the four minerals with aged psnp changed considerably when the four minerals were put in the aged psnp suspension their od800 values were obviously different from that in pure water p 0 05 which indicated that there were strong interactions between minerals and the aged psnp it seems that uv psnp2 had a stronger reaction with goethite and magnetite for montmorillonite and kaolinite the suspended mineral absorbance after sedimentation for 5 h in the aged psnp suspension was significantly changed p 0 05 in comparison with that in water indicating an interaction between montmorillonite or kaolinite and the aged psnp similar to iron oxides goethite and magnetite uv psnp2 had a strong reaction with clay minerals montmorillonite and kaolinite while uv psnp1 had a weak reaction with clay minerals based on the above findings the aged psnp was separately reacted with these four minerals for 48 h and then the suspension was centrifuged as shown in fig 2b the aged psnp concentrations in all mineral suspensions changed considerably especially magnetite and goethite further illustrating that there were interactions between minerals and the aged psnp in comparison with pristine psnp and uv psnp1 uv psnp2 had obvious interactions with minerals indicating that the longer the aging time of psnp the easier it is adsorbed on minerals the effect of solution ph on psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d adsorption was examined over a ph range of 3 to 11 fig 2c and d for all minerals the adsorption of psnp was highly ph dependent and the adsorption capacity was greater at lower ph values this could be because the position dependence including ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction contributes more to the adsorption process at lower ph values hur and schlautman 2004 weng et al 2007 the effects of ph on iron oxides goethite and magnetite were more distinct than those on clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite in the given ph range for instance the adsorption rates of uv psnp1 varied from 13 51 to 98 76 on magnetite in comparison with 2 28 to 11 46 on montmorillonite this can be explained by the fact that the pzcs of the two minerals were different and the overall trend of the adsorption near the pzc values of minerals drastically changed avena and koopal 1999 to more directly understand the interactions between minerals and aged psnp sem was employed to investigate the morphological features after adsorption fig 3 the sem images showed that magnetite appeared as dodecahedral and octahedral diamond structures while goethite was in a nanorod shape kaolinite and montmorillonite both showed flake like shapes with a lateral size of approximately 1000 nm from fig 3 it is obvious that there is no psnp adsorption on the clay mineral surface but there is psnp adsorption on the iron oxide surface furthermore with increasing aging time an increasing number of psnp pellets were adsorbed on the surface of minerals the number of psnp pellets adsorbed on the goethite surface is greater than that of magnetite which may be caused by electrostatic attraction and the larger bet surface area of goethite than magnetite table s2 more aged psnp pellets were adsorbed on montmorillonite than kaolinite since both clay minerals and aged psnp are negatively charged adsorption may be controlled by mechanisms other than electrostatic action because releasing fe ions e g fe3 fe oh 2 and fe oh from magnetite and goethite destabilize the aged psnp suspension the dissolution of magnetite and goethite particles at ph 3 0 11 0 was examined fig s5 when the ph value is 3 0 11 0 the release range of fe ions from goethite is 0 013 0 264 mg l and that in magnetite is 0 052 0 235 mg l based on the assumption that aged psnp aggregates are spherical the hydrodynamic diameters of aged psnp in the presence of fe ions were measured fig 4 a the results showed that when the fe3 concentration was 0 007 mm i e 0 392 mg l aged psnp formed large aggregates fig 4b this indicated that the release of iron ions from magnetite and goethite did not significantly induce the aggregation of aged psnp under experimental conditions 3 3 adsorption behavior of aged psnp on minerals 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics from fig 5 the adsorption capacity of psnp on iron oxides was greater than that of clay minerals and the adsorption capacity of psnp on minerals increased with the aging time of psnp regardless of irradiation all psnp reached apparent equilibrium within 12 h fig 5 the adsorption kinetic parameters are presented in table s3 it seems that the adsorption of aged psnp on minerals fit the pseudo second order model well r 2 0 946 which suggested that the adsorption of aged psnp on minerals was controlled by chemical adsorption the equilibrium concentrations qe of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 fitted by the pseudo second order model are different for instance the mean values of qe of uv psnp2 on kaolinite are approximately 2 8 times those of uv psnp1 this can be explained by the different surface charges of the two psnp samples this can also be attributed to the fact that the molecular size of psnp decreases with aging while the diffusion rate of small molecules is higher and it is easier to carry out in the rapid initial adsorption process kilduff et al 1996 additionally the adsorption kinetics data of psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d on all minerals were fitted by the intraparticle diffusion model as shown in fig s6a and b the adsorption process of aged psnp on minerals consists of three stages compared with pristine psnp two stages first the rate of adsorption was faster and the adsorption of a large amount of aged psnp on the surface of the adsorbents belonged to surface adsorption then the aged psnp diffused slowly from the liquid film to the micropores the above two stages were physical adsorption guo et al 2018 finally due to the small pore size a chemical process occurred and the rate of diffusion within the particles was very slow indicating that the rate limiting step of the adsorption process was controlled by the pseudo second order model guo et al 2018 moreover the first row did not cross the origin suggesting that diffusion within particles was not because of adsorption constraints and that other mechanisms are involved in diffusion within particles wen et al 2015 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d onto minerals are shown in fig 6 and the related model parameters are listed in table s4 the r 2 values of the freundlich and langmuir models were all high r 2 0 967 indicating that these two isotherm models can suitably explain the adsorption behaviors of the three kinds of psnp although the equilibrium adsorption behaviors were well depicted it is worth noting that the parameters of the langmuir model were theoretically limited by several assumptions including homogeneous surfaces and monolayer adsorption cai et al 2018a while the freundlich model assumed that the adsorbent had heterogeneous surfaces that were suitable for monolayer and multilayer adsorption wu et al 2019 for the same mineral the adsorption affinity kf of aged psnp was much higher than that of pristine psnp the kf value of uv psnp1 was 66 6 6 30 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n on goethite compared to 49 7 9 26 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n for pristine psnp table s4 this implies that aged psnp is well adsorbed on minerals this is supported by the observation that aged psnp had more negative charges than pristine psnp fig s3a hence these results further suggest that the dominant mechanism controlling the adsorption of psnp on the selected minerals may be electrostatic attraction however electrostatic attraction alone cannot account for all the adsorption behaviors as it is unlikely to play an active role in adsorption experiments for clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite at relatively low pzc at ph 7 in addition the enhanced adsorption of aged psnp on clay minerals was still observed although the aged psnp showed a stronger negative charge than the pristine psnp among the possible adsorption mechanisms that could exist between psnp and minerals hydrophobic interactions are unlikely to dominate because there was no adsorption of the pristine psnp appearing on the clay minerals fig 6c and d ligand exchange is a more likely explanation for the adsorption of aged psnp onto clay minerals zhang et al 2012 studies have shown that diethyl phthalate is degraded in soil by ligand exchange with reduced smectite clays chen et al 2019 in this study ligand exchange refers to the combination of anions in the aqueous phase with hydroxyl groups on mineral surfaces zhang et al 2012 the n values of the freundlich model were much lower than 1 0 which suggested that the effective sites for adsorption were limited to minerals in addition the n values were always lower for the aged psnp e g 0 479 for magnetite and 0 401 for goethite than for the pristine psnp e g 0 566 for magnetite and 0 431 for goethite this suggests that the aged psnp competed more fiercely for adsorption sites yun and jin 2020 3 4 ftir spectra of aged psnp adsorbed on minerals from fig 7 for all minerals a peak at 1667 cm 1 assigned to c o was observed and the band intensity increased with the adsorption time indicating that the aged psnp was absorbed on minerals however the adsorption of aged psnp on different minerals was different the adsorption peaks of goethite are generated by fe oh and fe o vibrations fig 7a and b the peak at 631 cm 1 belonged to the fe o stretching vibration of goethite šarić et al 1998 similar to other studies the peaks at 793 cm 1 fe oh and 887 cm 1 fe oh resulted from outward and inward bending vibrations of the 001 side of goethite respectively cambier 1986 the peak observed at 3111 cm 1 was ascribed to the fe oh stretching vibration cambier 1986 the above four peaks were unchanged during the adsorption process the peak at 1655 cm 1 h o h was the opposite and the intensity increased with the adsorption time wei and nan 2011 compared to goethite without psnp there was a peak at 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh appearing after the adsorption of uv psnp1 schwertmann and cornell 2007 fig 7a which could indicate that a strong hydrogen bonding between goethite and uv psnp1 the band at 571 cm 1 fe o was the characteristic peak of magnetite and it almost did not change during the adsorption process fig 7c and d in contrast the intensity of the characteristic peaks i e c o at 1667 cm 1 c h at 2849 cm 1 related to aged psnp increased with increasing adsorption time especially in the interaction between uv psnp2 and magnetite the changes in these two bonds were more obvious in addition the peaks at 3422 and 2924 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh stretching vibration of magnetite while those at 2924 cm 1 hinge on the morphology of the magnetite particles and those at 3422 cm 1 are involved in the water adsorbed on magnetite schwertmann and cornell 2007 the intensity of the oh stretching vibration of magnetite 2924 cm 1 increased significantly after adsorption as shown in fig 7d indicating that the functional groups of magnetite and uv psnp2 jointly controlled the adsorption process for kaolinite changes in the ftir peaks were essentially the same after adsorbing uv psnp1 or uv psnp2 and the intensity of al oh 3620 cm 1 and c o bonds increased with time however after the adsorption of uv psnp2 the ftir spectrum changed more obviously indicating that the longer the aging time of psnp the easier its interaction with kaolinite in addition peaks at 540 cm 1 belonged to si o al vibrations zhang et al 2021 peaks at 950 3653 3670 and 3695 cm 1 were caused by inward and surface al oh stretching vibrations of kaolinite leal et al 2021 a peak at 1115 cm 1 involving si o vibration of the vertical layer was also observed guo et al 2021 the above six peaks were unchanged during the adsorption process for montmorillonite peaks at 789 and 3648 cm 1 were due to al oh bending vibrations bhattacharyya and sen gupta 2008 peaks at 1657 and 3447 cm 1 could result from the bending vibration of h o h which is due to the o h group and water adsorbed in the sample leal et al 2021 additionally peaks at 624 and 1032 cm 1 corresponding to mg al oh bending vibrations and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o si were observed wang et al 2021a as shown in fig 7h the intensity of peaks a and b increased with increasing adsorption time indicating that more uv psnp2 was adsorbed on montmorillonite after 12 h 3 5 2d cos maps of aged psnp adsorbed on minerals 2d cos analysis was performed to obtain more detailed information about the structural sequence changes of aged psnp during adsorption fig 8 for goethite six major autopeaks were recognized at 3111 1655 1060 887 793 and 631 cm 1 along the diagonal line with the adsorption process of uv psnp1 on goethite the peak intensity of 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh was the highest followed by the peaks at 631 and 1655 cm 1 h o h and the lowest was at the band of 3111 cm 1 according to noda s rules noda 2018b noda and ozaki 2005 for uv irradiated psnp the adsorption of uv psnp1 on goethite table s5 was in the order of 1060 oh γ feooh 631 fe o 1655 h o h bending vibration 793 fe oh outward bending vibration 887 fe oh inward bending vibration 1667 c o 3111 cm 1 fe oh stretching vibration likewise according to the sign of 2d cos maps of uv psnp2 adsorbed on goethite the sequential order of band changes was 1655 h o h bending vibration 1667 c o 793 fe oh outward bending vibration 1060 oh γ feooh 887 fe oh inward bending vibration 3111 fe oh stretching vibration 631 cm 1 fe o the sequence indicated that hydrogen bonding of goethite played a key role in the adsorption of aged psnp on goethite zhang et al 2020 which also confirmed the ftir results for uv psnp1 on magnetite positively sign crossing peaks appeared at 1667 2849 1667 2924 2849 3422 and 2924 3422 below the diagonals of the asynchronous map and the corresponding positions on the synchronous map were all negative fig 8c and d table s6 according to these findings as adsorption progressed the corresponding change order was 1667 c o 571 fe o 3422 oh stretching vibration 2849 aromatic c h 2924 cm 1 oh stretching vibration similarly the adsorption of uv psnp2 on magnetite could be explained in the order of 1667 c o 2849 aromatic c h 2924 oh stretching vibration 571 fe o 3422 cm 1 oh stretching vibration the results suggest that ofgs of aged psnp preferentially adsorbed over the magnetite yun and jin 2020 according to the same analysis method mentioned above the order of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 interacting with kaolinite was as follows fig 8e and i table s7 3620 al oh inward bending vibration 1667 c o 950 al oh bending vibration 1115 si o 540 si o al 3653 3670 3695 cm 1 octahedral surface al oh stretching vibration 1667 c o 3620 al oh inward bending vibration 3653 3670 3695 octahedral surface al oh stretching vibration 950 al oh bending vibration 540 si o al 1115 cm 1 si o meanwhile the sequence of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 adsorbed on montmorillonite fig 8k and l table s8 followed the order of 3447 h oh 1030 c o 1667 c o 624 mg al oh 3648 al oh bending vibration 789 cm 1 al oh bending vibration 1667 c o 1030 c o 3648 al oh bending vibration 789 al oh bending vibration 624 mg al oh 3447 cm 1 h oh the results show that the longer the aging time of psnp is the earlier the ofgs on the surface reacts with the clay minerals ding et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 in general the adsorption sequence of aged psnp on minerals is in accordance with the following view electrostatic attraction is the main adsorption mechanism yun and jin 2020 4 conclusions increasing attention has been given to the potential environmental risks and impacts of nps although much research has been conducted to understand the potential impact of nps using only original materials may limit the depth of research recently much of the related research has focused on aging the results of this study show that the aging of psnp significantly changes its physical and chemical properties and affect its interaction with minerals widely present in the environment the positively charged mineral surfaces showed a strong adsorption capacity for psnp and the aged psnp was more adsorbed than the pristine psnp compared with pristine psnp there was an interaction between aged psnp and clay minerals and iron oxides showed a higher adsorption effect on the aged psnp the adsorption degree and affinity of iron oxides are higher than those of clay minerals the adsorption behavior can be explained by electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the aged psnp contains more ofgs than the pristine psnp which promotes adsorption on minerals meanwhile 2d cos maps of aged psnp binding to minerals showed that ofgs are preferentially adsorbed the advantage of this study is that the interaction mechanism between aged psnp and minerals was revealed by using adsorption experiments combined with multiple characterization methods and 2d cos analysis however this paper examines only uv aging and in the actual natural environment nps are also affected by aging factors such as high temperature hydrolysis and microorganism in addition iron oxides are typical active substances in soil driven by environmental factors such as light and oxidants they further affect the aging of nps and thus affect the interaction between them all of these topics need further research and exploration declaration

15893,with the massive use and discarding of plastic products plastic particles including nanoplastics nps which are continuously released under the action of environmental factors are posing greater risk to the ecosystem and human health nps exposed to the environment experience aging which can significantly change their physical and chemical properties and affect their environmental behavior here we examined the adsorption behavior of polystyrene nanoplastic psnp aging by ultraviolet uv exposure on different minerals goethite magnetite kaolinite and montmorillonite aging not only changes the surface morphology of psnp but also increases the surface negative charge and produces a large number of oxygen containing functional groups ofgs incubation of aged psnp with minerals indicated that iron oxides goethite and magnetite showed stronger interactions with aged psnp than pristine psnp and there was an interaction between clay minerals and aged psnp the adsorption experiments and scanning electron microscopy sem suggested that the higher adsorption capacity of a mineral surface to aged psnp may be related to electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra after adsorption showed that the adsorption affinity between the functional groups was different and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis further indicated that the mineral preferentially adsorbed the aged psnp in accordance with the order of ofgs the findings provide a theoretical basis for scientific evaluation of ecological risks of nps in the environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene nanoplastic ultraviolet aging minerals adsorption electrostatic interaction 1 introduction plastics are known as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century and have been widely used in various industries due to mass production koelmans et al 2014 the total consumption of plastics in countries around the world has reached 300 million tons per year but less than 10 can be recycled shen et al 2020 the emergence of plastic waste is quickly becoming an urgent environmental pollution problem worldwide china is a major country in the production and use of plastics accounting for approximately a quarter of the world s plastic products produced and used every year jiang et al 2020 in this process plastics inevitably enter the environment leading to the widespread existence of plastic debris in oceans cai et al 2018b wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017b rivers di and wang 2018 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a lakes mao et al 2020a su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the atmosphere liu et al 2019c soil ding et al 2020b he et al 2018 liu et al 2018 and sediments peng et al 2017 in the environment plastic debris can slowly biodegrade or break down into small particles after weathering and ultraviolet radiation duan et al 2021 mao et al 2020b sait et al 2021 particles with a size 100 nm are called nanoplastics nps li et al 2017 heavy metals and organic pollutants with high toxicity are easily enriched on the surface of nps which enter organisms through different ways and pass along the food chain thus causing joint toxic effects on organisms and even human health ma et al 2020 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b therefore scientific assessment of the environmental behavior and ecological risks of nps is crucial after being released into the aquatic system nps may undergo a process of aggregation which affects their fate and transportation and poses potential risks to the natural environment besseling et al 2017 da costa et al 2016 wang et al 2021b minerals with large surface areas and functional groups are widely present in water as active substances and are important components of sediments and soils han et al 2008 previous studies showed that minerals are of great importance to the environmental processes of pollutants for instance bacteria were absorbed on hematite according to electrostatic attraction in the soil and underground environment yan et al 2016 wang et al 2013 found that iron oxides can change the electrostatic force on the surface of biochar by combining with it and reducing its migration ability in the environment yun and jin 2020 found that the mineral surface had a higher adsorption affinity for dissolved organic matter dom leached from microplastics which may be related to both ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction similar to dom and biochar once nps enter the environment they interact with active substances in the environment this changes the interface properties surface activity and chemical properties of nps thus affecting their environmental behaviors li et al 2019 our previous studies found that the distribution characteristics of unaged polystyrene nanoplastic psnp on different minerals were mainly affected by electrostatic interactions while iron oxides had an important influence on the distribution of psnp zhang et al 2020 it has been reported that plastics including nps can undergo various aging processes and that their surface is oxidized to produce more oxygen containing functional groups ofgs such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups than fresh plastics bracco et al 2018 singh et al 2002 the aging process of nps in the environment may change their colloidal stability making them more concentrated or dispersed in water thus affecting the environmental fate of other pollutants such as heavy metals and hydrophilic organic pollutants liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019d however the effect of these natural aging processes on the interaction between nps and minerals remains unclear and this hinders our understanding of the overall fate and impact of nps in ecosystems to understand such effects we investigated polystyrene nanoplastic psnp of 50 100 nm in diameter as a representative model of nanoplastic alimi et al 2018 and four typical minerals goethite magnetite montmorillonite and kaolinite with different surface charges that widely exist in the environment psnp was aged for different days by uv irradiation to obtain two aged psnps with diverse surfaces and constitutive properties the adsorption properties between aged psnp and minerals were investigated and changes in surface morphology and functional groups were examined based on these results we attempted to uncover the interaction mechanism between aged psnp and minerals in addition we assessed the effect of ph on the interaction these findings will advance our understanding of the behavior and ecological risks of nps under environmentally relevant conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kaolinite and montmorillonite were purchased from fluka germany goethite and magnetite were purchased from sigma united states all minerals were passed through a 0 15 mm screen for subsequent use to obtain aged psnp the standard psnp solution macklin 25000 mg l dispersed uniformly at 50 100 nm was diluted with deionized water and then ultrasonicated at 100 w 20 khz kq 300de shumei for 30 min to prepare the psnp suspension 250 mg l the suspension was aged by ultraviolet radiation cai et al 2018a liu et al 2019b briefly the psnp suspension in h2o2 10 vol was added to a quartz tube and irradiated under uv light 500 w mercury lamps for 1 or 5 days at 25 c the two samples were denoted uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 respectively an aged psnp stock solution of 250 mg l was prepared and diluted to the desired concentrations of 0 5 1 5 20 and 50 mg l in ultrapure water to be used as the comparative calculation standard to determine the aged psnp concentration in subsequent experiments the concentrations of the aged psnp were measured using flow cytometry cytoflex beckman based on pre established calibration curves of psnp before and after aging which correlated the mass concentrations of psnp to number concentrations fig s1 since the aging process of psnp in the environment may change their colloidal stability colloidal stability experiments were performed briefly 20 mg l pristine psnp uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 were added to the brown glass vial and ultrasonicated at 100 w for 30 min then the vials were allowed to stand for 10 days and samples were taken at 1 3 5 7 and 10 days to measure the concentration and hydrodynamic diameter 2 2 adsorption experiments to preliminarily judge the interaction between aged psnp and minerals the absorbance of minerals in the presence of aged psnp at 800 nm od800 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis the preliminary experiment is provided in text s1 of the supplementary material the interaction between aged psnp and minerals was further studied by batch adsorption experiments for the kinetic adsorption experiment aged psnp solutions with 20 mg l concentrations were prepared and then each glass vial was filled with 20 ml of aged psnp solution and 0 015 g of minerals kaolinite montmorillonite goethite and magnetite the mixture was shaken in a thermostatic oscillator thz 98c yiheng shanghai 25 c 150 rpm and the samples were collected at various times 0 25 0 5 1 3 5 7 12 24 36 and 48 h the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min to remove the minerals from the aged psnp suspension then 5 ml of supernatant was taken cautiously to measure the concentrations of aged psnp using flow cytometry the experiment was repeated twice for each group in the adsorption isotherm experiment different amounts of adsorbents 0 01 0 01 0 015 0 015 and 0 02 g were added to brown vials containing aged psnp solutions at 1 5 10 20 and 30 mg l after shaking the solution samples were centrifuged 30 min 3000 rpm and then 5 ml of supernatant was removed for detection each group was repeated twice the details of the adsorption models are described in text s2 2 3 effect of ph on adsorption the ph values of the solution were adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 using koh and hno3 and each glass vial received 0 015 g of adsorbent and 20 ml of aged psnp solution at 20 mg l glass vials were placed in a thermostatic oscillator and shaken at 25 c at 150 rpm for 24 h then the samples were centrifuged 30 min 3000 rpm and 5 ml of supernatant was collected for analysis each group had three parallel samples as a reference 2 4 dissolved fe3 from goethite and magnetite and their impacts on aged psnp aggregation goethite and magnetite release fe ions in aqueous solutions to determine whether the dissolved fe ions affect the interaction of aged psnp and iron oxides we studied the effects of fe3 on the aggregation and sedimentation of aged psnp the concentration of fe ions was detected through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icaprq thermo fisher the aged psnp aggregation was determined by measuring the hydrodynamic diameter the detailed information is described in text s3 2 5 ftir and 2d cos analysis ftir spectrometry vetex70 bruker was employed to monitor the changes in functional groups of aged psnp and its mixtures with minerals at different times each spectrum was investigated and subtracted from the baseline in a scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 and resolution of 2 cm 1 the details are described in text s4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was applied to examine the origins of the ir peaks of the samples using 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan the 2d cos data were processed via matlab r2010a mathworks inc prior to the 2d cos analysis all ftir spectra were normalized baseline corrected and denoised by savitzky golay smoothing more details of the 2d cos analysis are supplied in text s5 2 6 characterization of minerals and aged psnp for minerals and aged psnp an appropriate amount of minerals that passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and psnp under different uv irradiation times was collected for characterization for minerals and aged psnp mixtures the residue after removal of the supernatant from the above adsorption experiments was dried and then characterized for both minerals and aged psnp scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei czech republic was used to characterize the morphologies and physical dimensions autosorb 1 quantachrome usa was used to determine the surface areas by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface chemical information of aged psnp was obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher escalab 250xi a nanolaser particle size analyzer zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk was applied to measure the point of zero charge pzc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of aged psnp aging processes i e uv exposure greatly altered the surface properties of psnp fig 1 as shown in fig 1a the pristine psnp particles were spherical and showed relatively smooth surfaces without cracks or other defects with an increase in uv irradiation time the morphological features i e surface smoothness size and shape of uv psnp1 fig 1b were significantly different from those of untreated psnp with rougher surfaces and holes after aging of 5 days the surface became much more irregular and some debris was observed fig 1c which may be caused by the embrittlement and fragmentation of the material horton et al 2017 on the whole as the aging time increased the shape of the psnp gradually shrank and cracks and pits gradually appeared on the surface xps data ftir spectra and 2d cos maps were employed to elucidate the aging process and mechanisms of psnp compared with the pristine psnp the uv treated psnp had abundant surface ofgs varying in carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy hydroxyl groups fig 1d e and f the ftir spectra data were basically consistent with the differences in the surface oxidation degree of the three materials mentioned above as shown in fig s2a due to the stretching vibration of c h in the aromatic ring and main chain the spectrum of the pristine psnp showed major peaks in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 whereas peaks at 1605 1483 1453 758 and 697 cm 1 were attributed to the skeleton vibration and deformation of c h kaczmarek et al 2008 additional bands appeared in the spectra of the aged psnp for instance a peak c o stretching was appeared at 1667 cm 1 with increasing of aging time c o and o c o stretching bands at 1030 cm 1 and 1716 cm 1 were also observed peaks at 1376 cm 1 were caused by c oh tensile ding et al 2020a the above band intensity increased with increasing uv irradiation time indicating that psnp was aged after uv irradiation the 2d cos data further confirmed this result the cross peaks in the synchronous maps fig s2b represent the frequency bands with coupled sources or related sources a positive sign indicates that the band intensity changes in the same direction and a negative sign indicates the opposite direction zhou et al 2017 the results suggested that the major ftir peaks changed concurrently during the aging process there were six major autopeaks recognized at 1030 1376 1483 1605 1667 and 1716 cm 1 along the diagonal of aged psnp moreover positive and negative signs of cross peaks were observed in the synchronous maps table s1 and fig s2b indicating that almost all of the cross peaks were asynchronized during the aging process with increasing aging time the peak intensity at 1667 cm 1 which corresponds to c o was the highest followed by the peaks at 1483 c h and 1030 cm 1 c o and the lowest was at 1483 cm 1 according to the rules of noda 2018a the sign of the cross peaks in the asynchronous map fig s2c table s1 suggested the order of the aging process of psnp as 1667 c o 1376 c oh 1483 c h 1030 c o 1716 o c o 1605 cm 1 c h the first occurrence of the functional group in the psnp aging process was c o on the aromatic ring followed by c h on the aromatic ring these results indicated that abundant ofgs were produced on the psnp surface under uv irradiation the ofgs could be generated by c h bond tertiary c atom breaking hydrogen extraction of peroxy radicals coo disproportionation of alkoxy radicals co and radical driven continuous oxidation duan et al 2022 yousif and haddad 2013 in this process the ofgs were gradually formed by c oh c o and carbonyl bands c o the charge properties of psnp at different solution ph values usually estimated through the measurements of zeta potentials provide a mechanized understanding of the adsorption behavior of psnp on mineral surfaces safiur rahman et al 2013 the zeta potential of psnp was detected in the ph range of 2 0 to 11 0 in this study fig s3a all psnp samples showed negative zeta potentials at ph values greater than 2 0 additionally the charge properties of the three psnp samples i e pristine and uv aged samples were significantly different at any given ph compared with the pristine psnp the aged psnp exhibited a stronger negative charge for instance the zeta potentials at ph 7 of the pristine and uv psnp2 samples were 24 63 mv and 35 83 mv respectively this is due to the acidic function of psnp generating carboxyl containing photolysis byproducts after uv irradiation psnp with more negative charges is more likely to be adsorbed on minerals with net positive charge on the surface through electrostatic attraction while minerals with net negative charge on the surface are less adsorbed because of electrostatic repulsion comparing the pzcs of the four minerals fig s4 it can be deduced that the psnp after uv irradiation is more easily adsorbed on goethite and magnetite than pristine psnp however the difference in adsorption affinity between montmorillonite and kaolinite may not be pronounced in addition colloid stability experiments suggested that the psnp suspension whether it was treated with uv light was stable within 10 days fig s3b and c 3 2 effect of aged psnp on minerals the od800 was detected to preliminarily study the interactions between the four minerals and aged psnp fig 2 a compared with that of pristine psnp the od800 of the four minerals with aged psnp changed considerably when the four minerals were put in the aged psnp suspension their od800 values were obviously different from that in pure water p 0 05 which indicated that there were strong interactions between minerals and the aged psnp it seems that uv psnp2 had a stronger reaction with goethite and magnetite for montmorillonite and kaolinite the suspended mineral absorbance after sedimentation for 5 h in the aged psnp suspension was significantly changed p 0 05 in comparison with that in water indicating an interaction between montmorillonite or kaolinite and the aged psnp similar to iron oxides goethite and magnetite uv psnp2 had a strong reaction with clay minerals montmorillonite and kaolinite while uv psnp1 had a weak reaction with clay minerals based on the above findings the aged psnp was separately reacted with these four minerals for 48 h and then the suspension was centrifuged as shown in fig 2b the aged psnp concentrations in all mineral suspensions changed considerably especially magnetite and goethite further illustrating that there were interactions between minerals and the aged psnp in comparison with pristine psnp and uv psnp1 uv psnp2 had obvious interactions with minerals indicating that the longer the aging time of psnp the easier it is adsorbed on minerals the effect of solution ph on psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d adsorption was examined over a ph range of 3 to 11 fig 2c and d for all minerals the adsorption of psnp was highly ph dependent and the adsorption capacity was greater at lower ph values this could be because the position dependence including ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction contributes more to the adsorption process at lower ph values hur and schlautman 2004 weng et al 2007 the effects of ph on iron oxides goethite and magnetite were more distinct than those on clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite in the given ph range for instance the adsorption rates of uv psnp1 varied from 13 51 to 98 76 on magnetite in comparison with 2 28 to 11 46 on montmorillonite this can be explained by the fact that the pzcs of the two minerals were different and the overall trend of the adsorption near the pzc values of minerals drastically changed avena and koopal 1999 to more directly understand the interactions between minerals and aged psnp sem was employed to investigate the morphological features after adsorption fig 3 the sem images showed that magnetite appeared as dodecahedral and octahedral diamond structures while goethite was in a nanorod shape kaolinite and montmorillonite both showed flake like shapes with a lateral size of approximately 1000 nm from fig 3 it is obvious that there is no psnp adsorption on the clay mineral surface but there is psnp adsorption on the iron oxide surface furthermore with increasing aging time an increasing number of psnp pellets were adsorbed on the surface of minerals the number of psnp pellets adsorbed on the goethite surface is greater than that of magnetite which may be caused by electrostatic attraction and the larger bet surface area of goethite than magnetite table s2 more aged psnp pellets were adsorbed on montmorillonite than kaolinite since both clay minerals and aged psnp are negatively charged adsorption may be controlled by mechanisms other than electrostatic action because releasing fe ions e g fe3 fe oh 2 and fe oh from magnetite and goethite destabilize the aged psnp suspension the dissolution of magnetite and goethite particles at ph 3 0 11 0 was examined fig s5 when the ph value is 3 0 11 0 the release range of fe ions from goethite is 0 013 0 264 mg l and that in magnetite is 0 052 0 235 mg l based on the assumption that aged psnp aggregates are spherical the hydrodynamic diameters of aged psnp in the presence of fe ions were measured fig 4 a the results showed that when the fe3 concentration was 0 007 mm i e 0 392 mg l aged psnp formed large aggregates fig 4b this indicated that the release of iron ions from magnetite and goethite did not significantly induce the aggregation of aged psnp under experimental conditions 3 3 adsorption behavior of aged psnp on minerals 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics from fig 5 the adsorption capacity of psnp on iron oxides was greater than that of clay minerals and the adsorption capacity of psnp on minerals increased with the aging time of psnp regardless of irradiation all psnp reached apparent equilibrium within 12 h fig 5 the adsorption kinetic parameters are presented in table s3 it seems that the adsorption of aged psnp on minerals fit the pseudo second order model well r 2 0 946 which suggested that the adsorption of aged psnp on minerals was controlled by chemical adsorption the equilibrium concentrations qe of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 fitted by the pseudo second order model are different for instance the mean values of qe of uv psnp2 on kaolinite are approximately 2 8 times those of uv psnp1 this can be explained by the different surface charges of the two psnp samples this can also be attributed to the fact that the molecular size of psnp decreases with aging while the diffusion rate of small molecules is higher and it is easier to carry out in the rapid initial adsorption process kilduff et al 1996 additionally the adsorption kinetics data of psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d on all minerals were fitted by the intraparticle diffusion model as shown in fig s6a and b the adsorption process of aged psnp on minerals consists of three stages compared with pristine psnp two stages first the rate of adsorption was faster and the adsorption of a large amount of aged psnp on the surface of the adsorbents belonged to surface adsorption then the aged psnp diffused slowly from the liquid film to the micropores the above two stages were physical adsorption guo et al 2018 finally due to the small pore size a chemical process occurred and the rate of diffusion within the particles was very slow indicating that the rate limiting step of the adsorption process was controlled by the pseudo second order model guo et al 2018 moreover the first row did not cross the origin suggesting that diffusion within particles was not because of adsorption constraints and that other mechanisms are involved in diffusion within particles wen et al 2015 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of psnp pristine uv 1d uv 5d onto minerals are shown in fig 6 and the related model parameters are listed in table s4 the r 2 values of the freundlich and langmuir models were all high r 2 0 967 indicating that these two isotherm models can suitably explain the adsorption behaviors of the three kinds of psnp although the equilibrium adsorption behaviors were well depicted it is worth noting that the parameters of the langmuir model were theoretically limited by several assumptions including homogeneous surfaces and monolayer adsorption cai et al 2018a while the freundlich model assumed that the adsorbent had heterogeneous surfaces that were suitable for monolayer and multilayer adsorption wu et al 2019 for the same mineral the adsorption affinity kf of aged psnp was much higher than that of pristine psnp the kf value of uv psnp1 was 66 6 6 30 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n on goethite compared to 49 7 9 26 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n for pristine psnp table s4 this implies that aged psnp is well adsorbed on minerals this is supported by the observation that aged psnp had more negative charges than pristine psnp fig s3a hence these results further suggest that the dominant mechanism controlling the adsorption of psnp on the selected minerals may be electrostatic attraction however electrostatic attraction alone cannot account for all the adsorption behaviors as it is unlikely to play an active role in adsorption experiments for clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite at relatively low pzc at ph 7 in addition the enhanced adsorption of aged psnp on clay minerals was still observed although the aged psnp showed a stronger negative charge than the pristine psnp among the possible adsorption mechanisms that could exist between psnp and minerals hydrophobic interactions are unlikely to dominate because there was no adsorption of the pristine psnp appearing on the clay minerals fig 6c and d ligand exchange is a more likely explanation for the adsorption of aged psnp onto clay minerals zhang et al 2012 studies have shown that diethyl phthalate is degraded in soil by ligand exchange with reduced smectite clays chen et al 2019 in this study ligand exchange refers to the combination of anions in the aqueous phase with hydroxyl groups on mineral surfaces zhang et al 2012 the n values of the freundlich model were much lower than 1 0 which suggested that the effective sites for adsorption were limited to minerals in addition the n values were always lower for the aged psnp e g 0 479 for magnetite and 0 401 for goethite than for the pristine psnp e g 0 566 for magnetite and 0 431 for goethite this suggests that the aged psnp competed more fiercely for adsorption sites yun and jin 2020 3 4 ftir spectra of aged psnp adsorbed on minerals from fig 7 for all minerals a peak at 1667 cm 1 assigned to c o was observed and the band intensity increased with the adsorption time indicating that the aged psnp was absorbed on minerals however the adsorption of aged psnp on different minerals was different the adsorption peaks of goethite are generated by fe oh and fe o vibrations fig 7a and b the peak at 631 cm 1 belonged to the fe o stretching vibration of goethite šarić et al 1998 similar to other studies the peaks at 793 cm 1 fe oh and 887 cm 1 fe oh resulted from outward and inward bending vibrations of the 001 side of goethite respectively cambier 1986 the peak observed at 3111 cm 1 was ascribed to the fe oh stretching vibration cambier 1986 the above four peaks were unchanged during the adsorption process the peak at 1655 cm 1 h o h was the opposite and the intensity increased with the adsorption time wei and nan 2011 compared to goethite without psnp there was a peak at 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh appearing after the adsorption of uv psnp1 schwertmann and cornell 2007 fig 7a which could indicate that a strong hydrogen bonding between goethite and uv psnp1 the band at 571 cm 1 fe o was the characteristic peak of magnetite and it almost did not change during the adsorption process fig 7c and d in contrast the intensity of the characteristic peaks i e c o at 1667 cm 1 c h at 2849 cm 1 related to aged psnp increased with increasing adsorption time especially in the interaction between uv psnp2 and magnetite the changes in these two bonds were more obvious in addition the peaks at 3422 and 2924 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh stretching vibration of magnetite while those at 2924 cm 1 hinge on the morphology of the magnetite particles and those at 3422 cm 1 are involved in the water adsorbed on magnetite schwertmann and cornell 2007 the intensity of the oh stretching vibration of magnetite 2924 cm 1 increased significantly after adsorption as shown in fig 7d indicating that the functional groups of magnetite and uv psnp2 jointly controlled the adsorption process for kaolinite changes in the ftir peaks were essentially the same after adsorbing uv psnp1 or uv psnp2 and the intensity of al oh 3620 cm 1 and c o bonds increased with time however after the adsorption of uv psnp2 the ftir spectrum changed more obviously indicating that the longer the aging time of psnp the easier its interaction with kaolinite in addition peaks at 540 cm 1 belonged to si o al vibrations zhang et al 2021 peaks at 950 3653 3670 and 3695 cm 1 were caused by inward and surface al oh stretching vibrations of kaolinite leal et al 2021 a peak at 1115 cm 1 involving si o vibration of the vertical layer was also observed guo et al 2021 the above six peaks were unchanged during the adsorption process for montmorillonite peaks at 789 and 3648 cm 1 were due to al oh bending vibrations bhattacharyya and sen gupta 2008 peaks at 1657 and 3447 cm 1 could result from the bending vibration of h o h which is due to the o h group and water adsorbed in the sample leal et al 2021 additionally peaks at 624 and 1032 cm 1 corresponding to mg al oh bending vibrations and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o si were observed wang et al 2021a as shown in fig 7h the intensity of peaks a and b increased with increasing adsorption time indicating that more uv psnp2 was adsorbed on montmorillonite after 12 h 3 5 2d cos maps of aged psnp adsorbed on minerals 2d cos analysis was performed to obtain more detailed information about the structural sequence changes of aged psnp during adsorption fig 8 for goethite six major autopeaks were recognized at 3111 1655 1060 887 793 and 631 cm 1 along the diagonal line with the adsorption process of uv psnp1 on goethite the peak intensity of 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh was the highest followed by the peaks at 631 and 1655 cm 1 h o h and the lowest was at the band of 3111 cm 1 according to noda s rules noda 2018b noda and ozaki 2005 for uv irradiated psnp the adsorption of uv psnp1 on goethite table s5 was in the order of 1060 oh γ feooh 631 fe o 1655 h o h bending vibration 793 fe oh outward bending vibration 887 fe oh inward bending vibration 1667 c o 3111 cm 1 fe oh stretching vibration likewise according to the sign of 2d cos maps of uv psnp2 adsorbed on goethite the sequential order of band changes was 1655 h o h bending vibration 1667 c o 793 fe oh outward bending vibration 1060 oh γ feooh 887 fe oh inward bending vibration 3111 fe oh stretching vibration 631 cm 1 fe o the sequence indicated that hydrogen bonding of goethite played a key role in the adsorption of aged psnp on goethite zhang et al 2020 which also confirmed the ftir results for uv psnp1 on magnetite positively sign crossing peaks appeared at 1667 2849 1667 2924 2849 3422 and 2924 3422 below the diagonals of the asynchronous map and the corresponding positions on the synchronous map were all negative fig 8c and d table s6 according to these findings as adsorption progressed the corresponding change order was 1667 c o 571 fe o 3422 oh stretching vibration 2849 aromatic c h 2924 cm 1 oh stretching vibration similarly the adsorption of uv psnp2 on magnetite could be explained in the order of 1667 c o 2849 aromatic c h 2924 oh stretching vibration 571 fe o 3422 cm 1 oh stretching vibration the results suggest that ofgs of aged psnp preferentially adsorbed over the magnetite yun and jin 2020 according to the same analysis method mentioned above the order of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 interacting with kaolinite was as follows fig 8e and i table s7 3620 al oh inward bending vibration 1667 c o 950 al oh bending vibration 1115 si o 540 si o al 3653 3670 3695 cm 1 octahedral surface al oh stretching vibration 1667 c o 3620 al oh inward bending vibration 3653 3670 3695 octahedral surface al oh stretching vibration 950 al oh bending vibration 540 si o al 1115 cm 1 si o meanwhile the sequence of uv psnp1 and uv psnp2 adsorbed on montmorillonite fig 8k and l table s8 followed the order of 3447 h oh 1030 c o 1667 c o 624 mg al oh 3648 al oh bending vibration 789 cm 1 al oh bending vibration 1667 c o 1030 c o 3648 al oh bending vibration 789 al oh bending vibration 624 mg al oh 3447 cm 1 h oh the results show that the longer the aging time of psnp is the earlier the ofgs on the surface reacts with the clay minerals ding et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 in general the adsorption sequence of aged psnp on minerals is in accordance with the following view electrostatic attraction is the main adsorption mechanism yun and jin 2020 4 conclusions increasing attention has been given to the potential environmental risks and impacts of nps although much research has been conducted to understand the potential impact of nps using only original materials may limit the depth of research recently much of the related research has focused on aging the results of this study show that the aging of psnp significantly changes its physical and chemical properties and affect its interaction with minerals widely present in the environment the positively charged mineral surfaces showed a strong adsorption capacity for psnp and the aged psnp was more adsorbed than the pristine psnp compared with pristine psnp there was an interaction between aged psnp and clay minerals and iron oxides showed a higher adsorption effect on the aged psnp the adsorption degree and affinity of iron oxides are higher than those of clay minerals the adsorption behavior can be explained by electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the aged psnp contains more ofgs than the pristine psnp which promotes adsorption on minerals meanwhile 2d cos maps of aged psnp binding to minerals showed that ofgs are preferentially adsorbed the advantage of this study is that the interaction mechanism between aged psnp and minerals was revealed by using adsorption experiments combined with multiple characterization methods and 2d cos analysis however this paper examines only uv aging and in the actual natural environment nps are also affected by aging factors such as high temperature hydrolysis and microorganism in addition iron oxides are typical active substances in soil driven by environmental factors such as light and oxidants they further affect the aging of nps and thus affect the interaction between them all of these topics need further research and exploration declaration

15894,shallow lakes are more susceptible to eutrophication than deep lakes the geochemical and biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the vulnerability to eutrophication for deep lakes and shallow lakes remain unknown therefore we investigated the combined phosphorus p retention mechanism with p fractions water depth distribution of p binding metal elements and macrophytes coverage in a degrading ecosystem of erhai lake we concluded that different mechanisms control the p retention in deep water areas and shallow water areas in shallow areas covered by macrophytes the biogeochemical process manipulates the p retention by changing the total organic carbon toc calcium ca distributions and turbulence in deep areas without macrophyte coverage the aluminum al and iron fe distributions control the p retention by a physicochemical process manganese mn was found to be a potential proxy in tracking the kinetic release and readsorb of redox sensitive p bd p in deep areas the historical record and core sample indicate that the hydrological engineering induced water depth variation is a vital factor changing the ecosystem of erhai lake by forming a large area of intermediate area where macrophytes could only survive at low water level the uplift of water level in the 1990s gradually changed the ecosystem of erhai lake from macrophyte dominated to algal macrophyte concomitant that reduced the accumulation of stable p fractions and their binding metals macrophytes were capable to preserve p in biomass in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem which released 150 and 72 of more labile organic p naoh25 nrp and bd p in the sediment after the deterioration than before respectively therefore water depth is a prerequisite to restoring the p preservation capacity of sediment and the macrophyte ecosystem further hydraulic engineering projects should consider the effect of water level variation induced ecosystem transition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sedimentary p fractions macrophyte water depth erhai lake metals ecosystem 1 introduction eutrophication of lakes is a worldwide problem caused by anthropogenic pollution and climate change søndergaard et al 1996 conley et al 2009 in most of the lakes p plays an important role in the eutrophication process due to the long term effect of the release potential of sedimentary p which is known as internal p loading ipl søndergaard et al 2003 nürnberg et al 2018 yang et al 2020 to reduce the p level in lakes the p retention mechanism along with p binding elements and minerals in sediment has been investigated in previous research hupfer et al 1998 dittrich et al 2013 jan et al 2013 nürnberg et al 2018 alewell et al 2021 ren et al 2022 the sedimentary p release is often contributed to the anoxia hypoxia developed in summer or after the cyanobacterial blooms ding et al 2018 wang et al 2019b since the dissolved oxygen at the sediment water interface swi is tightly correlated to the stratification of the water column of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 the water depth is an important factor affecting ipl however the lake s morphological effect on the p retention mechanism remains a lack of study qin et al 2020 especially the macrophyte distribution which is affected by water depth is often ignored in geochemical studies of p binding elements our research can fill up the gap of the p retention trait in the ternary system consisting of water depth p binding element distribution and macrophyte it can provide a more systematic view of lakes ecosystems for further study and engineering remediation p is preferentially bound to fe ca al organic compounds or adsorbed by the sedimentary minerals gonsiorczyk et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2003 different p fractions show different geochemical and biogeochemical properties in the environment to better understand the geochemical cycling of each p fraction the extraction methods were developed as the sequential extraction method sedex that can separate different fractions in different binding statuses the sedex has been widely used to study the preservation and release mechanism of p fractions and corresponding metals in sediment ruttenberg 1992 rydin 2000 hupfer et al 2009 jan et al 2013 the sedex can sequentially extract p fractions as loosely bound p nh4cl p redox sensitive p bd p naoh extractable inorganic al p naoh25 rp organic p naoh25 nrp ca p extracted by hcl hcl p and the most reluctant p fraction digested by naoh at 85 c naoh85 p the nh4cl p bd p and naoh25 nrp are considered labile p fractions while naoh25 rp hcl p and naoh85 p are stable ones rydin 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 dittrich et al 2013 a series of in situ and ex situ studies suggest that the sedimentary p release is mainly controlled by the break of fe p bound in hypoxia xie et al 2003 jin et al 2006 wilson et al 2008 the naoh extractable al p mainly naoh25 rp is also found to be a potential bioavailable internal p source zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 p binding elements are found to be important factors controlling the p cycling in both ocean and lake jan et al 2013 jokinen et al 2020 therefore the study on the extractable metals bound to p along with the extractable p provides an insight into the mechanism of p retention and release in the sediment jan et al 2013 the mechanism of external introduced al and fe controlling p retention has been widely studied kopáček et al 2005 kleeberg et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2020 agstam norlin et al 2020 several studies discussed the hydrological effects on metal distribution in sediments such as morphology huser 2012 redox condition chaillou et al 2002 and suspension agstam norlin et al 2020 however the natural driving forces controlling the metal content distribution and correlated p mobility remain a lack of study especially for the contribution of ca jan et al 2013 gao et al 2016 nürnberg et al 2018 statistically water depth is a critical factor in determining the trophic status since the shallow lakes are more likely to be more eutrophic and most of the lakes are p limited qin et al 2020 the water depth also controls the macrophyte distribution by changing the transparency secchi depth and dissolved oxygen ye et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that water depth is a key factor in controlling p retention in lakes but how the water depth variation affects the p retention by changing the ecosystem and the distribution of p binding elements remains unknown thus we used erhai lake a lake at the early stage eutrophication where the ecosystem degradation started simultaneously with the uplift of water level song et al 2020 lin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 to study how the water depth affects the p retention in the sediment by varying the ecosystem and the distribution of p binding elements 2 sampling site and methods 2 1 study site erhai lake 25 35 58 n 100 05 17 e is the largest fault lake in yunnan plateau the average depth of erhai lake is 10 m and the deepest point is 20 m at the center of the lake fig 1 the water surface area is 249 km2 and the volume is approximately 2 8 109 m3 ni and wang 2015 there is a platform 5 10 m deep at the south part of erhai lake where the lake floor slope is gradual and macrophytes covered the platform in 1960 2000 the coring site is located at the platform erhai lake used to be a mesotrophic lake but the nonpoint pollution and the water level variation result in the trophic status transition to early stage eutrophic ni and wang 2015 song et al 2020 lin et al 2021 erhai lake is highly affected by the internal p which contributes to 46 6 of the total p loading and the deterioration increases the risk for the release of sedimentary p r wang et al 2012 liu et al 2015 2 2 sequential extraction and measurements the surface sediments are freeze dried and ground into 100 mesh the freeze dried 30cm long core is sliced into a 1 cm interval and ground for further elemental measurements the samples are preserved at 20 c the metal contents and tp are measured thermo icap 6000 series icp spectrometer icp oes and spectrophotometer at 700 nm wavelength respectively the p and metal fractions in sediments were studied by using a common sequential extraction procedure rydin 2000 jan et al 2013 method part of si the extracted solutions are centrifuged and the supernatants are measured by the molybdate method while al and fe extracted simultaneously are measured by icp oes 2 3 data analysis the approximate age of each sample layer was estimated by the 0 2 cm yr accumulation rate measured at the same sampling site ni and wang 2015 the pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis were performed to evaluate the correlation coefficients of chemical properties of superficial sediment samples and the core sample fig 3 fig s1 s2 3 results 3 1 fe al and p extracted from superficial sediment the sequentially extracted p fractions along with some portions of fe and al in the superficial sediment were performed in fig 2 the recovery rate of p tpex tp is 99 1 0 3 indicating the extraction method is suitable for p extraction on the contrary the recovery rates of fe and al are 47 7 and 25 5 respectively the remaining al and fe contained in silicate minerals are considered as residuals that are stable and unable to bind with p except for loose adsorption of p the total extractable iron fete concentration sum of soluble reactive fe extracted by all steps of the studied sediments ranges from 238 56 to 612 48 μmol g and the mean fete concentration was 471 35 μmol g the fete concentrations account for 38 90 59 33 of total fe 613 21 1830 18 μmol g there are significant positive correlations between fete and total iron tfe concentration r 0 68 p 0 01 n 16 the majority of extractable sediment fe is extracted in the bd and hcl extraction steps bd fe and hcl fe which account for 24 23 51 63 and 45 89 70 56 of fete respectively the naoh85 step naoh85 fe contributes 2 59 9 36 of fete the nh4cl and naoh25 extraction naoh25 fe steps contribute less than 1 of fete on average the total extractable aluminum alte concentration of the sediments ranges from 240 15 to 630 61 μmol g and the mean alte concentration was 467 99 μmol g the alte concentration contributes 15 66 34 87 of total aluminum tal from 688 70 to 4027 13 μmol g the largest percentage of extractable sediment al is in the naoh85 extraction step naoh85 al which contributes 48 23 63 21 of alte the extractable sediment al in the hcl extraction step hcl al contributes 29 05 41 96 of alte the extractable sediment al in the naoh25 extraction step naoh25 al contributes 6 32 12 53 of alte the nh4cl and bd extraction steps contribute less than 1 of alte in total the total extractable phosphorus pte concentration in this study ranges from 14 89 to 27 19 μmol g and the average concentration is 23 12 μmol g a significantly positive correlation between pte and tp is also observed r 0 97 p 0 01 n 16 the extracted p concentration by hcl extraction step hcl p has the highest of all extraction steps which accounts for 23 35 43 88 of tp concentration with a mean value of 33 74 the extracted p concentration by nh4cl extraction step nh4cl p ranges 0 39 3 27 of pte concentration which contributes the lowest of all steps to the pte the relatively important bd and naoh25 steps bd p and naoh25 rp contribute 24 09 and 23 17 of pte on average respectively the naoh85 step naoh85 p extracts 18 04 of pte on average both naoh25 rp and naoh85 p are significantly correlated with pte and related coefficients are 0 95 and 0 83 p 0 01 n 16 respectively the ca concentration ranges in 581 63 5801 25 μmol g with an average of 1443 63 μmol g an extremely high ca point is found at the shallowest sampling site the mean ca concentration excluding this point is 1153 12 μmol g a similar trend for toc ranging from 22 88 to 110 58 mg g in the superficial sediment is found with an average of 38 89 mg g and a maximum of 110 58 mg g is found at the study site with the shallowest water depth the total nitrogen tn and mn range from 2 71 to 5 09 mg g and from 14 55 to 53 07 μmol g respectively 3 2 the temporal variation of p fractions and correlated metals in the core sample the extracted fe and al increased from 261 73 to 362 65 μmol g to 378 73 and 600 28 μmol g respectively from swi to 6 cm depth fig 4 on the contrary depletion of pte is found at 2 cm depth at 17 66 μmol g compared to 21 80 μmol g at swi and 8 cm depth since p retention in lake sediment is highly affected by organic matter gächter and müller 2003 the toc c n and c p ratios provide pivotal information on the source of the organic matter fig 5 the depletion of extractable al fe and p in the top 8 cm sediment is tightly correlated with the increase of tn toc and the c n and c p ratios the majority of alte is extracted by naoh85 and hcl taking up more than 90 at each depth the rest of alte is extracted by naoh at room temperature about 10 as for the fe 95 fete is extracted by hcl step and bd extraction while naoh extracts slightly more fe in shallow sediment than downcore the alte and fete remain relatively constant lower than 8 cm except for the enrichment at 20 cm on the contrary pte decreases from 22 17 μmol g at 20 cm depth to 17 28 μmol g deeper than 32 cm it is worth noting that the superficial sediment has more organic naoh25 nrp and redox sensitive bd p than the deep section fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the p retention mechanism at different water depth 4 1 1 hcl p and ca in different water depth calcium controls the retention of p in the sediment by coprecipitating with p to form calcite and fluorapatite jin et al 2006 li et al 2017a ni et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the ca p is the main fraction of hcl p which is more stable than bd p and naoh25 rp in natural alkaline lakes søndergaard et al 2003 dittirch et al 2013 ni and wang 2015 the hcl p buried in sediment is often considered a permanent burial since erhai lake is weak alkaline ph 7 07 7 58 zhao et al 2018 the high ca concentration can convert the unstable bd p and naoh25 rp into hcl p and immobilize the p in the sediment li et al 2017a yin et al 2021 thus ca plays an important role in the p retention the ca content halves at deep sites 8 m than shallower indicating higher precipitation of ca in the shallow areas this depth is consistent with the depth of active zoobenthos mastrantuono 1991 since a tightly positive correlation between ca content and toc in the sediment is observed p 0 01 r 0 945 the biogenic carbonate mainly contributes to the increase of ca content the existence of shell debris at shallow sites also supports the idea that the zoobenthos enriches the ca in the sediment the decoupling of ca content and hcl p is unexpected indicating excessive ca in binding with p in the sediment fig 3 the competition between organic matter and p indicates that ca preferentially binds with organic matter rather than p guppy et al 2005 furthermore the hcl p is coupling with hcl fe and hcl al p 0 01 r 0 65 and p 0 01 r 0 64 respectively fig 3 the small proportions of hcl fe such as fes and pyrite and hcl al such as bayerite and gibbsite jan et al 2013 are contributed to the hcl p retention when the ca is binding with organic matter or insufficient therefore the biogenic ca potentially contributes to the p retention the enrichment of organic matter makes the p in shallow area unable to bind with ca and accumulate 4 1 2 bd p mn and fe in different water depth water depth especially the stratification often controls the redox condition at the water sediment interface boehrer and schultze 2008 the bd p is sensitive to the variation of redox conditions at swi and often plays an important role in the ipl in several cases gächter and müller 2003 jin et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 jilbert et al 2011 the bd p is correlated to the ferric oxy hydroxide which has a strong binding capacity for inorganic phosphate in aerobic conditions wilson et al 2008 gu et al 2019 erhai lake is a deep lake according to the water depth but the swi is aerobic zhang et al 2014 ni and wang 2015 zhao et al 2021 the release of bd p in the deep area is not seen in this study and on the contrary there is slightly more bd p preserved in deep water sediment fig 2 previous studies advocated that more bd p accumulation happened in eutrophic areas where cyanobacterial blooms occurred which is consistent with the high bd p in the coastal area where cyanobacterial blooms frequently happened wang et al 2019b 2021 if we consider bd p proportion the bd p proportion remains constant at different water depths 15 25 except at the shallowest point on the north coast 32 thus more mobile bd p enriches in the sediment where cyanobacterial blooms usually happen from the release of cyanobacterial detritus and potential transformation from other p fractions li and shi 2020 the uncorrelated bd p and bd fe p 0 05 r 0 13 in the sediment indicate the bd p in erhai lake is not controlled by fe distribution as other lakes are gao et al 2016 chen et al 2019 it might be caused by the existence of abundant redox sensitive crystalline fe which is unable to adsorb p such as goethite and hematite jan et al 2013 another possibility is that the excessive al in sediment could prevent p release during anoxia by adsorbing the p liberated from bd p rydin et al 2000 kopáček et al 2005 unlike the fe controlled p release in other eutrophic lakes the bd p is significantly correlated to mn content in the sediment p 0 01 r 0 71 which can be a proxy to assess sedimentary bd p it might be explained by the fact that the bd p accumulation in erhai lake is mainly controlled by the kinetic process related to water level fluctuation yuan et al 2021 the highly correlated mn and bd p are expected due to the slower oxidation and reduction of mn compared to fe davison 1993 thus the swi of erhai lake is not always aerobic but mostly aerobic with occasional hypoxia that can release fe while retaining mn in the hypoxia the bd p might release as well which is also controlled by a kinetic process and readsorbed by excessive al if so the bd fe is not a proper proxy to assess the active fe that can bind with p as jan et al 2013 suggested in erhai lake the fe p ratio proposed by jensen et al 1992 is also misleading since the fe p ratio is uncorrelated to bd p either therefore we hypothesize that mn is a bd p proxy when the bd p release is controlled by the kinetic process when hypoxia is occasional even so further study on the binding mechanism of mn and bd p is required to explain why the mn is not correlated to bd p in some other cases chen et al 2019 4 1 3 naoh25 rp and al in different water depth al as a remediation method has been widely used as an effective capping adsorbent to immobilize p in the sediment kopáček et al 2005 egemose et al 2010 huser et al 2016 lin et al 2017 wang et al 2019a agstam norlin et al 2020 the amorphous aluminum hydroxides al oh 3 consist of the majority of naoh25 al in the sediment and bind with the naoh25 rp lake et al 2007 jan et al 2013 even though the naoh25 rp is redox insensitive kleeberg et al 2010 wang et al 2019a it is bioavailable and sometimes can be considered as an internal p source zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 ren et al 2022 as the main element extracted by naoh al shows a significantly positive correlation with water depth p 0 01 r 0 73 unlike the decoupling of hcl p and ca bd p and bd fe the naoh25 rp is positively correlated to naoh25 al p 0 01 r 0 84 indicating the extracted naoh25 al is mainly bound to p in other words the extracted naoh25 rp is saturated in the sediment considering the bd p readsorption by naoh25 al during the extraction process the saturation is expected moreover a significantly positive correlation between naoh25 p and water depth has been found p 0 01 r 0 83 and naoh25 al is also controlled by water depth p 0 05 r 0 86 thus p accumulation in the sediment is controlled by al distribution which is highly affected by water depth the shallow area is more sunlit thus the algal activity can assimilate sedimentary naoh25 rp resulting in less naoh25 rp accumulation in shallow areas jiang et al 2008 wang et al 2017 in addition the shallow areas are unfavorable for the formation of amorphous al due to the intensive turbulence and steep topography huser 2012 agstam norlin et al 2020 as a result there is less naoh25 rp retention in shallow areas than in deep areas thus the enrichment of al in deep areas might be the vital molecular mechanism explaining why the deep lakes are more resilient to eutrophication 4 1 4 sedimentary nh4cl in different water depth nh4cl solution extracts the loosely bound or exchangeable fractions of p lake et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 even though the nh4cl p content is the minority in most of the lakes sediment it is still a source of internal p søndergaard et al 1996 wang et al 2006 lake et al 2007 li et al 2015 tu et al 2019 in this study nh4cl p was less than 1 of pte on average fig 4 unlike the positive correlation between water depth and other p fractions the nh4cl p is significantly negatively correlated to water depth p 0 01 r 0 75 the nh4cl p is mainly adsorbed on some crystals such as caco3 through molecular attraction as the forms of dissolved p in pore water or leached p from decaying cells of bacterial biomass in deposited phytodetrital aggregates kaiserli et al 2002 pettersson 2001 it can explain the significant positive correlations between nh4cl p and toc p 0 01 r 0 95 and total ca p 0 01 r 0 916 in the sediments fig 3 as discussed in 4 1 2 more toc and ca distribute at shallow depth suitable for macrophytes growth and zoobenthos settlement thus more nh4cl p is supposed to be found in the shallow areas 4 1 5 the p retention controlled by al fe at different water depth in erhai lake the heterogeneity of al and fe in different water depths is essential for the accumulation of mobile p pmobile the sum of nh4cl p bd p and naoh25 nrp it is reported that the fe p ratio in surface sediment may be possible to control ipl as a result of its gravimetric ratio above 15 is equal to 8 3 of the molar ratio which is determined by the study of p release from the aerobic sediments in fifteen danish lakes jensen et al 1992 another study suggested that a dramatic increase in the p retention with the growth of fe p ratio up to 10 and the increase slows down with fe p 10 martynova 2008 in this study the molar ratios of the total content of fe p for all superficial sediments are above 26 and the molar ratios of bd fe pmobile are above 7 9 indicating the fe is sufficient in controlling the p release from sediment of erhai lake moreover the molar naoh25 al bd fe ratio 3 and the molar naoh25 al bd p nh4cl p ratio 25 a model as proposed by kopáček et al 2005 have been used to evaluate the ipl from anoxic sediments lake et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 another study suggested that the operationally defined pmobile was responsible for the internal p loading and a 4 1 molar ratio between al and pmobile is sufficient to ensure that significant reduction of p concentration in the overlying water of lakes reitzel et al 2005 in the superficial sediment samples the molar ratio of naoh25 al bd fe 1 and naoh25 al bd p nh4cl p 25 indicate a high risk of ipl for erhai lake however a higher than 4 1 molar ratio between naoh25 al and pmobile is found for most sediments of erhai lake indicating that al in sediments also played the important role in controlling ipl for most regions of erhai lake it is worth noting that pmobile shows a decreasing trend with increasing molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios fig s7 if we categorize the data into two sets as water depth 8 m without macrophyte growth and water depth 8 m where macrophytes exist or existed significantly negative relationships were found between pmobile and the molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios in the deep water sediments while the pmobile and the molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios in shallow water are not tightly correlated indicating that elevated naoh25 al in deep water promotes the p retention fig s6 since the naoh25 al is positively correlated to total al p 0 01 r 0 63 the enrichment of al in deep areas is vital in promoting the p retention in stable fractions the enrichment of fe al and tp in deep areas and enrichment of toc and ca in shallow areas indicate the relative importance of plant mediated organic matter accumulation on metal and p mobilization of sediments kleeberg 2013 lalonde et al 2012 the toc is positively correlated to the proportion of pmobile indicating that plant assimilation of labile p in sediments and the water column in shallow areas may accelerate the mobilization and release of sedimentary p p 0 01 r 0 60 in addition simple sorption of organic matter on reactive fe and al oxide surfaces possibly affects the sediment p mobilization in this study significantly negative correlations are found between the molar ratios of toc bd fe and bd fe pmoblie between the molar ratios of toc naoh25 al and naoh25 al pmobile while the data can be divided into sub groups through toc contents fig s6 these results indicate that enhanced surface adsorption of om on fe and al hydr oxides could promote mobilization of p and thus reduce the p retention in sediments however this relationship is triggered possibly based on the composition of organic matter and toc contents relative to water depth for example the higher molar ratio of bd fe pmobile is found in the high toc sediment 3 8 in shallow areas contrasting to the ratio in low toc sediment 3 0 in deep areas although they have a similar molar ratio of oc bd fe and that the linear regression slope of bd fe pmobile plotted with toc bd fe in deep water sediment is 5 6 folds higher than that in shallow water sediments the linear regression slope of naoh25 al pmobile plotted with toc naoh25 al in deep areas is 22 folds higher than that in shallow areas fig s6 the decreasing effects of organic matter on the mobility of p in shallow water sediments in contrast to deep water sediments indicate that the organic matter impedes the p retention controlled by fe and al binding therefore aside from the depletion of fe and al in the shallow areas the organic matter generated from macrophyte covered shallow areas further restrains the p retention by inactivating the adsorption of fe and al hydr oxides therefore the pmobile accumulation in the shallow area is mainly controlled by biogeochemical mechanism such as the accumulation of biogenic ca organic matter accumulated from macrophyte detritus while the physicochemical mechanism such as adsorption of al and fe controls the p retention in the deep area this mechanism makes the sedimentary p more labile in shallow area while more immobile in deep area leading to a higher eutrophication risk for shallow lakes 4 2 the p retention mechanisms in the ecosystem transition 4 2 1 the self purification of erhai in the clear water ecosystem the tpex is 20 higher in the top 20 cm corresponding to the date later than 1900 compared to downcore therefore the increased tpex is not caused by fertilization a concomitant increase of feex and c n occurs coincidently with the enrichment of p fig 4 5 a corresponding increasing sedimentary rate in the early 20th century is also observed li et al 2017b a one time abundant terrestrial nutrient input event can explain the anomaly that may be caused by an intensive earthquake 7 5 richter scale in 1925 dearing et al 2008 or the wars and pandemics that reduced more than 400 000 population of dali in the early 20th century local archive since the c n ratio is positively correlated to allochthonous organic matter meyers and teranes 2001 the high c n compounds along with terrestrial fe and al input are expected at 20 cm depth due to the increasing external input which is also seen in the core sample the enhanced input can also be proved by the 10 increase of toc simultaneously fig 5 b different p fractions show different accumulation and diagenetic processes after the event without further nutrient input it takes a longer time for tp in the water column to reduce to the original level in eutrophic lakes due to the internal loading spears et al 2006 søndergaard et al 2013 the molar ratios of naoh25 al bd fe and naoh25 al pmobile of core sediment indicate that erhai lake is unfavorable immobilizing p fig 7 s3 s4 as a mesotrophic lake erhai lake is vulnerable to external p input and takes a longer time to recover dittrich et al 2013 the reduction of c n ratio and fe in 14 20 cm represents the self purification process of external input even though the pte does not reduce to the original level the naoh25 nrp reduces in the next 40 years fig 6 which is consistent with the recovery of c n ratio and fe content the conversion of naoh25 nrp to naoh25 rp is observed due to the complementary proportion of these two p fractions in the core sediment fig s8 the al content enrichment at 20 cm depth reduces to original level in the next 2 cm upcore indicating a 10 year residence time for al in erhai lake on the contrary no corresponding increase of naoh25 rp indicates that the al input is mainly in mineral forms particle rather than amorphous dissolved al which is consistent with the gradual naoh85 al enrichment at 20 cm depth fig 7 on the contrary the fe enrichment at 20 cm consists of more mobile bd fe and immobilizes sedimentary p as bd p in a short time it is worth noting that the mobile p is sensitive to external disturbance while the relatively stable p gradually increases after the external input since the labile p fractions recover while the stable ones remain enriched it suggests that the long term ipl gradually transforms labile p forms into more stable fractions to preserve in the sediment to sum up all the elements except p reduce to the original level within 10 years after a one time external input event without further input and remediation in erhai lake the long lasting p enrichment might be caused by the ipl the molar ratios of naoh25 al bd fe and naoh25 al pmobile are lower than the suggested molar limit in kopáček et al 2005 of whole core sediment indicating naturally unfavorable for the immobilization of p in erhai lake fig 2 therefore the erhai lake is naturally at high risk from ipl which is consistent with the vulnerability of mesotrophic lakes carey and rydin 2011 4 2 2 the p retention in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem the platform is a pivotal area for erhai lake s ecosystem the macrophyte coverage is highly dependent on whether the platform is covered by macrophytes li et al 2013 ye et al 2018 erhai lake was not macrophyte dominated under natural circumstances before 1960 due to the high water level and oligotrophic condition with the anthropogenic nutrient input and the lowering of the water level fig 4 the water depth of the platform reduced by 3 m and the nutrient became suitable for macrophyte growth ye et al 2018 macrophytes covered 20 40 of erhai lake from 1960 to 2000 since macrophyte is a reservoir of p that absorbs p from sediment and water column wang et al 2018 the simultaneous reduction of p at 10 cm depth of the core sample is contributed to the spreading of macrophytes in erhai lake even with more exogenous p introduced the al was reduced simultaneously as well resulting in the decrease of naoh25 rp fig 4 as discussed in 4 1 3 the turbulence may restrain the accumulation of al and the lowering of the water level intensified the turbulence at the platform impeding the accumulation of al the expansion of macrophytes can partially reduce the sedimentary naoh25 rp wang et al 2018 since the naoh25 rp is saturated in erhai lake the decrease of al especially naoh25 al results in the reduction of p immobility and intensifies the ipl in macrophyte dominated erhai lake furthermore the simultaneous depletion of hcl fe hcl al and naoh85 al at 8 cm depth also impedes the accumulation of immobile p fig s3 s4 as a consequence the al release in the degrading ecosystem reduces the immobility of sedimentary p more importantly the macrophyte is not a permanent reservoir of p it is reported that the decomposition of macrophytes can mobilize p and reduce the accumulation kleeberg 2013 abundant organic p released from macrophyte detritus and bd p can accumulate in the superficial sediment fig 6 thus the macrophytes can assimilate relatively stable p fractions and release more labile and bioavailable p fractions when they are extinct zhu et al 2018 the macrophyte biomass remained dynamic constant when the platform was covered by macrophyte however the equilibrium broke down when the ecosystem transition happened 4 2 3 the p and active al fe retention in the transition ecosystem the ecosystem transition affects the p retention significantly for instance the sediment transforms from p sink to p source in the macrophyte dominated to algal dominated ecosystem transition zhang et al 2013 aguinaga et al 2019 klamt et al 2019 ren et al 2022 several cyanobacterial blooms occurred in the early 21st century wang et al 2013 in the meanwhile the increasing water level turbidity and trophic status reduced the macrophyte coverage to only 5 10 resulting in the transition of the ecosystem to an algae macrophyte concomitant ecosystem zhu et al 2015 fu et al 2018 song et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the sudden accumulation of macrophyte debris increased the labile p content in the superficial sediment in turn intensified the ipl fig 6 after the water level uplift of erhai lake the al in the sediment decreased slower than in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem the naoh25 al increased by 25 fig 7 indicating the al started to accumulate that will recover to the original level in the next decades because of the cyanobacterial blooms that impede the sedimentation of al by increasing ph cooke et al 1993 paerl et al 2011 it will take a longer time for al to recover than it did in the early 20th century 20 cm depth it will increase the storage capacity of naoh25 rp for the sediment of erhai lake and reduce the mobility of sedimentary p however without external al introduced the al level in the natural condition is insufficient to immobilize the p released by macrophyte debris since the naoh25 al is at low level and naoh25 rp is saturated in erhai lake there is a bd fe depletion at 5 cm depth fig 7 it might be explained by less bd fe introduced by anthropogenic activities than the natural nutrient input another possibility is that the anthropogenic bd fe releases due to the occasional anoxia caused by algal expansion the depletion of fete in the topmost sediment does not impede the high proportions of bd fe and bd p on the contrary more bd p accumulates in the sediment of eutrophic lakes after the degradation of ecosystems in some cases liu et al 2019 ren et al 2022 therefore the sorption capacity of bd fe exceeds the concentration of bd p it is worth noting that the bd fe decreases at the topmost core along with the degradation of the ecosystem the decoupling of bd p and bd fe at the surface of sediment indicates that macrophyte degradation could release p that is adsorbed by excessive bd fe in the superficial sediment kleeberg 2002 the reduction of bd fe and the enrichment of bd p increase the release risk of p under reductive condition more bioavailable naoh25 nrp is seen in the topmost sediment fig 4 indicating the accumulation of organic matters associated with the extinction of macrophytes the change of macrophyte taxa from long lasting potamogeton maackianus to short lived ceratophyllum demersum caused by the water level uplift shortens the p retention time in macrophytes he et al 2015 the enrichment of labile bd p and naoh25 nrp intensifies the risks of erhai lake from eutrophication and causes more severe cyanobacteria blooms after 2000 wang et al 2019b song et al 2020 5 conclusion we used sequential extraction method to thoroughly study the p retention and its binding metals in the sediment significant correlations between water depth and the distribution of fe and al were found that can explain why the shallow lakes are more easily to become eutrophic than deep ones the mobile p in sediment in shallow areas is mainly controlled by a biogeochemical mechanism affected by the zoobenthos activity and macrophyte coverage there is more biogenic ca that is positively correlated to the organic matters at the depth suitable for zoobenthos survival which also controls the p retention in shallow area on the contrary the physicochemical mechanism controls the p retention in the deep area by changing the p binding metal distributions such as al and fe in deep areas the sediment can preserve more p due to more al and fe in sediment we also found that mn is an important proxy in evaluating the bd p preservation in the kinetic process controlling the release of bd p the historical record of erhai lake indicates that the water depth is more important than simply changing the p distribution it controls the macrophyte coverage and ecosystem the self purification ability of erhai lake is capable to preserve the natural external nutrient input in 10 years at high water level the lowering of water level helps the expansion of macrophytes as an important p reservoir preserving further anthropogenic p input in the 1960s however the transition from clear water ecosystem to macrophyte dominated ecosystem also impedes the accumulation of immobile p fractions thus with the water level uplift the macrophyte extinction resulted in the release of p that deteriorated water quality of erhai lake and the released p was preserved in mobile p fractions in the sediment that increased the risk from ipl therefore water depth variation limits the p retention and mobility by changing the distribution of p binding metal elements and the coverage of macrophyte declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15894,shallow lakes are more susceptible to eutrophication than deep lakes the geochemical and biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the vulnerability to eutrophication for deep lakes and shallow lakes remain unknown therefore we investigated the combined phosphorus p retention mechanism with p fractions water depth distribution of p binding metal elements and macrophytes coverage in a degrading ecosystem of erhai lake we concluded that different mechanisms control the p retention in deep water areas and shallow water areas in shallow areas covered by macrophytes the biogeochemical process manipulates the p retention by changing the total organic carbon toc calcium ca distributions and turbulence in deep areas without macrophyte coverage the aluminum al and iron fe distributions control the p retention by a physicochemical process manganese mn was found to be a potential proxy in tracking the kinetic release and readsorb of redox sensitive p bd p in deep areas the historical record and core sample indicate that the hydrological engineering induced water depth variation is a vital factor changing the ecosystem of erhai lake by forming a large area of intermediate area where macrophytes could only survive at low water level the uplift of water level in the 1990s gradually changed the ecosystem of erhai lake from macrophyte dominated to algal macrophyte concomitant that reduced the accumulation of stable p fractions and their binding metals macrophytes were capable to preserve p in biomass in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem which released 150 and 72 of more labile organic p naoh25 nrp and bd p in the sediment after the deterioration than before respectively therefore water depth is a prerequisite to restoring the p preservation capacity of sediment and the macrophyte ecosystem further hydraulic engineering projects should consider the effect of water level variation induced ecosystem transition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sedimentary p fractions macrophyte water depth erhai lake metals ecosystem 1 introduction eutrophication of lakes is a worldwide problem caused by anthropogenic pollution and climate change søndergaard et al 1996 conley et al 2009 in most of the lakes p plays an important role in the eutrophication process due to the long term effect of the release potential of sedimentary p which is known as internal p loading ipl søndergaard et al 2003 nürnberg et al 2018 yang et al 2020 to reduce the p level in lakes the p retention mechanism along with p binding elements and minerals in sediment has been investigated in previous research hupfer et al 1998 dittrich et al 2013 jan et al 2013 nürnberg et al 2018 alewell et al 2021 ren et al 2022 the sedimentary p release is often contributed to the anoxia hypoxia developed in summer or after the cyanobacterial blooms ding et al 2018 wang et al 2019b since the dissolved oxygen at the sediment water interface swi is tightly correlated to the stratification of the water column of lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 the water depth is an important factor affecting ipl however the lake s morphological effect on the p retention mechanism remains a lack of study qin et al 2020 especially the macrophyte distribution which is affected by water depth is often ignored in geochemical studies of p binding elements our research can fill up the gap of the p retention trait in the ternary system consisting of water depth p binding element distribution and macrophyte it can provide a more systematic view of lakes ecosystems for further study and engineering remediation p is preferentially bound to fe ca al organic compounds or adsorbed by the sedimentary minerals gonsiorczyk et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2003 different p fractions show different geochemical and biogeochemical properties in the environment to better understand the geochemical cycling of each p fraction the extraction methods were developed as the sequential extraction method sedex that can separate different fractions in different binding statuses the sedex has been widely used to study the preservation and release mechanism of p fractions and corresponding metals in sediment ruttenberg 1992 rydin 2000 hupfer et al 2009 jan et al 2013 the sedex can sequentially extract p fractions as loosely bound p nh4cl p redox sensitive p bd p naoh extractable inorganic al p naoh25 rp organic p naoh25 nrp ca p extracted by hcl hcl p and the most reluctant p fraction digested by naoh at 85 c naoh85 p the nh4cl p bd p and naoh25 nrp are considered labile p fractions while naoh25 rp hcl p and naoh85 p are stable ones rydin 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 dittrich et al 2013 a series of in situ and ex situ studies suggest that the sedimentary p release is mainly controlled by the break of fe p bound in hypoxia xie et al 2003 jin et al 2006 wilson et al 2008 the naoh extractable al p mainly naoh25 rp is also found to be a potential bioavailable internal p source zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 p binding elements are found to be important factors controlling the p cycling in both ocean and lake jan et al 2013 jokinen et al 2020 therefore the study on the extractable metals bound to p along with the extractable p provides an insight into the mechanism of p retention and release in the sediment jan et al 2013 the mechanism of external introduced al and fe controlling p retention has been widely studied kopáček et al 2005 kleeberg et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2020 agstam norlin et al 2020 several studies discussed the hydrological effects on metal distribution in sediments such as morphology huser 2012 redox condition chaillou et al 2002 and suspension agstam norlin et al 2020 however the natural driving forces controlling the metal content distribution and correlated p mobility remain a lack of study especially for the contribution of ca jan et al 2013 gao et al 2016 nürnberg et al 2018 statistically water depth is a critical factor in determining the trophic status since the shallow lakes are more likely to be more eutrophic and most of the lakes are p limited qin et al 2020 the water depth also controls the macrophyte distribution by changing the transparency secchi depth and dissolved oxygen ye et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that water depth is a key factor in controlling p retention in lakes but how the water depth variation affects the p retention by changing the ecosystem and the distribution of p binding elements remains unknown thus we used erhai lake a lake at the early stage eutrophication where the ecosystem degradation started simultaneously with the uplift of water level song et al 2020 lin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 to study how the water depth affects the p retention in the sediment by varying the ecosystem and the distribution of p binding elements 2 sampling site and methods 2 1 study site erhai lake 25 35 58 n 100 05 17 e is the largest fault lake in yunnan plateau the average depth of erhai lake is 10 m and the deepest point is 20 m at the center of the lake fig 1 the water surface area is 249 km2 and the volume is approximately 2 8 109 m3 ni and wang 2015 there is a platform 5 10 m deep at the south part of erhai lake where the lake floor slope is gradual and macrophytes covered the platform in 1960 2000 the coring site is located at the platform erhai lake used to be a mesotrophic lake but the nonpoint pollution and the water level variation result in the trophic status transition to early stage eutrophic ni and wang 2015 song et al 2020 lin et al 2021 erhai lake is highly affected by the internal p which contributes to 46 6 of the total p loading and the deterioration increases the risk for the release of sedimentary p r wang et al 2012 liu et al 2015 2 2 sequential extraction and measurements the surface sediments are freeze dried and ground into 100 mesh the freeze dried 30cm long core is sliced into a 1 cm interval and ground for further elemental measurements the samples are preserved at 20 c the metal contents and tp are measured thermo icap 6000 series icp spectrometer icp oes and spectrophotometer at 700 nm wavelength respectively the p and metal fractions in sediments were studied by using a common sequential extraction procedure rydin 2000 jan et al 2013 method part of si the extracted solutions are centrifuged and the supernatants are measured by the molybdate method while al and fe extracted simultaneously are measured by icp oes 2 3 data analysis the approximate age of each sample layer was estimated by the 0 2 cm yr accumulation rate measured at the same sampling site ni and wang 2015 the pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis were performed to evaluate the correlation coefficients of chemical properties of superficial sediment samples and the core sample fig 3 fig s1 s2 3 results 3 1 fe al and p extracted from superficial sediment the sequentially extracted p fractions along with some portions of fe and al in the superficial sediment were performed in fig 2 the recovery rate of p tpex tp is 99 1 0 3 indicating the extraction method is suitable for p extraction on the contrary the recovery rates of fe and al are 47 7 and 25 5 respectively the remaining al and fe contained in silicate minerals are considered as residuals that are stable and unable to bind with p except for loose adsorption of p the total extractable iron fete concentration sum of soluble reactive fe extracted by all steps of the studied sediments ranges from 238 56 to 612 48 μmol g and the mean fete concentration was 471 35 μmol g the fete concentrations account for 38 90 59 33 of total fe 613 21 1830 18 μmol g there are significant positive correlations between fete and total iron tfe concentration r 0 68 p 0 01 n 16 the majority of extractable sediment fe is extracted in the bd and hcl extraction steps bd fe and hcl fe which account for 24 23 51 63 and 45 89 70 56 of fete respectively the naoh85 step naoh85 fe contributes 2 59 9 36 of fete the nh4cl and naoh25 extraction naoh25 fe steps contribute less than 1 of fete on average the total extractable aluminum alte concentration of the sediments ranges from 240 15 to 630 61 μmol g and the mean alte concentration was 467 99 μmol g the alte concentration contributes 15 66 34 87 of total aluminum tal from 688 70 to 4027 13 μmol g the largest percentage of extractable sediment al is in the naoh85 extraction step naoh85 al which contributes 48 23 63 21 of alte the extractable sediment al in the hcl extraction step hcl al contributes 29 05 41 96 of alte the extractable sediment al in the naoh25 extraction step naoh25 al contributes 6 32 12 53 of alte the nh4cl and bd extraction steps contribute less than 1 of alte in total the total extractable phosphorus pte concentration in this study ranges from 14 89 to 27 19 μmol g and the average concentration is 23 12 μmol g a significantly positive correlation between pte and tp is also observed r 0 97 p 0 01 n 16 the extracted p concentration by hcl extraction step hcl p has the highest of all extraction steps which accounts for 23 35 43 88 of tp concentration with a mean value of 33 74 the extracted p concentration by nh4cl extraction step nh4cl p ranges 0 39 3 27 of pte concentration which contributes the lowest of all steps to the pte the relatively important bd and naoh25 steps bd p and naoh25 rp contribute 24 09 and 23 17 of pte on average respectively the naoh85 step naoh85 p extracts 18 04 of pte on average both naoh25 rp and naoh85 p are significantly correlated with pte and related coefficients are 0 95 and 0 83 p 0 01 n 16 respectively the ca concentration ranges in 581 63 5801 25 μmol g with an average of 1443 63 μmol g an extremely high ca point is found at the shallowest sampling site the mean ca concentration excluding this point is 1153 12 μmol g a similar trend for toc ranging from 22 88 to 110 58 mg g in the superficial sediment is found with an average of 38 89 mg g and a maximum of 110 58 mg g is found at the study site with the shallowest water depth the total nitrogen tn and mn range from 2 71 to 5 09 mg g and from 14 55 to 53 07 μmol g respectively 3 2 the temporal variation of p fractions and correlated metals in the core sample the extracted fe and al increased from 261 73 to 362 65 μmol g to 378 73 and 600 28 μmol g respectively from swi to 6 cm depth fig 4 on the contrary depletion of pte is found at 2 cm depth at 17 66 μmol g compared to 21 80 μmol g at swi and 8 cm depth since p retention in lake sediment is highly affected by organic matter gächter and müller 2003 the toc c n and c p ratios provide pivotal information on the source of the organic matter fig 5 the depletion of extractable al fe and p in the top 8 cm sediment is tightly correlated with the increase of tn toc and the c n and c p ratios the majority of alte is extracted by naoh85 and hcl taking up more than 90 at each depth the rest of alte is extracted by naoh at room temperature about 10 as for the fe 95 fete is extracted by hcl step and bd extraction while naoh extracts slightly more fe in shallow sediment than downcore the alte and fete remain relatively constant lower than 8 cm except for the enrichment at 20 cm on the contrary pte decreases from 22 17 μmol g at 20 cm depth to 17 28 μmol g deeper than 32 cm it is worth noting that the superficial sediment has more organic naoh25 nrp and redox sensitive bd p than the deep section fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the p retention mechanism at different water depth 4 1 1 hcl p and ca in different water depth calcium controls the retention of p in the sediment by coprecipitating with p to form calcite and fluorapatite jin et al 2006 li et al 2017a ni et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the ca p is the main fraction of hcl p which is more stable than bd p and naoh25 rp in natural alkaline lakes søndergaard et al 2003 dittirch et al 2013 ni and wang 2015 the hcl p buried in sediment is often considered a permanent burial since erhai lake is weak alkaline ph 7 07 7 58 zhao et al 2018 the high ca concentration can convert the unstable bd p and naoh25 rp into hcl p and immobilize the p in the sediment li et al 2017a yin et al 2021 thus ca plays an important role in the p retention the ca content halves at deep sites 8 m than shallower indicating higher precipitation of ca in the shallow areas this depth is consistent with the depth of active zoobenthos mastrantuono 1991 since a tightly positive correlation between ca content and toc in the sediment is observed p 0 01 r 0 945 the biogenic carbonate mainly contributes to the increase of ca content the existence of shell debris at shallow sites also supports the idea that the zoobenthos enriches the ca in the sediment the decoupling of ca content and hcl p is unexpected indicating excessive ca in binding with p in the sediment fig 3 the competition between organic matter and p indicates that ca preferentially binds with organic matter rather than p guppy et al 2005 furthermore the hcl p is coupling with hcl fe and hcl al p 0 01 r 0 65 and p 0 01 r 0 64 respectively fig 3 the small proportions of hcl fe such as fes and pyrite and hcl al such as bayerite and gibbsite jan et al 2013 are contributed to the hcl p retention when the ca is binding with organic matter or insufficient therefore the biogenic ca potentially contributes to the p retention the enrichment of organic matter makes the p in shallow area unable to bind with ca and accumulate 4 1 2 bd p mn and fe in different water depth water depth especially the stratification often controls the redox condition at the water sediment interface boehrer and schultze 2008 the bd p is sensitive to the variation of redox conditions at swi and often plays an important role in the ipl in several cases gächter and müller 2003 jin et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 jilbert et al 2011 the bd p is correlated to the ferric oxy hydroxide which has a strong binding capacity for inorganic phosphate in aerobic conditions wilson et al 2008 gu et al 2019 erhai lake is a deep lake according to the water depth but the swi is aerobic zhang et al 2014 ni and wang 2015 zhao et al 2021 the release of bd p in the deep area is not seen in this study and on the contrary there is slightly more bd p preserved in deep water sediment fig 2 previous studies advocated that more bd p accumulation happened in eutrophic areas where cyanobacterial blooms occurred which is consistent with the high bd p in the coastal area where cyanobacterial blooms frequently happened wang et al 2019b 2021 if we consider bd p proportion the bd p proportion remains constant at different water depths 15 25 except at the shallowest point on the north coast 32 thus more mobile bd p enriches in the sediment where cyanobacterial blooms usually happen from the release of cyanobacterial detritus and potential transformation from other p fractions li and shi 2020 the uncorrelated bd p and bd fe p 0 05 r 0 13 in the sediment indicate the bd p in erhai lake is not controlled by fe distribution as other lakes are gao et al 2016 chen et al 2019 it might be caused by the existence of abundant redox sensitive crystalline fe which is unable to adsorb p such as goethite and hematite jan et al 2013 another possibility is that the excessive al in sediment could prevent p release during anoxia by adsorbing the p liberated from bd p rydin et al 2000 kopáček et al 2005 unlike the fe controlled p release in other eutrophic lakes the bd p is significantly correlated to mn content in the sediment p 0 01 r 0 71 which can be a proxy to assess sedimentary bd p it might be explained by the fact that the bd p accumulation in erhai lake is mainly controlled by the kinetic process related to water level fluctuation yuan et al 2021 the highly correlated mn and bd p are expected due to the slower oxidation and reduction of mn compared to fe davison 1993 thus the swi of erhai lake is not always aerobic but mostly aerobic with occasional hypoxia that can release fe while retaining mn in the hypoxia the bd p might release as well which is also controlled by a kinetic process and readsorbed by excessive al if so the bd fe is not a proper proxy to assess the active fe that can bind with p as jan et al 2013 suggested in erhai lake the fe p ratio proposed by jensen et al 1992 is also misleading since the fe p ratio is uncorrelated to bd p either therefore we hypothesize that mn is a bd p proxy when the bd p release is controlled by the kinetic process when hypoxia is occasional even so further study on the binding mechanism of mn and bd p is required to explain why the mn is not correlated to bd p in some other cases chen et al 2019 4 1 3 naoh25 rp and al in different water depth al as a remediation method has been widely used as an effective capping adsorbent to immobilize p in the sediment kopáček et al 2005 egemose et al 2010 huser et al 2016 lin et al 2017 wang et al 2019a agstam norlin et al 2020 the amorphous aluminum hydroxides al oh 3 consist of the majority of naoh25 al in the sediment and bind with the naoh25 rp lake et al 2007 jan et al 2013 even though the naoh25 rp is redox insensitive kleeberg et al 2010 wang et al 2019a it is bioavailable and sometimes can be considered as an internal p source zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 ren et al 2022 as the main element extracted by naoh al shows a significantly positive correlation with water depth p 0 01 r 0 73 unlike the decoupling of hcl p and ca bd p and bd fe the naoh25 rp is positively correlated to naoh25 al p 0 01 r 0 84 indicating the extracted naoh25 al is mainly bound to p in other words the extracted naoh25 rp is saturated in the sediment considering the bd p readsorption by naoh25 al during the extraction process the saturation is expected moreover a significantly positive correlation between naoh25 p and water depth has been found p 0 01 r 0 83 and naoh25 al is also controlled by water depth p 0 05 r 0 86 thus p accumulation in the sediment is controlled by al distribution which is highly affected by water depth the shallow area is more sunlit thus the algal activity can assimilate sedimentary naoh25 rp resulting in less naoh25 rp accumulation in shallow areas jiang et al 2008 wang et al 2017 in addition the shallow areas are unfavorable for the formation of amorphous al due to the intensive turbulence and steep topography huser 2012 agstam norlin et al 2020 as a result there is less naoh25 rp retention in shallow areas than in deep areas thus the enrichment of al in deep areas might be the vital molecular mechanism explaining why the deep lakes are more resilient to eutrophication 4 1 4 sedimentary nh4cl in different water depth nh4cl solution extracts the loosely bound or exchangeable fractions of p lake et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 even though the nh4cl p content is the minority in most of the lakes sediment it is still a source of internal p søndergaard et al 1996 wang et al 2006 lake et al 2007 li et al 2015 tu et al 2019 in this study nh4cl p was less than 1 of pte on average fig 4 unlike the positive correlation between water depth and other p fractions the nh4cl p is significantly negatively correlated to water depth p 0 01 r 0 75 the nh4cl p is mainly adsorbed on some crystals such as caco3 through molecular attraction as the forms of dissolved p in pore water or leached p from decaying cells of bacterial biomass in deposited phytodetrital aggregates kaiserli et al 2002 pettersson 2001 it can explain the significant positive correlations between nh4cl p and toc p 0 01 r 0 95 and total ca p 0 01 r 0 916 in the sediments fig 3 as discussed in 4 1 2 more toc and ca distribute at shallow depth suitable for macrophytes growth and zoobenthos settlement thus more nh4cl p is supposed to be found in the shallow areas 4 1 5 the p retention controlled by al fe at different water depth in erhai lake the heterogeneity of al and fe in different water depths is essential for the accumulation of mobile p pmobile the sum of nh4cl p bd p and naoh25 nrp it is reported that the fe p ratio in surface sediment may be possible to control ipl as a result of its gravimetric ratio above 15 is equal to 8 3 of the molar ratio which is determined by the study of p release from the aerobic sediments in fifteen danish lakes jensen et al 1992 another study suggested that a dramatic increase in the p retention with the growth of fe p ratio up to 10 and the increase slows down with fe p 10 martynova 2008 in this study the molar ratios of the total content of fe p for all superficial sediments are above 26 and the molar ratios of bd fe pmobile are above 7 9 indicating the fe is sufficient in controlling the p release from sediment of erhai lake moreover the molar naoh25 al bd fe ratio 3 and the molar naoh25 al bd p nh4cl p ratio 25 a model as proposed by kopáček et al 2005 have been used to evaluate the ipl from anoxic sediments lake et al 2007 wilson et al 2008 another study suggested that the operationally defined pmobile was responsible for the internal p loading and a 4 1 molar ratio between al and pmobile is sufficient to ensure that significant reduction of p concentration in the overlying water of lakes reitzel et al 2005 in the superficial sediment samples the molar ratio of naoh25 al bd fe 1 and naoh25 al bd p nh4cl p 25 indicate a high risk of ipl for erhai lake however a higher than 4 1 molar ratio between naoh25 al and pmobile is found for most sediments of erhai lake indicating that al in sediments also played the important role in controlling ipl for most regions of erhai lake it is worth noting that pmobile shows a decreasing trend with increasing molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios fig s7 if we categorize the data into two sets as water depth 8 m without macrophyte growth and water depth 8 m where macrophytes exist or existed significantly negative relationships were found between pmobile and the molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios in the deep water sediments while the pmobile and the molar naoh25 al pmobile ratios in shallow water are not tightly correlated indicating that elevated naoh25 al in deep water promotes the p retention fig s6 since the naoh25 al is positively correlated to total al p 0 01 r 0 63 the enrichment of al in deep areas is vital in promoting the p retention in stable fractions the enrichment of fe al and tp in deep areas and enrichment of toc and ca in shallow areas indicate the relative importance of plant mediated organic matter accumulation on metal and p mobilization of sediments kleeberg 2013 lalonde et al 2012 the toc is positively correlated to the proportion of pmobile indicating that plant assimilation of labile p in sediments and the water column in shallow areas may accelerate the mobilization and release of sedimentary p p 0 01 r 0 60 in addition simple sorption of organic matter on reactive fe and al oxide surfaces possibly affects the sediment p mobilization in this study significantly negative correlations are found between the molar ratios of toc bd fe and bd fe pmoblie between the molar ratios of toc naoh25 al and naoh25 al pmobile while the data can be divided into sub groups through toc contents fig s6 these results indicate that enhanced surface adsorption of om on fe and al hydr oxides could promote mobilization of p and thus reduce the p retention in sediments however this relationship is triggered possibly based on the composition of organic matter and toc contents relative to water depth for example the higher molar ratio of bd fe pmobile is found in the high toc sediment 3 8 in shallow areas contrasting to the ratio in low toc sediment 3 0 in deep areas although they have a similar molar ratio of oc bd fe and that the linear regression slope of bd fe pmobile plotted with toc bd fe in deep water sediment is 5 6 folds higher than that in shallow water sediments the linear regression slope of naoh25 al pmobile plotted with toc naoh25 al in deep areas is 22 folds higher than that in shallow areas fig s6 the decreasing effects of organic matter on the mobility of p in shallow water sediments in contrast to deep water sediments indicate that the organic matter impedes the p retention controlled by fe and al binding therefore aside from the depletion of fe and al in the shallow areas the organic matter generated from macrophyte covered shallow areas further restrains the p retention by inactivating the adsorption of fe and al hydr oxides therefore the pmobile accumulation in the shallow area is mainly controlled by biogeochemical mechanism such as the accumulation of biogenic ca organic matter accumulated from macrophyte detritus while the physicochemical mechanism such as adsorption of al and fe controls the p retention in the deep area this mechanism makes the sedimentary p more labile in shallow area while more immobile in deep area leading to a higher eutrophication risk for shallow lakes 4 2 the p retention mechanisms in the ecosystem transition 4 2 1 the self purification of erhai in the clear water ecosystem the tpex is 20 higher in the top 20 cm corresponding to the date later than 1900 compared to downcore therefore the increased tpex is not caused by fertilization a concomitant increase of feex and c n occurs coincidently with the enrichment of p fig 4 5 a corresponding increasing sedimentary rate in the early 20th century is also observed li et al 2017b a one time abundant terrestrial nutrient input event can explain the anomaly that may be caused by an intensive earthquake 7 5 richter scale in 1925 dearing et al 2008 or the wars and pandemics that reduced more than 400 000 population of dali in the early 20th century local archive since the c n ratio is positively correlated to allochthonous organic matter meyers and teranes 2001 the high c n compounds along with terrestrial fe and al input are expected at 20 cm depth due to the increasing external input which is also seen in the core sample the enhanced input can also be proved by the 10 increase of toc simultaneously fig 5 b different p fractions show different accumulation and diagenetic processes after the event without further nutrient input it takes a longer time for tp in the water column to reduce to the original level in eutrophic lakes due to the internal loading spears et al 2006 søndergaard et al 2013 the molar ratios of naoh25 al bd fe and naoh25 al pmobile of core sediment indicate that erhai lake is unfavorable immobilizing p fig 7 s3 s4 as a mesotrophic lake erhai lake is vulnerable to external p input and takes a longer time to recover dittrich et al 2013 the reduction of c n ratio and fe in 14 20 cm represents the self purification process of external input even though the pte does not reduce to the original level the naoh25 nrp reduces in the next 40 years fig 6 which is consistent with the recovery of c n ratio and fe content the conversion of naoh25 nrp to naoh25 rp is observed due to the complementary proportion of these two p fractions in the core sediment fig s8 the al content enrichment at 20 cm depth reduces to original level in the next 2 cm upcore indicating a 10 year residence time for al in erhai lake on the contrary no corresponding increase of naoh25 rp indicates that the al input is mainly in mineral forms particle rather than amorphous dissolved al which is consistent with the gradual naoh85 al enrichment at 20 cm depth fig 7 on the contrary the fe enrichment at 20 cm consists of more mobile bd fe and immobilizes sedimentary p as bd p in a short time it is worth noting that the mobile p is sensitive to external disturbance while the relatively stable p gradually increases after the external input since the labile p fractions recover while the stable ones remain enriched it suggests that the long term ipl gradually transforms labile p forms into more stable fractions to preserve in the sediment to sum up all the elements except p reduce to the original level within 10 years after a one time external input event without further input and remediation in erhai lake the long lasting p enrichment might be caused by the ipl the molar ratios of naoh25 al bd fe and naoh25 al pmobile are lower than the suggested molar limit in kopáček et al 2005 of whole core sediment indicating naturally unfavorable for the immobilization of p in erhai lake fig 2 therefore the erhai lake is naturally at high risk from ipl which is consistent with the vulnerability of mesotrophic lakes carey and rydin 2011 4 2 2 the p retention in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem the platform is a pivotal area for erhai lake s ecosystem the macrophyte coverage is highly dependent on whether the platform is covered by macrophytes li et al 2013 ye et al 2018 erhai lake was not macrophyte dominated under natural circumstances before 1960 due to the high water level and oligotrophic condition with the anthropogenic nutrient input and the lowering of the water level fig 4 the water depth of the platform reduced by 3 m and the nutrient became suitable for macrophyte growth ye et al 2018 macrophytes covered 20 40 of erhai lake from 1960 to 2000 since macrophyte is a reservoir of p that absorbs p from sediment and water column wang et al 2018 the simultaneous reduction of p at 10 cm depth of the core sample is contributed to the spreading of macrophytes in erhai lake even with more exogenous p introduced the al was reduced simultaneously as well resulting in the decrease of naoh25 rp fig 4 as discussed in 4 1 3 the turbulence may restrain the accumulation of al and the lowering of the water level intensified the turbulence at the platform impeding the accumulation of al the expansion of macrophytes can partially reduce the sedimentary naoh25 rp wang et al 2018 since the naoh25 rp is saturated in erhai lake the decrease of al especially naoh25 al results in the reduction of p immobility and intensifies the ipl in macrophyte dominated erhai lake furthermore the simultaneous depletion of hcl fe hcl al and naoh85 al at 8 cm depth also impedes the accumulation of immobile p fig s3 s4 as a consequence the al release in the degrading ecosystem reduces the immobility of sedimentary p more importantly the macrophyte is not a permanent reservoir of p it is reported that the decomposition of macrophytes can mobilize p and reduce the accumulation kleeberg 2013 abundant organic p released from macrophyte detritus and bd p can accumulate in the superficial sediment fig 6 thus the macrophytes can assimilate relatively stable p fractions and release more labile and bioavailable p fractions when they are extinct zhu et al 2018 the macrophyte biomass remained dynamic constant when the platform was covered by macrophyte however the equilibrium broke down when the ecosystem transition happened 4 2 3 the p and active al fe retention in the transition ecosystem the ecosystem transition affects the p retention significantly for instance the sediment transforms from p sink to p source in the macrophyte dominated to algal dominated ecosystem transition zhang et al 2013 aguinaga et al 2019 klamt et al 2019 ren et al 2022 several cyanobacterial blooms occurred in the early 21st century wang et al 2013 in the meanwhile the increasing water level turbidity and trophic status reduced the macrophyte coverage to only 5 10 resulting in the transition of the ecosystem to an algae macrophyte concomitant ecosystem zhu et al 2015 fu et al 2018 song et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the sudden accumulation of macrophyte debris increased the labile p content in the superficial sediment in turn intensified the ipl fig 6 after the water level uplift of erhai lake the al in the sediment decreased slower than in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem the naoh25 al increased by 25 fig 7 indicating the al started to accumulate that will recover to the original level in the next decades because of the cyanobacterial blooms that impede the sedimentation of al by increasing ph cooke et al 1993 paerl et al 2011 it will take a longer time for al to recover than it did in the early 20th century 20 cm depth it will increase the storage capacity of naoh25 rp for the sediment of erhai lake and reduce the mobility of sedimentary p however without external al introduced the al level in the natural condition is insufficient to immobilize the p released by macrophyte debris since the naoh25 al is at low level and naoh25 rp is saturated in erhai lake there is a bd fe depletion at 5 cm depth fig 7 it might be explained by less bd fe introduced by anthropogenic activities than the natural nutrient input another possibility is that the anthropogenic bd fe releases due to the occasional anoxia caused by algal expansion the depletion of fete in the topmost sediment does not impede the high proportions of bd fe and bd p on the contrary more bd p accumulates in the sediment of eutrophic lakes after the degradation of ecosystems in some cases liu et al 2019 ren et al 2022 therefore the sorption capacity of bd fe exceeds the concentration of bd p it is worth noting that the bd fe decreases at the topmost core along with the degradation of the ecosystem the decoupling of bd p and bd fe at the surface of sediment indicates that macrophyte degradation could release p that is adsorbed by excessive bd fe in the superficial sediment kleeberg 2002 the reduction of bd fe and the enrichment of bd p increase the release risk of p under reductive condition more bioavailable naoh25 nrp is seen in the topmost sediment fig 4 indicating the accumulation of organic matters associated with the extinction of macrophytes the change of macrophyte taxa from long lasting potamogeton maackianus to short lived ceratophyllum demersum caused by the water level uplift shortens the p retention time in macrophytes he et al 2015 the enrichment of labile bd p and naoh25 nrp intensifies the risks of erhai lake from eutrophication and causes more severe cyanobacteria blooms after 2000 wang et al 2019b song et al 2020 5 conclusion we used sequential extraction method to thoroughly study the p retention and its binding metals in the sediment significant correlations between water depth and the distribution of fe and al were found that can explain why the shallow lakes are more easily to become eutrophic than deep ones the mobile p in sediment in shallow areas is mainly controlled by a biogeochemical mechanism affected by the zoobenthos activity and macrophyte coverage there is more biogenic ca that is positively correlated to the organic matters at the depth suitable for zoobenthos survival which also controls the p retention in shallow area on the contrary the physicochemical mechanism controls the p retention in the deep area by changing the p binding metal distributions such as al and fe in deep areas the sediment can preserve more p due to more al and fe in sediment we also found that mn is an important proxy in evaluating the bd p preservation in the kinetic process controlling the release of bd p the historical record of erhai lake indicates that the water depth is more important than simply changing the p distribution it controls the macrophyte coverage and ecosystem the self purification ability of erhai lake is capable to preserve the natural external nutrient input in 10 years at high water level the lowering of water level helps the expansion of macrophytes as an important p reservoir preserving further anthropogenic p input in the 1960s however the transition from clear water ecosystem to macrophyte dominated ecosystem also impedes the accumulation of immobile p fractions thus with the water level uplift the macrophyte extinction resulted in the release of p that deteriorated water quality of erhai lake and the released p was preserved in mobile p fractions in the sediment that increased the risk from ipl therefore water depth variation limits the p retention and mobility by changing the distribution of p binding metal elements and the coverage of macrophyte declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
