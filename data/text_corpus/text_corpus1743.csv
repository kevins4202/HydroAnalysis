8715,decision making units dmus face considerable variations in their production possibilities as well as the characteristics of the production environments under which they operate consequently dmus are likely to experience substantial differences in productivity and efficiency levels in contrast the received literature assumes that dmus share similar technological possibilities and only differ with respect to their level of inefficiency this study develops an analytical framework using random parameters which accommodates heterogeneity in production possibilities and in characteristics of the production environment we use this framework to analyze variations in the output elasticity of irrigation across dmus and how these differences influence 1 irrigation water use efficiency iwue using a non radial input oriented approach that isolates and measures the efficient use of the irrigation input 2 technical efficiency which radially measures the efficient utilization of all inputs and 3 shadow prices of irrigation withdrawals we find that iwue and technical efficiency averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively and shadow prices averaged 77 5 per million gallons of irrigation water albeit with significant regional variations keywords irrigation water use efficiency technical efficiency random parameters stochastic production frontier u s agriculture 1 introduction the efficient management of water resources given rising water demand and projected reductions in precipitation as a result of climate change has become a critical issue in u s agriculture 57 several regions in the united states continue to experience significant drought and water shortages which directly threaten the viability of the agricultural sector 56 increased climatic variability characterized by rising temperatures and reduced precipitation means that irrigated agriculture is now conducted under conditions of water scarcity 18 as a result irrigated agriculture is in direct competition with other uses of water such as domestic industrial and hydroelectric 43 64 consequently the threat of water scarcity has become an issue of concern among policy makers and stakeholders alike with conversations emerging on how best to manage this scarce resource e g 7 11 33 36 47 61 65 68 69 evidence within the united states that establishes the connection between climatic variability and the need for secondary sources of water such as irrigation has been building for several years a major argument is that rising temperatures raise crop evapotranspiration rates reduce soil moisture rapidly and hence increase crop water demand 28 55 this changing temperature and precipitation patterns have lead directly to modifications in farming systems and resource use e g 13 24 34 50 and to a growing reliance on irrigation e g 13 24 38 48 the agricultural sector is now the second largest consumer of water resources in the united states accounting for approximately 115 000 million gallons per day with 62 4 million acres of land under irrigation 59 it is projected that demand for agricultural water use will continue to rise resulting in a strain in water available for household and industrial purposes 47 irrigation expansion can be expected in the short term to reduce the negative effects stemming from climatic variability 35 however the longer term potential for improved irrigation practices to solve the agricultural sector water problems will diminish due to water scarcity and competition with other sectors of the economy 47 the focus will then have to shift to sustainable water resource management and land use intensification in order to raise productivity 16 sustainable agriculture characterized as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices that over the long term enhances environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends requires the protection and enhancement of water resources 57 sustainable use of water resources in turn entails the adoption of updated and modern water management and irrigation technologies 11 28 43 47 in order to improve the timing and application of irrigation 6 it also requires that water be valued as an economic good in order to make this resource a tradable commodity 44 as creation of markets can improve the allocative efficiency of water 61 finally sustainable water use requires policies that favor conservation by placing more emphasis on practices such as water harvesting precision irrigation techniques and deficit irrigation 17 18 39 thus given the sensitivity of agriculture to secondary water sources in the face of water scarcity the analysis of irrigation systems and how efficiently they are implemented in farm production has become of increasing importance within the hydrology literature water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of harvested biomass to water consumed in order to achieve a given yield e g 17 water use efficiency has also been defined as the rate of carbon uptake per unit of water lost 53 on the other hand within economic studies water use efficiency often refers to the effectiveness of applied irrigation e g 35 and the ratio of the minimum feasible water used to observed water usage associated with a given level of output while holding other inputs and technology constant 30 67 this study analyzes irrigation efficiency across the top agricultural counties in the u s the objectives are 1 to develop an analytical framework that measures irrigation water use efficiency iwue and technical efficiency te while accommodating heterogeneity across u s counties in weather patterns soil type topography and drainage 2 to analyze iwue and te in order to establish whether these components have improved or deteriorated over time and 3 to estimate shadow prices for irrigation water in order to provide market signals as to the value of the resource as well as the corresponding savings that would accrue from raising iwue understanding the role that improvements in efficiency can have in enhancing irrigation water productivity is an important area of research and one that can provide useful information to stakeholders the results from this study will add to the existing knowledge on water use efficiency and will provide insights for public policies that are compatible with conservation and enhanced productivity the rest of the study is organized as follows the next section presents the analytical framework as well as the methodology that is used to analyze iwue and te section 3 presents the data that is used for the analysis section 4 presents the results and finally section 5 concludes and provides some suggestions for future research 2 irrigation water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency iwue is defined in the literature as the ratio of the minimum feasible requirement to observed water usage associated with a given level of output while holding other inputs technology and the environment constant 30 iwue a non radial measure of the irrigation input makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which irrigation water applied can be reduced while holding output constant the received literature on iwue uses either non parametric approaches such as data envelopment analysis dea e g 33 52 or stochastic production frontiers spf e g 14 30 67 the aforementioned studies also combine traditional radial measures of output oriented technical efficiency that incorporate all inputs e g 1 37 alongside non radial input oriented approaches that isolate the technical efficiency measurement of a single input while holding other inputs constant e g 31 45 the problem with the dea approach is the strong assumption that variables involved in the production process are observed and measured without error this assumption seldom holds implying that dea estimators are likely to be inconsistent 41 in contrast stochastic production frontier studies that investigate iwue e g 30 usually adopt the following general formulation 1 y i f x i w i β exp v i u i where the variables y i x i and w i represent output a vector of conventional inputs and water use for firm i respectively furthermore v i and u i denote a two sided statistical error term and a one sided output oriented technical efficiency term respectively early studies on iwue made a key assumption that the technical efficiency term u i was itself a function of exogenous factors such that u i g z i δ η i where η i iid n 0 σ v 2 this assumption raised considerable econometric problems first if the variables associated with the technical inefficiency term u i were correlated with elements in the first step i e x i w i then the associated estimates generated in the first step were likely to be biased due to omission of relevant variables 32 22 moreover the assumption of identically distributed errors are contradicted by the functional relationship between u i and z i 32 60 hence the need to include the vector z in the deterministic component of equation 1 41 furthermore the aforementioned spf studies rely on conventional translog specifications the translog is a flexible functional form that incorporates squares and cross products of log inputs which affords flexibility but violates key properties of a regular technology notably inactivity strong disposability of outputs and inputs and output and input closedness see refs 40 42 a translog production function cannot satisfy these properties globally and its use inevitably leads to inconsistencies with production economic theory thus the cobb douglas specification becomes a desirable alternative because it satisfies key regularity conditions globally however the conventional cobb douglas has constant parameters thus imposing fixed partial elasticities of output across all data points which leads to identical te and iwue rankings 30 45 to circumvent these flexibility concerns we utilize a random parameters cobb douglas specification the underlying motivation for using a random parameters approach is the ability to account for technological and environmental heterogeneity 22 54 traditional stochastic frontier models assume that firms share similar production possibilities and differ only with respect to their levels of inefficiency 54 random parameters on the other hand relax this restrictive assumption thus accommodating heterogeneous responses of dmus to changes in the covariates 5 this approach also enables the derivation of non identical te and iwue rankings across observations while avoiding the theoretical shortcomings associated with the translog and other flexible functional forms 40 42 2 1 the random parameters stochastic production frontier rp spf we proceed by introducing i and t subscripts into the notation such that y i t characterizes output of firm i at time t we also introduce firm and time specific vectors of irrigation withdrawals x 1 i t other conventional inputs x m i t and weather effects and physical characteristics of the production environment z j i t taken together all regressors impact the production process however the weather effects and physical characteristics of the environment are never under the control of the producer 12 the random parameters stochastic production frontier or rp spf see ref 22 for the cobb douglas functional form can be expressed as 2 ln y i t k 1 k φ k h 1 h τ h t β 1 i t ln x 1 i t m 2 m β m i t ln x m i t j 1 j γ j i t ln z j i t v i t u i t we include a composed error structure that consists of the term v i t which captures statistical noise with distributional assumptions v n 0 σ v 2 and u i t which represents te with distributional parameters u n 0 σ u 2 in this model te is a radial output oriented measure equal to observed output divided by frontier or maximum output and incorporates all inputs i e x and z mentioned above we conjecture that heterogeneity in production technologies and characteristics of the production environment are reflected through the estimated random parameters β 1 i t β m i t γ j i t the original formulation of a random parameters regression model comes from ref 26 while the extension to stochastic frontier models is due to tsionas 54 and greene 22 the theoretical underpinning behind random parameters holds that continuous parameter variation address cross firm variation technical inefficiency and minimizes confounding due to heterogeneity 22 p 287 the general form of the random parameters β 1 β m and γ j is given as 22 3 β 1 β m γ j β 1 β m γ j δ β 1 β m γ j η i γ β 1 β m γ j s i where β 1 β m γ j are the mean vectors in the distributions for the random parameters δ β 1 β m γ j is a coefficient matrix which forms the observation specific term in the mean η i is a set of observed variables which do not vary over time and enter the means of the random parameters s i is an unobservable latent random term with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix σ finally γ β 1 β m γ j is a diagonal matrix which produces the covariance matrix of the random parameters 21 now we turn to iwue which is illustrated in fig 1 the inefficient representative dmu is initially producing output level q 0 using x 1 a units of irrigation water and x m units of a second input at point a the input oriented te is a radial measure equal to 0 b 0 a for the dmu in question the minimum feasible quantity of water needed to produce q 0 operating at point a holding x m constant is denoted by x 1 c therefore the maximum possible reduction in irrigation water is given as x 1 a x 1 c thus i w u e x 1 c x 1 a the quantity x 1 c is not observed however rewriting the latter expression for iwue we can get x 1 c i w u e x 1 a note that the firm producing at point c in fig 1 is on the frontier hence making it technically efficient thus substituting x 1 c with x 1 from equation 2 we obtain 4 ln y i t k 1 k φ k h 1 h τ h t β 1 i t ln x 1 i t c m 2 m β m i t ln x m i t j 1 j γ j i t ln z j i t v i t producing on the frontier implies that te is 1 or that u i t 0 by holding output and all other inputs constant one can obtain a non radial measure of irrigation water and thus establish the extent to which the quantity of irrigation water applied can be feasibly reduced subsequently a measure of iwue can be obtained by equating expressions 2 and 4 in order to obtain 5a β 1 i t l n x 1 i t u i t β 1 i t l n x 1 i t c 5b ln x 1 i t x 1 i t c u i t β 1 i t taking the antilogarithm of equation 5b we obtain a measure of iwue for each decision making unit i and time period t as 6 i w u e i t e x p u i t β 1 i t results from equation 6 will enable us to establish how efficient dmus are at using the minimal possible level of irrigation water to generate a given level of output the derived te and iwue estimates enable a dual ranking of dmus based on these two efficiency measures 3 data we use a panel of county level input output data drawn from the u s department of agriculture usda census of agriculture for the years 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 and 2012 for the top 350 agricultural counties in the country based on the market value of agricultural products sold in 2012 the 2012 vol entitled state and county rankings which is published alongside every census report is used to select the counties in the panel fig 2 illustrates the spatial location of the counties used in this analysis aggregation at the county level can be justified based on past research that finds evidence that u s agricultural producers behave collectively as if they were price taking and profit maximizing firms e g 63 output is measured as total agricultural revenue received inputs include agricultural land in acres livestock number of dairy cows beef cows hogs sheep horses poultry expressed in animal equivalents which is an approach that takes into account feed requirements for each animal type 70 value of machinery and equipment hired and contract labor expenditures on intermediate materials fertilizer chemicals electricity and total fuel used in gallons all monetary values are adjusted using price indexes constructed by the usda in order to get quantity indices in 2016 dollars 71 estimates of volumetric measures of irrigation water withdrawn at the county level come from data provided by the u s geological survey which are available for the years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 cubic spline interpolation methods are used to match the irrigation withdrawal data with the input output variables e g 66 subsequently the input output data is augmented with growing season contemporaneous temperature and precipitation information derived from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group the prism incorporates a climate mapping system to generate temperature and precipitation information at a 2 5 by 2 5 mile grid cells for the entire united states and accounts for the effects of elevation coastal proximity temperature inversions and terrain induced air mass blockage see refs 8 10 evidence from the crop yield literature indicates that temperature affects production in a nonlinear fashion e g 4 13 46 50 consequently we incorporate growing degree days into our model a variable that captures the accumulated exposure of crops to heat during the growing season between given upper and lower bounds 46 we construct estimates of growing degree days using daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the growing season i e april september for the predominant crop grown in each county based on total acreage as reported in the agricultural census moreover temperatures that exceed optimal thresholds are likely to impact crop development negatively 25 hence we incorporate in the model the number of days that temperatures exceeded the crop ambient level within the growing season we refer to this non linear measure as harmful degree days we also incorporate in the model measures of vapor pressure deficit vpd defined as the difference between the amount of moisture currently in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is completely saturated this captures the potential of the surrounding air to pull moisture from the foliage through transpiration 19 rising temperatures lead to higher levels of vpd between the saturated foliage and the ambient air which then leads to higher rates of evapotranspiration which is the amount of water that is lost from the leaf surface conversely when the air is fully saturated with humidity there is less transpiration leading to low vpd this condition limits the ability of the plant to take up essential minerals which may lead to mineral deficiencies and plant susceptibility to disease pathogens 19 high and low vpd may lead to reduced crop development and yields our specification of the weather effects is consistent with recent studies including roberts et al 46 finally it is important to point out that agricultural production is impacted by topography and soil characteristics therefore data obtained from soil surveys and published in the national resource inventory of the usda is incorporated into the model this data contains detailed information on the physical characteristics of the production environment such as measures of susceptibility to soil erosion k factor estimates of susceptibility to floods length of slope permeability fraction of land cover under clay and sand level of moisture capacity and soil salinity similar measures of soil characteristics have been utilized in various climate change studies e g 13 49 summary statistics of the variables incorporated in the rp spf are provided in table 1 4 results the rp spf model is estimated using simulated maximum likelihood methods with halton draws in nlogit version 6 the estimates for the random parameters are generated at the county level and for each time period in table 2 we report estimates of the means of the random parameters which comprise the conventional inputs i e land labor capital livestock intermediate materials and irrigation and the weather effects i e growing degree days harmful degree days maximum and minimum vapor pressure deficit spring and summer precipitation table 2 also presents the parameters treated as non random which correspond to the variables that measure the physical characteristics of the soil and the topography e g fraction of clay and sand permeability levels moisture capacity levels susceptibility to erosion salinity levels and length of slope as well as the state level fixed effects variables representing physical characteristics of the production environment usually remain fairly constant over time and treating such parameters as random would result in convergence problems as discussed earlier the irrigation variable is constructed using cubic spline interpolation methods 66 such construction raises the potential for errors in variables which occurs when one or more of the explanatory variables in a regression equation or system of equations are measured with error 20 errors in variables may lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates 21 a measure that has been proposed to assess the accuracy of the standard errors generated when the potential for errors in variables exists is the use of bootstrapping e g 2 we begin by estimating the vector of parameters in equation 1 θ ˆ β ˆ γ ˆ φ ˆ ρ ˆ τ ˆ σ ˆ u 2 σ ˆ v 2 and subsequently construct bootstrap confidence regions for the standard errors assuming that the ratio of error variances lies within a confidence interval λ λ 1 λ 2 a confidence band is constructed in order to generate confidence intervals for the standard errors see ref 2 results indicate a 90 confidence interval for all standard errors generated and a 95 confidence interval for all but 1 22 of standard errors generated the estimated coefficients for the conventional inputs i e β 1 i t and β m i t which represent partial elasticities of output are all statistically significant and satisfy regularity conditions they are all positively signed thus guaranteeing strong disposability in inputs secondly these partial elasticities have a magnitude between zero and one ensuring that the bordered hessian matrix is negative semi definite 1 1 a cobb douglas function f x i x j that is twice continuously differentiable is concave if f x i x i 0 and f x i x j 0 x i 0 x j 0 equation 2 above satisfies this property the hessian matrix of a concave function is negative semidefinite see ref 51 the sum of the means of the random parameters indicates that the estimated average elasticity of scale is 1 04 revealing slightly increasing returns the ratio σ u σ v λ is equal to 1 05 indicating that the variance of the one sided error component is slightly larger than the one for the two sided component the estimate of the mean of the random parameter for irrigation withdrawals β 1 i t indicates that ceteris paribus irrigation has a positive and statistically significant effect on output at the 5 level the coefficient estimates range between 0 010 and 0 025 revealing substantial heterogeneity across dmus and over time similarly the parameter estimates for the weather effects reveal significant variation across time and space we find that growing degree days and spring precipitation ceteris paribus have a positive and statistically significant effect on output at the 5 level and 1 level respectively conversely maximum vapor pressure deficit vpd and harmful degree days ceteris paribus have negative and statistically significant effects on output at the 5 and 10 levels respectively we provide illustrations of the kernel densities of the random parameters in the appendix results for the coefficient estimates of the land and soil features reveal that on average regions characterized by high clay content elevated moisture capacity levels salinity and permeability ceteris paribus are associated with higher agricultural output on the other hand regions characterized by soils susceptible to floods soil erosion k factor longer slopes and wetland areas ceteris paribus exhibit negative association with agricultural output in order to capture technical change and any unobserved heterogeneity we include time fixed as well as state level fixed effects as mentioned earlier iwue measures the minimum feasible quantity of water needed to generate a given level of output at the frontier 30 this measure requires estimating the maximal possible reduction in irrigation withdrawals while holding all other inputs constant our findings indicate that average iwue for all observations in the sample is 72 6 ranging from 38 1 to 95 2 on the other hand te scores average 83 6 with a range between 52 8 and 97 9 a graphical illustration of the kernel densities for iwue and te is depicted in fig 3 the spearman rank correlation coefficient between iwue and te is 0 95 with a t statistic 0 000 thus providing strong evidence that counties with high te scores generally tend to rank highly in iwue as well conversely counties with low te measures also tend to rank low on iwue estimates now we turn to the output effect and shadow values associated with irrigation water following karagiannis et al 30 we calculate the average shadow cost in terms of forgone output associated with a percentage reduction in irrigation this shadow cost is given by dividing the mean value for observed irrigation withdrawals reported in table 1 by the estimated mean of the random parameter for irrigation reported in table 2 thus for the average county holding all other inputs constant we find that a 1 reduction approx 1 14 million gallons day in irrigation withdrawals would result in 88 9 million in foregone output this in turn implies that the shadow price for the average county which is calculated as the shadow cost divided by a one percent unit of irrigation water used is approximately 77 5 per million gallons table 3 provides information on average te and iwue scores as well as average shadow prices by state between 1987 and 2012 an analysis of the mean distribution of the shadow prices for irrigation reveals that on average western states face substantially higher shadow prices for irrigation compared to their eastern counterparts these shadow prices range from a high of 191 29 per million gallons in california to a low of 0 30 per million gallons in new hampshire in addition western states on average exhibit higher te and iwue scores compared to eastern states these differences across states suggest that regulatory frameworks for agricultural water markets which are prevalent in western states e g 3 15 23 27 62 may contribute to dmus minimizing their irrigation withdrawals thus raising iwue moreover this finding appears to be consistent with other studies on irrigation water use in the united states which suggest that institutional arrangements and water pricing at state and local levels may be key in influencing agricultural production practices that are consistent with the efficient use of water resources and other inputs e g 47 62 as a point of reference according to the usda s farm and ranch irrigation survey fris in 2003 the average price paid by farmers nationwide was approximately 42 per acre foot 2 2 approximately one million gallons are required to cover 3 06 acre feet and ranged from 86 per acre foot in california to 5 in minnesota 23 in 2013 the average farmer paid 74 62 per acre foot and this price ranged from 132 51 per acre foot in california to 8 85 per acre foot in minnesota 58 5 concluding remarks the u s agricultural sector is a major consumer of water resources in this country accounting for approximately 115 000 million gallons per day in 2010 or 38 of total fresh water withdrawals increased climatic variability characterized by rising temperatures and frequent and intense droughts has exacerbated the need for secondary sources of water for agriculture this has raised concerns among policy makers and stakeholders alike on the efficiency of current irrigation practices this study highlights some of these concerns and illustrates how to evaluate efficiency of agricultural practices with special attention given to irrigation water the importance of irrigation across agricultural regions in the united states reflects a combination of factors including environmental conditions water availability cost of irrigation and the prevailing regulatory and statutory frameworks surrounding access to water 23 62 thus the objective of this study is to calculate and evaluate irrigation water use efficiency iwue across several counties in the united states iwue is defined in this study as the minimum feasible quantity of irrigation water needed to generate a specified level of output given the technology and production environment we also calculate technical efficiency te and analyze how it relates to iwue we use a random parameters stochastic production frontier while controlling for weather effects and physical characteristics of the production environment in order to generate distinct coefficient estimates for key variables used by each county in our data across every time period observed importantly using our coefficient estimates we are able to determine an upper bound for the shadow price of irrigation water for the average county which we establish to be approximately 77 5 per million gallons this approach enables us to account for cross county variations in production possibilities as well as heterogeneity in the production environments thus minimizing confounding in the interpretation of the inefficiency results our general findings reveal that the distribution of the elasticity of irrigation withdrawals varies widely across the counties in the panel and that irrigation withdrawals have a statistically significant impact on output in addition we find that iwue and te averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively our findings indicate a strong correlation between te and iwue thus efforts aimed at raising irrigation water use efficiency also raise farm level technical efficiency another important finding is the wide disparity of shadow prices for irrigation water across counties and states in the us an analysis of the mean distribution of shadow prices reveals that western states generally faces substantially higher shadow prices compared to their eastern counterparts western states are characterized by semi arid agro climatic conditions and thus rely heavily on irrigation for this reason institutional arrangements that regulate the supply of irrigation water for agricultural consumption have evolved over time across the western states 49 62 and may be a contributing factor for the relatively high iwue levels found western states also exhibited relatively high te estimates this finding is consistent with other studies on irrigation water use in the united states that indicate that institutional arrangements and water pricing at the state and local levels may be key in influencing agricultural production practices that are consistent with the efficient use of scarce water resources e g 47 62 these results should provide policy makers with useful insights on how to formulate policies that are compatible with conservation and the promotion of efficient water use key of which is establishing institutional arrangements that regulate the supply and consumption of irrigation water by generating rankings of iwue policymakers can develop measures that can target specific dmus counties in our case in meeting efficiency targets in addition by establishing specific iwue measures one can determine the average savings that be accrued by operating at efficient levels acknowledgements this study was support by the national institute of food and agriculture grant

8715,decision making units dmus face considerable variations in their production possibilities as well as the characteristics of the production environments under which they operate consequently dmus are likely to experience substantial differences in productivity and efficiency levels in contrast the received literature assumes that dmus share similar technological possibilities and only differ with respect to their level of inefficiency this study develops an analytical framework using random parameters which accommodates heterogeneity in production possibilities and in characteristics of the production environment we use this framework to analyze variations in the output elasticity of irrigation across dmus and how these differences influence 1 irrigation water use efficiency iwue using a non radial input oriented approach that isolates and measures the efficient use of the irrigation input 2 technical efficiency which radially measures the efficient utilization of all inputs and 3 shadow prices of irrigation withdrawals we find that iwue and technical efficiency averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively and shadow prices averaged 77 5 per million gallons of irrigation water albeit with significant regional variations keywords irrigation water use efficiency technical efficiency random parameters stochastic production frontier u s agriculture 1 introduction the efficient management of water resources given rising water demand and projected reductions in precipitation as a result of climate change has become a critical issue in u s agriculture 57 several regions in the united states continue to experience significant drought and water shortages which directly threaten the viability of the agricultural sector 56 increased climatic variability characterized by rising temperatures and reduced precipitation means that irrigated agriculture is now conducted under conditions of water scarcity 18 as a result irrigated agriculture is in direct competition with other uses of water such as domestic industrial and hydroelectric 43 64 consequently the threat of water scarcity has become an issue of concern among policy makers and stakeholders alike with conversations emerging on how best to manage this scarce resource e g 7 11 33 36 47 61 65 68 69 evidence within the united states that establishes the connection between climatic variability and the need for secondary sources of water such as irrigation has been building for several years a major argument is that rising temperatures raise crop evapotranspiration rates reduce soil moisture rapidly and hence increase crop water demand 28 55 this changing temperature and precipitation patterns have lead directly to modifications in farming systems and resource use e g 13 24 34 50 and to a growing reliance on irrigation e g 13 24 38 48 the agricultural sector is now the second largest consumer of water resources in the united states accounting for approximately 115 000 million gallons per day with 62 4 million acres of land under irrigation 59 it is projected that demand for agricultural water use will continue to rise resulting in a strain in water available for household and industrial purposes 47 irrigation expansion can be expected in the short term to reduce the negative effects stemming from climatic variability 35 however the longer term potential for improved irrigation practices to solve the agricultural sector water problems will diminish due to water scarcity and competition with other sectors of the economy 47 the focus will then have to shift to sustainable water resource management and land use intensification in order to raise productivity 16 sustainable agriculture characterized as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices that over the long term enhances environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends requires the protection and enhancement of water resources 57 sustainable use of water resources in turn entails the adoption of updated and modern water management and irrigation technologies 11 28 43 47 in order to improve the timing and application of irrigation 6 it also requires that water be valued as an economic good in order to make this resource a tradable commodity 44 as creation of markets can improve the allocative efficiency of water 61 finally sustainable water use requires policies that favor conservation by placing more emphasis on practices such as water harvesting precision irrigation techniques and deficit irrigation 17 18 39 thus given the sensitivity of agriculture to secondary water sources in the face of water scarcity the analysis of irrigation systems and how efficiently they are implemented in farm production has become of increasing importance within the hydrology literature water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of harvested biomass to water consumed in order to achieve a given yield e g 17 water use efficiency has also been defined as the rate of carbon uptake per unit of water lost 53 on the other hand within economic studies water use efficiency often refers to the effectiveness of applied irrigation e g 35 and the ratio of the minimum feasible water used to observed water usage associated with a given level of output while holding other inputs and technology constant 30 67 this study analyzes irrigation efficiency across the top agricultural counties in the u s the objectives are 1 to develop an analytical framework that measures irrigation water use efficiency iwue and technical efficiency te while accommodating heterogeneity across u s counties in weather patterns soil type topography and drainage 2 to analyze iwue and te in order to establish whether these components have improved or deteriorated over time and 3 to estimate shadow prices for irrigation water in order to provide market signals as to the value of the resource as well as the corresponding savings that would accrue from raising iwue understanding the role that improvements in efficiency can have in enhancing irrigation water productivity is an important area of research and one that can provide useful information to stakeholders the results from this study will add to the existing knowledge on water use efficiency and will provide insights for public policies that are compatible with conservation and enhanced productivity the rest of the study is organized as follows the next section presents the analytical framework as well as the methodology that is used to analyze iwue and te section 3 presents the data that is used for the analysis section 4 presents the results and finally section 5 concludes and provides some suggestions for future research 2 irrigation water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency iwue is defined in the literature as the ratio of the minimum feasible requirement to observed water usage associated with a given level of output while holding other inputs technology and the environment constant 30 iwue a non radial measure of the irrigation input makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which irrigation water applied can be reduced while holding output constant the received literature on iwue uses either non parametric approaches such as data envelopment analysis dea e g 33 52 or stochastic production frontiers spf e g 14 30 67 the aforementioned studies also combine traditional radial measures of output oriented technical efficiency that incorporate all inputs e g 1 37 alongside non radial input oriented approaches that isolate the technical efficiency measurement of a single input while holding other inputs constant e g 31 45 the problem with the dea approach is the strong assumption that variables involved in the production process are observed and measured without error this assumption seldom holds implying that dea estimators are likely to be inconsistent 41 in contrast stochastic production frontier studies that investigate iwue e g 30 usually adopt the following general formulation 1 y i f x i w i β exp v i u i where the variables y i x i and w i represent output a vector of conventional inputs and water use for firm i respectively furthermore v i and u i denote a two sided statistical error term and a one sided output oriented technical efficiency term respectively early studies on iwue made a key assumption that the technical efficiency term u i was itself a function of exogenous factors such that u i g z i δ η i where η i iid n 0 σ v 2 this assumption raised considerable econometric problems first if the variables associated with the technical inefficiency term u i were correlated with elements in the first step i e x i w i then the associated estimates generated in the first step were likely to be biased due to omission of relevant variables 32 22 moreover the assumption of identically distributed errors are contradicted by the functional relationship between u i and z i 32 60 hence the need to include the vector z in the deterministic component of equation 1 41 furthermore the aforementioned spf studies rely on conventional translog specifications the translog is a flexible functional form that incorporates squares and cross products of log inputs which affords flexibility but violates key properties of a regular technology notably inactivity strong disposability of outputs and inputs and output and input closedness see refs 40 42 a translog production function cannot satisfy these properties globally and its use inevitably leads to inconsistencies with production economic theory thus the cobb douglas specification becomes a desirable alternative because it satisfies key regularity conditions globally however the conventional cobb douglas has constant parameters thus imposing fixed partial elasticities of output across all data points which leads to identical te and iwue rankings 30 45 to circumvent these flexibility concerns we utilize a random parameters cobb douglas specification the underlying motivation for using a random parameters approach is the ability to account for technological and environmental heterogeneity 22 54 traditional stochastic frontier models assume that firms share similar production possibilities and differ only with respect to their levels of inefficiency 54 random parameters on the other hand relax this restrictive assumption thus accommodating heterogeneous responses of dmus to changes in the covariates 5 this approach also enables the derivation of non identical te and iwue rankings across observations while avoiding the theoretical shortcomings associated with the translog and other flexible functional forms 40 42 2 1 the random parameters stochastic production frontier rp spf we proceed by introducing i and t subscripts into the notation such that y i t characterizes output of firm i at time t we also introduce firm and time specific vectors of irrigation withdrawals x 1 i t other conventional inputs x m i t and weather effects and physical characteristics of the production environment z j i t taken together all regressors impact the production process however the weather effects and physical characteristics of the environment are never under the control of the producer 12 the random parameters stochastic production frontier or rp spf see ref 22 for the cobb douglas functional form can be expressed as 2 ln y i t k 1 k φ k h 1 h τ h t β 1 i t ln x 1 i t m 2 m β m i t ln x m i t j 1 j γ j i t ln z j i t v i t u i t we include a composed error structure that consists of the term v i t which captures statistical noise with distributional assumptions v n 0 σ v 2 and u i t which represents te with distributional parameters u n 0 σ u 2 in this model te is a radial output oriented measure equal to observed output divided by frontier or maximum output and incorporates all inputs i e x and z mentioned above we conjecture that heterogeneity in production technologies and characteristics of the production environment are reflected through the estimated random parameters β 1 i t β m i t γ j i t the original formulation of a random parameters regression model comes from ref 26 while the extension to stochastic frontier models is due to tsionas 54 and greene 22 the theoretical underpinning behind random parameters holds that continuous parameter variation address cross firm variation technical inefficiency and minimizes confounding due to heterogeneity 22 p 287 the general form of the random parameters β 1 β m and γ j is given as 22 3 β 1 β m γ j β 1 β m γ j δ β 1 β m γ j η i γ β 1 β m γ j s i where β 1 β m γ j are the mean vectors in the distributions for the random parameters δ β 1 β m γ j is a coefficient matrix which forms the observation specific term in the mean η i is a set of observed variables which do not vary over time and enter the means of the random parameters s i is an unobservable latent random term with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix σ finally γ β 1 β m γ j is a diagonal matrix which produces the covariance matrix of the random parameters 21 now we turn to iwue which is illustrated in fig 1 the inefficient representative dmu is initially producing output level q 0 using x 1 a units of irrigation water and x m units of a second input at point a the input oriented te is a radial measure equal to 0 b 0 a for the dmu in question the minimum feasible quantity of water needed to produce q 0 operating at point a holding x m constant is denoted by x 1 c therefore the maximum possible reduction in irrigation water is given as x 1 a x 1 c thus i w u e x 1 c x 1 a the quantity x 1 c is not observed however rewriting the latter expression for iwue we can get x 1 c i w u e x 1 a note that the firm producing at point c in fig 1 is on the frontier hence making it technically efficient thus substituting x 1 c with x 1 from equation 2 we obtain 4 ln y i t k 1 k φ k h 1 h τ h t β 1 i t ln x 1 i t c m 2 m β m i t ln x m i t j 1 j γ j i t ln z j i t v i t producing on the frontier implies that te is 1 or that u i t 0 by holding output and all other inputs constant one can obtain a non radial measure of irrigation water and thus establish the extent to which the quantity of irrigation water applied can be feasibly reduced subsequently a measure of iwue can be obtained by equating expressions 2 and 4 in order to obtain 5a β 1 i t l n x 1 i t u i t β 1 i t l n x 1 i t c 5b ln x 1 i t x 1 i t c u i t β 1 i t taking the antilogarithm of equation 5b we obtain a measure of iwue for each decision making unit i and time period t as 6 i w u e i t e x p u i t β 1 i t results from equation 6 will enable us to establish how efficient dmus are at using the minimal possible level of irrigation water to generate a given level of output the derived te and iwue estimates enable a dual ranking of dmus based on these two efficiency measures 3 data we use a panel of county level input output data drawn from the u s department of agriculture usda census of agriculture for the years 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 and 2012 for the top 350 agricultural counties in the country based on the market value of agricultural products sold in 2012 the 2012 vol entitled state and county rankings which is published alongside every census report is used to select the counties in the panel fig 2 illustrates the spatial location of the counties used in this analysis aggregation at the county level can be justified based on past research that finds evidence that u s agricultural producers behave collectively as if they were price taking and profit maximizing firms e g 63 output is measured as total agricultural revenue received inputs include agricultural land in acres livestock number of dairy cows beef cows hogs sheep horses poultry expressed in animal equivalents which is an approach that takes into account feed requirements for each animal type 70 value of machinery and equipment hired and contract labor expenditures on intermediate materials fertilizer chemicals electricity and total fuel used in gallons all monetary values are adjusted using price indexes constructed by the usda in order to get quantity indices in 2016 dollars 71 estimates of volumetric measures of irrigation water withdrawn at the county level come from data provided by the u s geological survey which are available for the years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 cubic spline interpolation methods are used to match the irrigation withdrawal data with the input output variables e g 66 subsequently the input output data is augmented with growing season contemporaneous temperature and precipitation information derived from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group the prism incorporates a climate mapping system to generate temperature and precipitation information at a 2 5 by 2 5 mile grid cells for the entire united states and accounts for the effects of elevation coastal proximity temperature inversions and terrain induced air mass blockage see refs 8 10 evidence from the crop yield literature indicates that temperature affects production in a nonlinear fashion e g 4 13 46 50 consequently we incorporate growing degree days into our model a variable that captures the accumulated exposure of crops to heat during the growing season between given upper and lower bounds 46 we construct estimates of growing degree days using daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the growing season i e april september for the predominant crop grown in each county based on total acreage as reported in the agricultural census moreover temperatures that exceed optimal thresholds are likely to impact crop development negatively 25 hence we incorporate in the model the number of days that temperatures exceeded the crop ambient level within the growing season we refer to this non linear measure as harmful degree days we also incorporate in the model measures of vapor pressure deficit vpd defined as the difference between the amount of moisture currently in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is completely saturated this captures the potential of the surrounding air to pull moisture from the foliage through transpiration 19 rising temperatures lead to higher levels of vpd between the saturated foliage and the ambient air which then leads to higher rates of evapotranspiration which is the amount of water that is lost from the leaf surface conversely when the air is fully saturated with humidity there is less transpiration leading to low vpd this condition limits the ability of the plant to take up essential minerals which may lead to mineral deficiencies and plant susceptibility to disease pathogens 19 high and low vpd may lead to reduced crop development and yields our specification of the weather effects is consistent with recent studies including roberts et al 46 finally it is important to point out that agricultural production is impacted by topography and soil characteristics therefore data obtained from soil surveys and published in the national resource inventory of the usda is incorporated into the model this data contains detailed information on the physical characteristics of the production environment such as measures of susceptibility to soil erosion k factor estimates of susceptibility to floods length of slope permeability fraction of land cover under clay and sand level of moisture capacity and soil salinity similar measures of soil characteristics have been utilized in various climate change studies e g 13 49 summary statistics of the variables incorporated in the rp spf are provided in table 1 4 results the rp spf model is estimated using simulated maximum likelihood methods with halton draws in nlogit version 6 the estimates for the random parameters are generated at the county level and for each time period in table 2 we report estimates of the means of the random parameters which comprise the conventional inputs i e land labor capital livestock intermediate materials and irrigation and the weather effects i e growing degree days harmful degree days maximum and minimum vapor pressure deficit spring and summer precipitation table 2 also presents the parameters treated as non random which correspond to the variables that measure the physical characteristics of the soil and the topography e g fraction of clay and sand permeability levels moisture capacity levels susceptibility to erosion salinity levels and length of slope as well as the state level fixed effects variables representing physical characteristics of the production environment usually remain fairly constant over time and treating such parameters as random would result in convergence problems as discussed earlier the irrigation variable is constructed using cubic spline interpolation methods 66 such construction raises the potential for errors in variables which occurs when one or more of the explanatory variables in a regression equation or system of equations are measured with error 20 errors in variables may lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates 21 a measure that has been proposed to assess the accuracy of the standard errors generated when the potential for errors in variables exists is the use of bootstrapping e g 2 we begin by estimating the vector of parameters in equation 1 θ ˆ β ˆ γ ˆ φ ˆ ρ ˆ τ ˆ σ ˆ u 2 σ ˆ v 2 and subsequently construct bootstrap confidence regions for the standard errors assuming that the ratio of error variances lies within a confidence interval λ λ 1 λ 2 a confidence band is constructed in order to generate confidence intervals for the standard errors see ref 2 results indicate a 90 confidence interval for all standard errors generated and a 95 confidence interval for all but 1 22 of standard errors generated the estimated coefficients for the conventional inputs i e β 1 i t and β m i t which represent partial elasticities of output are all statistically significant and satisfy regularity conditions they are all positively signed thus guaranteeing strong disposability in inputs secondly these partial elasticities have a magnitude between zero and one ensuring that the bordered hessian matrix is negative semi definite 1 1 a cobb douglas function f x i x j that is twice continuously differentiable is concave if f x i x i 0 and f x i x j 0 x i 0 x j 0 equation 2 above satisfies this property the hessian matrix of a concave function is negative semidefinite see ref 51 the sum of the means of the random parameters indicates that the estimated average elasticity of scale is 1 04 revealing slightly increasing returns the ratio σ u σ v λ is equal to 1 05 indicating that the variance of the one sided error component is slightly larger than the one for the two sided component the estimate of the mean of the random parameter for irrigation withdrawals β 1 i t indicates that ceteris paribus irrigation has a positive and statistically significant effect on output at the 5 level the coefficient estimates range between 0 010 and 0 025 revealing substantial heterogeneity across dmus and over time similarly the parameter estimates for the weather effects reveal significant variation across time and space we find that growing degree days and spring precipitation ceteris paribus have a positive and statistically significant effect on output at the 5 level and 1 level respectively conversely maximum vapor pressure deficit vpd and harmful degree days ceteris paribus have negative and statistically significant effects on output at the 5 and 10 levels respectively we provide illustrations of the kernel densities of the random parameters in the appendix results for the coefficient estimates of the land and soil features reveal that on average regions characterized by high clay content elevated moisture capacity levels salinity and permeability ceteris paribus are associated with higher agricultural output on the other hand regions characterized by soils susceptible to floods soil erosion k factor longer slopes and wetland areas ceteris paribus exhibit negative association with agricultural output in order to capture technical change and any unobserved heterogeneity we include time fixed as well as state level fixed effects as mentioned earlier iwue measures the minimum feasible quantity of water needed to generate a given level of output at the frontier 30 this measure requires estimating the maximal possible reduction in irrigation withdrawals while holding all other inputs constant our findings indicate that average iwue for all observations in the sample is 72 6 ranging from 38 1 to 95 2 on the other hand te scores average 83 6 with a range between 52 8 and 97 9 a graphical illustration of the kernel densities for iwue and te is depicted in fig 3 the spearman rank correlation coefficient between iwue and te is 0 95 with a t statistic 0 000 thus providing strong evidence that counties with high te scores generally tend to rank highly in iwue as well conversely counties with low te measures also tend to rank low on iwue estimates now we turn to the output effect and shadow values associated with irrigation water following karagiannis et al 30 we calculate the average shadow cost in terms of forgone output associated with a percentage reduction in irrigation this shadow cost is given by dividing the mean value for observed irrigation withdrawals reported in table 1 by the estimated mean of the random parameter for irrigation reported in table 2 thus for the average county holding all other inputs constant we find that a 1 reduction approx 1 14 million gallons day in irrigation withdrawals would result in 88 9 million in foregone output this in turn implies that the shadow price for the average county which is calculated as the shadow cost divided by a one percent unit of irrigation water used is approximately 77 5 per million gallons table 3 provides information on average te and iwue scores as well as average shadow prices by state between 1987 and 2012 an analysis of the mean distribution of the shadow prices for irrigation reveals that on average western states face substantially higher shadow prices for irrigation compared to their eastern counterparts these shadow prices range from a high of 191 29 per million gallons in california to a low of 0 30 per million gallons in new hampshire in addition western states on average exhibit higher te and iwue scores compared to eastern states these differences across states suggest that regulatory frameworks for agricultural water markets which are prevalent in western states e g 3 15 23 27 62 may contribute to dmus minimizing their irrigation withdrawals thus raising iwue moreover this finding appears to be consistent with other studies on irrigation water use in the united states which suggest that institutional arrangements and water pricing at state and local levels may be key in influencing agricultural production practices that are consistent with the efficient use of water resources and other inputs e g 47 62 as a point of reference according to the usda s farm and ranch irrigation survey fris in 2003 the average price paid by farmers nationwide was approximately 42 per acre foot 2 2 approximately one million gallons are required to cover 3 06 acre feet and ranged from 86 per acre foot in california to 5 in minnesota 23 in 2013 the average farmer paid 74 62 per acre foot and this price ranged from 132 51 per acre foot in california to 8 85 per acre foot in minnesota 58 5 concluding remarks the u s agricultural sector is a major consumer of water resources in this country accounting for approximately 115 000 million gallons per day in 2010 or 38 of total fresh water withdrawals increased climatic variability characterized by rising temperatures and frequent and intense droughts has exacerbated the need for secondary sources of water for agriculture this has raised concerns among policy makers and stakeholders alike on the efficiency of current irrigation practices this study highlights some of these concerns and illustrates how to evaluate efficiency of agricultural practices with special attention given to irrigation water the importance of irrigation across agricultural regions in the united states reflects a combination of factors including environmental conditions water availability cost of irrigation and the prevailing regulatory and statutory frameworks surrounding access to water 23 62 thus the objective of this study is to calculate and evaluate irrigation water use efficiency iwue across several counties in the united states iwue is defined in this study as the minimum feasible quantity of irrigation water needed to generate a specified level of output given the technology and production environment we also calculate technical efficiency te and analyze how it relates to iwue we use a random parameters stochastic production frontier while controlling for weather effects and physical characteristics of the production environment in order to generate distinct coefficient estimates for key variables used by each county in our data across every time period observed importantly using our coefficient estimates we are able to determine an upper bound for the shadow price of irrigation water for the average county which we establish to be approximately 77 5 per million gallons this approach enables us to account for cross county variations in production possibilities as well as heterogeneity in the production environments thus minimizing confounding in the interpretation of the inefficiency results our general findings reveal that the distribution of the elasticity of irrigation withdrawals varies widely across the counties in the panel and that irrigation withdrawals have a statistically significant impact on output in addition we find that iwue and te averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively our findings indicate a strong correlation between te and iwue thus efforts aimed at raising irrigation water use efficiency also raise farm level technical efficiency another important finding is the wide disparity of shadow prices for irrigation water across counties and states in the us an analysis of the mean distribution of shadow prices reveals that western states generally faces substantially higher shadow prices compared to their eastern counterparts western states are characterized by semi arid agro climatic conditions and thus rely heavily on irrigation for this reason institutional arrangements that regulate the supply of irrigation water for agricultural consumption have evolved over time across the western states 49 62 and may be a contributing factor for the relatively high iwue levels found western states also exhibited relatively high te estimates this finding is consistent with other studies on irrigation water use in the united states that indicate that institutional arrangements and water pricing at the state and local levels may be key in influencing agricultural production practices that are consistent with the efficient use of scarce water resources e g 47 62 these results should provide policy makers with useful insights on how to formulate policies that are compatible with conservation and the promotion of efficient water use key of which is establishing institutional arrangements that regulate the supply and consumption of irrigation water by generating rankings of iwue policymakers can develop measures that can target specific dmus counties in our case in meeting efficiency targets in addition by establishing specific iwue measures one can determine the average savings that be accrued by operating at efficient levels acknowledgements this study was support by the national institute of food and agriculture grant

8716,impacts of alien marine species on ecosystem services have been documented in numerous studies but estimates of the costs with explicit quantification of the impact channels are lacking we calculated the costs of the invasive worm marenzelleria in the baltic sea which affects the capacity of the seabed to store nutrients by combining the production function and replacement cost methods the nutrient storage capacity is then regarded as an input to nutrient cleaning of the sea with reduced capacity implying higher costs of reaching nutrient reduction targets we developed a simple dynamic model which captured the effect of marenzelleria on the decay rates of nutrient pools in different interconnected sea basins of the baltic sea evidence and numerical estimates indicated a decrease in sequestration of phosphorus in the different sea basins caused by occurrence of the invasive worm the total discounted cost of this decrease was estimated for two different international nutrient policy scenarios cost effective abatement and current international agreement on country targets the results showed large differences in total abatement costs between these scenarios but the calculated cost of the species were similar the estimated cost ranged between 290 and 1094 billion sek depending on the effect of marenzelleria on sequestration of phosphorus the average annual cost corresponds to 0 03 0 13 of total gross domestic product of the nine coastal countries however the cost was unevenly distributed among the countries with poland bearing the largest share because of its large phosphorus loads and access to low cost abatement options keywords invasive species marenzelleria costs nutrient regulation eutrophication dynamic cost effectiveness country targets baltic sea jel q250 q280 q530 1 introduction the polychaete genus marenzelleria mesnil is listed as a target alien species of special concern in the action plan against invasive species in the baltic sea because of its impacts on nutrient recycling and thereby eutrophication status in the sea 25 eutrophication causes oxygen depletion increased frequency in harmful algal blooms and changes in the composition of fish species similar to many aquatic invasive species the main vector of introduction of marenzelleria spp from here on referred to as marenzelleria is exchange of ballast water in international shipping 4 in order to prevent such dispersal of alien species the international maritime organization adopted the international ballast water management convention 27 which is implemented in the baltic sea region however as shown by bachér and albrecht 3 the cost of complying with the convention can be high and correspond to an investment cost of 70 msek vessel for ships in international traffic entering ports in finland if successful the implementation of the convention will create values from reduction in the current number of 15 introductions per year into the baltic sea 25 one challenge when assessing such values is that many alien aquatic species affect supporting and regulating services such as ocean nourishment and climate regulation of the sea e g ref 30 despite numerous studies on the calculation of costs of invasive species 1 2 12 15 23 32 35 42 there are very few studies addressing impacts on regulating or supporting services e g refs 2 30 estimating the costs of such impacts is usually difficult since it requires numerical modelling of impacts on the ecosystem and associated provision of several types of ecosystem services and measurement of these services in monetary terms the aim of this study was to examine how a combination of two methods for valuing regulating and supporting ecosystem services the production function and the replacement cost methods can be used for calculating the economic impacts of an invasive species the choice of marenzelleria in the baltic sea was made because of the availability of necessary data and numerical model use of the production function in the present case involved regarding the sea s storage of nutrients as an input for regulating nutrient loads into the sea the replacement cost method was used to estimate the economic effects of changes in such self cleaning ability as associated changes in the cost of reaching nutrient targets the advantage of this combined method is that it does not need quantified information on the interaction of effects among several ecosystem services and their value in monetary terms to the best of our knowledge no previous study has used a combination of production function and replacement cost methods for estimating the cost of an invasive species instead the costs have been estimated as damages to facilities such as the clogging of drain pipes by zebra mussels in the great lakes 16 and loss of property values 26 35 the production function method has been applied previously in estimating the cost of invasions of aquatic system as impacts on the stock and recruitment of commercial fish e g ref 33 another commonly applied method is to use the expenses of combatting the spread and damage of invasive species such as the cost to public authorities of harvesting an invasive aquatic weed or vaccination of salmon against furunculosis caused by invasive bacteria 18 the idea is that such costs would not be borne by the authority unless they are covered by the avoided costs of the invasive species however the replacement cost method has been widely applied in valuation of regulating and supporting ecosystem services such as nutrient retention by wetlands and coastal zones and carbon sequestration by forests e g refs 9 11 one reason for the lack of application to invasive species affecting such services can be the requirement for relevant environmental targets data and numerical models of the impact of the species on a regulating or supporting ecosystem service of relevance for achievement of the targets and information on the cost of measures for reducing the pollutant loads the paper is organised as follows first we present the theoretical framework for determining impact of the worm the model also gives the structure of the numerical dynamic model which is used to identify possible economic effects of the presence of marenzelleria next data are briefly described and the results are presented in section 4 the paper ends with a summary and tentative conclusions 2 theoretical framework this study estimated the economic impacts of marenzelleria through its effect on nutrient storage in the seabed and the associated costs of reaching international agreements for mitigating eutrophication in the baltic sea in northern europe which contains the largest hypoxic zones in the world 14 international agreements for the baltic sea have been established for future achievement of reductions in nutrient loads and the most stringent targets in these have been set for phosphorus loads which need to be reduced by at least 50 24 data are available on the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus dynamics but not on nitrogen dynamics therefore we calculated the minimum cost of reaching phosphorus targets in the baltic sea with and without marenzelleria to this end we constructed a discrete dynamic optimisation model that accounted for differences in the decay rate i e the rate at which a certain amount of phosphorus is decomposed between sea basins the production function approach assigns a value to an ecosystem service as in input into production of other ecosystem services marketed and or non marketed 32 33 in our case marenzelleria affects the sequestration of nutrients in marine sediments which implies that the fraction of a given pool of phosphorus in the sea that is buried in the sea bed can be changed the burial of phosphorus in the sediments is regarded as a self cleaning service since this part of the pool does not contribute to eutrophication thus the presence of marenzelleria will affect the self cleaning of phosphorus however the impacts of marenzelleria on the sea bed s burial of phosphorus are relatively poorly understood but the effects will probably differ between the marine basins of the baltic sea because of differences in sediment and oceanographic conditions we therefore assume that in all marine basins the presence of the species affects the decay rate of phosphorus pools from one period to another that is the fraction of a given phosphorus pool that is buried in the sediments during the period and is not available at the beginning of the next period we assigned a simple relationship between the quantity of the species in a specific time t and marine basin i m t i where i 1 m basins and the decay rate of phosphorus which is written as d i m t i the carry over rate of the stock or pool of phosphorus in period t to the next period is then 1 d i m t i the impact of a marginal increase in m t i i e d i m t i is assumed to be negative in addition to the inherited phosphorus pool each marine basin receives phosphorus from the activities in each country in the catchment agriculture industry households in every period which we denote y t i n where n 1 h countries and from transports from other marine basins following the literature on transboundary pollutant it is assumed that the flows between basins can be described by a matrix consisting of the coefficients c i j p i j p i which show the share of phosphorus pool in marine basin i that is transported to basin j e g refs 20 36 the pool of phosphorus in period t 1 in each marine basin p t 1 i is then described as a linear function of the stock in an earlier period and phosphorus load according to 1 p t 1 i c i i 1 d i m t i p t i n y t i n j j i c j i p t j for i 1 m p 0 i p i the replacement cost method assigns a value or a cost to a species only if this species affects the abatement costs of reaching specified environmental targets this target can be determined by political decisions which is the case with the phosphorus targets for the baltic sea which are set by the helcom baltic sea action plan bsap 24 an alternative strategy would be to base target setting on the balancing of costs and benefits of nutrient pool reduction choice of decision context will affect the calculated costs of the invasive species because of lack of data on benefits of nutrient pool reductions in the sea we assume that the bsap targets on phosphorus pools in each marine basin are fixed and should be achieved at the latest in year t which is written as 2 τ j c j i 1 d i m t i t t 1 n y t i n p 0 j p t i for i 1 m where the expression for p t i at the left hand side of equation 2 is obtained from solving the integral in equation 1 in order to identify the impact on the costs of reaching these targets in the presence of marenzelleria we need to identify abatement options and their costs in this study abatement a t i n affects load from a country to a basin y t i n y i n b a u a t i n where y i n b a u is business as usual bau load a simplification was made by assuming one abatement cost function for each country despite the many abatement options and associated costs in each country e g refs 20 22 it was then assumed that costs for different abatement levels are minimized in each country and the cost function c i n a t i n is assumed to be increasing and non concave in a t i n furthermore we assigned restrictions to the abatement capacity in each country and period of time i a t i n a n these were imposed to avoid drastic structural changes in the sectors analysis of which would require a general equilibrium framework the costs of reaching the targets are determined by the policy for their implementation in general cost effective solutions can be generated by economic instruments such as an international pollutant charge or trading generate e g 5 however the actual bsap agreement applies a command and control system with country targets 24 which is well known to result in higher total abatement costs unless the allocation of abatement in time and among countries coincide with the cost effective solution 5 it is less clear if and how the cost of marenzelleria differs between the two policy regimes to examine this two decision problems were formulated minimization of total cost for reaching overall phosphorus pool targets and minimisation of costs for each country given a restriction on annual phosphorus load the decision rule under the cost effective system is then formulated as 3 m i n t t i n c i n a t i n ρ t a t i n s t 2 where ρ t 1 1 r t is the discount factor with r as the discount rate the other decision problem context is used in practice for regulating nutrient loads to the baltic sea where targets on nutrient loads to the sea are imposed for each country 23 these load targets are supposed to reach the maximum pool targets in equation 2 the bsap sets constant emission targets for each country in each period y n each country then minimizes abatement cost for reaching the targets which is written as 4 m i n t t i c i n a t i n ρ t a t i n s t i y t i n b a u a t i n y n f o r t 1 t where y n is the restriction on maximum phosphorus load for each country which are assumed to be constant over time as suggested by ref 23 common to both decision problems is that the impact of marenzelleria on total abatement costs is determined through the effects on the pool constraint in eq 2 lower decay rates created by the species create needs for more abatement in order to maintain p t as shown in appendix a the size of the cost of marenzelleria under both decision problems is determined by 1 timing of the introduction of marenzelleria early introduction results in high cost because of the longer period in which the effects of the species persist 2 closeness openness of the affected marine basin the effect of the species in the original basin is relatively large for a high c i i but the dispersal effects to other basins are then relatively small 3 level of decay rate d i m t i a relatively low decay rate and associated high carry over rate raises total abatement cost of achieving the target and hence the marginal cost impact of the species 4 abatement costs the cost of marenzelleria is high when abatement costs are large because of the higher cost of abatement compensating for the lower decay rate 5 discount rate total abatement costs in present terms for achieving the nutrient targets are lower for a high discount rate because of the discounting of future abatement costs which implies a lower cost of marenzelleria 3 description of data the numerical application of the model presented in section 2 rests on two main studies data on the impact of marenzelleria on phosphorus cycling taken from biophysical modelling using gis geographical information systems in a study by nyström sandman 40 and data on nutrient loads pools and decay rates in each marine basin and dispersal among basins taken from gren et al 20 the spatial division of the baltic sea and its catchment is based on existing oceanographic models which divide the baltic sea into seven sea marine basins e g ref 43 these basins are delineated by differences in e g depth and currents see figure b1 in appendix for the purpose of matching data on the cost of different abatement measures with nutrient transport into different sea basins the entire baltic sea drainage basin with its nine countries with coastal zones to the sea was divided here into 24 drainage basins see figure b1 in the appendix 3 1 calculation of the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus fluxes marenzelleria was introduced into the baltic sea in the mid 1980 s 7 and has since then become a significant component of benthic faunal communities across the whole baltic sea 45 currently three species of marenzelleria are known to be present in the baltic sea and these have separate ecological niches as they bioturbate the sediment in different ways 41 it is currently largely unclear what role marenzelleria itself plays as a prey species in the baltic sea food web but it is known that old deposited organic material is an important food source 29 marenzelleria burrows much deeper than native deposit feeding fauna and can thereby access organic material which is unavailable to native species 34 leading to decreased deposition rates in addition experimental and field studies using stable isotopes have shown that marenzelleria increases the community resource use efficiency for deposited organic matter i e a higher fraction of the nutrients in the organic matter is recycled 28 29 further reducing organic matter deposition marenzelleria can also increase the release of organic contaminants from sediments 16 at present there is a lack of field and model studies considering the effects of marenzelleria on relevant spatial and temporal scales however a study by norkko 38 has shown that the effects of marenzelleria on phosphorus cycling are also potentially very relevant at local regional scale data on the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus fluxes were taken from nyström sandman et al 40 and the calculations comprised two steps first the distribution and density of marenzelleria in the baltic sea were mapped based on samples from the sea bottom approximately 8960 samples which provided information on biomass of marenzelleria measured as g m2 and on salinity sight depth seabed topology and other environmental variables a random forest model 8 of marenzelleria biomass based on relationships to these environmental variables was then used to predict marenzelleria biomass across the whole baltic sea at 200 m horizontal grid cell resolution 25 second the relationship between the density of marenzelleria and phosphorus flux between sediment and water was estimated by combining the data on the species obtained in the first step with data from field measurements on phosphorus fluxes in intact sediment cores 39 or with simulated data from norkko et al 38 the change in phosphorus flux per grid cell and year was then calculated using gis modelling known areas of permanent hypoxia were masked from the analysis as marenzelleria cannot live there an important assumption was that the effects on sediment fluxes in sandy sediments sediment type according to eu seamap was half that from muddy sediments it was further assumed that the modelled density of marenzelleria was constant until the target year of 2081 see section 3 2 as marenzelleria biomass densities have been relatively stable for several years on baltic sea level the results for the measured and simulated data are presented in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the estimated increases in phosphorus fluxes in the presence of marenzelleria were lower when simulated data were used instead of field data in order to calculate the effects on costs we compared the reductions in flux with phosphorus sequestration unaffected by the species which was based on data on the initial phosphorus stocks and decay rates in the different basins table 2 the new decay rates as affected by marenzelleria were then calculated by subtracting the increase in fluxes shown in table 1 from the initial sequestration presented in the third column in table 2 and dividing by the initial phosphorus stocks shown in the first column in table 2 the results are presented in the two last columns in table 2 the largest relative effect for both types of data was obtained for the bothnian sea where the sediment can become a source of phosphorus the smallest relative effect was obtained for the baltic proper where the decay rate could be reduced by a maximum of 15 i e from 0 041 to 0 035 however as discussed in subsequent sections this decrease had a large impact on the cost of meeting the helcom bsap 23 nutrient targets because of the stringent phosphorus target for the baltic proper 3 2 phosphorus transports and targets data on bau phosphorus loads from different emissions sources and drainage basins into marine basins and of transport coefficients between marine basins were taken from gren et al 20 the emissions sources included in each drainage basin are agriculture industry and sewage treatment plants the bau loads to the coastal waters of the baltic sea are measured in biologically available fractions that affect eutrophication poland is the largest contributor of phosphorus accounting for 39 of the total phosphorus load table 3 data on the maximum levels of nutrient stocks and time for the achievement of reductions i e p t i in section 2 were calculated from the most recent intergovernmental agreement on nutrient load targets for each country presented in the eutrophication segment of the bsap 23 this agreement applies the so called ecosystem approach where targets on nutrient loads to each marine basin are determined by the ecological conditions in the basins the agreement thus derives country targets which are assumed to reach maximum phosphorus pools in three of the seven basins baltic proper gulf of finland and gulf of riga however neither the maximum pools nor the timing of their achievements are specified in ref 23 with respect to the time for achieving the target we follow gren et al 20 and chose a time perspective of 60 years from a start year of 2021 when the implementation actions are supposed to start the targets are then calculated as the pools obtained in the marine basins from introduction country targets in year 1 table 3 the baltic proper receives the largest share 53 of the total load and has to meet the most stringent calculated target with a requirement of 60 reduction in the initial phosphorus pool the role of polish abatement then becomes important since it discharges 73 of the total load into the baltic proper the basin is also relatively open with approximately 55 of its load originating from other basins 20 see table a5 phosphorus reductions to other marine basins may thus be needed in order to meet the target for the baltic proper similarly since the baltic proper receives about half of its total phosphorus load from its own catchment which is transported to other marine basins reductions can be needed in this basin to achieve the targets for the gulf of finland and the gulf of riga 3 3 abatement costs and discount rate abatement cost functions for each country were taken from gren 17 who estimated the functions by generating data on the minimum cost of reaching different levels of phosphorus reduction from the bau level the numerical model calculating cost effective solutions considered for each country 11 abatement measures within agriculture industry and sewage treatment plants most of the abatement measures were directed towards agriculture since this is the main source of phosphorus loads the measures included for this sector were reductions in use of fertiliser livestock holdings cattle pigs and chickens changed spreading time of manure from autumn to spring cultivation of energy forest and catch crops and construction of wetlands in total 500 observations were generated for each country and regression analyses were carried out with abatement cost as the dependent variable and phosphorus reduction as the independent variable all costs were expressed in 2015 prices finally we need to choose the level of the social discount rate on which there is a large body of literature see e g ref 44 because of the different levels of economic prosperity and consumption preferences it is quite likely that the discount rate differs between the baltic sea countries for time periods exceeding 50 years a hyperbolic i e time declining discount rate is often suggested a simplification was made in this study by assigning a uniform discount rate to all countries and periods and the calculations of cost effective solutions were made for a relatively low level of the discount rate 0 015 e g ref 37 impacts on the cost of marenzelleria of a higher discount rate are discussed in section 4 4 results the numerical dynamic model was solved using the gams conopt2 solver 10 which gave the optimal allocation of abatement and associated costs in different drainage basins and time periods the minimum costs with marenzelleria were calculated under the assumption that the species entered the marine basins as specified in table 1 in time period t 0 it also turned out that the achievement of the phosphorus target in the baltic proper implied fulfilment of targets for the other basins because of the high reduction requirement in this basin the calculated minimum cost of reaching the bsap targets without marenzelleria amounted to 1268 billion sek 1 euro sek 9 35 on average for 2015 this represented an annual average discounted cost of 21 3 billion sek which is close to the value obtained by gren et al 19 total gross domestic product gdp of the countries in the baltic sea catchment amounted to approximately 14170 billion sek in 2015 prices 21 table 1 which means that the average annual abatement cost in the reference case corresponded to approximately 0 15 of gdp as expected the cost increased when country targets were imposed and amounted to 2483 billion sek or 0 29 of total gdp the reasons for this increase in costs are the spatial and dynamic divergences in abatement from the cost effective solution the abatement costs under the country targets regime exceed the cost effective solution for all countries but estonia and latvia table b1 the main reason for the larger cost is the constant annual country target whereas the cost effective solution generates delayed abatement because of the discount rate and self cleaning capacity in the baltic proper despite the considerable difference in levels of abatement costs between the cost effective and country target regimes the cost of marenzelleria is similar under the two regimes for the two measurements of impacts table 4 when calculating costs of the species introduction under the emission standard system it is assumed that the necessary proportional increase in abatement requirements to maintain the targets is the same for all countries and years for both policy regimes the cost of the species is lowest with simulated data since these data show lower impact on the decay rate than the field data we can also note that the lowest cost with field data is almost the same as the highest cost with simulated date under both policy regimes the reason is that the highest decay rate in baltic proper with field data is the same as the lowest decay rate for simulated data table 2 the largest cost is found for the cost effective regime under which the presence of marenzelleria increased the total abatement cost by at most 1094 billion sek or 86 from the reference case without the species in spite of similarities in total costs of marenzelleria the optimal abatement paths under cost effective solutions and country targets are quite different in the reference case and with the species impact fig 1 in the reference case the cost effective abatements starts with 1 6 kton in the first year and increases to 25 kton in the final year which can be compared with the country targets which total to 15 6 kton every year in the cost effective solution the impact of marenzelleria implies an increase in annual abatement in particular in the middle years where for example abatement is doubled in year 30 with field data measurement but reaches almost the same level as in the reference case in the final year when country targets are imposed abatement requirements are increased by 16 for all countries which gives a total abatement of 18 1 ton phosphorus each year however the cost of marenzelleria for both policy regimes and data measurements was unevenly distributed among the countries bordering the baltic sea fig 2 in general countries with relatively low abatement costs poland latvia lithuania russia face lower cost of marenzelleria under country targets than in the cost effective solution and the opposite is the case for high cost countries sweden denmark finland germany in the cost effective regime the increased costs created by the need for more abatement were borne by countries with relatively large abatement capacity and low cost abatement measures available under a country target regime the countries face the same proportional increase in abatement and the associated cost increase depends on the initial target and the shape of the marginal abatement cost function a relatively high initial abatement requirement and steep marginal cost curve then explains the high cost in relation to the cost under a cost effective policy in particular for germany irrespective of policy regime poland is the largest emitter of phosphorus to the baltic proper and faces the largest costs of marenzelleria in addition to policy regime and method for estimating impacts on the phosphorus decay rate the cost of marenzelleria depends on several exogenous parameter values in our dynamic model these include the timing of entry of the species into the baltic proper choice of discount rate and abatement costs at emission sources with respect to entry of the species the calculations were based on the current incidence of the species in the basins a delayed entrance of the species with 10 years would reduce the cost of marenzelleria by 12 an increase in the discount rate from 0 015 to 0 02 reduces cost of the species by approximately 15 without technological development abatement costs are likely to increase in the future because of economic growth in the countries raising the costs of several abatement measures however considering the long term perspective technological improvements are likely to be made which reduce abatement costs on the other hand future changes in the nutrient targets may be necessary because of climate change and or unexpected responses in the sea to changes in nutrient loads 5 discussion and conclusions the main purpose of this paper was to calculate the cost of the invasive species marenzelleria in the baltic sea this cost arises from the impact of the species on phosphorus sequestration in the seabed sediment this impact affects the dynamics of phosphorus cycling which in turn determines the need for costly phosphorus load reductions in order to achieve predetermined targets for mitigating damages from eutrophication the costs were therefore calculated as the change in total abatement costs for achieving specific maximum pools of phosphorus in the baltic sea which differ for its different basins to this end we constructed a numerical dynamic optimisation model that accounts for interlinked sea basins which differ with respect to nutrient dynamics and eutrophication status costs under two types of policy regimes were considered a cost effective achievement of the target and the country targets determined by the international governmental agreement the analytical results showed that under both policy regimes the cost of marenzelleria depends on its effect on the decay rate of phosphorus pools in the sea basins the stringency of phosphorus targets connectivity among sea basins discount rate and the cost of abatement measures our empirical results for the current incidence of marenzelleria in different sea basins showed that the effect on the decay rate differed among and within these basins it emerged that marenzelleria creates costs in only one sea basin the baltic proper the reason is the relatively low decay rate large phosphorus pool and largest phosphorus reduction target set by helcom 22 despite the large differences in total abatement costs between the two policy regimes the calculated costs were quite similar and ranged between 290 billion sek and 1094 billion sek or between 4 8 billion sek year and 18 2 billion sek year which corresponds to a maximum of approximately 0 13 of total gdp in the baltic sea catchment a feature common to all estimates was uneven distribution of the costs of marenzelleria among the baltic sea countries the largest cost was borne by poland which accounts for 73 of the phosphorus loads to the baltic proper and has access to low cost abatement options the results rest on several assumptions including deterministic conditions without technological change the long term perspective would also require consideration of uncertainty with respect to e g technological development and climate change in our approach uncertainty was treated in a simple way by testing changes in exogenous parameter values the inclusion of uncertainty in the decision problem is likely to raise costs for a society wishing to obtain nutrient targets with some degree of certainty this can also raise the cost of marenzelleria a factor not included in this analysis was fairness with respect to allocation of the cost burden among countries which is likely to be highly important for implementing any international agreement e g refs 6 13 the results in all scenarios in this study showed that one country poland would bear the largest cost burden for marenzelleria this is explained by the size of poland with respect to load of nutrients the stringent target for the baltic proper and the slow dynamics of this basin as demonstrated in a static context by gren and destouni 19 this means an unfair allocation of costs when using fairness criteria such as costs per capita or costs related to the total economic outputs an important assumption was that necessary increases in abatement are implemented to compensate for the reduction in the sea s self cleaning capacity created by marenzelleria if policies are not changed and remain the same as if marenzelleria had no impact on the decay rate the cost would be unaffected but the target would not have been reached instead of the required 60 reduction of phosphorus in the baltic proper the decrease would be 47 and 49 in the cost effective and country target regime respectively the net loss to the baltic sea society of this excess pool depends on the value of the associated decline in ecological conditions if there had been an optimal weighting of values and costs of nutrient reduction underlying the decision on the phosphorus pool targets the reduction in benefits would be higher than the decrease in cost although our empirical application of a combination of production and replacement cost methods for valuing ecosystem services did not consider uncertainty or fairness in the decision problem the method as such is not limited with respect to these aspects different types of uncertainty can be introduced in a cost effectiveness framework e g as chance constrained programming or in a mean variance framework e g ref 17 fairness can also be accounted for as e g constraints in the decision problem and benefits from nutrient reductions can be introduced in the objective function e g ref 31 given our assumptions and estimates of a cost of marenzerellia of at least 4 8 billion sek per year quite another type of issue is if this would call for mitigation actions the response requires some estimates of costs and effects of mitigation measures similar to several other aquatic invasive species once introduced it is very difficult to reduce the abundance of marenzelleria furthermore it has already colonised the whole baltic sea region our analysis and suggested methods can then be applied to the prevention of other species introduced by ballast water exchange estimation of costs of preventing other species would require assessments of costs of alternative ways of reducing exchange of ballast water in the baltic sea such as exchange of ballast water before entering the sea in skagerack exchange in ports or installation of cleaning technologies further the impact of improved management of ballast water on the cost of introductions of all alien species has to be determined this was beyond the scope of this paper and to the best of our knowledge has not been made in any other study even if it would be possible to obtain the cost of mitigating aquatic invasive species these costs should be compared with the associated benefits from prevention of introduction of all species several of these species affect the ecological functioning and nutrient recycling of the baltic sea such as the fishhook waterflea cergopagis pengoi and the sea walnut mnemiopsis leidyi 25 the combined method suggested in this paper for estimating costs of marenzelleria would then be useful for estimates of benefits from preventing other aquatic species into the sea acknowledgements we are much indebted to the swedish environmental protection agency for funding the project value of underwater habitat ecosystem services values with grant number 13 132 appendix a in the cost effective solution the determinants of the economic impact of marenzelleria were derived from the first order conditions for an optimal solution to 3 these conditions were obtained by constructing the lagrange expression which is written as a1 l t i n ρ t c i n a t i n λ t i p t i p t i γ t n a n i a t i n where λ t i 0 are the lagrange multipliers of the restrictions on phosphorus stocks in the marine basins and are the multipliers of the abatement capacity constraints the necessary conditions for minimising costs in eq a1 subject to eq 2 are written as a2 ρ t c i n a t i n τ j λ t j 1 d j m t j t

words the term on the left hand must be equal to the sum of marginal impacts on the sea basins weighted by the lagrange multipliers plus the marginal cost of the capacity constraint in order to show the impact of m t i on the cost effective solution we apply the implicit function theorem on a2 and solve for a t i n m t i this is positive when abatement of phosphorus and hence abatement cost increases and vice versa in order to obtain a tractable solution we assume that the pool target is binding for only one basin and an interior solution where γ t g 0 the expression then becomes a5 a t

as a7 ρ t c i n a t i n β t n γ t n f o r t 0 t 1 n 1 h from which we see that the abatement costs are affected through the impact on the shadow cost β t n of the country target this is in turn

8716,impacts of alien marine species on ecosystem services have been documented in numerous studies but estimates of the costs with explicit quantification of the impact channels are lacking we calculated the costs of the invasive worm marenzelleria in the baltic sea which affects the capacity of the seabed to store nutrients by combining the production function and replacement cost methods the nutrient storage capacity is then regarded as an input to nutrient cleaning of the sea with reduced capacity implying higher costs of reaching nutrient reduction targets we developed a simple dynamic model which captured the effect of marenzelleria on the decay rates of nutrient pools in different interconnected sea basins of the baltic sea evidence and numerical estimates indicated a decrease in sequestration of phosphorus in the different sea basins caused by occurrence of the invasive worm the total discounted cost of this decrease was estimated for two different international nutrient policy scenarios cost effective abatement and current international agreement on country targets the results showed large differences in total abatement costs between these scenarios but the calculated cost of the species were similar the estimated cost ranged between 290 and 1094 billion sek depending on the effect of marenzelleria on sequestration of phosphorus the average annual cost corresponds to 0 03 0 13 of total gross domestic product of the nine coastal countries however the cost was unevenly distributed among the countries with poland bearing the largest share because of its large phosphorus loads and access to low cost abatement options keywords invasive species marenzelleria costs nutrient regulation eutrophication dynamic cost effectiveness country targets baltic sea jel q250 q280 q530 1 introduction the polychaete genus marenzelleria mesnil is listed as a target alien species of special concern in the action plan against invasive species in the baltic sea because of its impacts on nutrient recycling and thereby eutrophication status in the sea 25 eutrophication causes oxygen depletion increased frequency in harmful algal blooms and changes in the composition of fish species similar to many aquatic invasive species the main vector of introduction of marenzelleria spp from here on referred to as marenzelleria is exchange of ballast water in international shipping 4 in order to prevent such dispersal of alien species the international maritime organization adopted the international ballast water management convention 27 which is implemented in the baltic sea region however as shown by bachér and albrecht 3 the cost of complying with the convention can be high and correspond to an investment cost of 70 msek vessel for ships in international traffic entering ports in finland if successful the implementation of the convention will create values from reduction in the current number of 15 introductions per year into the baltic sea 25 one challenge when assessing such values is that many alien aquatic species affect supporting and regulating services such as ocean nourishment and climate regulation of the sea e g ref 30 despite numerous studies on the calculation of costs of invasive species 1 2 12 15 23 32 35 42 there are very few studies addressing impacts on regulating or supporting services e g refs 2 30 estimating the costs of such impacts is usually difficult since it requires numerical modelling of impacts on the ecosystem and associated provision of several types of ecosystem services and measurement of these services in monetary terms the aim of this study was to examine how a combination of two methods for valuing regulating and supporting ecosystem services the production function and the replacement cost methods can be used for calculating the economic impacts of an invasive species the choice of marenzelleria in the baltic sea was made because of the availability of necessary data and numerical model use of the production function in the present case involved regarding the sea s storage of nutrients as an input for regulating nutrient loads into the sea the replacement cost method was used to estimate the economic effects of changes in such self cleaning ability as associated changes in the cost of reaching nutrient targets the advantage of this combined method is that it does not need quantified information on the interaction of effects among several ecosystem services and their value in monetary terms to the best of our knowledge no previous study has used a combination of production function and replacement cost methods for estimating the cost of an invasive species instead the costs have been estimated as damages to facilities such as the clogging of drain pipes by zebra mussels in the great lakes 16 and loss of property values 26 35 the production function method has been applied previously in estimating the cost of invasions of aquatic system as impacts on the stock and recruitment of commercial fish e g ref 33 another commonly applied method is to use the expenses of combatting the spread and damage of invasive species such as the cost to public authorities of harvesting an invasive aquatic weed or vaccination of salmon against furunculosis caused by invasive bacteria 18 the idea is that such costs would not be borne by the authority unless they are covered by the avoided costs of the invasive species however the replacement cost method has been widely applied in valuation of regulating and supporting ecosystem services such as nutrient retention by wetlands and coastal zones and carbon sequestration by forests e g refs 9 11 one reason for the lack of application to invasive species affecting such services can be the requirement for relevant environmental targets data and numerical models of the impact of the species on a regulating or supporting ecosystem service of relevance for achievement of the targets and information on the cost of measures for reducing the pollutant loads the paper is organised as follows first we present the theoretical framework for determining impact of the worm the model also gives the structure of the numerical dynamic model which is used to identify possible economic effects of the presence of marenzelleria next data are briefly described and the results are presented in section 4 the paper ends with a summary and tentative conclusions 2 theoretical framework this study estimated the economic impacts of marenzelleria through its effect on nutrient storage in the seabed and the associated costs of reaching international agreements for mitigating eutrophication in the baltic sea in northern europe which contains the largest hypoxic zones in the world 14 international agreements for the baltic sea have been established for future achievement of reductions in nutrient loads and the most stringent targets in these have been set for phosphorus loads which need to be reduced by at least 50 24 data are available on the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus dynamics but not on nitrogen dynamics therefore we calculated the minimum cost of reaching phosphorus targets in the baltic sea with and without marenzelleria to this end we constructed a discrete dynamic optimisation model that accounted for differences in the decay rate i e the rate at which a certain amount of phosphorus is decomposed between sea basins the production function approach assigns a value to an ecosystem service as in input into production of other ecosystem services marketed and or non marketed 32 33 in our case marenzelleria affects the sequestration of nutrients in marine sediments which implies that the fraction of a given pool of phosphorus in the sea that is buried in the sea bed can be changed the burial of phosphorus in the sediments is regarded as a self cleaning service since this part of the pool does not contribute to eutrophication thus the presence of marenzelleria will affect the self cleaning of phosphorus however the impacts of marenzelleria on the sea bed s burial of phosphorus are relatively poorly understood but the effects will probably differ between the marine basins of the baltic sea because of differences in sediment and oceanographic conditions we therefore assume that in all marine basins the presence of the species affects the decay rate of phosphorus pools from one period to another that is the fraction of a given phosphorus pool that is buried in the sediments during the period and is not available at the beginning of the next period we assigned a simple relationship between the quantity of the species in a specific time t and marine basin i m t i where i 1 m basins and the decay rate of phosphorus which is written as d i m t i the carry over rate of the stock or pool of phosphorus in period t to the next period is then 1 d i m t i the impact of a marginal increase in m t i i e d i m t i is assumed to be negative in addition to the inherited phosphorus pool each marine basin receives phosphorus from the activities in each country in the catchment agriculture industry households in every period which we denote y t i n where n 1 h countries and from transports from other marine basins following the literature on transboundary pollutant it is assumed that the flows between basins can be described by a matrix consisting of the coefficients c i j p i j p i which show the share of phosphorus pool in marine basin i that is transported to basin j e g refs 20 36 the pool of phosphorus in period t 1 in each marine basin p t 1 i is then described as a linear function of the stock in an earlier period and phosphorus load according to 1 p t 1 i c i i 1 d i m t i p t i n y t i n j j i c j i p t j for i 1 m p 0 i p i the replacement cost method assigns a value or a cost to a species only if this species affects the abatement costs of reaching specified environmental targets this target can be determined by political decisions which is the case with the phosphorus targets for the baltic sea which are set by the helcom baltic sea action plan bsap 24 an alternative strategy would be to base target setting on the balancing of costs and benefits of nutrient pool reduction choice of decision context will affect the calculated costs of the invasive species because of lack of data on benefits of nutrient pool reductions in the sea we assume that the bsap targets on phosphorus pools in each marine basin are fixed and should be achieved at the latest in year t which is written as 2 τ j c j i 1 d i m t i t t 1 n y t i n p 0 j p t i for i 1 m where the expression for p t i at the left hand side of equation 2 is obtained from solving the integral in equation 1 in order to identify the impact on the costs of reaching these targets in the presence of marenzelleria we need to identify abatement options and their costs in this study abatement a t i n affects load from a country to a basin y t i n y i n b a u a t i n where y i n b a u is business as usual bau load a simplification was made by assuming one abatement cost function for each country despite the many abatement options and associated costs in each country e g refs 20 22 it was then assumed that costs for different abatement levels are minimized in each country and the cost function c i n a t i n is assumed to be increasing and non concave in a t i n furthermore we assigned restrictions to the abatement capacity in each country and period of time i a t i n a n these were imposed to avoid drastic structural changes in the sectors analysis of which would require a general equilibrium framework the costs of reaching the targets are determined by the policy for their implementation in general cost effective solutions can be generated by economic instruments such as an international pollutant charge or trading generate e g 5 however the actual bsap agreement applies a command and control system with country targets 24 which is well known to result in higher total abatement costs unless the allocation of abatement in time and among countries coincide with the cost effective solution 5 it is less clear if and how the cost of marenzelleria differs between the two policy regimes to examine this two decision problems were formulated minimization of total cost for reaching overall phosphorus pool targets and minimisation of costs for each country given a restriction on annual phosphorus load the decision rule under the cost effective system is then formulated as 3 m i n t t i n c i n a t i n ρ t a t i n s t 2 where ρ t 1 1 r t is the discount factor with r as the discount rate the other decision problem context is used in practice for regulating nutrient loads to the baltic sea where targets on nutrient loads to the sea are imposed for each country 23 these load targets are supposed to reach the maximum pool targets in equation 2 the bsap sets constant emission targets for each country in each period y n each country then minimizes abatement cost for reaching the targets which is written as 4 m i n t t i c i n a t i n ρ t a t i n s t i y t i n b a u a t i n y n f o r t 1 t where y n is the restriction on maximum phosphorus load for each country which are assumed to be constant over time as suggested by ref 23 common to both decision problems is that the impact of marenzelleria on total abatement costs is determined through the effects on the pool constraint in eq 2 lower decay rates created by the species create needs for more abatement in order to maintain p t as shown in appendix a the size of the cost of marenzelleria under both decision problems is determined by 1 timing of the introduction of marenzelleria early introduction results in high cost because of the longer period in which the effects of the species persist 2 closeness openness of the affected marine basin the effect of the species in the original basin is relatively large for a high c i i but the dispersal effects to other basins are then relatively small 3 level of decay rate d i m t i a relatively low decay rate and associated high carry over rate raises total abatement cost of achieving the target and hence the marginal cost impact of the species 4 abatement costs the cost of marenzelleria is high when abatement costs are large because of the higher cost of abatement compensating for the lower decay rate 5 discount rate total abatement costs in present terms for achieving the nutrient targets are lower for a high discount rate because of the discounting of future abatement costs which implies a lower cost of marenzelleria 3 description of data the numerical application of the model presented in section 2 rests on two main studies data on the impact of marenzelleria on phosphorus cycling taken from biophysical modelling using gis geographical information systems in a study by nyström sandman 40 and data on nutrient loads pools and decay rates in each marine basin and dispersal among basins taken from gren et al 20 the spatial division of the baltic sea and its catchment is based on existing oceanographic models which divide the baltic sea into seven sea marine basins e g ref 43 these basins are delineated by differences in e g depth and currents see figure b1 in appendix for the purpose of matching data on the cost of different abatement measures with nutrient transport into different sea basins the entire baltic sea drainage basin with its nine countries with coastal zones to the sea was divided here into 24 drainage basins see figure b1 in the appendix 3 1 calculation of the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus fluxes marenzelleria was introduced into the baltic sea in the mid 1980 s 7 and has since then become a significant component of benthic faunal communities across the whole baltic sea 45 currently three species of marenzelleria are known to be present in the baltic sea and these have separate ecological niches as they bioturbate the sediment in different ways 41 it is currently largely unclear what role marenzelleria itself plays as a prey species in the baltic sea food web but it is known that old deposited organic material is an important food source 29 marenzelleria burrows much deeper than native deposit feeding fauna and can thereby access organic material which is unavailable to native species 34 leading to decreased deposition rates in addition experimental and field studies using stable isotopes have shown that marenzelleria increases the community resource use efficiency for deposited organic matter i e a higher fraction of the nutrients in the organic matter is recycled 28 29 further reducing organic matter deposition marenzelleria can also increase the release of organic contaminants from sediments 16 at present there is a lack of field and model studies considering the effects of marenzelleria on relevant spatial and temporal scales however a study by norkko 38 has shown that the effects of marenzelleria on phosphorus cycling are also potentially very relevant at local regional scale data on the impacts of marenzelleria on phosphorus fluxes were taken from nyström sandman et al 40 and the calculations comprised two steps first the distribution and density of marenzelleria in the baltic sea were mapped based on samples from the sea bottom approximately 8960 samples which provided information on biomass of marenzelleria measured as g m2 and on salinity sight depth seabed topology and other environmental variables a random forest model 8 of marenzelleria biomass based on relationships to these environmental variables was then used to predict marenzelleria biomass across the whole baltic sea at 200 m horizontal grid cell resolution 25 second the relationship between the density of marenzelleria and phosphorus flux between sediment and water was estimated by combining the data on the species obtained in the first step with data from field measurements on phosphorus fluxes in intact sediment cores 39 or with simulated data from norkko et al 38 the change in phosphorus flux per grid cell and year was then calculated using gis modelling known areas of permanent hypoxia were masked from the analysis as marenzelleria cannot live there an important assumption was that the effects on sediment fluxes in sandy sediments sediment type according to eu seamap was half that from muddy sediments it was further assumed that the modelled density of marenzelleria was constant until the target year of 2081 see section 3 2 as marenzelleria biomass densities have been relatively stable for several years on baltic sea level the results for the measured and simulated data are presented in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the estimated increases in phosphorus fluxes in the presence of marenzelleria were lower when simulated data were used instead of field data in order to calculate the effects on costs we compared the reductions in flux with phosphorus sequestration unaffected by the species which was based on data on the initial phosphorus stocks and decay rates in the different basins table 2 the new decay rates as affected by marenzelleria were then calculated by subtracting the increase in fluxes shown in table 1 from the initial sequestration presented in the third column in table 2 and dividing by the initial phosphorus stocks shown in the first column in table 2 the results are presented in the two last columns in table 2 the largest relative effect for both types of data was obtained for the bothnian sea where the sediment can become a source of phosphorus the smallest relative effect was obtained for the baltic proper where the decay rate could be reduced by a maximum of 15 i e from 0 041 to 0 035 however as discussed in subsequent sections this decrease had a large impact on the cost of meeting the helcom bsap 23 nutrient targets because of the stringent phosphorus target for the baltic proper 3 2 phosphorus transports and targets data on bau phosphorus loads from different emissions sources and drainage basins into marine basins and of transport coefficients between marine basins were taken from gren et al 20 the emissions sources included in each drainage basin are agriculture industry and sewage treatment plants the bau loads to the coastal waters of the baltic sea are measured in biologically available fractions that affect eutrophication poland is the largest contributor of phosphorus accounting for 39 of the total phosphorus load table 3 data on the maximum levels of nutrient stocks and time for the achievement of reductions i e p t i in section 2 were calculated from the most recent intergovernmental agreement on nutrient load targets for each country presented in the eutrophication segment of the bsap 23 this agreement applies the so called ecosystem approach where targets on nutrient loads to each marine basin are determined by the ecological conditions in the basins the agreement thus derives country targets which are assumed to reach maximum phosphorus pools in three of the seven basins baltic proper gulf of finland and gulf of riga however neither the maximum pools nor the timing of their achievements are specified in ref 23 with respect to the time for achieving the target we follow gren et al 20 and chose a time perspective of 60 years from a start year of 2021 when the implementation actions are supposed to start the targets are then calculated as the pools obtained in the marine basins from introduction country targets in year 1 table 3 the baltic proper receives the largest share 53 of the total load and has to meet the most stringent calculated target with a requirement of 60 reduction in the initial phosphorus pool the role of polish abatement then becomes important since it discharges 73 of the total load into the baltic proper the basin is also relatively open with approximately 55 of its load originating from other basins 20 see table a5 phosphorus reductions to other marine basins may thus be needed in order to meet the target for the baltic proper similarly since the baltic proper receives about half of its total phosphorus load from its own catchment which is transported to other marine basins reductions can be needed in this basin to achieve the targets for the gulf of finland and the gulf of riga 3 3 abatement costs and discount rate abatement cost functions for each country were taken from gren 17 who estimated the functions by generating data on the minimum cost of reaching different levels of phosphorus reduction from the bau level the numerical model calculating cost effective solutions considered for each country 11 abatement measures within agriculture industry and sewage treatment plants most of the abatement measures were directed towards agriculture since this is the main source of phosphorus loads the measures included for this sector were reductions in use of fertiliser livestock holdings cattle pigs and chickens changed spreading time of manure from autumn to spring cultivation of energy forest and catch crops and construction of wetlands in total 500 observations were generated for each country and regression analyses were carried out with abatement cost as the dependent variable and phosphorus reduction as the independent variable all costs were expressed in 2015 prices finally we need to choose the level of the social discount rate on which there is a large body of literature see e g ref 44 because of the different levels of economic prosperity and consumption preferences it is quite likely that the discount rate differs between the baltic sea countries for time periods exceeding 50 years a hyperbolic i e time declining discount rate is often suggested a simplification was made in this study by assigning a uniform discount rate to all countries and periods and the calculations of cost effective solutions were made for a relatively low level of the discount rate 0 015 e g ref 37 impacts on the cost of marenzelleria of a higher discount rate are discussed in section 4 4 results the numerical dynamic model was solved using the gams conopt2 solver 10 which gave the optimal allocation of abatement and associated costs in different drainage basins and time periods the minimum costs with marenzelleria were calculated under the assumption that the species entered the marine basins as specified in table 1 in time period t 0 it also turned out that the achievement of the phosphorus target in the baltic proper implied fulfilment of targets for the other basins because of the high reduction requirement in this basin the calculated minimum cost of reaching the bsap targets without marenzelleria amounted to 1268 billion sek 1 euro sek 9 35 on average for 2015 this represented an annual average discounted cost of 21 3 billion sek which is close to the value obtained by gren et al 19 total gross domestic product gdp of the countries in the baltic sea catchment amounted to approximately 14170 billion sek in 2015 prices 21 table 1 which means that the average annual abatement cost in the reference case corresponded to approximately 0 15 of gdp as expected the cost increased when country targets were imposed and amounted to 2483 billion sek or 0 29 of total gdp the reasons for this increase in costs are the spatial and dynamic divergences in abatement from the cost effective solution the abatement costs under the country targets regime exceed the cost effective solution for all countries but estonia and latvia table b1 the main reason for the larger cost is the constant annual country target whereas the cost effective solution generates delayed abatement because of the discount rate and self cleaning capacity in the baltic proper despite the considerable difference in levels of abatement costs between the cost effective and country target regimes the cost of marenzelleria is similar under the two regimes for the two measurements of impacts table 4 when calculating costs of the species introduction under the emission standard system it is assumed that the necessary proportional increase in abatement requirements to maintain the targets is the same for all countries and years for both policy regimes the cost of the species is lowest with simulated data since these data show lower impact on the decay rate than the field data we can also note that the lowest cost with field data is almost the same as the highest cost with simulated date under both policy regimes the reason is that the highest decay rate in baltic proper with field data is the same as the lowest decay rate for simulated data table 2 the largest cost is found for the cost effective regime under which the presence of marenzelleria increased the total abatement cost by at most 1094 billion sek or 86 from the reference case without the species in spite of similarities in total costs of marenzelleria the optimal abatement paths under cost effective solutions and country targets are quite different in the reference case and with the species impact fig 1 in the reference case the cost effective abatements starts with 1 6 kton in the first year and increases to 25 kton in the final year which can be compared with the country targets which total to 15 6 kton every year in the cost effective solution the impact of marenzelleria implies an increase in annual abatement in particular in the middle years where for example abatement is doubled in year 30 with field data measurement but reaches almost the same level as in the reference case in the final year when country targets are imposed abatement requirements are increased by 16 for all countries which gives a total abatement of 18 1 ton phosphorus each year however the cost of marenzelleria for both policy regimes and data measurements was unevenly distributed among the countries bordering the baltic sea fig 2 in general countries with relatively low abatement costs poland latvia lithuania russia face lower cost of marenzelleria under country targets than in the cost effective solution and the opposite is the case for high cost countries sweden denmark finland germany in the cost effective regime the increased costs created by the need for more abatement were borne by countries with relatively large abatement capacity and low cost abatement measures available under a country target regime the countries face the same proportional increase in abatement and the associated cost increase depends on the initial target and the shape of the marginal abatement cost function a relatively high initial abatement requirement and steep marginal cost curve then explains the high cost in relation to the cost under a cost effective policy in particular for germany irrespective of policy regime poland is the largest emitter of phosphorus to the baltic proper and faces the largest costs of marenzelleria in addition to policy regime and method for estimating impacts on the phosphorus decay rate the cost of marenzelleria depends on several exogenous parameter values in our dynamic model these include the timing of entry of the species into the baltic proper choice of discount rate and abatement costs at emission sources with respect to entry of the species the calculations were based on the current incidence of the species in the basins a delayed entrance of the species with 10 years would reduce the cost of marenzelleria by 12 an increase in the discount rate from 0 015 to 0 02 reduces cost of the species by approximately 15 without technological development abatement costs are likely to increase in the future because of economic growth in the countries raising the costs of several abatement measures however considering the long term perspective technological improvements are likely to be made which reduce abatement costs on the other hand future changes in the nutrient targets may be necessary because of climate change and or unexpected responses in the sea to changes in nutrient loads 5 discussion and conclusions the main purpose of this paper was to calculate the cost of the invasive species marenzelleria in the baltic sea this cost arises from the impact of the species on phosphorus sequestration in the seabed sediment this impact affects the dynamics of phosphorus cycling which in turn determines the need for costly phosphorus load reductions in order to achieve predetermined targets for mitigating damages from eutrophication the costs were therefore calculated as the change in total abatement costs for achieving specific maximum pools of phosphorus in the baltic sea which differ for its different basins to this end we constructed a numerical dynamic optimisation model that accounts for interlinked sea basins which differ with respect to nutrient dynamics and eutrophication status costs under two types of policy regimes were considered a cost effective achievement of the target and the country targets determined by the international governmental agreement the analytical results showed that under both policy regimes the cost of marenzelleria depends on its effect on the decay rate of phosphorus pools in the sea basins the stringency of phosphorus targets connectivity among sea basins discount rate and the cost of abatement measures our empirical results for the current incidence of marenzelleria in different sea basins showed that the effect on the decay rate differed among and within these basins it emerged that marenzelleria creates costs in only one sea basin the baltic proper the reason is the relatively low decay rate large phosphorus pool and largest phosphorus reduction target set by helcom 22 despite the large differences in total abatement costs between the two policy regimes the calculated costs were quite similar and ranged between 290 billion sek and 1094 billion sek or between 4 8 billion sek year and 18 2 billion sek year which corresponds to a maximum of approximately 0 13 of total gdp in the baltic sea catchment a feature common to all estimates was uneven distribution of the costs of marenzelleria among the baltic sea countries the largest cost was borne by poland which accounts for 73 of the phosphorus loads to the baltic proper and has access to low cost abatement options the results rest on several assumptions including deterministic conditions without technological change the long term perspective would also require consideration of uncertainty with respect to e g technological development and climate change in our approach uncertainty was treated in a simple way by testing changes in exogenous parameter values the inclusion of uncertainty in the decision problem is likely to raise costs for a society wishing to obtain nutrient targets with some degree of certainty this can also raise the cost of marenzelleria a factor not included in this analysis was fairness with respect to allocation of the cost burden among countries which is likely to be highly important for implementing any international agreement e g refs 6 13 the results in all scenarios in this study showed that one country poland would bear the largest cost burden for marenzelleria this is explained by the size of poland with respect to load of nutrients the stringent target for the baltic proper and the slow dynamics of this basin as demonstrated in a static context by gren and destouni 19 this means an unfair allocation of costs when using fairness criteria such as costs per capita or costs related to the total economic outputs an important assumption was that necessary increases in abatement are implemented to compensate for the reduction in the sea s self cleaning capacity created by marenzelleria if policies are not changed and remain the same as if marenzelleria had no impact on the decay rate the cost would be unaffected but the target would not have been reached instead of the required 60 reduction of phosphorus in the baltic proper the decrease would be 47 and 49 in the cost effective and country target regime respectively the net loss to the baltic sea society of this excess pool depends on the value of the associated decline in ecological conditions if there had been an optimal weighting of values and costs of nutrient reduction underlying the decision on the phosphorus pool targets the reduction in benefits would be higher than the decrease in cost although our empirical application of a combination of production and replacement cost methods for valuing ecosystem services did not consider uncertainty or fairness in the decision problem the method as such is not limited with respect to these aspects different types of uncertainty can be introduced in a cost effectiveness framework e g as chance constrained programming or in a mean variance framework e g ref 17 fairness can also be accounted for as e g constraints in the decision problem and benefits from nutrient reductions can be introduced in the objective function e g ref 31 given our assumptions and estimates of a cost of marenzerellia of at least 4 8 billion sek per year quite another type of issue is if this would call for mitigation actions the response requires some estimates of costs and effects of mitigation measures similar to several other aquatic invasive species once introduced it is very difficult to reduce the abundance of marenzelleria furthermore it has already colonised the whole baltic sea region our analysis and suggested methods can then be applied to the prevention of other species introduced by ballast water exchange estimation of costs of preventing other species would require assessments of costs of alternative ways of reducing exchange of ballast water in the baltic sea such as exchange of ballast water before entering the sea in skagerack exchange in ports or installation of cleaning technologies further the impact of improved management of ballast water on the cost of introductions of all alien species has to be determined this was beyond the scope of this paper and to the best of our knowledge has not been made in any other study even if it would be possible to obtain the cost of mitigating aquatic invasive species these costs should be compared with the associated benefits from prevention of introduction of all species several of these species affect the ecological functioning and nutrient recycling of the baltic sea such as the fishhook waterflea cergopagis pengoi and the sea walnut mnemiopsis leidyi 25 the combined method suggested in this paper for estimating costs of marenzelleria would then be useful for estimates of benefits from preventing other aquatic species into the sea acknowledgements we are much indebted to the swedish environmental protection agency for funding the project value of underwater habitat ecosystem services values with grant number 13 132 appendix a in the cost effective solution the determinants of the economic impact of marenzelleria were derived from the first order conditions for an optimal solution to 3 these conditions were obtained by constructing the lagrange expression which is written as a1 l t i n ρ t c i n a t i n λ t i p t i p t i γ t n a n i a t i n where λ t i 0 are the lagrange multipliers of the restrictions on phosphorus stocks in the marine basins and are the multipliers of the abatement capacity constraints the necessary conditions for minimising costs in eq a1 subject to eq 2 are written as a2 ρ t c i n a t i n τ j λ t j 1 d j m t j t

words the term on the left hand must be equal to the sum of marginal impacts on the sea basins weighted by the lagrange multipliers plus the marginal cost of the capacity constraint in order to show the impact of m t i on the cost effective solution we apply the implicit function theorem on a2 and solve for a t i n m t i this is positive when abatement of phosphorus and hence abatement cost increases and vice versa in order to obtain a tractable solution we assume that the pool target is binding for only one basin and an interior solution where γ t g 0 the expression then becomes a5 a t

as a7 ρ t c i n a t i n β t n γ t n f o r t 0 t 1 n 1 h from which we see that the abatement costs are affected through the impact on the shadow cost β t n of the country target this is in turn

8717,since the 1960s the government of benin has invested in the development of canal irrigation schemes in order to intensify food crop production and reduce food insecurity this paper employed an ordered probit model with sample selection to assess the potential of irrigation in reducing food insecurity in the municipality of malanville benin the results show that 60 of the irrigation farmers and 46 of the dry land farmers were food secure adoption of irrigation has a positive effect on food security other variables explaining food security are education informal training credit extension services use of improved seed fertilizer and herbicide application farm and off farm income the study recommends that efforts to rehabilitate current irrigation scheme and develop other schemes should be intensified keywords irrigation food insecurity item response theory rasch model ordered probit model 1 introduction originally defined as the availability of food the concept of food security has gradually evolved to an emphasis on access to food 16 up to today s definition stating the four dimensions of food security availability accessibility utilization and stability the latest concept was adopted at the world food summit organized in rome in 1996 and food security has been defined as a situation that exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life therefore food security implies the provision of safe nutritious quantitatively and qualitatively adequate food as well as access to it by all people at any time it can be analyzed either from the supply or demand side or both sides 48 highlighted that food problems are influenced not only by food production and agricultural activities but also by the structure and processes governing entire economies and societies following that view food insecurity is caused not only by scarcity but also by institutional failures that led to suboptimal food distribution for instance the world has the capacity to provide at least 2 15 kg per person a day for the whole population but the world has about 795 million food insecure and undernourished people 15 on this premise this study suggests that food supply is a necessary condition while food access is a sufficient condition for food security improving access to adequate and nutritious food for its population is the major goals of any developing country this was re emphasized with the 2007 08 global food prices shock despite efforts made towards hunger eradication worldwide about 780 million people in developing countries still experience and suffer hunger in benin an integrated modular survey on household living conditions conducted by the institut national de la statistique et de l analyse economique 28 found that about 22 5 and 23 of households were food insecure and at risk of food insecurity respectively in 2011 food insecurity is unevenly distributed within regions and between urban and rural area the situation is worse in rural areas where 24 7 of households were observed to be food insecure and 25 7 were at risk of food insecurity in 2011 28 a report of the world food program wfp in 2014 points to the fact that in benin households that rely on agriculture as main source of livelihood are more vulnerable to food insecurity about 21 of farm household in benin were food insecure and 48 were at risk of food insecurity in 2013 55 the synthesis statistics by municipality reveal that 26 of households in the municipality of malanville study area were food secure 20 were food insecure and 54 were at risk of food insecurity while agriculture is a key sector for benin economy it is handicapped by climate change and weather variability many farmers cannot produce during the dry season and the production decreases when there is flooding or drought it follows that the country experiences good production year when rainfall and spatial temporal distribution of rainfall is favorable as water is a limiting factor for agricultural production irrigated agriculture is considered as one of the practices for controlling the effects of weather variability flood and drought on crop yield and thus for increasing food production in the countries 18 53 7 13 30 14 consistent with this the government of benin has developed several irrigation scheme through the country since 1960 in a bid to support cereal production and to reduce food insecurity several irrigation systems gravity pump manual watering among others are used in benin according to the financial capacity of the producers surface irrigation is practiced on 46 of the total area followed by sprinkler irrigation on 42 of the total area and drip irrigation covers 12 of the total area under irrigation 33 sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are mostly used for vegetable production canal irrigation is used in all irrigated rice schemes in benin with water from a river for instance in the irrigation scheme of malanville study area the water used is pumped from the niger river and distributed into the farms through surface canals public expenditure for irrigation schemes construction and maintenances are important factors of irrigation development such investments have been realized in benin by the government and its development partners since 1960 it is therefore important to reinforce the justification for such investments and provide support for continuing investments previous empirical works abonesh et al 2006 36 52 51 7 3 22 39 49 57 2 dealing with the effect of irrigation on livelihood have concluded that irrigation contributes to food availability which leads to lower food price and thus to food security for example the project to install solar powered water pumps in benin significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake particularly during the dry season 7 indeed the per capita daily consumption expenditure for the beneficiary household has increased from us 0 69 to us 0 85 7 argue that the project not only increased consumption but also initiated small institutional changes more children attended school and women received formalized land rights and access to financial institutions these findings were confirmed by ref 2 who showed that solar powered drip irrigation has the potential to improve household nutritional status in benin 3 point out that irrigation scheme enhanced household food security and wellbeing during the dry season in ghana using a propensity score matching approach 57 showed that adoption of irrigation in ethiopia has a positive effect on irrigation facilities users household total expenditure this agrees with previous findings by refs 1 and 52 a study conducted in malawi by ref 39 based on a propensity score matching method indicated that access to irrigation facilities increases the daily per capita caloric intake for participants by 103 kcal and that represented an average increase of 10 percent more than non participants to the irrigation scheme studies 17 8 in zimbabwe have shown that irrigation schemes have the potential to achieve food security through employment creation income generation and acquisition of assets the present study seeks to answer the following important question for irrigation policy what are the impacts of adoption of irrigation on food security among rice farmers the choice of rice is due to the importance that has been given to its production in benin it occupies 50 of the irrigated land in benin 19 20 40 rice is among the main food crop on which the government is focused to reduce food insecurity and poverty there is no one best measure of food security it has been measured using a range of indicators following quantitative approaches based on prevalence of undernourishment per capita food consumption expenditure daily per capita caloric intake food consumption score anthropometry measure or qualitative approaches using questionnaires for measuring food insecurity experiences scales the quantitative approaches are criticized for being data intensive costly to implement and insensitive to shocks and seasonality 21 11 25 questionnaires measuring experiences of food insecurity attempt to fill these gaps and are relatively less expensive and easy to use 21 5 42 19 20 the study contributes to the growing literature on the effects of irrigation adoption on food security it shows evidence of the importance of irrigation in reducing food insecurity in benin this is useful for policy makers in the formulation and evaluation of the food insecurity reduction programs it takes an approach that differs from quantitative approaches of food security measurement by using the approach of food insecurity experiences scales to examine food security status currently the efficacy of the irrigation development policy in benin has not been sufficiently addressed literature on the effects of adoption of irrigation on food security is scant for benin few studies 7 2 have analyzed the impact of irrigation on food security in benin thus a study showing empirical evidence that irrigation adoption affects food security among rice farmers in benin is of great importance as it contributes to advance existing literature context specific analysis is needed to support smarter policies in benin various methods have been used in the literature to examine impact of technology adoption on food security 52 51 39 57 the main problem is sample selection bias some authors minimized the problem of selection bias by using the heckman two step model 52 49 others 39 57 62 employed the propensity score matching psm approaches both methods rely on assumptions the heckman approach relies on the restrictive assumption of normally distributed errors 62 the validity of the matching approach depends on the conditional independence assumption which postulates that potential outcomes are independent of the treatment status 46 62 64 this implies that technology adoption decision is entirely based on observed characteristics even after this there may be significant differences between adopters and non adopters outcomes 62 63 because of unobservable characteristics such as farmers motivation and ability to control for this problem the instrumental variables iv model is commonly used applying the iv model requires the availability of at least one instrumental variable assumed to be highly correlated with the treatment variable and uncorrelated with unobservable factors affecting the outcome the main limitation of this approach is the difficulty in identifying valid instruments comparing these different methods of addressing selection bias jalan and ravallion 60 noted that the assumption of selection on observables is no more restrictive than assuming away problems of weak instruments when heckman or the iv approach is employed in cross sectional data analysis majority of the studies have not considered the food security categories in examining the impact of irrigation adoption to take advantage of this the ordered probit model with sample selection was employed this is a generalization of the 26 two step model to ordered outcomes 9 the paper is arranged as follows the introduction provides an overview and the objectives of the study the next section describes the linkages between irrigation and food security this is followed by the research design which includes the presentation of the study area the sampling technique and data collection procedure and then the methods of analysis the results are presented and discussed in section 4 while the conclusion and policy implications of the study are given in section 5 2 conceptual framework the link between irrigation and food security agricultural technology adoption is generally based on the expected utility derived from the adoption this study therefore builds on a random utility framework where farmers are assumed to maximize their utility from the adoption of irrigation in this regard farmers adopt irrigation when they perceive that this will provide them with greater utility in terms of reducing food insecurity irrigation water is an important resource for agricultural activities including livestock and fisheries without water people cannot water crops provide food and productive environment for the fast growing population animals plants and microbes worldwide 43 this framework describes the way by which the adoption of irrigation contributes to achieve food security fig 1 14 argues that the four dimensions of food security are likely to be improved due to increased availability of water investing in irrigation is a mean to hedge against weather variability such as drought and flood irrigation water allows for all year round food production this allows food production in two or more cycles in a year studies by de mey et al 61 and diagne et al 58 have shown that the presence of severe production risks prevent farmers from intensifying their production system as a risk reducing technology developing irrigation schemes is often a package of technologies leading to crowding in of inputs and technologies such as improved seed fertilizers and agrochemicals among others 59 which in turn may contribute to crop yield improvement and higher farm income non farmers benefit from this through lower food price increased returns from production can have important employment opportunities through increased demand for inputs and supply of outputs 27 another source of employment opportunity in the area is the additional demand for intensive use of labour during the construction of the schemes and the ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation works these employment opportunities offer prospects for farmers to diversify their sources of livelihood resulting in an increase of their total income as income increases farmers can afford more nutritious foods for consumption and other goods or even increase farm investments therefore adoption of irrigation contributes not only to food availability through crop yield improvement but also by improving access to food through lower food price and higher farm income enabling farmers to afford more food and food security boost it should also be noted that irrigation water is also used for other activities including domestic use livestock rearing fish production 27 14 40 which are part of the farmers income diversification strategies leading to food security 3 research design 3 1 description of the study area and survey design the study 1 1 details of the survey and sampling techniques can also be found in ref 40 2 this classification follows 5 19 20 and 42 is carried out in benin in the municipality of malanville which is borded to the north by the republic of niger to the south by the municipalities of kandi and ségbana to the west by the municipality of karimama and to the east by the federal republic of nigeria the municipality is located in the sudano sahelian zone of benin with only one rainy season which lasts for 5 6 months from may to october with a rainfall range between 700 mm and 1000 mm this low rainfall negatively affects agricultural production especially rice malanville is characterized by high level of food insecurity and poverty table 1 the majority of its inhabitants are involved in subsistence agriculture and other economic activities such as fishing livestock rearing small business trade and crafts the major crops grown are maize rice millet sorghum cotton and vegetables the municipality of malanville was chosen for this study for three main reasons first it is the largest rice producing area in benin second it is crossed by the niger river and its tributaries which offer an important opportunity for rice production and third among other rice irrigation schemes developed by the state the irrigation scheme at malanville is the most important in terms of size and yield the total irrigable land under the scheme is 516 ha of which 400 ha were cultivated in 2015 the average rice yield under the scheme is about 5 7 mt ha the irrigation scheme of malanville was constructed in 1970 and the water used is pumped from the niger river and distributed into the farms through surface canals there are approximately 1054 rice farmers operating on the scheme in 2015 four districts out of five in the municipality were selected for the survey based on distance to the irrigation scheme and on the size of rice production districts selected were garou guene malanville and tombouctou in each of these districts two villages one high rice producing village and one low rice producing village were purposively selected with the help of the extension officers in total eight villages within the four districts were selected for the survey 3 2 sampling design and data collection there were two groups of respondents considered for this study the irrigation farmers who produce rice under irrigation in the formal irrigation scheme of malanville and the dry land farmers producing rice under rainfed condition in the same municipality 34 reveals that about 9 of the rice farm population in benin are irrigation farmers and the rest are under rainfed condition based on the prevalence of irrigation and rainfed farmers the optimal sample size required to produce accurate results was determined for each group of farmers using 10 sample size formula we obtained an optimal sample size of 126 for irrigation farmers and 359 for dry land farmers oversampling was done and hence 150 irrigation farmers and 540 dry land farmers were finally chosen a large sample size minimizes sampling error practically a list of irrigation farmers was obtained from the committee in charge of the management of the irrigation scheme of malanville farmers from the scheme are in groups of 20 100 people with a total of 24 groups to ensure a fair representation a proportional sampling technique was used to select 150 irrigation farmers further the dry land farmers were selected from the eight villages covered by the survey for this group the approximate list of the rice farmers was provided by the chief of the village ninety 90 farmers were randomly selected in each high rice producing village and 45 farmers were also randomly selected in each low rice producing village totaling to 540 dry land farmers the total number of respondents interviewed for the survey was 690 rice producers comprising of 150 irrigation farmers and 540 dry land farmers farm level data was collected between april and june 2015 3 3 method of analysis 3 3 1 framework for the measurement of food insecurity under the rasch model the food insecurity experience scale fies is an experience based measure of severity of food insecurity it comprises a set of eight questions table 2 that the respondents were directly asked about their experiences associated with increasing difficulties in food access due to resource constraints the questionnaire is very simple to apply at a fairly low cost and with less time responses were coded as yes 1 for an affirmative value and no 0 for a negative value the rasch model 45 programmed in r package was used to analyze the data it provides a theoretical framework for models that use questionnaire items measuring the same latent trait 21 44 compared to the other related item response models the rash model is more appropriate for use in small samples and allow to assess the relative contribution of each item to the latent variable measured 32 50 in rasch modelling the likelihood that a subject with ability b h responds correctly to a test items characterized by difficulty level a i is a logistic function of the difference between b h and a i 1 p r o b x h i 1 b h a i f b h a i e b h a i 1 e b h a i the underlying assumptions of the rasch model are that the items within the questionnaire are uni dimensional the probability that a respondent affirms an item is a logistic function of experienced food insecurity all items within the questionnaire discriminate equally meaning that they are equally and strongly associated with the latent trait and the items are conditionally independent 21 42 before the validation of the results the items were subjected to a test that indicates whether the responses fit the assumptions of the rasch model after testing the rasch model assumptions for all rice farmers separate test was done for irrigated and rainfed rice farmers to compare the psychometric characteristics of the two sub groups within the sample the idea is to ensure that all items are strong indicators of food insecurity for the two sub groups before starting any comparison between them two statistics commonly used as indices of fit of the items and of the individuals are item infit and item outfit both compare observed deviations of responses from the deviations expected under rasch assumptions 24 31 42 item infit is calculated as follows 2 i n f i t i 1 n x i h p i h 2 1 n p i h p i h 2 item outfit is defined as follows 3 o u t f i t i 1 n 1 n x i h p i h 2 p i h p i h 2 where x i h is the observed response of farmer h to item i p i h is the probability of an affirmative response by farmer h to item i and n is the total number of farmers when the responses fit the model perfectly the value of infit and outfit are 1 values above 1 indicate items that are weakly related to the food insecurity and values below 1 show items that are more strongly related to food insecurity 44 42 in practical analysis the recommended value for fit statistics ranges from 0 8 to 1 2 and a wider acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 21 44 42 the raw score is a sufficient statistic for food insecurity measurement when the conditions of the rasch model are met 19 20 5 42 therefore the respondent s maximum food insecurity scale is 8 for farmers who provide an affirmative response to all eight questions and the minimum scale is 0 for farmers who provide negative answers to all eight questions the higher the score the more food insecurity the farmer experiences the score 0 corresponds to high food security the score of 1 3 corresponds to marginal food security the score 4 6 corresponds to moderate food insecurity and the score 7 8 corresponds to severe food insecurity 5 19 20 42 3 3 2 econometric analysis of the effect of irrigation adoption on food security based on their food security status fs farmers were classified as follows 1 for severe food insecurity 2 for moderate food insecurity 3 for marginal food security and 4 for high food security then the appropriate model to estimate is an ordered response model this is employed to take advantage of the ordinal nature of the food security categories 37 for instance a farmer in moderate food insecurity category is worse off than a farmer in the marginal and high food security categories but he is better off than a farmer in a severe food insecurity category therefore grouping moderate and severe food insecurity into a single food insecure category can be misleading because it fails to distinguish between serious and less serious conditions of food insecurity the ordered response model is an extension of the binary response model by adding multiple cutoff points assuming that the latent variable fs is determined by the regression relationship 4 f s β x ε where x is a vector of independents variables with the corresponding parameter vector β ε refers to the error term which is assumed normally distributed in practice f s is unobservable the observed aspect of food security can be written as 5 f s 1 i f f s μ 1 2 i f μ 1 f s μ 2 3 i f μ 2 f s μ 3 4 i f f s μ 3 where μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are the cutoff points with the four categories of the food security model three cutoff points are estimated by assuming a normal distribution function form an ordered probit model was estimated finally to control for the selection bias that may arise since participation in an irrigation project is not random and purposive targeting and self selection occurs an ordered probit model with sample selection was estimated this is a generalization of the classical 26 two steps selection model to ordered categorical outcomes 9 argue that the two step estimator is more robust and is a better choice for practical applications variables included in the ordered probit model are socio economic characteristics such as age gender education level informal training and geographical location of the farmer farm inputs such as crop variety fertilizer herbicide adoption of irrigation and institutional variables such as access to extension services and credit farm income and off farm income were also included in the model as wealth status indicators the main hypothesis is that adoption of irrigation contributes to reduce food insecurity in benin previous studies 52 7 3 nkhata et al 2014 49 have shown positive relationship between adoption of irrigation and food security it is also hypothesized that use of the other agricultural inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed positively affects farmer s food security status 37 have shown that the use of fertilizer and improved seed leads to reducing food insecurity through increased production positive effects of the wealth proxy variables on the food security status of a farmer was expected study by ref 51 showed that the socio economic variables such as age education and income are positively correlated with household welfare it is also expected that due to the low level of literacy table 1 above in the municipality of malanville farmers who do not have formal education but have gone through an a form of informal training such as carpentry engineering mason dress making hairdressing among others will have high probability of being food secure 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics comparison of the socio economic characteristics of irrigation and dry land farmers are reported in table 3 all the differences discussed are statistically significant irrigators were relatively younger compared to dry land farmers suggesting that young farmers are likely to adopt irrigation few female farmers 25 were involved in rice production irrigators used more inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed than the dry land farmers this implies that adoption of irrigation is likely to lead to intensive use of inputs and technologies this result is in line with previous finding by emerick et al 59 irrigators have better institutional support than the dry land farmers the majority 94 of irrigators had access to extension services while only 49 of the dry land farmers had about 87 of irrigators received credit against 54 of dry land farmers higher proportion of irrigators had an informal training compared to dry land farmers irrigators earn higher off farm income than the dry land farmers they earn about 71 more in off farm income than the dry land farmers 4 2 meeting the rasch model assumptions and analysis of food security distribution assessing the extent to which the data are consistent with the rasch model assumptions is an important step in the validation of the food security data 42 table 4 presents the affirmative responses and items severity for both irrigated and rainfed rice farmers in overall about 69 of the surveyed rice farmers reported that they were worried not having enough food to eat 44 ran out of food and 23 went without eating for a whole day at some time during the last year because they lacked food or money for food comparisons of affirmative responses between irrigation and dry land farmers show that a relatively higher percentage of dry land farmers have affirmed each item than the irrigation farmers the frequency of the affirmative response to the items is an inverse function of the items severity this decreases as the severity of the items increases also in all cases it is observed that less severe items had lower measure values of severity than the more severe items for instance the item ran out of food has a lower measure value than items hungry but did not eat and went without eating for a whole day but has a higher measure value than the item worried to run out of food item infit values ranged from 0 73 to 1 29 for all rice farmers and also for irrigated and rainfed rice farmers table 5 this is outside the appropriate range of 0 8 1 2 but still within the acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 overall item outfit values were within the acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 except for the irrigated rice farmers where these values were elevated for the least severe item worried to run out of food indicating few highly unexpected responses 44 42 47 given the good infit statistics for all items the elevated outfit statistics may not threat the suitability of the data and do not indicate any serious violation of the rasch model assumptions 47 the item fit statistics indicate that the 8 items considered are independent of one another and they measure the same construct then they are strong indicators for food insecurity measurement this confirms the suitability of the data in fitting rasch modelling to measure food insecurity therefore the raw score is a sufficient indicator of food insecurity experience scale among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville table 6 summarizes the distribution of the raw score and the food security status among irrigation and dry land farmers in the municipality of malanville in all 15 of the surveyed rice farmers were classified into the high food security category 36 28 and 21 of irrigation and dry land farmers were in the marginal food security moderate food insecurity and severe food insecurity categories respectively regarding the farming system 21 of the irrigation farmers and 13 of the dry land farmers were in the high food security category while about 20 of irrigators and 22 of dry land farmers were in the severe food insecurity category the aggregate distribution shows that about 60 of the irrigation farmers against 46 of the dry land farmers were food secure these results reveal that while food security is still a challenge among rice farmers a large percentage of dry land farmers experience food insecurity than irrigated rice farmers irrigation farmers show a higher level of food security than dry land farmers holding other factors constant one may deduce that irrigation adoption contributes to reduce food insecurity among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville see table 7 food secured farmers have higher farm income and off farm income than the non food secured farmers the food secured farmers used more intensive inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed than the non food secured farmers intensive use of inputs leads to increased production which in turn is positively correlated with food security about 70 of the food secured farmers had access to credit against 52 of the non secured farmers this implies that access to credit is positively associated to food security higher proportion of food secured farmers 45 are educated compared to the non food secured farmers 25 this suggests positive correlation between education and food security more educated farmers are likely to be food secure 4 3 effects of irrigation adoption on food security the estimates of the ordered probit model with sample selection are reported in table 8 following 6 and 54 the endogeneity of farm income 3 3 the endogeneity of farm income comes from the fact that it is linked to inputs seed credit fertilizer herbicide among others through a production function was controlled using the expected values as follows 1 farm income was regressed on the exogenous explanatory variables 2 expected values were obtained and 3 the food security equation was estimated using the expected values of farm income as an instrument for observed values this procedure is more efficient than the two stage least squares 2sls technique and the control function approach 56 6 54 the results of the selection equation is not presented since this is not the primary objective of the study 4 4 interested readers may read 41 the chi square test is significant at 1 indicating the significance of the overall model the estimated cut off points satisfy the conditions that μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 this implies that the four categories of the food security differ and should be included in the model the coefficient of the inverse mills ratio lambda is significant suggesting the presence of selection bias which is controlled through the two step procedure interactive terms of key agricultural inputs were included in the model to assess how the combination of these inputs may affect food security status of the farmers the district of malanville was chosen as reference for comparison across districts of the effect of variables included in the model because the rice irrigation scheme is located in that district the marginal effects are interpreted relative to the food security category and the sign table 9 the results table 9 show that the prevalence of food insecurity differs among districts relative to the farmers in the districts of garou guene and tombouctou living in the district of malanville decreases the probability of being in severe and moderate food insecurity categories while increasing the probability of being in marginal and high food security categories however the effect is significant only for the district of guene farmers in the districts of guene are about 53 more likely to be in severe food insecurity category and 42 less likely to be in the high food security category than farmers in the district of malanville table 9 with regard to this one explanation to the difference in food security status among districts could be the presence of the irrigation scheme in the district of malanville allowing irrigation farmers to produce even during the dry season and also provision of more institutional support in terms of access to productive inputs and rice marketing consistent with this adoption of irrigation has a positive and significant effect on the food security status of the farmer table 8 this decreases the probability of a farmer being in severe food insecurity category by about 58 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 46 table 9 the implication is that the adoption of irrigation contributes to reduce food insecurity among the rice farmers this is in line with majority of studies 36 52 51 7 3 22 39 49 dealing with the effect of irrigation on food security in addition to the use of water irrigation farmers benefit from more support such as extension services use of improved seed and access to fertilizer and credit the results also reveal that the interaction terms between adoption of irrigation and access to fertilizer and credit are positive and significant demonstrating that the adoption of irrigation accompanied by access to fertilizer and credit decrease the probability of a farmer being in severe and moderate food insecure categories while increasing the probability of being in marginal and high food secure categories positive sign was also observed for the interaction between extension services and use of improved seed this means that the effect of adoption is larger for farmers that received extension services and used improved seed than farmers who did not negative sign was found for the interactions of the variables fertilizer and access to credit and use of improved seed and herbicide this implies that the effect of adoption is smaller for farmers who use fertilizer but lack credit and also for farmers that used improved seed and lack herbicide so in addition to the use of irrigation water accessibility to extension services fertilizer credit and improved seed variety should be key policy focus for agricultural development in benin apart from adoption of irrigation the other farm input variables have significant effect on food security status among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville use of fertilizer herbicide and improved seed variety are farm input variables that positively affect food security status of the farmer for instance the use of improved seed decreases the probability of being in severe food insecurity category by about 38 and increases the probability of being in high food security category by about 30 table 9 the results also indicate that the return from the use of improved seed is less in the district of garou guene and tombouctou than in the district of malanville there was no significant difference in the return from the use of herbicides between malanville and the district of tombouctou while in the districts of garou and guene the return is less compared to the district of malanville regarding the institutional variables access to credit decreases the probability of a farmer being in the severe food insecurity category by about 21 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 16 similarly access to extension services decreases the probability of a farmer being in the severe food insecurity category by about 32 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 25 it is observed that the return from access to extension services is higher in malanville than in the districts of garou guene and tombouctou no significant difference was found among the four districts in terms of return from access to credit the amount of farm and off farm income have an effect of decreasing the probability of being in severe or moderate food insecurity categories and increasing the probability of being in marginal or high food security categories as highlighted in the conceptual framework fig 1 the development of irrigation schemes can also attract a vibrant services sector which may provide off farm income opportunities to farmers and contributes to increased total income this supports the argument that irrigation cannot be introduced in a vacuum without encouraging surrounding service sectors 58 theoretically these results imply that farmers with high farm and off farm income are likely to be food secure one reason is that as income increases the farmers may have more money for food other goods and farm investments increased education level of farmers also decreases the probability of being in severe or moderate food insecurity categories and increases the probability of being in marginal or high food security categories compared to uneducated farmers those that have attained at least primary school have a higher probability of being food secure this result implies that education is important for improving the food security status of farmers as the educated farmers are more likely to be food secure the importance of informal training in reducing food insecurity was also stressed in this study in the municipality of malanville where only about 14 of the population are literate 28 informal training is an option for improving food security farmers who have attained informal training have higher probability of being in the food secure category the major informal training reported by the surveyed farmers are carpentry mason or construction works engineering and dress making the findings of this study suggest that the development of irrigation schemes have helped enhancing food security in benin previous studies 27 14 have shown that irrigation adoption reduces risk of crop failure leads to food security through higher productivity and income 12 reported that the irrigation schemes did not only contribute to increased food security but also profited surrounding communities who were not in the schemes irrigators benefit more from institutional support services in terms of access to extension services and credit and use of farm inputs the results support the idea that the development of irrigation schemes lead to crowding in of inputs and technologies 59 the findings also suggest that irrigation schemes offer opportunities for employment through increased demand for inputs and supply of output this therefore helps farmers in diversifying income sources for greater impact of irrigation on food security there is a need for complementary inputs services policies and institutional support measures previous studies 23 38 argue that impacts of investments in irrigation schemes on crop productivity food security and poverty reduction are greater where institutional support measures and complementary policies and infrastructure are available while the findings of this study support our hypotheses and expectations further research might test the robustness of our findings using different data set such as panel data furthermore further research may also consider other outcomes of irrigation adoption such as income diversification and explore the spillover effects related to changes in food prices 5 concluding remarks the motivation of this study was to demonstrate the significance of the linkage between irrigation and food security using the irrigation scheme of malanville benin as an empirical case study questionnaire on food insecurity experiences were administered to 690 rice farmers and rasch modelling was used to assess the validity of the farmers responses to items after fitting rasch model assumptions with the overall rice farmers separate assessment was done for the irrigation and dry land rice farmers this shows that both irrigators and dry land farmers responses to food insecurity questionnaire fit the rasch model assumptions descriptive statistics analysis of food security status of the farmers shows that about 60 of the irrigated rice farmers and 46 of the rainfed rice farmers were food secure indicating that irrigators were more food secure than dry land farmers the statistical results were confirmed by an estimation of ordered probit model with sample selection which demonstrates a positive relationship between irrigation and food security other variables that influence food security include educational level access to credit use of improved seed access to extension services fertilizer and herbicide farm income off farm income and informal training the study concludes that investment in irrigation is a potential avenue for reducing food insecurity in benin efforts to rehabilitate current irrigation scheme and develop other schemes should be intensified however importance should be given to other factors that affect food insecurity thus there is an urgent need to improve farmers access to farm inputs credit and extension services with these complementary actions food insecurity could be reduced among rice

8717,since the 1960s the government of benin has invested in the development of canal irrigation schemes in order to intensify food crop production and reduce food insecurity this paper employed an ordered probit model with sample selection to assess the potential of irrigation in reducing food insecurity in the municipality of malanville benin the results show that 60 of the irrigation farmers and 46 of the dry land farmers were food secure adoption of irrigation has a positive effect on food security other variables explaining food security are education informal training credit extension services use of improved seed fertilizer and herbicide application farm and off farm income the study recommends that efforts to rehabilitate current irrigation scheme and develop other schemes should be intensified keywords irrigation food insecurity item response theory rasch model ordered probit model 1 introduction originally defined as the availability of food the concept of food security has gradually evolved to an emphasis on access to food 16 up to today s definition stating the four dimensions of food security availability accessibility utilization and stability the latest concept was adopted at the world food summit organized in rome in 1996 and food security has been defined as a situation that exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life therefore food security implies the provision of safe nutritious quantitatively and qualitatively adequate food as well as access to it by all people at any time it can be analyzed either from the supply or demand side or both sides 48 highlighted that food problems are influenced not only by food production and agricultural activities but also by the structure and processes governing entire economies and societies following that view food insecurity is caused not only by scarcity but also by institutional failures that led to suboptimal food distribution for instance the world has the capacity to provide at least 2 15 kg per person a day for the whole population but the world has about 795 million food insecure and undernourished people 15 on this premise this study suggests that food supply is a necessary condition while food access is a sufficient condition for food security improving access to adequate and nutritious food for its population is the major goals of any developing country this was re emphasized with the 2007 08 global food prices shock despite efforts made towards hunger eradication worldwide about 780 million people in developing countries still experience and suffer hunger in benin an integrated modular survey on household living conditions conducted by the institut national de la statistique et de l analyse economique 28 found that about 22 5 and 23 of households were food insecure and at risk of food insecurity respectively in 2011 food insecurity is unevenly distributed within regions and between urban and rural area the situation is worse in rural areas where 24 7 of households were observed to be food insecure and 25 7 were at risk of food insecurity in 2011 28 a report of the world food program wfp in 2014 points to the fact that in benin households that rely on agriculture as main source of livelihood are more vulnerable to food insecurity about 21 of farm household in benin were food insecure and 48 were at risk of food insecurity in 2013 55 the synthesis statistics by municipality reveal that 26 of households in the municipality of malanville study area were food secure 20 were food insecure and 54 were at risk of food insecurity while agriculture is a key sector for benin economy it is handicapped by climate change and weather variability many farmers cannot produce during the dry season and the production decreases when there is flooding or drought it follows that the country experiences good production year when rainfall and spatial temporal distribution of rainfall is favorable as water is a limiting factor for agricultural production irrigated agriculture is considered as one of the practices for controlling the effects of weather variability flood and drought on crop yield and thus for increasing food production in the countries 18 53 7 13 30 14 consistent with this the government of benin has developed several irrigation scheme through the country since 1960 in a bid to support cereal production and to reduce food insecurity several irrigation systems gravity pump manual watering among others are used in benin according to the financial capacity of the producers surface irrigation is practiced on 46 of the total area followed by sprinkler irrigation on 42 of the total area and drip irrigation covers 12 of the total area under irrigation 33 sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are mostly used for vegetable production canal irrigation is used in all irrigated rice schemes in benin with water from a river for instance in the irrigation scheme of malanville study area the water used is pumped from the niger river and distributed into the farms through surface canals public expenditure for irrigation schemes construction and maintenances are important factors of irrigation development such investments have been realized in benin by the government and its development partners since 1960 it is therefore important to reinforce the justification for such investments and provide support for continuing investments previous empirical works abonesh et al 2006 36 52 51 7 3 22 39 49 57 2 dealing with the effect of irrigation on livelihood have concluded that irrigation contributes to food availability which leads to lower food price and thus to food security for example the project to install solar powered water pumps in benin significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake particularly during the dry season 7 indeed the per capita daily consumption expenditure for the beneficiary household has increased from us 0 69 to us 0 85 7 argue that the project not only increased consumption but also initiated small institutional changes more children attended school and women received formalized land rights and access to financial institutions these findings were confirmed by ref 2 who showed that solar powered drip irrigation has the potential to improve household nutritional status in benin 3 point out that irrigation scheme enhanced household food security and wellbeing during the dry season in ghana using a propensity score matching approach 57 showed that adoption of irrigation in ethiopia has a positive effect on irrigation facilities users household total expenditure this agrees with previous findings by refs 1 and 52 a study conducted in malawi by ref 39 based on a propensity score matching method indicated that access to irrigation facilities increases the daily per capita caloric intake for participants by 103 kcal and that represented an average increase of 10 percent more than non participants to the irrigation scheme studies 17 8 in zimbabwe have shown that irrigation schemes have the potential to achieve food security through employment creation income generation and acquisition of assets the present study seeks to answer the following important question for irrigation policy what are the impacts of adoption of irrigation on food security among rice farmers the choice of rice is due to the importance that has been given to its production in benin it occupies 50 of the irrigated land in benin 19 20 40 rice is among the main food crop on which the government is focused to reduce food insecurity and poverty there is no one best measure of food security it has been measured using a range of indicators following quantitative approaches based on prevalence of undernourishment per capita food consumption expenditure daily per capita caloric intake food consumption score anthropometry measure or qualitative approaches using questionnaires for measuring food insecurity experiences scales the quantitative approaches are criticized for being data intensive costly to implement and insensitive to shocks and seasonality 21 11 25 questionnaires measuring experiences of food insecurity attempt to fill these gaps and are relatively less expensive and easy to use 21 5 42 19 20 the study contributes to the growing literature on the effects of irrigation adoption on food security it shows evidence of the importance of irrigation in reducing food insecurity in benin this is useful for policy makers in the formulation and evaluation of the food insecurity reduction programs it takes an approach that differs from quantitative approaches of food security measurement by using the approach of food insecurity experiences scales to examine food security status currently the efficacy of the irrigation development policy in benin has not been sufficiently addressed literature on the effects of adoption of irrigation on food security is scant for benin few studies 7 2 have analyzed the impact of irrigation on food security in benin thus a study showing empirical evidence that irrigation adoption affects food security among rice farmers in benin is of great importance as it contributes to advance existing literature context specific analysis is needed to support smarter policies in benin various methods have been used in the literature to examine impact of technology adoption on food security 52 51 39 57 the main problem is sample selection bias some authors minimized the problem of selection bias by using the heckman two step model 52 49 others 39 57 62 employed the propensity score matching psm approaches both methods rely on assumptions the heckman approach relies on the restrictive assumption of normally distributed errors 62 the validity of the matching approach depends on the conditional independence assumption which postulates that potential outcomes are independent of the treatment status 46 62 64 this implies that technology adoption decision is entirely based on observed characteristics even after this there may be significant differences between adopters and non adopters outcomes 62 63 because of unobservable characteristics such as farmers motivation and ability to control for this problem the instrumental variables iv model is commonly used applying the iv model requires the availability of at least one instrumental variable assumed to be highly correlated with the treatment variable and uncorrelated with unobservable factors affecting the outcome the main limitation of this approach is the difficulty in identifying valid instruments comparing these different methods of addressing selection bias jalan and ravallion 60 noted that the assumption of selection on observables is no more restrictive than assuming away problems of weak instruments when heckman or the iv approach is employed in cross sectional data analysis majority of the studies have not considered the food security categories in examining the impact of irrigation adoption to take advantage of this the ordered probit model with sample selection was employed this is a generalization of the 26 two step model to ordered outcomes 9 the paper is arranged as follows the introduction provides an overview and the objectives of the study the next section describes the linkages between irrigation and food security this is followed by the research design which includes the presentation of the study area the sampling technique and data collection procedure and then the methods of analysis the results are presented and discussed in section 4 while the conclusion and policy implications of the study are given in section 5 2 conceptual framework the link between irrigation and food security agricultural technology adoption is generally based on the expected utility derived from the adoption this study therefore builds on a random utility framework where farmers are assumed to maximize their utility from the adoption of irrigation in this regard farmers adopt irrigation when they perceive that this will provide them with greater utility in terms of reducing food insecurity irrigation water is an important resource for agricultural activities including livestock and fisheries without water people cannot water crops provide food and productive environment for the fast growing population animals plants and microbes worldwide 43 this framework describes the way by which the adoption of irrigation contributes to achieve food security fig 1 14 argues that the four dimensions of food security are likely to be improved due to increased availability of water investing in irrigation is a mean to hedge against weather variability such as drought and flood irrigation water allows for all year round food production this allows food production in two or more cycles in a year studies by de mey et al 61 and diagne et al 58 have shown that the presence of severe production risks prevent farmers from intensifying their production system as a risk reducing technology developing irrigation schemes is often a package of technologies leading to crowding in of inputs and technologies such as improved seed fertilizers and agrochemicals among others 59 which in turn may contribute to crop yield improvement and higher farm income non farmers benefit from this through lower food price increased returns from production can have important employment opportunities through increased demand for inputs and supply of outputs 27 another source of employment opportunity in the area is the additional demand for intensive use of labour during the construction of the schemes and the ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation works these employment opportunities offer prospects for farmers to diversify their sources of livelihood resulting in an increase of their total income as income increases farmers can afford more nutritious foods for consumption and other goods or even increase farm investments therefore adoption of irrigation contributes not only to food availability through crop yield improvement but also by improving access to food through lower food price and higher farm income enabling farmers to afford more food and food security boost it should also be noted that irrigation water is also used for other activities including domestic use livestock rearing fish production 27 14 40 which are part of the farmers income diversification strategies leading to food security 3 research design 3 1 description of the study area and survey design the study 1 1 details of the survey and sampling techniques can also be found in ref 40 2 this classification follows 5 19 20 and 42 is carried out in benin in the municipality of malanville which is borded to the north by the republic of niger to the south by the municipalities of kandi and ségbana to the west by the municipality of karimama and to the east by the federal republic of nigeria the municipality is located in the sudano sahelian zone of benin with only one rainy season which lasts for 5 6 months from may to october with a rainfall range between 700 mm and 1000 mm this low rainfall negatively affects agricultural production especially rice malanville is characterized by high level of food insecurity and poverty table 1 the majority of its inhabitants are involved in subsistence agriculture and other economic activities such as fishing livestock rearing small business trade and crafts the major crops grown are maize rice millet sorghum cotton and vegetables the municipality of malanville was chosen for this study for three main reasons first it is the largest rice producing area in benin second it is crossed by the niger river and its tributaries which offer an important opportunity for rice production and third among other rice irrigation schemes developed by the state the irrigation scheme at malanville is the most important in terms of size and yield the total irrigable land under the scheme is 516 ha of which 400 ha were cultivated in 2015 the average rice yield under the scheme is about 5 7 mt ha the irrigation scheme of malanville was constructed in 1970 and the water used is pumped from the niger river and distributed into the farms through surface canals there are approximately 1054 rice farmers operating on the scheme in 2015 four districts out of five in the municipality were selected for the survey based on distance to the irrigation scheme and on the size of rice production districts selected were garou guene malanville and tombouctou in each of these districts two villages one high rice producing village and one low rice producing village were purposively selected with the help of the extension officers in total eight villages within the four districts were selected for the survey 3 2 sampling design and data collection there were two groups of respondents considered for this study the irrigation farmers who produce rice under irrigation in the formal irrigation scheme of malanville and the dry land farmers producing rice under rainfed condition in the same municipality 34 reveals that about 9 of the rice farm population in benin are irrigation farmers and the rest are under rainfed condition based on the prevalence of irrigation and rainfed farmers the optimal sample size required to produce accurate results was determined for each group of farmers using 10 sample size formula we obtained an optimal sample size of 126 for irrigation farmers and 359 for dry land farmers oversampling was done and hence 150 irrigation farmers and 540 dry land farmers were finally chosen a large sample size minimizes sampling error practically a list of irrigation farmers was obtained from the committee in charge of the management of the irrigation scheme of malanville farmers from the scheme are in groups of 20 100 people with a total of 24 groups to ensure a fair representation a proportional sampling technique was used to select 150 irrigation farmers further the dry land farmers were selected from the eight villages covered by the survey for this group the approximate list of the rice farmers was provided by the chief of the village ninety 90 farmers were randomly selected in each high rice producing village and 45 farmers were also randomly selected in each low rice producing village totaling to 540 dry land farmers the total number of respondents interviewed for the survey was 690 rice producers comprising of 150 irrigation farmers and 540 dry land farmers farm level data was collected between april and june 2015 3 3 method of analysis 3 3 1 framework for the measurement of food insecurity under the rasch model the food insecurity experience scale fies is an experience based measure of severity of food insecurity it comprises a set of eight questions table 2 that the respondents were directly asked about their experiences associated with increasing difficulties in food access due to resource constraints the questionnaire is very simple to apply at a fairly low cost and with less time responses were coded as yes 1 for an affirmative value and no 0 for a negative value the rasch model 45 programmed in r package was used to analyze the data it provides a theoretical framework for models that use questionnaire items measuring the same latent trait 21 44 compared to the other related item response models the rash model is more appropriate for use in small samples and allow to assess the relative contribution of each item to the latent variable measured 32 50 in rasch modelling the likelihood that a subject with ability b h responds correctly to a test items characterized by difficulty level a i is a logistic function of the difference between b h and a i 1 p r o b x h i 1 b h a i f b h a i e b h a i 1 e b h a i the underlying assumptions of the rasch model are that the items within the questionnaire are uni dimensional the probability that a respondent affirms an item is a logistic function of experienced food insecurity all items within the questionnaire discriminate equally meaning that they are equally and strongly associated with the latent trait and the items are conditionally independent 21 42 before the validation of the results the items were subjected to a test that indicates whether the responses fit the assumptions of the rasch model after testing the rasch model assumptions for all rice farmers separate test was done for irrigated and rainfed rice farmers to compare the psychometric characteristics of the two sub groups within the sample the idea is to ensure that all items are strong indicators of food insecurity for the two sub groups before starting any comparison between them two statistics commonly used as indices of fit of the items and of the individuals are item infit and item outfit both compare observed deviations of responses from the deviations expected under rasch assumptions 24 31 42 item infit is calculated as follows 2 i n f i t i 1 n x i h p i h 2 1 n p i h p i h 2 item outfit is defined as follows 3 o u t f i t i 1 n 1 n x i h p i h 2 p i h p i h 2 where x i h is the observed response of farmer h to item i p i h is the probability of an affirmative response by farmer h to item i and n is the total number of farmers when the responses fit the model perfectly the value of infit and outfit are 1 values above 1 indicate items that are weakly related to the food insecurity and values below 1 show items that are more strongly related to food insecurity 44 42 in practical analysis the recommended value for fit statistics ranges from 0 8 to 1 2 and a wider acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 21 44 42 the raw score is a sufficient statistic for food insecurity measurement when the conditions of the rasch model are met 19 20 5 42 therefore the respondent s maximum food insecurity scale is 8 for farmers who provide an affirmative response to all eight questions and the minimum scale is 0 for farmers who provide negative answers to all eight questions the higher the score the more food insecurity the farmer experiences the score 0 corresponds to high food security the score of 1 3 corresponds to marginal food security the score 4 6 corresponds to moderate food insecurity and the score 7 8 corresponds to severe food insecurity 5 19 20 42 3 3 2 econometric analysis of the effect of irrigation adoption on food security based on their food security status fs farmers were classified as follows 1 for severe food insecurity 2 for moderate food insecurity 3 for marginal food security and 4 for high food security then the appropriate model to estimate is an ordered response model this is employed to take advantage of the ordinal nature of the food security categories 37 for instance a farmer in moderate food insecurity category is worse off than a farmer in the marginal and high food security categories but he is better off than a farmer in a severe food insecurity category therefore grouping moderate and severe food insecurity into a single food insecure category can be misleading because it fails to distinguish between serious and less serious conditions of food insecurity the ordered response model is an extension of the binary response model by adding multiple cutoff points assuming that the latent variable fs is determined by the regression relationship 4 f s β x ε where x is a vector of independents variables with the corresponding parameter vector β ε refers to the error term which is assumed normally distributed in practice f s is unobservable the observed aspect of food security can be written as 5 f s 1 i f f s μ 1 2 i f μ 1 f s μ 2 3 i f μ 2 f s μ 3 4 i f f s μ 3 where μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are the cutoff points with the four categories of the food security model three cutoff points are estimated by assuming a normal distribution function form an ordered probit model was estimated finally to control for the selection bias that may arise since participation in an irrigation project is not random and purposive targeting and self selection occurs an ordered probit model with sample selection was estimated this is a generalization of the classical 26 two steps selection model to ordered categorical outcomes 9 argue that the two step estimator is more robust and is a better choice for practical applications variables included in the ordered probit model are socio economic characteristics such as age gender education level informal training and geographical location of the farmer farm inputs such as crop variety fertilizer herbicide adoption of irrigation and institutional variables such as access to extension services and credit farm income and off farm income were also included in the model as wealth status indicators the main hypothesis is that adoption of irrigation contributes to reduce food insecurity in benin previous studies 52 7 3 nkhata et al 2014 49 have shown positive relationship between adoption of irrigation and food security it is also hypothesized that use of the other agricultural inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed positively affects farmer s food security status 37 have shown that the use of fertilizer and improved seed leads to reducing food insecurity through increased production positive effects of the wealth proxy variables on the food security status of a farmer was expected study by ref 51 showed that the socio economic variables such as age education and income are positively correlated with household welfare it is also expected that due to the low level of literacy table 1 above in the municipality of malanville farmers who do not have formal education but have gone through an a form of informal training such as carpentry engineering mason dress making hairdressing among others will have high probability of being food secure 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics comparison of the socio economic characteristics of irrigation and dry land farmers are reported in table 3 all the differences discussed are statistically significant irrigators were relatively younger compared to dry land farmers suggesting that young farmers are likely to adopt irrigation few female farmers 25 were involved in rice production irrigators used more inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed than the dry land farmers this implies that adoption of irrigation is likely to lead to intensive use of inputs and technologies this result is in line with previous finding by emerick et al 59 irrigators have better institutional support than the dry land farmers the majority 94 of irrigators had access to extension services while only 49 of the dry land farmers had about 87 of irrigators received credit against 54 of dry land farmers higher proportion of irrigators had an informal training compared to dry land farmers irrigators earn higher off farm income than the dry land farmers they earn about 71 more in off farm income than the dry land farmers 4 2 meeting the rasch model assumptions and analysis of food security distribution assessing the extent to which the data are consistent with the rasch model assumptions is an important step in the validation of the food security data 42 table 4 presents the affirmative responses and items severity for both irrigated and rainfed rice farmers in overall about 69 of the surveyed rice farmers reported that they were worried not having enough food to eat 44 ran out of food and 23 went without eating for a whole day at some time during the last year because they lacked food or money for food comparisons of affirmative responses between irrigation and dry land farmers show that a relatively higher percentage of dry land farmers have affirmed each item than the irrigation farmers the frequency of the affirmative response to the items is an inverse function of the items severity this decreases as the severity of the items increases also in all cases it is observed that less severe items had lower measure values of severity than the more severe items for instance the item ran out of food has a lower measure value than items hungry but did not eat and went without eating for a whole day but has a higher measure value than the item worried to run out of food item infit values ranged from 0 73 to 1 29 for all rice farmers and also for irrigated and rainfed rice farmers table 5 this is outside the appropriate range of 0 8 1 2 but still within the acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 overall item outfit values were within the acceptable range of 0 7 1 3 except for the irrigated rice farmers where these values were elevated for the least severe item worried to run out of food indicating few highly unexpected responses 44 42 47 given the good infit statistics for all items the elevated outfit statistics may not threat the suitability of the data and do not indicate any serious violation of the rasch model assumptions 47 the item fit statistics indicate that the 8 items considered are independent of one another and they measure the same construct then they are strong indicators for food insecurity measurement this confirms the suitability of the data in fitting rasch modelling to measure food insecurity therefore the raw score is a sufficient indicator of food insecurity experience scale among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville table 6 summarizes the distribution of the raw score and the food security status among irrigation and dry land farmers in the municipality of malanville in all 15 of the surveyed rice farmers were classified into the high food security category 36 28 and 21 of irrigation and dry land farmers were in the marginal food security moderate food insecurity and severe food insecurity categories respectively regarding the farming system 21 of the irrigation farmers and 13 of the dry land farmers were in the high food security category while about 20 of irrigators and 22 of dry land farmers were in the severe food insecurity category the aggregate distribution shows that about 60 of the irrigation farmers against 46 of the dry land farmers were food secure these results reveal that while food security is still a challenge among rice farmers a large percentage of dry land farmers experience food insecurity than irrigated rice farmers irrigation farmers show a higher level of food security than dry land farmers holding other factors constant one may deduce that irrigation adoption contributes to reduce food insecurity among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville see table 7 food secured farmers have higher farm income and off farm income than the non food secured farmers the food secured farmers used more intensive inputs fertilizer herbicide and improved seed than the non food secured farmers intensive use of inputs leads to increased production which in turn is positively correlated with food security about 70 of the food secured farmers had access to credit against 52 of the non secured farmers this implies that access to credit is positively associated to food security higher proportion of food secured farmers 45 are educated compared to the non food secured farmers 25 this suggests positive correlation between education and food security more educated farmers are likely to be food secure 4 3 effects of irrigation adoption on food security the estimates of the ordered probit model with sample selection are reported in table 8 following 6 and 54 the endogeneity of farm income 3 3 the endogeneity of farm income comes from the fact that it is linked to inputs seed credit fertilizer herbicide among others through a production function was controlled using the expected values as follows 1 farm income was regressed on the exogenous explanatory variables 2 expected values were obtained and 3 the food security equation was estimated using the expected values of farm income as an instrument for observed values this procedure is more efficient than the two stage least squares 2sls technique and the control function approach 56 6 54 the results of the selection equation is not presented since this is not the primary objective of the study 4 4 interested readers may read 41 the chi square test is significant at 1 indicating the significance of the overall model the estimated cut off points satisfy the conditions that μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 this implies that the four categories of the food security differ and should be included in the model the coefficient of the inverse mills ratio lambda is significant suggesting the presence of selection bias which is controlled through the two step procedure interactive terms of key agricultural inputs were included in the model to assess how the combination of these inputs may affect food security status of the farmers the district of malanville was chosen as reference for comparison across districts of the effect of variables included in the model because the rice irrigation scheme is located in that district the marginal effects are interpreted relative to the food security category and the sign table 9 the results table 9 show that the prevalence of food insecurity differs among districts relative to the farmers in the districts of garou guene and tombouctou living in the district of malanville decreases the probability of being in severe and moderate food insecurity categories while increasing the probability of being in marginal and high food security categories however the effect is significant only for the district of guene farmers in the districts of guene are about 53 more likely to be in severe food insecurity category and 42 less likely to be in the high food security category than farmers in the district of malanville table 9 with regard to this one explanation to the difference in food security status among districts could be the presence of the irrigation scheme in the district of malanville allowing irrigation farmers to produce even during the dry season and also provision of more institutional support in terms of access to productive inputs and rice marketing consistent with this adoption of irrigation has a positive and significant effect on the food security status of the farmer table 8 this decreases the probability of a farmer being in severe food insecurity category by about 58 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 46 table 9 the implication is that the adoption of irrigation contributes to reduce food insecurity among the rice farmers this is in line with majority of studies 36 52 51 7 3 22 39 49 dealing with the effect of irrigation on food security in addition to the use of water irrigation farmers benefit from more support such as extension services use of improved seed and access to fertilizer and credit the results also reveal that the interaction terms between adoption of irrigation and access to fertilizer and credit are positive and significant demonstrating that the adoption of irrigation accompanied by access to fertilizer and credit decrease the probability of a farmer being in severe and moderate food insecure categories while increasing the probability of being in marginal and high food secure categories positive sign was also observed for the interaction between extension services and use of improved seed this means that the effect of adoption is larger for farmers that received extension services and used improved seed than farmers who did not negative sign was found for the interactions of the variables fertilizer and access to credit and use of improved seed and herbicide this implies that the effect of adoption is smaller for farmers who use fertilizer but lack credit and also for farmers that used improved seed and lack herbicide so in addition to the use of irrigation water accessibility to extension services fertilizer credit and improved seed variety should be key policy focus for agricultural development in benin apart from adoption of irrigation the other farm input variables have significant effect on food security status among rice farmers in the municipality of malanville use of fertilizer herbicide and improved seed variety are farm input variables that positively affect food security status of the farmer for instance the use of improved seed decreases the probability of being in severe food insecurity category by about 38 and increases the probability of being in high food security category by about 30 table 9 the results also indicate that the return from the use of improved seed is less in the district of garou guene and tombouctou than in the district of malanville there was no significant difference in the return from the use of herbicides between malanville and the district of tombouctou while in the districts of garou and guene the return is less compared to the district of malanville regarding the institutional variables access to credit decreases the probability of a farmer being in the severe food insecurity category by about 21 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 16 similarly access to extension services decreases the probability of a farmer being in the severe food insecurity category by about 32 while increasing the probability of being in high food security category by about 25 it is observed that the return from access to extension services is higher in malanville than in the districts of garou guene and tombouctou no significant difference was found among the four districts in terms of return from access to credit the amount of farm and off farm income have an effect of decreasing the probability of being in severe or moderate food insecurity categories and increasing the probability of being in marginal or high food security categories as highlighted in the conceptual framework fig 1 the development of irrigation schemes can also attract a vibrant services sector which may provide off farm income opportunities to farmers and contributes to increased total income this supports the argument that irrigation cannot be introduced in a vacuum without encouraging surrounding service sectors 58 theoretically these results imply that farmers with high farm and off farm income are likely to be food secure one reason is that as income increases the farmers may have more money for food other goods and farm investments increased education level of farmers also decreases the probability of being in severe or moderate food insecurity categories and increases the probability of being in marginal or high food security categories compared to uneducated farmers those that have attained at least primary school have a higher probability of being food secure this result implies that education is important for improving the food security status of farmers as the educated farmers are more likely to be food secure the importance of informal training in reducing food insecurity was also stressed in this study in the municipality of malanville where only about 14 of the population are literate 28 informal training is an option for improving food security farmers who have attained informal training have higher probability of being in the food secure category the major informal training reported by the surveyed farmers are carpentry mason or construction works engineering and dress making the findings of this study suggest that the development of irrigation schemes have helped enhancing food security in benin previous studies 27 14 have shown that irrigation adoption reduces risk of crop failure leads to food security through higher productivity and income 12 reported that the irrigation schemes did not only contribute to increased food security but also profited surrounding communities who were not in the schemes irrigators benefit more from institutional support services in terms of access to extension services and credit and use of farm inputs the results support the idea that the development of irrigation schemes lead to crowding in of inputs and technologies 59 the findings also suggest that irrigation schemes offer opportunities for employment through increased demand for inputs and supply of output this therefore helps farmers in diversifying income sources for greater impact of irrigation on food security there is a need for complementary inputs services policies and institutional support measures previous studies 23 38 argue that impacts of investments in irrigation schemes on crop productivity food security and poverty reduction are greater where institutional support measures and complementary policies and infrastructure are available while the findings of this study support our hypotheses and expectations further research might test the robustness of our findings using different data set such as panel data furthermore further research may also consider other outcomes of irrigation adoption such as income diversification and explore the spillover effects related to changes in food prices 5 concluding remarks the motivation of this study was to demonstrate the significance of the linkage between irrigation and food security using the irrigation scheme of malanville benin as an empirical case study questionnaire on food insecurity experiences were administered to 690 rice farmers and rasch modelling was used to assess the validity of the farmers responses to items after fitting rasch model assumptions with the overall rice farmers separate assessment was done for the irrigation and dry land rice farmers this shows that both irrigators and dry land farmers responses to food insecurity questionnaire fit the rasch model assumptions descriptive statistics analysis of food security status of the farmers shows that about 60 of the irrigated rice farmers and 46 of the rainfed rice farmers were food secure indicating that irrigators were more food secure than dry land farmers the statistical results were confirmed by an estimation of ordered probit model with sample selection which demonstrates a positive relationship between irrigation and food security other variables that influence food security include educational level access to credit use of improved seed access to extension services fertilizer and herbicide farm income off farm income and informal training the study concludes that investment in irrigation is a potential avenue for reducing food insecurity in benin efforts to rehabilitate current irrigation scheme and develop other schemes should be intensified however importance should be given to other factors that affect food insecurity thus there is an urgent need to improve farmers access to farm inputs credit and extension services with these complementary actions food insecurity could be reduced among rice

companies whose revenue derives largely from the potable and wastewater industry our interest stems from the fact that the demand for water and water related products is increasing mainly driven by agriculture and energy withdrawals which in their turn are also likely to increase in the future as pointed out by recent research 1 this will generate a pressure for expansion of the water industry that will be called to satisfy the growing needs of agriculture and energy in fact agriculture accounts for the 70 of water consumption used for irrigation livestock crops and non food crops production processes demand for food is expected to increase by 35 by 2030 due to global growth and changes in lifestyles and this will consequently increase the demand for water 2 the energy sector on the other hand is the second largest consumer of water for cooling at thermal power plants water withdrawals by the energy sector will increase as well in fact energy prices fluctuations and political considerations are generating demand for alternative energy sources that may imply intensive water usage such as hydroelectric energy but also biofuels and shale gas 1 3 5 as well as energy saving techniques 6 water scarcity and growing demand together with sustainability issues 1 1 for an overview of water agriculture and energy sustainability issues see bazilian et al 2011 7 elobeid et al 2013 8 peri et al 2014 9 will drive an increase in the demand for water related infrastructures products and services to optimize the use of the resources in order to meet this growing demand companies will have to make considerable investments and will consequently need a huge amount of funds in the water industry companies have traditionally covered their financial needs with transfers taxes and tariffs 3ts which however will not be sufficient to support the strong development required to face all the above mentioned challenges 10 given the scarcity of public funds policy intervention could be aimed at promoting and supporting the development of an additional form of finance to be channelled into the industry 11 funds may come from capital markets for instance through the issue of bonds or equities and understanding the stock price dynamics of this growing industry can inspire capital allocation decisions of investors and financial institutions indeed considering that stock prices can be viewed as the expression of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may incorporate the growth expectations of the water business into rising water stock prices related to the growing demand for water related products services and infrastructures increasing the efficiency of production processes and developing new technologies additionally as highlighted by jin et al 2015 12 evidence on risk returns of water stock investments is lacking within this framework and considering that according to financial theory stock prices may convey information about the expected expansion of the industry 13 to accomplish our aim we use a multifactor market model where agriculture and energy prices are used as specific common macroeconomic sources of risk for the water industry according to the above described mechanism specifically we use a multifactor market model with state space time varying betas estimated using kalman filter to monitor the effect of risk factors over time this approach is particularly valuable because it enables to study the dynamics of the water stock price and hence evaluate how the latter is affected by agriculture and energy price movements for the water industry we use the s p global water index that provides liquid and tradable exposure to 50 companies from around the world that are involved in water related businesses for the agriculture and energy sectors we use two sub indexes of s p gs commodity index the s p agriculture livestock index and the s p energy index we use daily data spanning from november 19 2001 to march 20 2014 results highlight that agriculture and energy prices are significant risk factors affecting water stock prices and have a time varying behavior especially during the 2008 economic and financial crisis we contribute to the existing literature by providing first insights on the simultaneous effect of agriculture and energy prices on water stock index prices to our knowledge studies have so far analyzed the economic relation only between pairs of sectors or the technical relationship between the three and hence none of the studies takes our perspective we argue that understanding this relationship is of great importance from an economic environmental and ethical perspective as recently outlined by many international organizations 1 2 14 it may help policy makers in the decision process and in the design of appropriate policies aimed at contributing to the development and to the promotion of innovation of the water industry as well as at fostering the channel of additional finance the paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on the water sector and earlier literature section 3 presents the research methodology section 4 describes the data section 5 reports and discusses the results and section 6 draws the main conclusions 2 background the water sector represents an enormous set of different firms and operators that deal with water supply water use and wastewater handling to refer more properly to the water business the term hydrocommerce is sometimes used because of the magnitude of the business its boundaries are not easy to define and its actual size is difficult to determine both in terms of number of firms and in terms of counter value according to recent estimates there are at least 400 public companies operating in the water business in the world with a 900 billion market capitalization and these figures are destined to grow in the future 15 the activities of water related businesses are peculiar because of the characteristics of the resource they manage and treat i e water indeed water has no substitute and it is essential to life this makes its demand increase over time as the population grows while supply remains fixed although water covers most of the globe with a total volume of 1 4 billion km3 the volume of freshwater is only 2 5 of the total around 35 million km3 and the latter is not equally distributed on earth around 70 of water is in form of ice and snow 30 is groundwater and only the 0 3 is represented by lakes and rivers these water basins in most cases are shared between nations and this creates further tensions and difficulties in accessing the resource 1 according to fao estimates 16 around 45 of the world freshwater is in the americas 28 in asia 15 5 in europe and the remaining is located in africa 9 3 and oceania 2 1 data highlight the imbalances between demand and supply of freshwater around the globe with asia accounting for more than 60 of the population with only 28 of resources africa also lives a shortage in water it hosts the 15 of world inhabitants and has access to less than 10 of freshwater the situation is made more severe by its arid climate which characterizes especially the north of the continent the already limited availability of freshwater is likely to further diminish in the next years because of climate changes increasing needs for a growing population and an ageing infrastructure that will have to be repaired or substituted 17 it is estimated that in 2050 more than half of the population will be short of water 15 together with natural scarcity also economic scarcity exists in areas where water is abundant relative to demand but malnutrition still exists depending on socio economic conditions lack of water management and of proper infrastructures 1 2 1 the water industry companies in the water sector play an important role in developing new technologies and processes for water sanitation storage distribution reuse and recycle infrastructures need to be replaced and this will increase the request for pipes pumps valves and other related goods collection and storage will involve the creation of new tanks and groundwater banks while existing dams will need intervention new technologies will help in the reuse and recycle of water in order to optimize the use of the resources 18 in this sense it is believed that incremental innovation will play a major role in the sector 19 additionally management tools including the activities of data collection data analysis regulation and governance need to be developed 1 these are essential to accurately estimate the quantity and quality of water available and to manage the resource effectively taking into account increasing uncertainty and risks in order to pursue all the above mentioned challenges the industry needs additional capital and funds for instance in africa one of the most water stressed area of the globe water and sanitation spending needs for the period 2006 2015 were estimated to be 22 6 billion per year around 3 3 of africa s gdp of which more than 15 billion for investments and the remaining for water maintenance 5 7 billion and sanitation maintenance 1 4 billion 20 additional 18 billion us dollars are required for small scale irrigation and 2 7 billion for large scale irrigation systems for the next fifty years 1 tariffs taxation and transfers from institutions are not sufficient to guarantee future investments in the industry indeed public contribution in the future might be limited funds are scarce and their use needs to be optimized in fact although water is commonly perceived as a public good and public intervention in the past has been heavy forecasts show that the huge amount of capital needed by the industry cannot be exclusively provided by the public sector and more private intervention is expected even recent analysis of water governance arrangements in oecd countries flagged the lack of finance as a major and recurrent gap in water policies 11 indeed in the last few years the water industry has started attracting interest by numerous types of investors such as private equity and venture capital funds but also etfs hedge funds and wealthy individuals 2 2 according to the statistics provided by state street global advisors the total aum of the 7 etfs on water businesses amount to 1199 million around 0 07 of the total aum invested in equity in the developed markets among the us listed etfs the three etfs first trust ise water index fiw powershare global water pio and guggenheim s p global water index etf cgw have an overall market capitalization of 827 million on a total market capitalization of the etfs in the us of 1450 72 billion according to xtf these investors can provide funds for the different activities related to water withdrawal storage distribution and reuse and recycle with reference to this issue roca et al 2013 22 examined the portfolio returns of water investments and find that this industry outperforms traditional assets and enables better diversification especially during times of market stress also jin et al 2014 23 find similar results in this regard to date markets have developed some instruments specifically designed to cope with the challenges set by the climate change 3 3 for a discussion of green bonds see flaherty et al 2016 21 and with reference to the water industry some indexes follow exclusively the dynamics of the water sector besides the ones which include water business in the utilities universe e g the s p global water index the nasdaq water index the ise water index etc as also underlined by rompotis 2009 the advantage of investing in a water index is to gain exposure to the entire water market rather than in a specific water company indeed most of the indexes include firms that operate in the water and wastewater industry according to the broad definition of hydrocommerce to enable investments in the water indexes a number of exchange traded funds etfs have been created in order to track their trends and benefit from the expected expansion of the industry e g the ishares global water etf the invesco powershares global water resources the lyxor etf world water etc 2 2 earlier literature recent empirical papers provide only a few attempts at frameworks aimed at analyzing the effect of agriculture or energy on the water sector from an economic perspective and on a global scale generally this topic was analyzed in the literature following different approaches technical or economic and different fields of application or points of view agricultural to water energy to water separately or jointly agriculture and energy to water the technical approach has been addressed more often to analyze the relationship between energy and water studies mainly focus on energy consumption and water use applying life cycle evaluation or numerical simulation 24 25 26 27 among the most recent papers focusing on the energy water nexus gu et al 2014 6 use input output tables to describe the supply consumption relationship between water supply and primary energy sectors while nogueira vilanova and perrella balestrieri 2015 28 focus on the case of brazil works considering jointly agriculture energy and water are less common among others see refs 8 9 29 31 these studies analyze the technical connection that exists between the three elements in order to highlight the need for a joint policy aimed at ensuring a sustainable development conversely the studies following a strictly economic approach focus only on pairs of relationships separately i e agriculture water or energy water as far as agriculture and water few studies deal with the effect of agricultural prices on water demand and management lipton et al 2003 32 find that the decline in investment in irrigation is largely ascribed to the falling economic rate of return of irrigation projects and this is in part due to declining agricultural prices together with technical reasons this would mean that in a world with falling agricultural prices water companies have fewer resources to be invested and this in the end would bring to declining revenues for water companies that finally translate into decreasing stock prices in the same fashion the work by bjornlund and rossini 2005 33 and brennan 2006 34 find that water demand is positively related to commodity prices although the latter appears to be less important than water scarcity von braun 2008 35 states that the food price crisis has increased competition for land and water resources for agriculture and declining capital for long term investment due to the credit crunch has resulted in a re evaluation of natural resources finally wheeler et al 2008 36 use a wide variety of agricultural prices to estimate water allocation but they find that none displayed any significance in their model because of the relationships above described and summarizing the contribution of the literature we can expect that increasing agricultural prices will generate a pressure on the water industry for developing more efficient water distribution techniques that will yield in the last instance to investments and higher returns in the water industry 2 h1 agriculture price trends positively influence water stock returns a wider strand of literature focusing on pricing issue in the water sector has provided numerous contributions but lies beyond our scope the reader might refer to bar shira et al 2006 37 galioto et al 2013 38 vasileiou et al 2014 39 yang et al 2003 40 additionally other studies with a microeconomic approach study the firm specific determinants of the water industry stock returns 22 41 in particular roca et al 2015 41 analyze the impact of balance sheet variables on the wowax index and find that sales and administration expenses and account receivables have a positive impact on abnormal returns while ebit account payable and labor force have a negative one to the best of knowledge there are only two studies considering the economic relation in energy water that directly focus on the impact of energy prices on water sector 3 42 the authors find that rising energy prices increase costs for water extraction and conveyance thus altering water allocation and distribution indeed energy is an input in the water business as such rising energy prices increase the marginal cost of water with a depressing effect on profitability and as a consequence on water stock prices these considerations bring us to elaborate the following hypothesis h2a energy price trends negatively influence water stock returns despite this the effect of energy on water stock prices is still an understudied issue and factual explanations suggest that also a positive relationship may hold in fact a positive relationship would mean that the energy sector is a demand source of water which is employed for production purposes e g shale gas this increased demand translates into higher water stock prices because of the financial mechanisms already explained above additionally the development of technologies to extract water more cheaply and transport water more efficiently can offset the effects of rising energy prices which are expected to induce adoption of new and better technologies stimulating investments and future revenues in the water industry that are incorporated in rising stock returns h2b energy price trends positively influence water stock returns the novelty of our paper is to provide first insights on the economic relation not only between energy and water or agriculture and water but considering how both agriculture and energy simultaneously influence the water sector using water stock prices 3 the multifactor market model 3 1 theoretical approach to analyze the impact of agricultural and energy price trends on the share price value of water companies we use a multifactor market model multifactor models are an extension of single factor capital asset pricing model capm as known the single factor capm model uses only the market index while multifactor models employ a multidimensional set of common factors in addition to the market factor to explain the performance of a security or a portfolio of securities the basic idea behind these models is that the common variation in asset returns is determined by multiple common components or risk factors 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 for recent empirical applications see 51 52 53 54 55 56 the general form of a multifactor model is 1 rt a b1 f1t b2 f2t bifit bn fnt et with t 1 t where i 1 n number of factors rt excess equity returns at time t fit factor i at time t bi sensitivity of the returns to changes in factor i et random component among the several characterizations of the multifactor models i e macroeconomic fundamental momentum or statistical factors 57 58 59 this study employs a macroeconomic approach the use of multifactor models with macroeconomic factors is common in the empirical literature on the stock prices of commodity related industries among others sadorsky and henriques 2001 61 apply a multifactor market model to evaluate the returns of canadian paper and forest products companies the factors are commodity prices returns together with market index returns interest rates and exchange rates also boyer and filion 2007 62 use a multifactor market model with macroeconomic factors to test the dynamics of canadian oil and gas stocks prices using crude oil return and natural gas returns the market return exchange rates while ramos and vega 2011 63 use market portfolio currency rates and oil prices to investigate oil and gas industry returns in developed and emerging markets among the most recent analyses that apply the multifactor model mo et al 2012 54 choose four factors to proxy the performance of european electricity corporations overall market return electricity price changes oil price changes and eua eu emission allowance price changes the model in addition to the market factor selects two specific common macroeconomic sources of risks that best fit the analysis framework energy and agriculture price trends this choice is justified by the following considerations oil price is generally included among the set of systematic risk factors since fluctuations in energy prices can be expected to have an effect on security prices given the global economy relies on oil as a major energy resource its fluctuations and effects can be severe especially in extreme market conditions 60 besides energy for the specific purpose of this study the price of agriculture commodities is introduced in the model as a further common factor that can have an impact on water companies equity returns the model is hence specified as follows 2 y t α β 1 x 1 t β 2 x 2 t β 3 x 3 t e t with t 1 t yt is the excess daily return on the water stock index x1 is the excess daily return to the market index x2 is the daily return to agricultural prices x3 is the daily return to energy prices and et is the idiosyncratic error β1 is the market beta β2 is the agricultural beta that is the sensitivity of water stock index to agricultural price changes and β3 is the energy beta that is the sensitivity of water stock index to energy prices changes excess returns are measured by daily indexes returns minus the three month us treasury bill rate that is commonly employed in the literature as a reference for the free risk rate of return 4 4 see also the webpage by kenneth french http mba tuck dartmouth edu pages faculty ken french data library html who employs us t bill for the computation of european and developed markets factors we thank an anonymous referee for remarking this given that we use daily data 5 5 data are better described in section 4 we expect that the series exhibit volatility across time and that the conditional variance during some periods may be unusually large in this case heteroscedasticity could lead to incorrect inferences and employing estimation methods that use conditional variances appears more appropriate for this type of data between several approaches dealing with heteroscedasticity the generalized arch garch model allows the conditional variance to follow an arma process for both auto regressive and moving average components in the heteroscedastic variance because of these reasons this paper uses garch 1 1 to estimate the variance covariance matrix of returns in order to obtain the estimates of beta we consider the following specification 3 y t βx t e t 4 σ t 2 ω α e t 1 2 γ σ t 1 2 eq 3 is the mean equation yt is the dependent variable x ts are regressors as in eq 2 and et is the error term eq 4 is the variance equation σ2 t is the one period ahead forecast variance based on past information and it is called the conditional variance ω is the constant term e2 t 1 is the arch term and σ2 t 1 is the garch term 3 2 time varying betas when applying the capm in its basic form it is generally assumed that the beta coefficients are constant over time however betas can vary because of several factors such as the leverage effect induced by fluctuations of stock prices information asymmetries in the market the dependence of systematic risk on the level of the risk free interest rate which also changes over time see 58 for a general overview additionally also econometric arguments support time variation in betas as the stylized fact of volatility clustering although a number of studies have questioned the stability of betas only a few authors explicitly model the time varying behavior of systematic risk also thanks to more recent advancement in estimation techniques 53 64 69 this study considers the case for non constant betas to this end we employ a three step procedure first we use estimation methodologies for regression models which allow for a change in betas according to the bai 1997 64 and bai and perron 1998 70 techniques they perform linear regression models that are subject to structural changes where regime breakpoints are not known and specified a priori but are estimated in particular we use a pure breakpoint specification in which all of the regressors have regime specific coefficients varying between regimes garch approach is used in this step second the evolution of the relationship between excess returns in the water industry and betas is traced using rolling ols estimates this procedure tracks an evolving system i e time varying parameters and allows evaluating the evolution of the relation of the series over time requiring the definition of the length of a rolling window third we employ the state space representation to treat the time varying coefficients to allow the direct estimation of the time varying betas in fact although various models have been developed to allow the coefficients to follow a dynamic process the literature finds evidence that the state space model provides more accurate estimates of systematic risk when using daily market data 71 73 this model was introduced in the sixties in the engineering field and only after many years it has been used in economics due to the computational complexity surveys on the applicability of the state space approach to economics and finance can be found in hamilton 1994 74 and kim and nelson 1989 75 in agricultural economics the space state models became popular mainly around the nineties see bessler et al 2010 for a review 76 while the model has been applied to energy issues only more recently see 77 78 79 80 also in the financial field applications are various among the most recent contributions al anaswah and wilfling 2011 81 use the methodology to study the behavior of speculative bubbles on stock markets while berger and pozzi 2013 82 study the time varying degree of world stock market integration in the latest forty years using a state space approach following these consideration we model eq 2 in the state space form as follows 6 6 in its general form the state space model of eq 3 is as follows a r t α t k 1 3 β k t f k t ε t b α t α t 1 υ t υ n 0 σ υ 2 c β k t β k t 1 η t η t n 0 q where εt t and ηt are errors terms normally distributed and serially uncorrelated with zero mean and variances σ2 ε and σ2 υ and diagonal covariance matrix q respectively equation a is called observation equation and relates the observed variables to the unobserved state vector while eq b and c formulate the dynamics of the state variables 5 watert αt βm t s pt βa t agrt βe t energyt εt where the dependent variable and the factors are the same as in eq 2 αt βm t βa t and βe t are the time varying coefficients and are assumed to evolve as a pure random walk the unknown parameters in such a system can be estimated via the kalman filter a very powerful and flexible recursive algorithm that compute the optimal estimates of the state variables for each period t conditional on the information set available at time t see refs 83 84 for use in econometrics we use this technique to calculate maximum likelihood estimates of σ ε 2 σ ν 2 and q to obtain the filtered values of αt and βk t variables we set the initial one step ahead predicted values for the state variables equal to the ols estimates from the static model in eq 3 4 data the analysis presented in this paper makes use of daily data supplied by datastream thomson reuters and spanning from november 19 2001 to march 20 2014 for a total of 3 219 observations the water series is the s p global water index that is composed of 50 liquid and tradable companies from around the world that are involved in water businesses specifically the 50 constituents of the index are equally distributed between two distinct clusters of water related activities water utilities infrastructure water supply water utilities wastewater treatment water purification water well drilling water testing water sewer and pipeline construction and water equipment materials water treatment chemicals water treatment appliances pumps and pumping equipment plumbing pipes fluid power pumps and motors fluid meters and counting devices of the 50 constituents 22 were from the us and weighted for more than 39 on overall capitalization the total market capitalization of each constituent is greater than 250 million the median market capitalization is slightly above 3 000 million stocks are traded on developed market exchanges the index is capitalization weighted that is the components are weighted according to the total market value of their outstanding shares the series is price indexes expressive of the dynamics of stock prices alone and without the component of income represented by the distribution of dividends 7 7 the choice of the s p global water index has been determined by various considerations on the quality of the index and on the evaluation of the characteristics of the other indexes available s p global water provides exposure to a higher number of companies operating in the water related business if compared to other indexes like the nasdaq omx global water or the ise water index additionally despite not being the oldest index on water it is the index we identified on the markets as the most often used as benchmark for water etfs while for instance the ise water index is replicated by only an etf to the best of our knowledge for agriculture and energy sectors we used two sub indexes of s p gs commodity index specifically we collect the spot index a measure of the level of nearby commodity prices for agriculture livestock and energy both the indexes are calculated primarily on a world production weighted basis and comprise the principal physical commodities that are the subject of active liquid futures markets 8 8 the s p gsci agriculture and livestock index comprises the following index components wheat corn soybeans cotton sugar coffee cocoa feeder cattle live cattle and lean hogs while the s p gsci energy index comprises wti crude oil brent crude oil rbob gas heating oil gas oil and natural gas the weight of each commodity in the index is determined by the average quantity of production over the last five years of available data moreover as reported by the s p company to be included in the commodity index the commodity must be denominated in us dollars but traded in a trading venue located in one of the oecd countries given the above the water agriculture and energy indexes show coherence in terms of coverage of markets we also use the s p 500 to measure the equity market performance of global markets this index represents one of the most common benchmarks used in the literature to evaluate the performance of a global investment strategy 9 9 we have checked the robustness of our results by additionally estimating our models also using msci all countries that is a global index that is less commonly used than s p 500 the dynamics of results remain substantially unchanged and this confirms the robustness of our results results are omitted but available upon request finally we employ the yield on a 3 month us treasury bill as a proxy for the risk free asset we use daily data to obtain the continuously compounded returns which are given by the following equation ri t 100 ln pi t pi t 1 where pi t is the daily closing price of the index i on day t ln is the natural logarithm fig 1 shows the trend for global water index agricultural and energy indexes and s p all the series show a common rising trend with a strong break during the economic and financial crisis at the end of 2008 after this period prices decreased very fast and grew again at a different rate table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of continuously compounded daily returns for each series the t statistics indicate that the mean is statistically significant only for global water index whereas the other indexes means are statistically insignificant from zero skewness is negative for all the indexes this may be an indication that large negative returns occur more often than large positive returns the water index returns also display a stronger amount of kurtosis than agricultural and energy indexes the higher the kurtosis coefficient is above the normal level the more likely future returns will be either extremely large or extremely small fat tails that is large outlying observations occur more often than can be expected under the assumption of normality this fact suggests the need to account for the presence of volatility in our models using an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity arch approach we also measure the risk adjusted performance based on the sharpe ratio computed as the excess return above the risk free rate divided by the volatility over a given period of time sharpe ratio ri rf σi the sharpe ratio for the water index is higher than the one for the market respectively 13 8 and 10 thus highlighting a better return for unit of risk for the water industry 5 results and comments 5 1 baseline results we first apply a pure breakpoint bai perron 1998 70 specification to allow for the identification of multiple endogenous break dates this enables a better understanding of the changing nature of beta coefficients in the capm model utilizing eq 2 the procedure finds two breaks table 2 in 05 23 2003 and 05 08 2008 we then estimate the multifactor market model by ols for the three periods detected by bai perron breakpoints provided that we are linking series showing an excess of kurtosis we also account for the presence of volatility testing the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in the ols residuals 85 by arch test 10 10 result are available on request results suggest to carry out a generalized arch model garch to address the presence of heteroscedasticity 86 we use garch 1 1 for the entire period and the three sub periods and we obtain evidence of no arch effects in the residuals table 3 reports the estimates for the full period all the common factors are positive and statistically significant overall apart from the overall market conditions that of course as expected are key determinants of the price of the water industry stocks 11 11 see jin et al 2015 12 or any stock in general the macroeconomic factors that proxy common shocks in the agriculture and in the energy sectors appear to be determining the behavior of the water stock returns especially with reference to energy specifically the estimated market beta is positive and statistically significant in line with the literature on the capm agriculture and energy betas are also positive and significant although the sensitivity of the first is rather weak this evidence highlights that agriculture changes positively impact the stock returns of the water industry coherently with our hypothesis h1 this means that higher commodity prices also driven by water scarcity may push investments in the water industry to optimize the use of water this in turn translates into higher growth expectations which are positively anticipated by financial markets with rising stock prices energy also shows a positive coefficient h2b is verified in line with the fact that energy is a driver of water demand and not only an input shale gas and alternative water intensive energy production techniques may call for a strong increase in water usage which finally yields to increased expected profits for the water industry and rising returns on the stock market with reference to the size of the coefficients the agriculture beta coefficient is quite higher than the energy beta this is in line with the fact that demand for water is mainly driven by agriculture while energy sector is the second largest consumer comparison between subperiods allows us to analyze if and when agriculture and energy price changes influence differently water stock returns in the first subperiod energy beta is not significant whereas agriculture beta is negative and significant however in this subperiod results may not be meaningful since there are few observations in the second subperiod all betas are positive and significant that means all common factors impact positively the water excess returns in the third period the agriculture beta is still positive and significant whereas the energy is not significant the estimated arch and garch coefficients are found to be both positive and statistically significant validating the appropriateness of the capm garch specification in particular the estimated garch coefficient after the crisis 0 955 indicates that the volatility of price changes is a more persistent phenomenon than it appeared before the crisis 5 2 dynamic setting the different dynamic of betas during time emerging from our first analyses table 3 supports the hypothesis of time varying factor sensitivities indeed although the static analysis of beta coefficients brings relevant information about the financial mechanisms behind water stocks a dynamic analysis of the time varying behavior of factor sensitivities by application of advanced time series techniques will provide more robust insights therefore we deepen our analyses by investigating the dynamic specification of the model to supply more information about the dynamic response of excess returns of water industry to deviations in energy and agricultural prices we first run a rolling regression that is a series of regressions with fixed sample size called window in each regression that we set at 250 days i e about one financial year we plot the agriculture and energy betas repetitively estimated together with the evolution of the point estimates of time varying betas obtained using kalman filter from eq 5 in order to assess the relative superiority of the proposed dynamic specification with a state space mechanism in the same figure we plot the constant garch estimated from table 2 both for the whole period and for three subperiods rolling estimated and state space estimated beta coefficients the latter are based on filtered risk factor estimates that take into account information that was available at time t and appear to be the most flexible techniques in capturing changes in sector sensitivity to the overall market over time figs 2 4 illustrate the time varying exposure of water to the s p agriculture and energy spread respectively the agriculture beta becomes clearly positive during the 2008 economic and financial crisis highlighting the market perception of the positive sensitivity of the water industry to agriculture price changes one possible explanation is that during the crisis agriculture commodity prices grew considerably due to the scarcity of agricultural supply this scarcity derives from different contingencies among these the biofuel competition the increasing food demand from china and india and last but not least adverse weather conditions that led to severe drought and heavy flooding especially in those areas affected by arrears hydraulic systems given the financial theory that claims that stock prices can be viewed as a stream of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may have incorporated into water stock prices the growth expectations of the water business and the positive role water management will play in producing sufficient food supplies these expectations are linked to the ability of the water industry to satisfy the growing demand for water related products services and infrastructures increasing the efficiency of production processes and developing new technologies it is not therefore surprising that financial markets are able to better anticipate and capture these expectations when the markets live extreme conditions such the increase of commodity prices which might create worries by the policy makers and the economic community especially when the increase in commodity prices affects food aspects of population and sustainability issues as far as energy the sensitivity of the water sector alternates between positive and negative domain indeed generally speaking since energy is an input in production the increase in prices determines a reduction in expected profits with a subsequent negative effect on stock returns nevertheless with reference to stock returns in the water industry an opposite effect might also hold in fact a rise in oil price may drive an increase in demand for alternative energy sources among others these alternative energy sources might come from the hydroelectric sector and from shale gas that makes intensive use of water during the extraction process as we can see from fig 4 water returns are most frequently positively related to energy price changes but during the economic crisis when the estimated betas become negative highlighting how in this period the extreme increase in prices due to the oil price bubble makes the input effect prevail 5 3 geographical patterns to better investigate the dynamic behavior of prices we further perform our analysis differentiating on the geographical area figs 5 and 6 in this respect we use a water index that comprises only water firms operating in the us 12 12 powershares water resources pho is a full replication exchange traded fund that follows the nasdaq omx us water indexsm which tracks the performance of companies creating products that conserve and purify water for homes businesses and industries listed on an us exchange where for instance the shale gas extraction methodology has received an important support for its development and expansion in fact when isolating the us water index in relation to the energy sector we obtain an interesting although not surprising result the energy beta becomes positive during the crisis in line with the hypothesis that water is important when developing an alternative to traditional energy sources as far as the agricultural sector however there is no evidence of significant differences between the world and north america 6 conclusion in the latest years the water industry is gaining crucial importance for an economic and social development that takes a sustainability perspective the demand for water and water related products is increasing over time mainly driven by the demand for agriculture and energy purposes this generates pressures on the industry that is already facing issues deriving from the limited water availability climate change and ageing infrastructure and that will be called to respond to these challenges by increasing efficiency and introducing innovations this paper aims at investigating how the water industry stock prices react to changes in agriculture and energy prices to this end we model a multifactor market model where the macroeconomic sources of risk are proxy by agriculture and energy commodity prices and by the excess market return to confirm our findings we follow three steps first using a garch approach we estimate a constant beta for different subperiods identified by a pure breakpoint specification second we use a rolling ols estimates to trace the evolution of the relationship between excess returns and betas third we employ the state space representation estimating kalman filter to treat the time varying coefficients according to recent advancement in econometric techniques evidence shows that agriculture and energy effectively impact water stock prices with effects varying over time specifically the agriculture betas become positive during 2008 crisis highlighting the positive sensitivity of the water industry to agriculture price changes h1 agriculture price trends positively influence water stock returns indeed agriculture prices grew considerably among others also for the scarcity of supply and this could have stimulated an increasing demand for water and water related infrastructures the energy betas alternate between positive and negative domain energy is an input in production the increase in prices due to the oil price bubble determines a reduction in stock returns h2a energy price trends negatively influence water stock returns nevertheless an opposite effect might also hold in fact a rise in oil price may drive an increase in demand for alternative energy sources as the hydroelectric sector and from shale gas that make intensive use of water during the extraction process h2b energy price trends positively influence water stock returns during the economic crisis the estimated betas become negative highlighting how in this period the extreme increase in prices makes the input effect to prevail given that financial theory states that stock prices can be viewed as a stream of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may have incorporated into water stock prices the growth expectations of the water business and the positive role water management will play in producing sufficient energy and food supplies the implications of our study may be relevant for policy makers in the decision process aimed at contributing to the development and to the promotion of innovation of the water industry as well as in fostering the channel of additional finance indeed recent spikes in food prices underline the urgent need to invest in agricultural production of which water management is a crucial part moreover the negative impact of rising energy prices and the introduction of biofuels can also be partially offset by the development and adoption of new water technologies the traditional sources of funding in the water industry e g the so called 3ts are not likely to satisfy the needs of the sector in the future the investments through financial markets made feasible by a number of instruments such as stocks or etfs present an alternative suitable way of fundraising last but not least results from this work highlight that water agriculture and energy are related to each other considering the fact that the three sectors have technical relationships in a perspective of sustainable development in this paper we maintain that the relationships are also economic and therefore policy makers should consider these relationships when defining their policies to shed additional insight on the water food energy nexus it is important that future research further investigate the issue 
8718,water issues are receiving increasing attention from policy makers and international organizations due to water scarcity and global rising demand given that the demand for water is mainly driven by agriculture and energy we use a multifactor market model to analyze the impact of agriculture and energy price trends on the price of listed companies operating in the water industry evidence highlights a sensitivity of water stocks returns to agriculture and energy price changes additionally when using state space model to estimate dynamic beta coefficients factor sensitivities show a time varying behavior especially during the 2008 economic and financial crisis keywords water energy agriculture multifactor market model state space models stock prices jel classification q25 q21 g11 c58 e39 1 introduction this paper aims at analyzing the impact of agriculture and energy price trends on the share price value of companies operating in the water industry i e exchange listed companies whose revenue derives largely from the potable and wastewater industry our interest stems from the fact that the demand for water and water related products is increasing mainly driven by agriculture and energy withdrawals which in their turn are also likely to increase in the future as pointed out by recent research 1 this will generate a pressure for expansion of the water industry that will be called to satisfy the growing needs of agriculture and energy in fact agriculture accounts for the 70 of water consumption used for irrigation livestock crops and non food crops production processes demand for food is expected to increase by 35 by 2030 due to global growth and changes in lifestyles and this will consequently increase the demand for water 2 the energy sector on the other hand is the second largest consumer of water for cooling at thermal power plants water withdrawals by the energy sector will increase as well in fact energy prices fluctuations and political considerations are generating demand for alternative energy sources that may imply intensive water usage such as hydroelectric energy but also biofuels and shale gas 1 3 5 as well as energy saving techniques 6 water scarcity and growing demand together with sustainability issues 1 1 for an overview of water agriculture and energy sustainability issues see bazilian et al 2011 7 elobeid et al 2013 8 peri et al 2014 9 will drive an increase in the demand for water related infrastructures products and services to optimize the use of the resources in order to meet this growing demand companies will have to make considerable investments and will consequently need a huge amount of funds in the water industry companies have traditionally covered their financial needs with transfers taxes and tariffs 3ts which however will not be sufficient to support the strong development required to face all the above mentioned challenges 10 given the scarcity of public funds policy intervention could be aimed at promoting and supporting the development of an additional form of finance to be channelled into the industry 11 funds may come from capital markets for instance through the issue of bonds or equities and understanding the stock price dynamics of this growing industry can inspire capital allocation decisions of investors and financial institutions indeed considering that stock prices can be viewed as the expression of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may incorporate the growth expectations of the water business into rising water stock prices related to the growing demand for water related products services and infrastructures increasing the efficiency of production processes and developing new technologies additionally as highlighted by jin et al 2015 12 evidence on risk returns of water stock investments is lacking within this framework and considering that according to financial theory stock prices may convey information about the expected expansion of the industry 13 to accomplish our aim we use a multifactor market model where agriculture and energy prices are used as specific common macroeconomic sources of risk for the water industry according to the above described mechanism specifically we use a multifactor market model with state space time varying betas estimated using kalman filter to monitor the effect of risk factors over time this approach is particularly valuable because it enables to study the dynamics of the water stock price and hence evaluate how the latter is affected by agriculture and energy price movements for the water industry we use the s p global water index that provides liquid and tradable exposure to 50 companies from around the world that are involved in water related businesses for the agriculture and energy sectors we use two sub indexes of s p gs commodity index the s p agriculture livestock index and the s p energy index we use daily data spanning from november 19 2001 to march 20 2014 results highlight that agriculture and energy prices are significant risk factors affecting water stock prices and have a time varying behavior especially during the 2008 economic and financial crisis we contribute to the existing literature by providing first insights on the simultaneous effect of agriculture and energy prices on water stock index prices to our knowledge studies have so far analyzed the economic relation only between pairs of sectors or the technical relationship between the three and hence none of the studies takes our perspective we argue that understanding this relationship is of great importance from an economic environmental and ethical perspective as recently outlined by many international organizations 1 2 14 it may help policy makers in the decision process and in the design of appropriate policies aimed at contributing to the development and to the promotion of innovation of the water industry as well as at fostering the channel of additional finance the paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on the water sector and earlier literature section 3 presents the research methodology section 4 describes the data section 5 reports and discusses the results and section 6 draws the main conclusions 2 background the water sector represents an enormous set of different firms and operators that deal with water supply water use and wastewater handling to refer more properly to the water business the term hydrocommerce is sometimes used because of the magnitude of the business its boundaries are not easy to define and its actual size is difficult to determine both in terms of number of firms and in terms of counter value according to recent estimates there are at least 400 public companies operating in the water business in the world with a 900 billion market capitalization and these figures are destined to grow in the future 15 the activities of water related businesses are peculiar because of the characteristics of the resource they manage and treat i e water indeed water has no substitute and it is essential to life this makes its demand increase over time as the population grows while supply remains fixed although water covers most of the globe with a total volume of 1 4 billion km3 the volume of freshwater is only 2 5 of the total around 35 million km3 and the latter is not equally distributed on earth around 70 of water is in form of ice and snow 30 is groundwater and only the 0 3 is represented by lakes and rivers these water basins in most cases are shared between nations and this creates further tensions and difficulties in accessing the resource 1 according to fao estimates 16 around 45 of the world freshwater is in the americas 28 in asia 15 5 in europe and the remaining is located in africa 9 3 and oceania 2 1 data highlight the imbalances between demand and supply of freshwater around the globe with asia accounting for more than 60 of the population with only 28 of resources africa also lives a shortage in water it hosts the 15 of world inhabitants and has access to less than 10 of freshwater the situation is made more severe by its arid climate which characterizes especially the north of the continent the already limited availability of freshwater is likely to further diminish in the next years because of climate changes increasing needs for a growing population and an ageing infrastructure that will have to be repaired or substituted 17 it is estimated that in 2050 more than half of the population will be short of water 15 together with natural scarcity also economic scarcity exists in areas where water is abundant relative to demand but malnutrition still exists depending on socio economic conditions lack of water management and of proper infrastructures 1 2 1 the water industry companies in the water sector play an important role in developing new technologies and processes for water sanitation storage distribution reuse and recycle infrastructures need to be replaced and this will increase the request for pipes pumps valves and other related goods collection and storage will involve the creation of new tanks and groundwater banks while existing dams will need intervention new technologies will help in the reuse and recycle of water in order to optimize the use of the resources 18 in this sense it is believed that incremental innovation will play a major role in the sector 19 additionally management tools including the activities of data collection data analysis regulation and governance need to be developed 1 these are essential to accurately estimate the quantity and quality of water available and to manage the resource effectively taking into account increasing uncertainty and risks in order to pursue all the above mentioned challenges the industry needs additional capital and funds for instance in africa one of the most water stressed area of the globe water and sanitation spending needs for the period 2006 2015 were estimated to be 22 6 billion per year around 3 3 of africa s gdp of which more than 15 billion for investments and the remaining for water maintenance 5 7 billion and sanitation maintenance 1 4 billion 20 additional 18 billion us dollars are required for small scale irrigation and 2 7 billion for large scale irrigation systems for the next fifty years 1 tariffs taxation and transfers from institutions are not sufficient to guarantee future investments in the industry indeed public contribution in the future might be limited funds are scarce and their use needs to be optimized in fact although water is commonly perceived as a public good and public intervention in the past has been heavy forecasts show that the huge amount of capital needed by the industry cannot be exclusively provided by the public sector and more private intervention is expected even recent analysis of water governance arrangements in oecd countries flagged the lack of finance as a major and recurrent gap in water policies 11 indeed in the last few years the water industry has started attracting interest by numerous types of investors such as private equity and venture capital funds but also etfs hedge funds and wealthy individuals 2 2 according to the statistics provided by state street global advisors the total aum of the 7 etfs on water businesses amount to 1199 million around 0 07 of the total aum invested in equity in the developed markets among the us listed etfs the three etfs first trust ise water index fiw powershare global water pio and guggenheim s p global water index etf cgw have an overall market capitalization of 827 million on a total market capitalization of the etfs in the us of 1450 72 billion according to xtf these investors can provide funds for the different activities related to water withdrawal storage distribution and reuse and recycle with reference to this issue roca et al 2013 22 examined the portfolio returns of water investments and find that this industry outperforms traditional assets and enables better diversification especially during times of market stress also jin et al 2014 23 find similar results in this regard to date markets have developed some instruments specifically designed to cope with the challenges set by the climate change 3 3 for a discussion of green bonds see flaherty et al 2016 21 and with reference to the water industry some indexes follow exclusively the dynamics of the water sector besides the ones which include water business in the utilities universe e g the s p global water index the nasdaq water index the ise water index etc as also underlined by rompotis 2009 the advantage of investing in a water index is to gain exposure to the entire water market rather than in a specific water company indeed most of the indexes include firms that operate in the water and wastewater industry according to the broad definition of hydrocommerce to enable investments in the water indexes a number of exchange traded funds etfs have been created in order to track their trends and benefit from the expected expansion of the industry e g the ishares global water etf the invesco powershares global water resources the lyxor etf world water etc 2 2 earlier literature recent empirical papers provide only a few attempts at frameworks aimed at analyzing the effect of agriculture or energy on the water sector from an economic perspective and on a global scale generally this topic was analyzed in the literature following different approaches technical or economic and different fields of application or points of view agricultural to water energy to water separately or jointly agriculture and energy to water the technical approach has been addressed more often to analyze the relationship between energy and water studies mainly focus on energy consumption and water use applying life cycle evaluation or numerical simulation 24 25 26 27 among the most recent papers focusing on the energy water nexus gu et al 2014 6 use input output tables to describe the supply consumption relationship between water supply and primary energy sectors while nogueira vilanova and perrella balestrieri 2015 28 focus on the case of brazil works considering jointly agriculture energy and water are less common among others see refs 8 9 29 31 these studies analyze the technical connection that exists between the three elements in order to highlight the need for a joint policy aimed at ensuring a sustainable development conversely the studies following a strictly economic approach focus only on pairs of relationships separately i e agriculture water or energy water as far as agriculture and water few studies deal with the effect of agricultural prices on water demand and management lipton et al 2003 32 find that the decline in investment in irrigation is largely ascribed to the falling economic rate of return of irrigation projects and this is in part due to declining agricultural prices together with technical reasons this would mean that in a world with falling agricultural prices water companies have fewer resources to be invested and this in the end would bring to declining revenues for water companies that finally translate into decreasing stock prices in the same fashion the work by bjornlund and rossini 2005 33 and brennan 2006 34 find that water demand is positively related to commodity prices although the latter appears to be less important than water scarcity von braun 2008 35 states that the food price crisis has increased competition for land and water resources for agriculture and declining capital for long term investment due to the credit crunch has resulted in a re evaluation of natural resources finally wheeler et al 2008 36 use a wide variety of agricultural prices to estimate water allocation but they find that none displayed any significance in their model because of the relationships above described and summarizing the contribution of the literature we can expect that increasing agricultural prices will generate a pressure on the water industry for developing more efficient water distribution techniques that will yield in the last instance to investments and higher returns in the water industry 2 h1 agriculture price trends positively influence water stock returns a wider strand of literature focusing on pricing issue in the water sector has provided numerous contributions but lies beyond our scope the reader might refer to bar shira et al 2006 37 galioto et al 2013 38 vasileiou et al 2014 39 yang et al 2003 40 additionally other studies with a microeconomic approach study the firm specific determinants of the water industry stock returns 22 41 in particular roca et al 2015 41 analyze the impact of balance sheet variables on the wowax index and find that sales and administration expenses and account receivables have a positive impact on abnormal returns while ebit account payable and labor force have a negative one to the best of knowledge there are only two studies considering the economic relation in energy water that directly focus on the impact of energy prices on water sector 3 42 the authors find that rising energy prices increase costs for water extraction and conveyance thus altering water allocation and distribution indeed energy is an input in the water business as such rising energy prices increase the marginal cost of water with a depressing effect on profitability and as a consequence on water stock prices these considerations bring us to elaborate the following hypothesis h2a energy price trends negatively influence water stock returns despite this the effect of energy on water stock prices is still an understudied issue and factual explanations suggest that also a positive relationship may hold in fact a positive relationship would mean that the energy sector is a demand source of water which is employed for production purposes e g shale gas this increased demand translates into higher water stock prices because of the financial mechanisms already explained above additionally the development of technologies to extract water more cheaply and transport water more efficiently can offset the effects of rising energy prices which are expected to induce adoption of new and better technologies stimulating investments and future revenues in the water industry that are incorporated in rising stock returns h2b energy price trends positively influence water stock returns the novelty of our paper is to provide first insights on the economic relation not only between energy and water or agriculture and water but considering how both agriculture and energy simultaneously influence the water sector using water stock prices 3 the multifactor market model 3 1 theoretical approach to analyze the impact of agricultural and energy price trends on the share price value of water companies we use a multifactor market model multifactor models are an extension of single factor capital asset pricing model capm as known the single factor capm model uses only the market index while multifactor models employ a multidimensional set of common factors in addition to the market factor to explain the performance of a security or a portfolio of securities the basic idea behind these models is that the common variation in asset returns is determined by multiple common components or risk factors 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 for recent empirical applications see 51 52 53 54 55 56 the general form of a multifactor model is 1 rt a b1 f1t b2 f2t bifit bn fnt et with t 1 t where i 1 n number of factors rt excess equity returns at time t fit factor i at time t bi sensitivity of the returns to changes in factor i et random component among the several characterizations of the multifactor models i e macroeconomic fundamental momentum or statistical factors 57 58 59 this study employs a macroeconomic approach the use of multifactor models with macroeconomic factors is common in the empirical literature on the stock prices of commodity related industries among others sadorsky and henriques 2001 61 apply a multifactor market model to evaluate the returns of canadian paper and forest products companies the factors are commodity prices returns together with market index returns interest rates and exchange rates also boyer and filion 2007 62 use a multifactor market model with macroeconomic factors to test the dynamics of canadian oil and gas stocks prices using crude oil return and natural gas returns the market return exchange rates while ramos and vega 2011 63 use market portfolio currency rates and oil prices to investigate oil and gas industry returns in developed and emerging markets among the most recent analyses that apply the multifactor model mo et al 2012 54 choose four factors to proxy the performance of european electricity corporations overall market return electricity price changes oil price changes and eua eu emission allowance price changes the model in addition to the market factor selects two specific common macroeconomic sources of risks that best fit the analysis framework energy and agriculture price trends this choice is justified by the following considerations oil price is generally included among the set of systematic risk factors since fluctuations in energy prices can be expected to have an effect on security prices given the global economy relies on oil as a major energy resource its fluctuations and effects can be severe especially in extreme market conditions 60 besides energy for the specific purpose of this study the price of agriculture commodities is introduced in the model as a further common factor that can have an impact on water companies equity returns the model is hence specified as follows 2 y t α β 1 x 1 t β 2 x 2 t β 3 x 3 t e t with t 1 t yt is the excess daily return on the water stock index x1 is the excess daily return to the market index x2 is the daily return to agricultural prices x3 is the daily return to energy prices and et is the idiosyncratic error β1 is the market beta β2 is the agricultural beta that is the sensitivity of water stock index to agricultural price changes and β3 is the energy beta that is the sensitivity of water stock index to energy prices changes excess returns are measured by daily indexes returns minus the three month us treasury bill rate that is commonly employed in the literature as a reference for the free risk rate of return 4 4 see also the webpage by kenneth french http mba tuck dartmouth edu pages faculty ken french data library html who employs us t bill for the computation of european and developed markets factors we thank an anonymous referee for remarking this given that we use daily data 5 5 data are better described in section 4 we expect that the series exhibit volatility across time and that the conditional variance during some periods may be unusually large in this case heteroscedasticity could lead to incorrect inferences and employing estimation methods that use conditional variances appears more appropriate for this type of data between several approaches dealing with heteroscedasticity the generalized arch garch model allows the conditional variance to follow an arma process for both auto regressive and moving average components in the heteroscedastic variance because of these reasons this paper uses garch 1 1 to estimate the variance covariance matrix of returns in order to obtain the estimates of beta we consider the following specification 3 y t βx t e t 4 σ t 2 ω α e t 1 2 γ σ t 1 2 eq 3 is the mean equation yt is the dependent variable x ts are regressors as in eq 2 and et is the error term eq 4 is the variance equation σ2 t is the one period ahead forecast variance based on past information and it is called the conditional variance ω is the constant term e2 t 1 is the arch term and σ2 t 1 is the garch term 3 2 time varying betas when applying the capm in its basic form it is generally assumed that the beta coefficients are constant over time however betas can vary because of several factors such as the leverage effect induced by fluctuations of stock prices information asymmetries in the market the dependence of systematic risk on the level of the risk free interest rate which also changes over time see 58 for a general overview additionally also econometric arguments support time variation in betas as the stylized fact of volatility clustering although a number of studies have questioned the stability of betas only a few authors explicitly model the time varying behavior of systematic risk also thanks to more recent advancement in estimation techniques 53 64 69 this study considers the case for non constant betas to this end we employ a three step procedure first we use estimation methodologies for regression models which allow for a change in betas according to the bai 1997 64 and bai and perron 1998 70 techniques they perform linear regression models that are subject to structural changes where regime breakpoints are not known and specified a priori but are estimated in particular we use a pure breakpoint specification in which all of the regressors have regime specific coefficients varying between regimes garch approach is used in this step second the evolution of the relationship between excess returns in the water industry and betas is traced using rolling ols estimates this procedure tracks an evolving system i e time varying parameters and allows evaluating the evolution of the relation of the series over time requiring the definition of the length of a rolling window third we employ the state space representation to treat the time varying coefficients to allow the direct estimation of the time varying betas in fact although various models have been developed to allow the coefficients to follow a dynamic process the literature finds evidence that the state space model provides more accurate estimates of systematic risk when using daily market data 71 73 this model was introduced in the sixties in the engineering field and only after many years it has been used in economics due to the computational complexity surveys on the applicability of the state space approach to economics and finance can be found in hamilton 1994 74 and kim and nelson 1989 75 in agricultural economics the space state models became popular mainly around the nineties see bessler et al 2010 for a review 76 while the model has been applied to energy issues only more recently see 77 78 79 80 also in the financial field applications are various among the most recent contributions al anaswah and wilfling 2011 81 use the methodology to study the behavior of speculative bubbles on stock markets while berger and pozzi 2013 82 study the time varying degree of world stock market integration in the latest forty years using a state space approach following these consideration we model eq 2 in the state space form as follows 6 6 in its general form the state space model of eq 3 is as follows a r t α t k 1 3 β k t f k t ε t b α t α t 1 υ t υ n 0 σ υ 2 c β k t β k t 1 η t η t n 0 q where εt t and ηt are errors terms normally distributed and serially uncorrelated with zero mean and variances σ2 ε and σ2 υ and diagonal covariance matrix q respectively equation a is called observation equation and relates the observed variables to the unobserved state vector while eq b and c formulate the dynamics of the state variables 5 watert αt βm t s pt βa t agrt βe t energyt εt where the dependent variable and the factors are the same as in eq 2 αt βm t βa t and βe t are the time varying coefficients and are assumed to evolve as a pure random walk the unknown parameters in such a system can be estimated via the kalman filter a very powerful and flexible recursive algorithm that compute the optimal estimates of the state variables for each period t conditional on the information set available at time t see refs 83 84 for use in econometrics we use this technique to calculate maximum likelihood estimates of σ ε 2 σ ν 2 and q to obtain the filtered values of αt and βk t variables we set the initial one step ahead predicted values for the state variables equal to the ols estimates from the static model in eq 3 4 data the analysis presented in this paper makes use of daily data supplied by datastream thomson reuters and spanning from november 19 2001 to march 20 2014 for a total of 3 219 observations the water series is the s p global water index that is composed of 50 liquid and tradable companies from around the world that are involved in water businesses specifically the 50 constituents of the index are equally distributed between two distinct clusters of water related activities water utilities infrastructure water supply water utilities wastewater treatment water purification water well drilling water testing water sewer and pipeline construction and water equipment materials water treatment chemicals water treatment appliances pumps and pumping equipment plumbing pipes fluid power pumps and motors fluid meters and counting devices of the 50 constituents 22 were from the us and weighted for more than 39 on overall capitalization the total market capitalization of each constituent is greater than 250 million the median market capitalization is slightly above 3 000 million stocks are traded on developed market exchanges the index is capitalization weighted that is the components are weighted according to the total market value of their outstanding shares the series is price indexes expressive of the dynamics of stock prices alone and without the component of income represented by the distribution of dividends 7 7 the choice of the s p global water index has been determined by various considerations on the quality of the index and on the evaluation of the characteristics of the other indexes available s p global water provides exposure to a higher number of companies operating in the water related business if compared to other indexes like the nasdaq omx global water or the ise water index additionally despite not being the oldest index on water it is the index we identified on the markets as the most often used as benchmark for water etfs while for instance the ise water index is replicated by only an etf to the best of our knowledge for agriculture and energy sectors we used two sub indexes of s p gs commodity index specifically we collect the spot index a measure of the level of nearby commodity prices for agriculture livestock and energy both the indexes are calculated primarily on a world production weighted basis and comprise the principal physical commodities that are the subject of active liquid futures markets 8 8 the s p gsci agriculture and livestock index comprises the following index components wheat corn soybeans cotton sugar coffee cocoa feeder cattle live cattle and lean hogs while the s p gsci energy index comprises wti crude oil brent crude oil rbob gas heating oil gas oil and natural gas the weight of each commodity in the index is determined by the average quantity of production over the last five years of available data moreover as reported by the s p company to be included in the commodity index the commodity must be denominated in us dollars but traded in a trading venue located in one of the oecd countries given the above the water agriculture and energy indexes show coherence in terms of coverage of markets we also use the s p 500 to measure the equity market performance of global markets this index represents one of the most common benchmarks used in the literature to evaluate the performance of a global investment strategy 9 9 we have checked the robustness of our results by additionally estimating our models also using msci all countries that is a global index that is less commonly used than s p 500 the dynamics of results remain substantially unchanged and this confirms the robustness of our results results are omitted but available upon request finally we employ the yield on a 3 month us treasury bill as a proxy for the risk free asset we use daily data to obtain the continuously compounded returns which are given by the following equation ri t 100 ln pi t pi t 1 where pi t is the daily closing price of the index i on day t ln is the natural logarithm fig 1 shows the trend for global water index agricultural and energy indexes and s p all the series show a common rising trend with a strong break during the economic and financial crisis at the end of 2008 after this period prices decreased very fast and grew again at a different rate table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of continuously compounded daily returns for each series the t statistics indicate that the mean is statistically significant only for global water index whereas the other indexes means are statistically insignificant from zero skewness is negative for all the indexes this may be an indication that large negative returns occur more often than large positive returns the water index returns also display a stronger amount of kurtosis than agricultural and energy indexes the higher the kurtosis coefficient is above the normal level the more likely future returns will be either extremely large or extremely small fat tails that is large outlying observations occur more often than can be expected under the assumption of normality this fact suggests the need to account for the presence of volatility in our models using an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity arch approach we also measure the risk adjusted performance based on the sharpe ratio computed as the excess return above the risk free rate divided by the volatility over a given period of time sharpe ratio ri rf σi the sharpe ratio for the water index is higher than the one for the market respectively 13 8 and 10 thus highlighting a better return for unit of risk for the water industry 5 results and comments 5 1 baseline results we first apply a pure breakpoint bai perron 1998 70 specification to allow for the identification of multiple endogenous break dates this enables a better understanding of the changing nature of beta coefficients in the capm model utilizing eq 2 the procedure finds two breaks table 2 in 05 23 2003 and 05 08 2008 we then estimate the multifactor market model by ols for the three periods detected by bai perron breakpoints provided that we are linking series showing an excess of kurtosis we also account for the presence of volatility testing the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in the ols residuals 85 by arch test 10 10 result are available on request results suggest to carry out a generalized arch model garch to address the presence of heteroscedasticity 86 we use garch 1 1 for the entire period and the three sub periods and we obtain evidence of no arch effects in the residuals table 3 reports the estimates for the full period all the common factors are positive and statistically significant overall apart from the overall market conditions that of course as expected are key determinants of the price of the water industry stocks 11 11 see jin et al 2015 12 or any stock in general the macroeconomic factors that proxy common shocks in the agriculture and in the energy sectors appear to be determining the behavior of the water stock returns especially with reference to energy specifically the estimated market beta is positive and statistically significant in line with the literature on the capm agriculture and energy betas are also positive and significant although the sensitivity of the first is rather weak this evidence highlights that agriculture changes positively impact the stock returns of the water industry coherently with our hypothesis h1 this means that higher commodity prices also driven by water scarcity may push investments in the water industry to optimize the use of water this in turn translates into higher growth expectations which are positively anticipated by financial markets with rising stock prices energy also shows a positive coefficient h2b is verified in line with the fact that energy is a driver of water demand and not only an input shale gas and alternative water intensive energy production techniques may call for a strong increase in water usage which finally yields to increased expected profits for the water industry and rising returns on the stock market with reference to the size of the coefficients the agriculture beta coefficient is quite higher than the energy beta this is in line with the fact that demand for water is mainly driven by agriculture while energy sector is the second largest consumer comparison between subperiods allows us to analyze if and when agriculture and energy price changes influence differently water stock returns in the first subperiod energy beta is not significant whereas agriculture beta is negative and significant however in this subperiod results may not be meaningful since there are few observations in the second subperiod all betas are positive and significant that means all common factors impact positively the water excess returns in the third period the agriculture beta is still positive and significant whereas the energy is not significant the estimated arch and garch coefficients are found to be both positive and statistically significant validating the appropriateness of the capm garch specification in particular the estimated garch coefficient after the crisis 0 955 indicates that the volatility of price changes is a more persistent phenomenon than it appeared before the crisis 5 2 dynamic setting the different dynamic of betas during time emerging from our first analyses table 3 supports the hypothesis of time varying factor sensitivities indeed although the static analysis of beta coefficients brings relevant information about the financial mechanisms behind water stocks a dynamic analysis of the time varying behavior of factor sensitivities by application of advanced time series techniques will provide more robust insights therefore we deepen our analyses by investigating the dynamic specification of the model to supply more information about the dynamic response of excess returns of water industry to deviations in energy and agricultural prices we first run a rolling regression that is a series of regressions with fixed sample size called window in each regression that we set at 250 days i e about one financial year we plot the agriculture and energy betas repetitively estimated together with the evolution of the point estimates of time varying betas obtained using kalman filter from eq 5 in order to assess the relative superiority of the proposed dynamic specification with a state space mechanism in the same figure we plot the constant garch estimated from table 2 both for the whole period and for three subperiods rolling estimated and state space estimated beta coefficients the latter are based on filtered risk factor estimates that take into account information that was available at time t and appear to be the most flexible techniques in capturing changes in sector sensitivity to the overall market over time figs 2 4 illustrate the time varying exposure of water to the s p agriculture and energy spread respectively the agriculture beta becomes clearly positive during the 2008 economic and financial crisis highlighting the market perception of the positive sensitivity of the water industry to agriculture price changes one possible explanation is that during the crisis agriculture commodity prices grew considerably due to the scarcity of agricultural supply this scarcity derives from different contingencies among these the biofuel competition the increasing food demand from china and india and last but not least adverse weather conditions that led to severe drought and heavy flooding especially in those areas affected by arrears hydraulic systems given the financial theory that claims that stock prices can be viewed as a stream of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may have incorporated into water stock prices the growth expectations of the water business and the positive role water management will play in producing sufficient food supplies these expectations are linked to the ability of the water industry to satisfy the growing demand for water related products services and infrastructures increasing the efficiency of production processes and developing new technologies it is not therefore surprising that financial markets are able to better anticipate and capture these expectations when the markets live extreme conditions such the increase of commodity prices which might create worries by the policy makers and the economic community especially when the increase in commodity prices affects food aspects of population and sustainability issues as far as energy the sensitivity of the water sector alternates between positive and negative domain indeed generally speaking since energy is an input in production the increase in prices determines a reduction in expected profits with a subsequent negative effect on stock returns nevertheless with reference to stock returns in the water industry an opposite effect might also hold in fact a rise in oil price may drive an increase in demand for alternative energy sources among others these alternative energy sources might come from the hydroelectric sector and from shale gas that makes intensive use of water during the extraction process as we can see from fig 4 water returns are most frequently positively related to energy price changes but during the economic crisis when the estimated betas become negative highlighting how in this period the extreme increase in prices due to the oil price bubble makes the input effect prevail 5 3 geographical patterns to better investigate the dynamic behavior of prices we further perform our analysis differentiating on the geographical area figs 5 and 6 in this respect we use a water index that comprises only water firms operating in the us 12 12 powershares water resources pho is a full replication exchange traded fund that follows the nasdaq omx us water indexsm which tracks the performance of companies creating products that conserve and purify water for homes businesses and industries listed on an us exchange where for instance the shale gas extraction methodology has received an important support for its development and expansion in fact when isolating the us water index in relation to the energy sector we obtain an interesting although not surprising result the energy beta becomes positive during the crisis in line with the hypothesis that water is important when developing an alternative to traditional energy sources as far as the agricultural sector however there is no evidence of significant differences between the world and north america 6 conclusion in the latest years the water industry is gaining crucial importance for an economic and social development that takes a sustainability perspective the demand for water and water related products is increasing over time mainly driven by the demand for agriculture and energy purposes this generates pressures on the industry that is already facing issues deriving from the limited water availability climate change and ageing infrastructure and that will be called to respond to these challenges by increasing efficiency and introducing innovations this paper aims at investigating how the water industry stock prices react to changes in agriculture and energy prices to this end we model a multifactor market model where the macroeconomic sources of risk are proxy by agriculture and energy commodity prices and by the excess market return to confirm our findings we follow three steps first using a garch approach we estimate a constant beta for different subperiods identified by a pure breakpoint specification second we use a rolling ols estimates to trace the evolution of the relationship between excess returns and betas third we employ the state space representation estimating kalman filter to treat the time varying coefficients according to recent advancement in econometric techniques evidence shows that agriculture and energy effectively impact water stock prices with effects varying over time specifically the agriculture betas become positive during 2008 crisis highlighting the positive sensitivity of the water industry to agriculture price changes h1 agriculture price trends positively influence water stock returns indeed agriculture prices grew considerably among others also for the scarcity of supply and this could have stimulated an increasing demand for water and water related infrastructures the energy betas alternate between positive and negative domain energy is an input in production the increase in prices due to the oil price bubble determines a reduction in stock returns h2a energy price trends negatively influence water stock returns nevertheless an opposite effect might also hold in fact a rise in oil price may drive an increase in demand for alternative energy sources as the hydroelectric sector and from shale gas that make intensive use of water during the extraction process h2b energy price trends positively influence water stock returns during the economic crisis the estimated betas become negative highlighting how in this period the extreme increase in prices makes the input effect to prevail given that financial theory states that stock prices can be viewed as a stream of expected discounted cash flow financial markets may have incorporated into water stock prices the growth expectations of the water business and the positive role water management will play in producing sufficient energy and food supplies the implications of our study may be relevant for policy makers in the decision process aimed at contributing to the development and to the promotion of innovation of the water industry as well as in fostering the channel of additional finance indeed recent spikes in food prices underline the urgent need to invest in agricultural production of which water management is a crucial part moreover the negative impact of rising energy prices and the introduction of biofuels can also be partially offset by the development and adoption of new water technologies the traditional sources of funding in the water industry e g the so called 3ts are not likely to satisfy the needs of the sector in the future the investments through financial markets made feasible by a number of instruments such as stocks or etfs present an alternative suitable way of fundraising last but not least results from this work highlight that water agriculture and energy are related to each other considering the fact that the three sectors have technical relationships in a perspective of sustainable development in this paper we maintain that the relationships are also economic and therefore policy makers should consider these relationships when defining their policies to shed additional insight on the water food energy nexus it is important that future research further investigate the issue 
8719,the issue of water access and security has been emphasized in the recent policy debate on sustainable development sustainable development goal no 6 and adaptation to climate change cop21 in paris 2015 this study provides new evidence about the blue virtual water input output network the main novelty of our approach is the combination of structural decomposition analysis sda with network theory sda reveals that size related technological and structural components have contributed substantially to changes in virtual water use network analysis offers new insights about the vulnerability of the system to shocks through trade links across country sector pairs our analysis highlights a possible trade off in the increasing importance of virtual water trade the efficiency improvement in granting access to virtual water might come at the cost of increasing systemic vulnerability overall the great unbalance between water availability and usage combined with rigidity of global consumption and production networks and the risk of cascade effects imply increasing vulnerability of the virtual water network to shocks propagation keywords virtual water trade multi regional input output model network analysis jel classification c67 q25 f18 1 introduction global production chains virtually transfer large amounts of water resources from areas of production to far consumption regions a phenomenon that has been named the globalization of water 1 that is especially important for food security 2 4 conflicts for water 5 and overpopulation 6 the capacity to engage in trade enables water scarce countries to achieve food security and more generally to satisfy their demand for water intensive products the quantification and assessment of virtual water vw and the evaluation of the vulnerability of the v w network are particularly relevant as climate change and other exogenous shocks are likely to alter the geographical distribution of water availability and to increase the exposure to systemic risk of water misallocation 7 the two main methodological approaches used in the literature to analyse virtual water trade vwt are input output io analysis and network theory io tables express the monetary value of economic transactions occurring across sectors of an economy to account for sectoral interdependencies in the economic system in the vast literature of environmentally extended input output analysis the attention has been directed towards the attribution of the responsibility to producers and consumers for the exploitation of natural resources and the release of pollutants by computing the net balance of pollution and of resource embodied in traded goods io models allow to identify and quantifying both direct and indirect water use throughout the whole supply chain previous studies on water related to international trade considered both single region io data 8 10 sub national multi region io data 11 13 and global multi region io mrio data 14 17 based on io analysis the literature has developed a variety of structural decomposition analysis sda 1 1 see refs 18 19 and 20 for overviews of the literature in order to unravel and quantify the main drivers of change in pollution or in resource and water use there are several examples of sda of energy use 21 22 emissions 23 24 or water use 25 26 in a specific region or macro area with mixed results depending on the period the environmental dimension that is considered and the countries and sectors included in the analysis on the other hand network theory has been extensively used to analyse bilateral trade flows 27 because it enables to find non local interdependencies among nodes country sector pairs in our case involved in the international trade system and to capture useful information on the topology of exchanges network theory is particularly suitable to deal with economic complexity where hierarchies of economic sub systems and the synergistic interactions between sub systems can be detected 28 network analysis is a powerful tool to analyse complex influences of social and ecological structures i e multiplex on community and household dynamics 29 2 2 in our paper we do not develop a multiplex analysis due to the high number of sector country pairs involved but we decided to focus on directed and weighted network of vwt further research is needed to gain additional insights from multiplex network analysis in the context of world input output relationships of embodied water neoclassical macroeconomic theory got rid of the possibility of cascade effects based on the alleged diversification argument 30 however recent contributions showed that the interconnections between different firms and sectors play a key role in the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks throughout the economy 27 a number of papers applied network analysis to study virtual water trade as a global network by unveiling the main characteristics of its topological structure 2 31 32 as well as its geographical 33 and temporal evolution 34 35 they main findings are that i the total volume of virtual water trade is likely to shrink as a consequence of climate change due to increasing crop prices ii international trade in food related commodities has contributed to substantial savings of global water resources over time 7 and iii that the topology of exchanges is becoming denser over time as a consequence of globalisation following recent studies that integrate information provided by io tables with network indexes 27 36 37 we extend this approach to analyse the relation between global supply chains and water resources the global v w t system is both interconnected and interdependent which poses a problem of network vulnerability to exogenous perturbations 38 40 the novelty introduced by the present study is the combination of the sda with network measures of systematic vulnerability to exogenous supply shocks our approach proposes a multi faced framework of investigation that is suitable for those resources such as water for which a price mechanism for the allocation of the resource is weak or absent and the resource is not directly traded but it is virtually embodied in the exchanged goods the use of io allows to calculate the overall requirements of a resource and to identify the geographical origin of the resource network tools allow to study the systemic structure and the evolution of the network to unravel potential vulnerabilities in the exploitation and allocation of a resource the current study goes beyond previous contributions because we ground our analysis on inter sectoral virtual water trade and not simply on final consumption this step is essential to understand whether the current global supply chain of virtual water is vulnerable to external shocks and whether the evolution of international trade is yielding riskier systems of v w exchanges in particular i we take into account the heterogeneous sectoral composition of each country i i we assess the evolution of blue water use and the key drivers of its evolution and i i i we evaluate how the process of globalisation increasing international trade could affect the stability of the blue vw io network bvwion via sectoral level shocks the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the world input output database wiod and introduces the main concepts section 3 explains the input output methodology while section 4 discusses the drivers of blue water use by means of a structural decomposition analysis sda section 5 introduces the network methodology and the fundamental topological properties of the global virtual water trade network section 6 discusses the methodological implications from the combination of sda and network theory finally section 7 summarizes the main results and identifies open issues for further research 2 data and definitions the world input output database wiod 3 3 world input output database http www wiod org updated to 2013 wiod is composed by a set of harmonized supply and use tables and symmetric i o tables valued at current and previous year s prices for a description of alternative io databases see ref 41 provides data on world inter industry monetary flows of intermediate and final goods the database includes 40 countries 4 4 country coverage 40 countries including eu27 member states plus 13 non eu countries australia brazil canada china india indonesia japan south korea mexico russia taiwan turkey and the us and the remaining regions of the world aggregated into a single region row rest of the world which account for approximately 85 of world gdp and for approximately 70 of global blue water use 5 5 see http waterfootprint org en resources water footprint statistics for country level statistics data including blue water direct use in m3 are presented with a breakdown of 35 sectors for each country and vary in time 6 6 see http www wiod org database eas13 for a detailed description of the data sources used to estimate sector country year specific blue water direct use before moving to our set of empirical applications it is useful to discuss the most common definitions of virtual water present in the existing literature virtual water 7 7 see refs 42 and 43 for a review of the literature on v w concept refers to the quantity of water embodied in traded goods within and across national borders 44 including both direct and indirect uses along the whole supply chain 45 8 8 the sum of direct and indirect water use coefficients returns a vector of total water demand multipliers equivalent to the virtual water content in m3 details on the computation of virtual water based on input output analysis are discussed in section 3 blue water bw refers to the consumptive use of ground or surface water the supply of blue water is costly because it requires a specific infrastructure blue water is mobile can be abstracted pumped stored treated distributed collected and recycled thus each m3 saved can be directed toward alternative uses by production activities and households here we consider renewable freshwater then any quantity used in a year is available again the subsequent year for sake of brevity we compare the results at the global level with those derived from a selection of countries i developed countries eu us canada australia and japan labelled as dev and emerging countries india china russia and brazil labelled as ldc countries these selected countries cover together about the 50 of global gdp source world bank and about the 57 percent of total blue water direct use source wiod in 2009 the selection of countries includes both high income and emerging countries which allows to compare the drivers of changes in water demand across rather heterogeneous regions 9 9 a complete list of results for all countries in wiod are available in appendix b moreover for illustrative purposes we aggregate the 35 industries in four macro sectors the agriculture hunting forestry and fishing atb together with the food and beverage fb that we call a f f the electric gas and water supply egw the chemical textile pulp paper and metallic products dus and the remaining are pooled together because of their very small direct use of water oth 10 10 see table b6 for the list of all 35 industries present in wiod table 1 compares the total amount of water used both in absolute level and per capita given the stability of the distribution and of the ranking across countries in terms of water use during the considered time span we present the amount of blue water use in years 1995 and 2009 11 11 these volumes are provided by the wiod database release 2013 http www wiod org database eas13 there are three facts that emerge from the data reported by table 1 1 there is an uneven distribution of direct water use both in terms of absolute level and per capita the first three countries in the ranking china india and the us were responsible of about 41 39 of the total amount of blue water use worldwide in 2009 1995 2 the ranking of countries in terms of absolute water use and per capita water use remains rather stable over the time span 1995 2009 3 blue water use absolute and per capita has increased substantially over time in what follows we assess the role played by inter sectoral exchanges international trade technological shifts and change in size and composition of final demand in driving these aggregate figures 2 1 the input output system as a network the mrio model offers a variety of tools to ascertain several features of economic activity both at local and global level such as i tracing the trade structure between countries and the related impacts on economic systems environmental pressures and society ii identifying and quantifying the key drivers that cause changes over time in economic social or environmental variables and iii evaluating the economic and environmental consequences due to short run exogenous shocks even though they were designed to keep track of inter industry links the io systems have been extensively applied in the field of network science the mrio system can be viewed as an interdependent complex network where nodes are thought as country sector pairs and edges are the monetary flows related to the exchange of goods and services between industries more precisely in our analysis the mrio system measures inter industry and inter country of water embodied in the production of goods and services we consider the global mrio system as a world input output network in order to assess the evolution of v w t and the vulnerability of the system to potential exogenous shocks research on input output links as a network though relatively new is expanding rapidly the recent bulk of literature in economics stresses that the structure of this production network is key in determining whether and how microeconomic shocks that affect only a particular sector country can propagate throughout the economy yielding aggregate outcomes the study of the mechanisms through which shocks diffuse in economic and ecological systems is of a foremost importance to devise policy measures that can help water management strategies whereas most papers have analysed the mechanisms of contagion in financial 46 47 and economic networks 39 40 much less is known about how the topology of interdependencies between the sectors and countries could affect the access to and the distribution of natural resources an interesting feature that was found in many networks is the presence of a highly heterogeneous structure with degree distributions characterized by large variability and heavy tails this feature in a context of inter sectoral input output linkages has proven to be fundamental to understand how microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate effects 27 indeed higher order interconnections capture the possibility of cascade effects whereby local shocks propagate to the rest of the economy 40 differently from previous studies 2 34 35 we analyse network statistics and we evaluate time series of network properties considering the country sector pair as the node and the flow of v w as the edge on the one hand mrio allows a more refined approach with respect to simple trade links since it includes intermediate economic sectors then allowing to recover the v w through the overall supply chain of production and consumption moreover differently from most of the previous studies that focus on agricultural and food products we consider all commodities including many water intensive industrial products such as energy paper and chemical products the consideration of all products within a mrio framework comes at the cost of dealing with a rather crude sectoral aggregation for what concerns many water intensive sectors such as the agricultural and food sectors that in our analysis are not broken down into detailed commodities with heterogeneous water footprints another drawback of using world input output data is that they are not the result of a direct data collection process as trade statistics rather they are the result of modelling exercises that aim at harmonizing country level input output tables with international trade statistics our study aims at integrating the results from sda with the study of the topology of the vw network in order to provide a rich framework of analysis that is able to provide a qualitative evaluation of the implications of trade and water management policies in terms of v w sda quantifies the impact of the main drivers over time while network theory assesses the vulnerability of the system to exogenous shocks diffused through trade to sum up we may say that demand level shocks can be evaluated by considering their impact on the need for virtual water by using the results coming from the sda while the effect of supply side shocks can be evaluated by considering the topology of the vw network as described by network statistics 3 bvwion international trade balances global trade involves to a different degree all countries in the world each of which is characterized by a technology of production given by the different mix of intermediate inputs a natural approach to deal with this framework is the application of a global mrio model 48 in which there are r regions countries in our case composed by the same number s of sectors the matrix of intermediate exchanges is composed by r s 2 elements this approach allows to exploit both information about the exchange within a country from sector i to sector j z i j r r and international trade from country b to country m z i j b m with possibly i j 12 12 in our case given the high level of aggregation each sector is actually composed by several firms and sub sectors for this reason we find positive and large values on the main diagonal in what follows we describe the logic of the mrio model the notation and the main equations that will be used in section 4 let assume without loss of generality 13 13 see ref 48 for a full description of the io methodology that the world is composed by two countries m b with two sectors each i j the aggregate world io table z of intermediate exchanges has on the diagonal the square matrices z m m and z b b which represent domestic interindustry flows while off diagonal matrices z m b and z b m record the interindustry flows across countries i e international trade in intermediates in particular each element z i j indicates the monetary value of intermediate exchange from sector i to sector j that is the element z i j b m is the monetary value of trade from sector i of country b to sector j of country m 1 z i i b b z i j b b z i i b m z i j b m z j i b b z j j b b z j i b m z j j b m z i i m b z i j m b z i i m m z i j m m z j i m b z j j m b z j i m m z j j m m let x be the vector of total output given by the row sum of intermediate exchanges z plus the matrix of final demand f which includes domestic consumption and international trade of final goods it is possible to split the system among different regions hence also x is composed by x b and x m the vector f of total final demand row sum of f is composed by domestic demand and exports the matrix of technical coefficients a describes how much of the production of sectors of each row is required directly to produce one monetary unit of output of the sector in the column that is a z x ˆ 1 where x ˆ is a diagonal matrix composed by the inverse of the elements in x i e 1 x i 14 14 in matrix notation the hat indicates the diagonal matrix given that a has the same structure of z we distinguish the domestic matrix blocks a b b a m m and those that describe the international intermediate trade a m b and a b m the leontief matrix l solves the linear system x a x f and it is thus given by l i a 1 each element l i j of l indicates how much the monetary value of the production of sector j must increase overall given an unitary increase in the final demand of good i matrix l captures not only the direct links a but also the indirect ones to compute the total use of water at the global level that is needed to satisfy final demand we compute the vector water intensity γ as the element by element ratio between direct water use of each country sector pair and the total monetary output of each country sector pair this vector describes the direct use of water for each sector country and year pair needed to produce one monetary unit of output table b1 in appendix b shows the value of direct water intensity γ for the four main macro sectors a f f e w g d u s and o t h and for both dev and ldc countries we observe a remarkable heterogeneity in water intensity both at cross sectoral and cross country levels even within the same macro sector we observe very large differences in direct water use per dollar of output for example in 2009 the water directly used to produce one dollar s worth of agriculture and food products was 61 times larger in india than in japan moreover we also observe substantial changes in water intensity through time within the same sector and country for example the direct use of water in the ewg sector in russia was 3 34 times larger in 1995 than in 2009 let w be the vector of total water use of each sector then γ w x ˆ 1 total water requirements of each sector is then defined as 2 ω γ ˆ l f combining γ and l we define the matrix of the water use multipliers θ γ ˆ l each element θ j i of the matrix θ measures the overall water impact of an increase of final demand of one monetary unit in one sector country pair for each sector in each region in the world 3 1 vwt evidence in what follows we show how international trade of intermediate and final goods and services with the corresponding v w t allows some country to indirectly use water coming from other countries the two key sectors are a f f and e w g that cover around the 57 and the 40 of direct blue water use respectively we define the v w of export θ e x p and import θ i m p of country c of both intermediate and final goods from which we derived the water trade balance θ b a l θ e x p θ i m p as 3 θ e x p c k 1 r θ c k f k f k c 4 θ i m p c k 1 r θ k θ c k f k c 5 θ k j 1 r θ j k where f c c is the domestic final demand while f k c represents the vector of export for final demand from country k to c and f k is the row sum of the matrix of final demand for each sector in country k θ c k l c k ω c is the square sub matrix which shows the leontief inverse for country c when it exports to k multiplied by the vector of sectoral water use intensity of country c note that θ c c k c n f k returns the water use in country c when producing goods and services for final use which are exported to all the other countries given k c it is possible to recover the water required in country c when producing the intermediate exports that are used abroad to produce final goods and services consumed by country k as θ c k k c n f k f k c we define a country c as a water debtor if θ i m p c θ e x p c see e g ref 49 page 519 an important conclusion from studies on v w trade is that in many cases international v w trade does not follow the spatial pattern of fresh water resource availability 42 fig 1 suggests that international trade has a high impact on the possibility of a country to face its domestic requirements by comparing the levels of vw trade balance and of water availability 15 15 as a proxy of water availability wa we use the variable total actual renewable water resources which shows the maximum theoretical yearly amount of renewable freshwater actually available for a country at a given moment for a more in dept discussion see ref 44 pag 34 and 15 our proxy of water availability that is not directly comparable in magnitude with our measure of virtual water is the sum of internal renewable water resources irwr and external actual renewable water resources erwr in particular the indicator is computed as the sum of total renewable surface water and total renewable groundwater minus the possible overlap between the two resources for more information refer to fao aquastat http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html lang en and 44 in fact countries with the smallest value of water availability are also net debtors of virtual water while few big countries e g china india and canada with large reserves of water are also net exporters of vw 16 16 the correlation coefficient between water availability and net vw balance export minus import is positive both when considering absolute values 72 4 and when considering per capita figures 68 9 the findings of 49 are confirmed with a progressive diversion of virtual water from the developing china india and brazil to developed countries see table b2 in appendix b the main net importers are the us 720 km 3 japan 380 km 3 germany 300 km 3 and great britain 225 km 3 note that once compared with water availability wa there are only few countries with large water endowments china india canada and brazil which cover the greatest part of the export of virtual water big countries are rather heterogeneous some of them are net exporters china 400 km 3 india 310 km 3 canada 275 km 3 and brazil 100 km 3 while the us and most european countries were net importers of b v w note that some results differ from the ones found in the literature in particular in our case the us is net importer of vw while the asian countries are mostly net exporters the opposite of what is found in refs 2 32 34 this divergence in results confirms that including more sectors than simply the agricultural one might unravel new dynamics in the international vwt the case of russia is particularly interesting russia was an important exporter in 2001 13 km3 but became a net importer 1 4 km3 in 2009 although it is a water abundant country as it is well known in international trade theory e g the heckscher ohlin model of factor endowment inasmuch as a country is less endowed with a production factor e g water it specializes in the production of commodities with little need of the scarce production factor and it imports commodities intensive in the scarce production factor in the case of water specialization according to the heckscher ohlin would give rise to trade in virtual water here it emerges a tendency of international trade to redistribute v w from water abundant to water scarce countries with the exception of the us from a systemic point of view these facts raise the question about the vulnerability of v w trade in case negative climatic shocks hit the main nodes of the virtual water network 4 structural decomposition analysis as discussed in the previous section trade in virtual water has increased substantially in recent years the existing literature agrees that this dynamic has been driven by a variety of factors such as changes in water efficiency in terms of use of water per unit of production structural change composition of final demand and scale effects 14 in this section we dig deeper into the drivers of virtual water by decomposing recent trends of virtual water in their various components structural decomposition analysis sda is a particularly useful tool to evaluate the likely impact of demand side change and shocks as it is based on the demand driven leontief model we apply a simplified version of the sda used by ref 24 differently from ref 24 we do not evaluate changes in environmental pressures embodied in export either of final goods and services or of intermediates but we evaluate directly the water required to satisfy the final demand of each country this is particularly suitable for our purposes as we can capture the importance of the different driving forces of total v w from a methodological viewpoint sda offers as static comparative analysis that allows to quantify the variation in water requirements as a consequence of a change in one component by keeping all the other components unchanged i e ceteris paribus condition mathematical details about the decomposition are discussed in appendix a the relative change of total water use from time t to t 1 δ w w t 1 w t w t is a function of the following drivers that are 6 δ w θ i e t h q p o p q c q c a p d where the intensity effect i e refers to changes in water intensity coefficients γ t and h represent the effects of trade and change in the sectoral composition of intermediate inputs respectively captured by the leontief inverse in the mrio model the impact of final demand is decomposed into four components impact of international trade d change in the product mix q c and change in consumption per capita q c a p and population size q p o p fig 2 shows the cumulative contribution to changes in water use of each component with respect to the water use in the base year 1995 the water i e component describes the role played by changes in the vector of direct water use per unit of produced output more specifically this component describes how changes in v w in all countries affect the total water requirement of a specific country overall improvements in water efficiency reduction of γ that is less water per unit of production of production activities allowed to reduce world water use by about 90 over the period 1995 2009 the contribution of this component has been rather small in the first years of the series 1995 1999 and then accelerated substantially up to 2009 the central panel of fig 2 shows in more details the impact on water use related to intermediate goods that are t and h the component h should be interpreted as the contribution to v w of changes in the technical coefficient matrix i e mix of intermediate inputs with no consideration of the geographical origin of intermediate inputs a positive sign reveals a systematic increase in the relative importance of water intensive sectors overall this component has driven up the world water use by about 8 over the period 1995 2009 the component t accounts for changes in the geographical composition of the mix of intermediate inputs for a fixed average mix of intermediates i e h a positive sign should be interpreted as a systematic shift of the purchase of intermediates towards more water intensive in terms of average γ countries at the aggregate level this component is very small 4 and contributed positively to v w quite surprisingly the composition of trade of intermediates has remained rather stable in the considered period especially when compared to changes in production technology h trade links seem to be persistent in time and are likely to be tightly connected to stable factors that determine trade patterns such as bilateral relationships between countries comparative advantage trade costs and factor endowment this is particularly interesting as shocks in water availability that might drastically reduce the supply of water intensive goods of a specific country hit by the shock are likely to influence the demand for water quite substantially due to the rigidity of bilateral trade patterns the right panel of fig 2 shows in more details the impact on water use related to the four components of final demand the first two components q c and d are the counterparts for final demand of the components h and t respectively the component q c quantifies the role played by changes in the product mix of final demand for a given level of final demand and for a given geographical composition of final demand we find a negative contribution of this component to total water demand in the order of about 18 over the period 1995 2009 the role of changes in the geographical distribution of final demand is described by the component d results for this component are very similar to the ones found for t changes in the geographical distribution of final demand contributes positively to the overall demand of virtual water even though the effect is rather small about 3 3 the last two components refer to more aggregate driving forces that are changes in total final demand per capita in real terms and demographic growth the role played by changes in q c a p which is strongly correlated with affluence is very important final demand per capita is by far the biggest component that drives virtual water accounting for the doubling of worldwide water use over the period 1995 2009 population showed a further positive impact of about 20 4 1 country level sda results for single countries highlight a substantial degree of heterogeneity fig 3 shows the results of i e for specific countries developing left panel and developed right panel 17 17 results for other countries in wiod are not reported and remain available upon request changes in water intensity contributed to an overall reduction in water for all countries except japan but with heterogeneous magnitudes the bric countries show a consistent reduction over time with cumulative contribution that goes from 70 to almost 160 18 18 note that in this case the percentage could be smaller than 100 because each variation is computed with respect to the previous year and each year showed an increase in water use an example might clarify let assume that the water use is constant over time at 100 k m 3 and assume that there are only two factors that influence water use x and y let imagine that each year x would contribute ceteris paribus to an increase of 20 km 3 that are exactly compensated by y then if we compute the cumulative variation with respect to the value of the first year 100 we would obtain values smaller than 100 from the sixth year on i e 120 for the factor y russia showed a volatile pattern that might reflect its economic conditions indeed during the economic crisis occurred in the period 1998 2000 we observe that water efficiency worsens due to economic and institutional disruptions instead from the year 2000 onward its γ coefficient decreased in correspondence of a period of fast economic recovery and political stability 19 19 russia was the biggest exporter of wheat worldwide in 2016 while in 1993 it was the biggest importer of wheat worldwide 4 the us australia and canada show an overall reduction in the range between 50 and 70 20 20 the rather volatile trend of australia in the early 2000s is likely to be related to the so called millennium drought that hit the south east of australia in those years 50 interestingly while the overall cumulative trends go in the direction of a negative contribution i e smaller water use from γ many years have been characterized by even substantial increases in average water use per unit of output fig 4 displays the h right and t left components for dev top and ldc bottom countries showing mixed outcomes the production mix contributed positively in terms of v w only for brazil 8 5 and china 20 over the period 1995 2009 interestingly in case of brazil the contribution of h had an inverted u shape trend while for china we estimate a steep increase starting form 2003 although anticipated and deep structural change shifting away from water intensive agricultural sectors 51 but with higher use of the water intensive ewg sector that superseded the savings from aff see table b4 in the other cases the sign was negative with a magnitude 15 20 for india russia and canada and of 5 10 for australia and the us while basically no change is observed for japan overall the production technology has changed in recent years in the direction of requiring an increasing amount of virtual water fig 2 central panel the effect of changing trade patterns in intermediate goods generates smaller variations with respect to the production mix similarly to the water efficiency trends are not systematically upward or downward looking at the overall 1995 2009 cumulative contribution of the t component we observe that the major country that shifted its demand of intermediate inputs towards systematically more water intensive countries in terms of average γ is china with an increase close to 20 the contribution of this component is smaller than 10 for india brazil russia and canada while it is negative and in the order of 5 10 percent for japan and australia although japan is highly dependent on import for its food needs it was able to reshape the import to a system of relations that reduced the v w associated to the trade of intermediate goods finally we consider the role played by final demand for both the dev fig 5 and ldc fig 6 countries this component is further decomposed into four components d top left panel q c top right panel q c a p bottom left panel and q p o p bottom right panel starting from the consumption mix q c we observe a general transition of final demand towards sectors with a systematically smaller water per dollar the only exception being japan and the us for which basically no change is visible in the latter case it seems surprising because after two decades of almost linear reduction the us recover almost all the difference in only one year in correspondence with the financial crisis of 2008 09 the component is particularly big in magnitude for china and india for which changes in the sectoral composition of final demand contributed to a reduction of water of 40 over the whole time window as highlighted in the recent literature 26 49 this evidence is linked to the relative decrease in the share of final demand directed to food products which are particularly water intensive looking at the evidence for water use due to shift of trade now of final goods the evidence is mixed china was the only big country that experienced a relevant increase 21 in d i e importing from more water intensive countries about the same contribution of factor t for the same country for the other ldc the contribution of d is close to zero while the contribution is slightly negative for all dev 2 5 5 except canada 2 5 these results are in line with the ones discussed for the component t denoting a substantial rigidity of the geographical distribution of trade patterns in line with previous findings 26 the consumption per capita q c a p that is strictly correlated to affluence i e gdp per capita is the main cause of increase of v w use this effect was particularly important for ldc from about 100 brazil to a peak for china that almost tripled its v w with respect to 1995 in the dev countries the increase was less than half 50 75 than ldc and no change is observed for japan these differences reflect asymmetric macroeconomic growth across countries with evidence of a substantial convergence of emerging countries towards high income countries both in terms of affluence and in terms of water demand on the other hand the role of demography has been very stable over the period contributing to steady increase in v w the magnitude is of about 10 20 in each country with the exception of russia and japan for which the contribution is negligible over the period 1995 2009 to summarize the structural decomposition has highlighted that while size related components population and affluence and technological structural components water intensity and structure of final demand and intermediate inputs mix have contributed substantially to changes in the demand for water the geographical related components both in terms of final demand and intermediate inputs had very little influence on the demand for water also because of the time invariant nature of the factors that determine the specialization of countries including water availability this result however may suggest another possible implication if the geographical structure of trade patterns was not responsive to differences in water endowment and efficiency across countries what would happen in case of shocks to water availability that are likely to occur due to climate change how would these shocks propagate across different countries and sectors and how vulnerable is the v w trade network these questions will be the subject of section 5 4 2 sectoral level sda to complete the evaluation of the driving forces of v w we also provide evidence on the role of the driving forces broken down by sector to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to provide such a level of detail in the decomposition of water use in our opinion these findings provide additional insights about the attribution of responsibility for the depletion of water resources and open the way towards future research aiming at refining the scale of investigation e g firm level for two reasons i avoiding aggregation bias and loss of information that affect macro variables and ii providing data and analyses at lower scale i e regions can be worth to guarantee a sustainable management of local resources like water fig 7 shows the basic sda related to water efficiency trade in intermediate inputs and final demand for four macro sectors aff ewg dus and oth as expected the most relevant variation are reported only by the first two sectors with only a slight contribution coming from dus for this reason we will only shortly discuss the outcomes of a f f and e w g the trends followed by water efficiency left panel and final demand right panel are similar for the two sectors surprisingly the e w g 50 improved its water efficiency faster than a f f 40 in terms of direct use of water per dollar of sectoral output i e γ the global contribution to the increase of water from final demand is split almost equally between the two sectors 50 each interestingly the trends related to the matrix of intermediate exchange show opposite signs the a f f sector slightly decreased its use of water while the e w g reported an increase of 15 overall the two sectors contributed both to almost the same increase in the water use of about 14 3 aff and 12 5 ewg with respect to the amount of 1995 finally fig 8 shows the complete sda for each macro sector with the cumulative variation in absolute terms k m 3 in each case the most important driver is the level of consumption per capita however the magnitude of this component appears to be rather heterogeneous a f f 1000 km 3 e w g 500 km 3 and d u s 30 km 3 for the three sectors the trend accelerates steeply from the year 2003 onwards as a consequence of rapid economic growth the other components of the demand seem negligible in each case with few exceptions q c in a f f contributed to a reduction of more than 250 k m 3 17 with respect to total b w in 1995 q p o p in a f f was responsible of an increase of more than 180 k m 3 12 with respect to total b w in 1995 5 network analysis of virtual water flows network analysis is particularly suitable to evaluate the short term impact of supply side shocks to the water system differently from sda that is based on the demand driven leontief model network analysis evaluates the likely consequences of the collapse of one or more nodes of the network when considering the network of virtual water flows the collapse of a node is equivalent to assume that water is not available due to some external reason e g a drought as a primary input of a production sector in a certain country this shortage will impede the production of that sector that will not be able to export virtual water to other downstream sectors giving rise to cascade effects on the contrary long run changes in water availability cannot be evaluated with the kind of network statistics we discuss below as these long run changes influence themselves the topology and structure of the virtual water input output network following 40 we compute the topology of the b v w i o n that is described by the matrix ω whose elements are the amount of direct virtual water m 3 21 21 we filter the edges such that the minimum amount of virtual water traded is 1000 m3 this simplifies the computation without affecting the results in a substantial way since we preserve more than 99 99 of the total bvwion exchanged for intermediate goods and services defined as 7 ω γ ˆ z such that the row sum must be equal to the total amount of water used in each sector for the io trade note that the vector γ is a filter so that only those links for which the country sector directly uses water have a positive weight in the whole io network it should be noted however that the network also include all the nodes country sector pairs that do not use water directly but are connected through inter industry transactions to country sector pairs that do use water directly this is particularly important when considering possible cascade effects we investigate the directed and weighted graph of the actual exchanges of virtual water embodied in each product 22 22 differently from the approach evaluated when considering vw trade we here just consider direct requirements of water and not total requirements in this way it is possible to complement the evidence arising from the sda which quantifies the role played by a variety of drivers of virtual water at the aggregate level with useful information on the topology of the linkages among countries and sectors differently for many other existing studies that focus on the cross country trade network 2 32 35 the main novelty in our paper is that we consider the country sector pair as the node of the network links between nodes are directed on the basis of the flow of trade from exporter to the importer and they are weighted by the volume of v w ω is the weighted adjacency matrix whose elements ω i j represent the links between node i and j that is the flow of v w that goes from i to j strictly positive self loops ω i i 0 capture the idea of an industry using its own products as inputs directed networks are typically asymmetric meaning that ω i j ω j i so they allow to recover the information both from the importer and the exporter side let k i n i be the i n node degree that is the number of sectors that are exporting to sector i while s i n i σ j ω i j is the i n node strength of node i that is the total v w related to the amount of intermediate input purchased by sector i 23 23 this computation reminds the backward linkage index which returns the column sum of matrix l to assess the importance of a node symmetrically we define the o u t node degree k o u t i and strength s o u t i of node i as the sum of entries in row i of matrix ω these indicators provide information about the structure of v w network and of the presence of hubs big importers or exporters which influence the vulnerability of the whole system the graph is composed by 1400 nodes i e industries in different countries each of which trades virtual water 24 24 row has been removed because by definition it includes a great variety of countries and then it does not represent a homogeneous entity the topological structure is not affected by that with the exception of the ranking because row covers a big share of the virtual water globally traded in what follows we discuss a series of network statistics of interest for the whole graph ω to assess its vulnerability to localized shocks at the level of single country sector pairs moreover to focus our attention on the international dimension of vw we also provide a comparison of the total world vwn with the pure international trade network it that is obtained by excluding within country trade from the matrix ω to check the scale free behaviour of the network although the number of edges or links is quite large 10 5 the share of active linkages with respect to all possible combinations 14002 is very low although increasing over time from 5 to about 6 this is not surprising because many sectors are characterized by a null direct water intensity coefficient 25 25 this is a specific feature of the data collected in wiod with the bulk of direct water usage concentrated in a reduced number of water intensive sectors if also direct water use of much less water intensive sectors was considered the number of active links would have been greater even though these additional links would have been characterized by a very small average weight in the case of the international trade network it similar considerations hold true although active linkages represent only 4 of ω the distribution of node strength is highly variable both in space and over time as expected the maximum node out strength s o u t that is the magnitude of export links is always greater than the maximum node in strength s i n that is the magnitude of import links this happens because few industries are providing virtual water to all the others in 1995 the highest out strength values was 90 km3 7 km3 in case of it and of 143 km3 8 2 km3 in case of i t in 2009 similarly for in strength that oscillated from 43 km3 2 2 km3 in case of i t to 52 km3 2 km3 in case of i t this evidence suggests that the b v w i o n is expected to be characterized by scale free behaviours by the presence of fat tails as discussed later in this section these characteristics imply that the b v w i o n is particularly vulnerable to shocks due to cascade effects note that the basic statistics concerning the structure of the exchanges are really stable over time and are independent on the scale of analysis not statistically significant differences are found over time nor between the whole i o network and i t the i t network appears to be even more stable over time than ω fig 9 shows the time series of the share of b v w used by the top suppliers out strength and buyers in strength as expected the main sectors are e w g and a t b with the interesting role played by f b which is among the main absorbing sector in the b v w i o n of i t the main countries identified in the previous section are present here brazil china india the us and japan with mixed roles sometimes as exporter and sometimes as importers depending on the sector based on matrix ω we observe that virtual water use is concentrated in few pairs in 2009 1995 top 5 suppliers used together 60 51 while the buyers were sparser the top 5 covered jointly only 27 24 in case of i t the percentages are slightly higher and more stable the cumulative percentage of the top 5 suppliers was 65 over the whole time span while the cumulative percentage of the top 5 suppliers was 25 these results open the door to a deeper understanding of the asymmetric information coming from the importer in and exporter out side and on how the topology can inform us about the probability of propagation of micro shocks through cascade effects that is the possibility to observe macro fluctuations global due to local supply side shocks 5 1 systemic vulnerability on the bvwion systemic risk is the risk that a local shock will affect several players i e country sector pairs because it spreads to the entire economy through the interconnections among nodes the structure of the network is a key component that can either attenuate or amplify systemic risk and thus its understanding is crucial to assessing monitoring and regulating vw systems most of the literature focused on the propagation of financial crises 27 37 39 40 while only few attempts have been made in the context of global food chains 4 38 and global vwn 52 the concept of vulnerability refers to the possibility that idiosyncratic micro level shocks propagate due to the inter sectoral linkages leading to aggregate fluctuations in particular the rate at which aggregate volatility decays explicitly depends on the structure of the inter sectoral network 40 this explains why we only focus on matrix ω and why we develop several indexes to evaluate the structure of the network and the distribution of different kind of connectivity degrees in particular substantial heterogeneity in the size and the interconnection among nodes high levels of variability in the degrees of different sectors and the presence of high degree sectors that share common suppliers imply that the effects of a shock will dissipate at a lower rate and then that the shock can generate macro level fluctuations the remarkable difference between v w t in final and intermediate goods deserves attention since most of the literature so far has been focusing on aggregate trade neglecting the impact of the unfolding of global production chains on water exchange and consumption to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to analyse the io supply chain in terms of v w vulnerability our results might represent an integration of previous literature that focused on final consumption and can enrich the framework of investigation toward wiser water management policies the analysis of the empirical distribution of i n and o u t node degree and strength has been widely applied to assess the heterogeneity of the network connectivity and then the potential vulnerability 37 40 a very common feature of many complex network is the so called fat tail distribution which means that extreme events i e the upper and lower parts of the distribution are more frequent than what expected in a gaussian distribution this fact has relevant repercussions on the stability of the trade relations and on the probability of local shock propagation in the short term fig 10 top panels shows the empirical probability density distribution 26 26 we apply the kernel density smoothing function provided in matlab statistical toolbox see https it mathworks com help stats kernel distribution html for a detailed description for both the i n left and o u t right strength degree with the distinction between ω and it given the stability of the structure over time we draw the empirical probability density function from all nodes of all years pooled together from the figure nodes appear to be log normally distributed especially so in the case of it the most widespread fat tail distributions analysed in the context of complex systems are the log normal and the power law ones these two distributions appear very similar from an empirical viewpoint and often the distinction among the two is rather difficult 53 54 since here we are not interested in the statical process of generation of distribution we compute both the main parameters of the log normal distribution mean and standard deviation and we run year specific ols regressions between the logarithm of node s degree and the logarithm of strength both for suppliers and buyers power law table 2 reports the outcomes for each year of the log normal parameters and the ols estimations the mean of the log normal is really similar for buyers and suppliers of about 10 while in case of it is 7 5 the volatility σ is very similar in both cases 3 slightly lower for importers interestingly even the it shows similar σ meaning that the it system is more volatile given that the mean is lower then in case of ω the power law relationship has the functional form s i n k i n ξ and s o u t k o u t ζ for buyers and suppliers respectively the coefficients were relatively stable over time ξ was approximately 2 4 2 2 for it while ζ was of approximately 2 1 7 for it thus revealing a highly skewed relationship these high values indicate that there is a strong more than proportional relationship between the volume of virtual water that each country trades and the number of commercial partners in other words the i n o u t weighted degree i e strength grows faster than simple i n o u t degree so the more trade connections a country has the more it is able to participate in the exchange of vw in a highly non proportional way however the rate of decay is far slower for an estimated coefficient ξ then the rate of decay is calculated as n ξ 2 ξ 1 55 pag 30 in our case it is about n 0 16 than in a gaussian distribution where the exponent is 0 5 meaning that shocks to sectors that take more central positions in the inter sectoral network have a more than proportional effect on the whole system in other words we detect an increasing interdependency among rigid cross country systems of water distribution and consumption that enables the extensive diffusion of risks these results are robust over time the adjusted r squared r a d j 2 that provides an estimate of the share of total variance that is explained by the econometric model reveals that the power law is a good approximation for both i n and o u t relations and both in case of b v w i o n and i t the smallest values are found in case of in degree where the goodness of fit was 55 75 in case of i t while the out degree performed really well with r a d j 2 of 75 85 in case of i t these results are in line with the findings of 2 despite the fact that our study accounts for self loops and that it focuses on inter sectoral trade only ω 27 27 note that the scale free behaviour allows to conjecture similar findings even when more data and details for the row will be available indeed the system is stable at different levels of aggregation and the absence of the half of the v w trade represented by the row does not affect the topology in what follows we introduce additional measures to understand whether benefits coming from higher trade connectivity i e efficient redistribution of v w as explained in section 3 1 are counterbalanced by greater systemic risks to provide a complete framework for the investigation of the systemic vulnerability of the network we compute the first and second order network characteristics the first order connectivity degree d is an average of the importance of a sector as a direct supplier to its importers the second order degree q captures the indirect connections that is the extent to which sectors with high degrees those that are important suppliers to other sectors are interconnected to one another through common suppliers in other words q i is defined as the weighted sum of d i of the sectors that use sector i s product as inputs with weights given by the corresponding input shares the distinction between the two is crucial because two networks with identical f i r s t o r d e r degree distributions might exhibit considerably different levels of vulnerability because of the so called cascade effects 40 indeed a country sector specific idiosyncratic shock affects not only those nodes immediately connected to it but also those indirectly connected first order d and second order q degrees are defined as follows 8 ψ ω s ˆ i n 1 9 d ψ i 10 q ψ d ˆ i where ψ is the matrix of weights such that i ψ i where i is the summation vector fig 10 bottom panels shows the distribution of both d and q which are characterized by fat tail behaviour these findings suggest that the b v w i o n is vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks due to indirect connections between sectors and countries it means that the indirect inter sectoral links potentially propagate the impact of a shock that hits a node most notably if it is a big exporter because of the scale free behaviour the same considerations hold in case of i t international input trade transmits shocks across borders in the same way as domestic input trade transmits shocks across sectors they are passed downstream through the production chain directly in other countries and may generate remarkable variations in the amount of v w traded thus the it network input flows despite their tiny fraction might be a risky channel of water redistribution the main implication is that remarkable aggregate fluctuations may originate from microeconomic shocks because the b v w i o n shows asymmetries in the roles that sectors play as direct or indirect suppliers to others finally table 3 shows some descriptive statistics to check the presence of fat tails in the distribution of first and second order connectivity degrees both skewness and kurtosis were positive and high indicating asymmetric distributions and compared to the normal distribution a higher concentration around the mean and fatter tails these values were always higher in case of it and for the d index this confirms that the international vwt could be a potential channel of shock diffusion mostly through indirect links i e cascade effects that indeed are captured by the second order connectivity degree moreover contrary to the findings of 38 we find that over time the kurtosis and skewness are increasing together with the increasing standard deviation confirming once again that the distributions become less balanced and the possible presence of heavy tails increases the level of vulnerability due to local crises and abnormal events this divergence in results confirms that including more sectors than simply the agricultural one might unravel new potential risks in the international vwt the extreme heterogeneity of the connectivity patterns together with the large degree variability observed are further signals of the presence of a scale free distribution recent literature shows that the heavy tailed nature of the degree distribution has also important consequences on the network vulnerability in case of removals of vertices or exogenous shocks to vertices 55 a relevant parameter for these phenomena is the ratio between the first and the second moment of the distribution i e the coefficient of variation defined as λ in case of directed networks as those analysed so far this heterogeneity parameter has to be defined separately for i n degrees λ s i n and o u t degrees λ s o u t if λ s i n 1 and λ s o u t 1 then the network manifests some properties that are not observed for networks with exponentially decaying degree distributions table 4 confirms the heavy tailed behaviour when comparing the heterogeneity parameters and their high variances with the only exception of the i n strength of it it should be noted however that in our context in which climatic shocks may influence the existence of nodes as suppliers of virtual water what matters the most for the propagation of shocks are o u t degrees because most of the analysed degree distributions are heavy tailed heterogeneity is very large so that the linear correlation coefficient between variables is not well defined for those cases a full account of the connectivity pattern and of the system vulnerability requires further non linear indicators of degree correlations first we compute the so called one point degree correlations k i n o u t and s i n o u t for individual nodes in order to understand whether a relation exists between the number of incoming and outgoing links in single nodes these one point degree correlations are computed as 11 k i n o u t σ i k i n i k o u t i k i n 2 12 s i n o u t σ i s i n i s o u t i s i n 2 a significant positive correlation between the in degrees and the out degrees of single nodes is found in each year as summarized in table 4 this implies that sectors that have a high number of input demand relations i e a high in degree also tend to supply their output to a relatively high number of other sectors this information is crucial to better understand the structure of international trade shown in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge the assessment of these values for environmental variables is novel in the literature finally the assortativity index measures the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the node strength hence it is a correlation coefficient between the strengths weighted degrees of all nodes on two opposite ends of a link this measure is a natural candidate to investigate the correlation of the degrees of neighboring vertices through this index we assess whether relatively high degree nodes have a higher tendency to be connected to other high degree nodes a positive assortativity coefficient indicates that nodes tend to link to other nodes with the same or similar strength this property was defined by ref 56 for un weighted networks while here we introduce the weighted and directed version 57 58 13 r ω j i s j s i 2 p j i s j s j 2 p 2 j i s j 2 s i 2 2 p j i s j s i 2 p 2 where p is the sum of the weighted edges of the network either total degree column weightk in table 4 or total strength column weights in table 4 and the double summation is computed only for positive links i e ω j i 0 we compute the assortativity index for each of the four possible combinations out out in in in out and out in finding very similar results table 4 reports an average value the weighted values were close to zero negative if weighted by degree and slighlty positive if weighted by strength 28 28 this results is slightly in contrast with those of 2 then we do not identify a clear behaviour suggesting that high degree strength country sector pairs tend to have trade relationships both with small and big country sector pairs in other words this result indicates that nodes that trade large volumes of water are highly connected with many other country sector pairs so that large volumes of water can be reallocated among several countries representing a potential water security tool confirming the finding of section 3 1 6 learning from sda and network analysis of vw the above analysis that combines structural decomposition analysis and network analysis highlights a trade off in the b v w i o n the global network of virtual water might benefit from increasing exchanges however it might be a risky channel because it facilitates the propagation of shocks the topological properties of the current v w network bring about some relevant implications that call for policy actions aimed at reducing and mitigating the propagation of shocks in the supply of water due to the increasing climatic risks actions should necessarily involve a coordinated set of measures across countries due to the high degree of dependence on foreign water resources for many countries not only big countries but also smaller ones should be included fig 1 shows a positive relation between the endowment of w a and the level of net import of v w and thus of higher level of external dependency and thus exposure to external shocks being part of the v w network increases a country s vulnerability to crises that occur in other countries involved in the network due to the cascade effects in other words there is a potential trade off between the need to import water intensive goods and the associated potential saving in water resources and the vulnerability to external shocks moreover from the inter temporal comparison of the f i r s t and s e c o n d order connectivity degrees and of the indexes of degree correlations it emerges an increasing tendency of the water network to be more vulnerable in time these are remarkable results about the possibility to incur in imminent crises finally our results highlight the necessity to reinforce initiatives toward coordinated local and global water management strategies to reduce the risks coming from water stress therefore understanding the structure of this network can inform policy makers on how to prepare for and recover from adverse shocks that alter the provision and distribution of water 7 concluding remarks in this paper we study the global network of virtual water exchanges by adopting a multi faced approach that integrates input output analysis and network analysis this approach proved to be fruitful in providing a wide picture of the issues at stake highlighting that a trade off may exist between an efficient allocation of water intensive production in water abundant countries to guarantee virtual water to water scarce countries and a vw trade network that prevents the propagation of risks our analysis contributes to the existing literature that analyzes the vw trade network e g refs 38 and 35 by considering all possible uses of blue water in many different sectors the present work also contributes to the debate about the potential merits and risks associated with high trade connectivity for water security sda allowed to unravel the main drivers of v w and their evolution over time there was a substantial contribution to reducing water demand exerted by the composition of final demand and by improvements in the water efficiency of production while demographic and economic growth and changes in the intermediate input mix have more than compensated such reduction interestingly the role played by changes in trade patterns was rather marginal contributing only to a moderate increase in virtual water besides the aggregate picture we also observe some peculiarities in specific countries that seem to be related to their level of affluence and their trajectory of structural change and economic growth overall sda analysis showed that the growing usage of water has been only marginally affected by the increase of virtual water trade network theory captures the non linear relationships between i n and o u t node strength and degree distributions that follow a power law distribution this finding has important implications for the trade policy of water scarce countries that look to increase their virtual water availability because the amount of v w increases more than proportionally with the number of commercial partners this means that increasing the number of trade partners through bilateral or multilateral trade agreements would allow water scarce countries to increase substantially their consumption of water intensive commodities the fat tail behaviour of the f i r s t and s e c o n d order connectivity measures confirms that the system is particularly exposed to the propagation of localized supply side shocks due to cascade effects 40 the main policy implication of these two findings is that a cross country coordination of water management policies is needed to reduce the vulnerability of the world water supply system to negative shocks that might hit some crucial nodes that would otherwise propagate to a large number of nodes when looking at both sda and network analysis it turns out that the component international trade is still relatively small in relative terms on the other hand the technological components h and γ have ensured to save almost 30 of water at global level 29 29 it is important to recall that these two technological components consider two different dimensions of technological improvement h identifies the contribution of changes in the mix of intermediate inputs to the demand for virtual water for a given mix of consumption and direct requirement of water per unitary output while γ considers reduced direct water requirements to produce a certain level of monetary output for a given mix of production and consumption due to the rather high degree of sectoral aggregation γ also account for within sector changes in the mix of products such as the move from water intensive crops to more water efficient crops within the agricultural sector this finding points to a possible response to perturbations to the vw network that is to improve water efficiency of production and consumption this important feature has been captured by the combination of the two methodologies that in isolation cannot describe effectively both the systematic risks and the dynamic evolution of the v w t the duality of trade is determined by the apparent minor role played by trade evidenced by the sda coupled with the potential risks related to the propagation of shocks in water supply across sectors and countries evidenced by network analysis in other words there is still large room for reducing the virtual water requirements by reallocating intermediate and final consumption towards more water efficient countries such reallocation however would come at the cost of greater exposure to propagation of shocks in the supply of water from specific countries this duality is particularly challenging for what concerns the negotiation of international trade agreements and of international agreements aimed at promoting water security and an efficient use of water a reduction of trade barriers may help in principle to improve the allocation of production of water intensive products in water efficient with lower use of water per unit of production countries this would come at the cost of increasing the vulnerability of the virtual water network results from connectivity and centrality measures underline the presence of a the disassortative network meaning that countries that trade large volumes of water are open to trade with many other countries so that large volumes of water can be reallocated among several countries representing a potential water security tool our results largely differ from some recent findings in the literature in particular 38 found that the v w t network is more interconnected but not necessarily less stable the key difference between our approach and the one followed in ref 38 is that we look at the larger network of industry and country specific relationships considering all products in the economy whereas they study the aggregate cross country network of exchanges of food commodities thus we find an extremely skewed connectivity distribution among country industry pairs while the distribution is usually less concentrated when studies are carried on at the country level our findings call for coordinated actions to better manage water scarcity through the development of transboundary agreements and policies both at global and regional level trade in commodities is an imperfect substitute for the mobility of factors this problem is exacerbated in case of freshwater that is locally extracted and cannot be cheaply transferred abroad our study aims at focusing the attention on an efficient in terms of reducing the amount of resource per unit of production and rational exploitation of a scarce resource such as freshwater that is sometimes overlooked in production decisions and in international agreements the process of globalization should then be matched with a process of international cooperation because countries actions are not confined to their territorial jurisdiction but they might interfere directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of the right to virtual water in other countries currently there is an imbalance between international trade agreements under the wto system and international agreements on sustainable water use being the former strong detailed and enforceable whereas the latter are weak unsophisticated and with low enforcement power an extensions of wto rules on trade in virtual water is needed with the aim of conserving domestic water resources in water scarce countries by means for example of export bans on water intensive products on the basis of serious concerns over conservation of domestic water resources or tariffs that consider the amount of water that has been used to produce imported products this approach may look similar to the one proposed to tackle the issue of carbon leakage in the context of climate change by means of so called carbon tariffs similarly to carbon tariffs a water tariff may be difficult to implement within the wto rules 59 and would require specific international negotiations water is central in the debate about climate change especially so for what concerns adaptation strategies during the cop21 in paris december 2015 a large number of parties identified the water sector as the first priority area for mitigation actions followed by agriculture that is also strictly connected to the water sector in the synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the intended nationally determined contributions proposed by the participating parties before the cop21 30 october 2015 30 30 the document is available at the following link http unfccc int resource docs 2015 cop21 eng 07 pdf we read that water security is clearly a key development priority for most parties and therefore various types of action related to the protection of water resources have been included in the adaptation components these generally aim at saving water ensuring security of supply enhancing the allocation of water and broadening the resource base this means that a likely large share of the funds that parties agreed to mobilise for mitigation and adaptation at least usd 100 billion by 2020 will be devoted to actions aimed at adapting the water sector to climate related disruptions a comprehensive consideration of virtual water trends topology and evolution is of crucial importance for an efficient and effective allocation of these economic resources appendix a structural decomposition analysis io allows to identify and quantify the main drivers of change through the so called structural decomposition analysis sda which allows to disentangle technological change from shifts in the final demand see ref 48 ch 13 let x be the vector of total output and t and t 1 be two consecutive periods i e years expressed in a common base year price then it is possible to decompose the variation as a 1 δ x x t x t 1 1 2 δ l f t f t 1 δ f l t l t 1 where the first term on the right hand side expresses the change of the io structure technology and trade and the latter the effect of a variation of final demand it has long been recognized in the literature on sda that there is not a unique criteria to do a decomposition the results may differ significantly across the alternative procedures see ref 60 22 for comparisons to overcome the non uniqueness problem it is possible to use the average of all possible decomposition forms 60 in case of n determinants or variables the number of alternative decompositions is n the average of all decompositions can be adequately approximated by the average of the two so called polar decomposition forms the first polar form is derived by starting the decomposition with changing the first variable followed by changing the second variable changing the third variable and so forth the second polar form is derived exactly the other way around i e changing the last variable first followed by changing the second last variable and so on here we propose and additive decomposition 22 of equation 2 to describe the increase from year t 1 to year t of the total water use a 2 δ w w t w t 1 θ i e θ t e c h θ c o n s where θ i e represents the intensity effect i e water efficiency that is the variation of water use for any unit of output γ computed as a 3 θ i e 1 2 δ γ ˆ l t f t δ γ ˆ l t 1 f t 1 afterwards we calculate θ l e o n that captures the variation of leontief coefficients from which it is possible to recover the impact from the change in the technological composition h and in the trade structure t of intermediate goods exchanges static comparative analysis allows to quantify the variation in water requirements given a change of matrix l by keeping all the other variables unchanged i e ceteris paribus condition as a 4 θ l e o n 1 2 γ ˆ t 1 δ l f t γ ˆ t δ l f t 1 finally θ c o n s represents the variation of virtual water due to a shift in the volume of final demand both at domestic and international level a 5 θ c o n s 1 2 γ ˆ t 1 l t 1 δ f γ ˆ t l t δ f the additive chaining technique allows to recover the whole variation from the first and the last year of interest simply by summing consecutive one year decompositions a 6 δ w t 0 w t w 0 τ 1 t δ w τ τ 1 here we further decompose θ l e o n we start by computing the matrix h 35 x 1435 which gives the sum of technical coefficients of a for each sector by including all the intermediate imports of each country the component h should be interpreted as the contribution to water of changes in the mix of intermediate inputs with no consideration of the geographical origin of intermediate inputs for country c we have h c of size 35 35 a 7 h c j 1 r a j 1 matrix t 1435 x 1435 whose elements are the ratios between regional technical coefficient with respect of total technical coefficient h captures the impact of different a different geographical compositions of intermediate goods for country c we compute t jc j ε r as a 8 t j c a j c h c where indicates the hadamard product which in this case is the element wise ratio for two matrices of the same dimensions recall that matrix a includes both t and h then we rewrite δ l with respect to h and t through matrix a in particular we apply the multiplicative decomposition of the leontief inverse a 9 δ l p o l a r 1 2 l t 1 δ a p o l a r l t l t δ a p o l a r l t 1 hence a 10 δ a p o l a r 1 2 δ t h t δ t h t 1 t t δ h t t 1 δ h where is the hadamard product which is the element wise product for two matrices of the same dimensions at this point it is worth to decompose the matrix of final demand δ f in order to find the trade structure and the impact of product mix distribution over time we assess the impact of population of per capita consumption let define f as a rsxr matrix where each column accounts the national distribution of final demand by considering both domestic consumption and imports for each sector let q be the overall level of the final demand then for country c we have a 11 q c j 1 r f j c which is a column vector with the distribution of domestic demand plus imports of country c over all the 35 sectors let d be the trade structure for final products then for each country c we compute d 1 c d 2 c d r c or in general for each j ε r a 12 d j c f j c q c afterwards we decompose q by taking into account the population size let q be the vector of total demand in each country and φ c 1 n q c be the product of population and consumption per capita that is also given by φ q p o p q c a p moreover let q be the relative distribution of total final demand by sector i e for country c we have that φ c is a scalar then a 13 q c q c φ c the final demand vector f k c of country c for any j 1 2 r is given by a 14 f k c d k c q c q c a p c q p o p c polar decomposition technique reduces the computation to only two equations the first one in which the static comparative analysis starts from the first component d while the second equation beginning from the last element p o p in this case the polar decomposition for the final demand is given by a 15 θ c o n s d q c q c a p q p o p where d is the polar decomposition of the final demand trade structure which is the counterpart for final demand of the component t a 16 d 1 2 δ d q t δ d q t 1 q c represents the variation of in the distribution of the demand among sectors it quantifies the role played by changes in the product mix of final demand for a given level of final demand and for a given geographical composition of final demand a 17 q c 1 2 d t 1 δ q q t d t δ q q t 1 finally q p o p and q c a p indicate the impact of population and consumption per capita growth respectively a 18 q c a p 1 2 d t 1 q t 1 δ q c a p p o p t d t q t δ q c a p p o p t 1 a 19 q p o p 1 2 d t 1 q t 1 q c a p t 1 δ p o p d t q t q c a p t δ p o p therefore equation 2 can be rewritten as a 20 w γ ˆ i t h 1 d q q c a p p o p where p o p is the total population and γ ˆ is a diagonal matrix composed by the entries of the array γ appendix b additional tables table b1 time series 1995 2009 of the water intensity coefficients γ in terms of m 3 for the

8719,the issue of water access and security has been emphasized in the recent policy debate on sustainable development sustainable development goal no 6 and adaptation to climate change cop21 in paris 2015 this study provides new evidence about the blue virtual water input output network the main novelty of our approach is the combination of structural decomposition analysis sda with network theory sda reveals that size related technological and structural components have contributed substantially to changes in virtual water use network analysis offers new insights about the vulnerability of the system to shocks through trade links across country sector pairs our analysis highlights a possible trade off in the increasing importance of virtual water trade the efficiency improvement in granting access to virtual water might come at the cost of increasing systemic vulnerability overall the great unbalance between water availability and usage combined with rigidity of global consumption and production networks and the risk of cascade effects imply increasing vulnerability of the virtual water network to shocks propagation keywords virtual water trade multi regional input output model network analysis jel classification c67 q25 f18 1 introduction global production chains virtually transfer large amounts of water resources from areas of production to far consumption regions a phenomenon that has been named the globalization of water 1 that is especially important for food security 2 4 conflicts for water 5 and overpopulation 6 the capacity to engage in trade enables water scarce countries to achieve food security and more generally to satisfy their demand for water intensive products the quantification and assessment of virtual water vw and the evaluation of the vulnerability of the v w network are particularly relevant as climate change and other exogenous shocks are likely to alter the geographical distribution of water availability and to increase the exposure to systemic risk of water misallocation 7 the two main methodological approaches used in the literature to analyse virtual water trade vwt are input output io analysis and network theory io tables express the monetary value of economic transactions occurring across sectors of an economy to account for sectoral interdependencies in the economic system in the vast literature of environmentally extended input output analysis the attention has been directed towards the attribution of the responsibility to producers and consumers for the exploitation of natural resources and the release of pollutants by computing the net balance of pollution and of resource embodied in traded goods io models allow to identify and quantifying both direct and indirect water use throughout the whole supply chain previous studies on water related to international trade considered both single region io data 8 10 sub national multi region io data 11 13 and global multi region io mrio data 14 17 based on io analysis the literature has developed a variety of structural decomposition analysis sda 1 1 see refs 18 19 and 20 for overviews of the literature in order to unravel and quantify the main drivers of change in pollution or in resource and water use there are several examples of sda of energy use 21 22 emissions 23 24 or water use 25 26 in a specific region or macro area with mixed results depending on the period the environmental dimension that is considered and the countries and sectors included in the analysis on the other hand network theory has been extensively used to analyse bilateral trade flows 27 because it enables to find non local interdependencies among nodes country sector pairs in our case involved in the international trade system and to capture useful information on the topology of exchanges network theory is particularly suitable to deal with economic complexity where hierarchies of economic sub systems and the synergistic interactions between sub systems can be detected 28 network analysis is a powerful tool to analyse complex influences of social and ecological structures i e multiplex on community and household dynamics 29 2 2 in our paper we do not develop a multiplex analysis due to the high number of sector country pairs involved but we decided to focus on directed and weighted network of vwt further research is needed to gain additional insights from multiplex network analysis in the context of world input output relationships of embodied water neoclassical macroeconomic theory got rid of the possibility of cascade effects based on the alleged diversification argument 30 however recent contributions showed that the interconnections between different firms and sectors play a key role in the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks throughout the economy 27 a number of papers applied network analysis to study virtual water trade as a global network by unveiling the main characteristics of its topological structure 2 31 32 as well as its geographical 33 and temporal evolution 34 35 they main findings are that i the total volume of virtual water trade is likely to shrink as a consequence of climate change due to increasing crop prices ii international trade in food related commodities has contributed to substantial savings of global water resources over time 7 and iii that the topology of exchanges is becoming denser over time as a consequence of globalisation following recent studies that integrate information provided by io tables with network indexes 27 36 37 we extend this approach to analyse the relation between global supply chains and water resources the global v w t system is both interconnected and interdependent which poses a problem of network vulnerability to exogenous perturbations 38 40 the novelty introduced by the present study is the combination of the sda with network measures of systematic vulnerability to exogenous supply shocks our approach proposes a multi faced framework of investigation that is suitable for those resources such as water for which a price mechanism for the allocation of the resource is weak or absent and the resource is not directly traded but it is virtually embodied in the exchanged goods the use of io allows to calculate the overall requirements of a resource and to identify the geographical origin of the resource network tools allow to study the systemic structure and the evolution of the network to unravel potential vulnerabilities in the exploitation and allocation of a resource the current study goes beyond previous contributions because we ground our analysis on inter sectoral virtual water trade and not simply on final consumption this step is essential to understand whether the current global supply chain of virtual water is vulnerable to external shocks and whether the evolution of international trade is yielding riskier systems of v w exchanges in particular i we take into account the heterogeneous sectoral composition of each country i i we assess the evolution of blue water use and the key drivers of its evolution and i i i we evaluate how the process of globalisation increasing international trade could affect the stability of the blue vw io network bvwion via sectoral level shocks the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the world input output database wiod and introduces the main concepts section 3 explains the input output methodology while section 4 discusses the drivers of blue water use by means of a structural decomposition analysis sda section 5 introduces the network methodology and the fundamental topological properties of the global virtual water trade network section 6 discusses the methodological implications from the combination of sda and network theory finally section 7 summarizes the main results and identifies open issues for further research 2 data and definitions the world input output database wiod 3 3 world input output database http www wiod org updated to 2013 wiod is composed by a set of harmonized supply and use tables and symmetric i o tables valued at current and previous year s prices for a description of alternative io databases see ref 41 provides data on world inter industry monetary flows of intermediate and final goods the database includes 40 countries 4 4 country coverage 40 countries including eu27 member states plus 13 non eu countries australia brazil canada china india indonesia japan south korea mexico russia taiwan turkey and the us and the remaining regions of the world aggregated into a single region row rest of the world which account for approximately 85 of world gdp and for approximately 70 of global blue water use 5 5 see http waterfootprint org en resources water footprint statistics for country level statistics data including blue water direct use in m3 are presented with a breakdown of 35 sectors for each country and vary in time 6 6 see http www wiod org database eas13 for a detailed description of the data sources used to estimate sector country year specific blue water direct use before moving to our set of empirical applications it is useful to discuss the most common definitions of virtual water present in the existing literature virtual water 7 7 see refs 42 and 43 for a review of the literature on v w concept refers to the quantity of water embodied in traded goods within and across national borders 44 including both direct and indirect uses along the whole supply chain 45 8 8 the sum of direct and indirect water use coefficients returns a vector of total water demand multipliers equivalent to the virtual water content in m3 details on the computation of virtual water based on input output analysis are discussed in section 3 blue water bw refers to the consumptive use of ground or surface water the supply of blue water is costly because it requires a specific infrastructure blue water is mobile can be abstracted pumped stored treated distributed collected and recycled thus each m3 saved can be directed toward alternative uses by production activities and households here we consider renewable freshwater then any quantity used in a year is available again the subsequent year for sake of brevity we compare the results at the global level with those derived from a selection of countries i developed countries eu us canada australia and japan labelled as dev and emerging countries india china russia and brazil labelled as ldc countries these selected countries cover together about the 50 of global gdp source world bank and about the 57 percent of total blue water direct use source wiod in 2009 the selection of countries includes both high income and emerging countries which allows to compare the drivers of changes in water demand across rather heterogeneous regions 9 9 a complete list of results for all countries in wiod are available in appendix b moreover for illustrative purposes we aggregate the 35 industries in four macro sectors the agriculture hunting forestry and fishing atb together with the food and beverage fb that we call a f f the electric gas and water supply egw the chemical textile pulp paper and metallic products dus and the remaining are pooled together because of their very small direct use of water oth 10 10 see table b6 for the list of all 35 industries present in wiod table 1 compares the total amount of water used both in absolute level and per capita given the stability of the distribution and of the ranking across countries in terms of water use during the considered time span we present the amount of blue water use in years 1995 and 2009 11 11 these volumes are provided by the wiod database release 2013 http www wiod org database eas13 there are three facts that emerge from the data reported by table 1 1 there is an uneven distribution of direct water use both in terms of absolute level and per capita the first three countries in the ranking china india and the us were responsible of about 41 39 of the total amount of blue water use worldwide in 2009 1995 2 the ranking of countries in terms of absolute water use and per capita water use remains rather stable over the time span 1995 2009 3 blue water use absolute and per capita has increased substantially over time in what follows we assess the role played by inter sectoral exchanges international trade technological shifts and change in size and composition of final demand in driving these aggregate figures 2 1 the input output system as a network the mrio model offers a variety of tools to ascertain several features of economic activity both at local and global level such as i tracing the trade structure between countries and the related impacts on economic systems environmental pressures and society ii identifying and quantifying the key drivers that cause changes over time in economic social or environmental variables and iii evaluating the economic and environmental consequences due to short run exogenous shocks even though they were designed to keep track of inter industry links the io systems have been extensively applied in the field of network science the mrio system can be viewed as an interdependent complex network where nodes are thought as country sector pairs and edges are the monetary flows related to the exchange of goods and services between industries more precisely in our analysis the mrio system measures inter industry and inter country of water embodied in the production of goods and services we consider the global mrio system as a world input output network in order to assess the evolution of v w t and the vulnerability of the system to potential exogenous shocks research on input output links as a network though relatively new is expanding rapidly the recent bulk of literature in economics stresses that the structure of this production network is key in determining whether and how microeconomic shocks that affect only a particular sector country can propagate throughout the economy yielding aggregate outcomes the study of the mechanisms through which shocks diffuse in economic and ecological systems is of a foremost importance to devise policy measures that can help water management strategies whereas most papers have analysed the mechanisms of contagion in financial 46 47 and economic networks 39 40 much less is known about how the topology of interdependencies between the sectors and countries could affect the access to and the distribution of natural resources an interesting feature that was found in many networks is the presence of a highly heterogeneous structure with degree distributions characterized by large variability and heavy tails this feature in a context of inter sectoral input output linkages has proven to be fundamental to understand how microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate effects 27 indeed higher order interconnections capture the possibility of cascade effects whereby local shocks propagate to the rest of the economy 40 differently from previous studies 2 34 35 we analyse network statistics and we evaluate time series of network properties considering the country sector pair as the node and the flow of v w as the edge on the one hand mrio allows a more refined approach with respect to simple trade links since it includes intermediate economic sectors then allowing to recover the v w through the overall supply chain of production and consumption moreover differently from most of the previous studies that focus on agricultural and food products we consider all commodities including many water intensive industrial products such as energy paper and chemical products the consideration of all products within a mrio framework comes at the cost of dealing with a rather crude sectoral aggregation for what concerns many water intensive sectors such as the agricultural and food sectors that in our analysis are not broken down into detailed commodities with heterogeneous water footprints another drawback of using world input output data is that they are not the result of a direct data collection process as trade statistics rather they are the result of modelling exercises that aim at harmonizing country level input output tables with international trade statistics our study aims at integrating the results from sda with the study of the topology of the vw network in order to provide a rich framework of analysis that is able to provide a qualitative evaluation of the implications of trade and water management policies in terms of v w sda quantifies the impact of the main drivers over time while network theory assesses the vulnerability of the system to exogenous shocks diffused through trade to sum up we may say that demand level shocks can be evaluated by considering their impact on the need for virtual water by using the results coming from the sda while the effect of supply side shocks can be evaluated by considering the topology of the vw network as described by network statistics 3 bvwion international trade balances global trade involves to a different degree all countries in the world each of which is characterized by a technology of production given by the different mix of intermediate inputs a natural approach to deal with this framework is the application of a global mrio model 48 in which there are r regions countries in our case composed by the same number s of sectors the matrix of intermediate exchanges is composed by r s 2 elements this approach allows to exploit both information about the exchange within a country from sector i to sector j z i j r r and international trade from country b to country m z i j b m with possibly i j 12 12 in our case given the high level of aggregation each sector is actually composed by several firms and sub sectors for this reason we find positive and large values on the main diagonal in what follows we describe the logic of the mrio model the notation and the main equations that will be used in section 4 let assume without loss of generality 13 13 see ref 48 for a full description of the io methodology that the world is composed by two countries m b with two sectors each i j the aggregate world io table z of intermediate exchanges has on the diagonal the square matrices z m m and z b b which represent domestic interindustry flows while off diagonal matrices z m b and z b m record the interindustry flows across countries i e international trade in intermediates in particular each element z i j indicates the monetary value of intermediate exchange from sector i to sector j that is the element z i j b m is the monetary value of trade from sector i of country b to sector j of country m 1 z i i b b z i j b b z i i b m z i j b m z j i b b z j j b b z j i b m z j j b m z i i m b z i j m b z i i m m z i j m m z j i m b z j j m b z j i m m z j j m m let x be the vector of total output given by the row sum of intermediate exchanges z plus the matrix of final demand f which includes domestic consumption and international trade of final goods it is possible to split the system among different regions hence also x is composed by x b and x m the vector f of total final demand row sum of f is composed by domestic demand and exports the matrix of technical coefficients a describes how much of the production of sectors of each row is required directly to produce one monetary unit of output of the sector in the column that is a z x ˆ 1 where x ˆ is a diagonal matrix composed by the inverse of the elements in x i e 1 x i 14 14 in matrix notation the hat indicates the diagonal matrix given that a has the same structure of z we distinguish the domestic matrix blocks a b b a m m and those that describe the international intermediate trade a m b and a b m the leontief matrix l solves the linear system x a x f and it is thus given by l i a 1 each element l i j of l indicates how much the monetary value of the production of sector j must increase overall given an unitary increase in the final demand of good i matrix l captures not only the direct links a but also the indirect ones to compute the total use of water at the global level that is needed to satisfy final demand we compute the vector water intensity γ as the element by element ratio between direct water use of each country sector pair and the total monetary output of each country sector pair this vector describes the direct use of water for each sector country and year pair needed to produce one monetary unit of output table b1 in appendix b shows the value of direct water intensity γ for the four main macro sectors a f f e w g d u s and o t h and for both dev and ldc countries we observe a remarkable heterogeneity in water intensity both at cross sectoral and cross country levels even within the same macro sector we observe very large differences in direct water use per dollar of output for example in 2009 the water directly used to produce one dollar s worth of agriculture and food products was 61 times larger in india than in japan moreover we also observe substantial changes in water intensity through time within the same sector and country for example the direct use of water in the ewg sector in russia was 3 34 times larger in 1995 than in 2009 let w be the vector of total water use of each sector then γ w x ˆ 1 total water requirements of each sector is then defined as 2 ω γ ˆ l f combining γ and l we define the matrix of the water use multipliers θ γ ˆ l each element θ j i of the matrix θ measures the overall water impact of an increase of final demand of one monetary unit in one sector country pair for each sector in each region in the world 3 1 vwt evidence in what follows we show how international trade of intermediate and final goods and services with the corresponding v w t allows some country to indirectly use water coming from other countries the two key sectors are a f f and e w g that cover around the 57 and the 40 of direct blue water use respectively we define the v w of export θ e x p and import θ i m p of country c of both intermediate and final goods from which we derived the water trade balance θ b a l θ e x p θ i m p as 3 θ e x p c k 1 r θ c k f k f k c 4 θ i m p c k 1 r θ k θ c k f k c 5 θ k j 1 r θ j k where f c c is the domestic final demand while f k c represents the vector of export for final demand from country k to c and f k is the row sum of the matrix of final demand for each sector in country k θ c k l c k ω c is the square sub matrix which shows the leontief inverse for country c when it exports to k multiplied by the vector of sectoral water use intensity of country c note that θ c c k c n f k returns the water use in country c when producing goods and services for final use which are exported to all the other countries given k c it is possible to recover the water required in country c when producing the intermediate exports that are used abroad to produce final goods and services consumed by country k as θ c k k c n f k f k c we define a country c as a water debtor if θ i m p c θ e x p c see e g ref 49 page 519 an important conclusion from studies on v w trade is that in many cases international v w trade does not follow the spatial pattern of fresh water resource availability 42 fig 1 suggests that international trade has a high impact on the possibility of a country to face its domestic requirements by comparing the levels of vw trade balance and of water availability 15 15 as a proxy of water availability wa we use the variable total actual renewable water resources which shows the maximum theoretical yearly amount of renewable freshwater actually available for a country at a given moment for a more in dept discussion see ref 44 pag 34 and 15 our proxy of water availability that is not directly comparable in magnitude with our measure of virtual water is the sum of internal renewable water resources irwr and external actual renewable water resources erwr in particular the indicator is computed as the sum of total renewable surface water and total renewable groundwater minus the possible overlap between the two resources for more information refer to fao aquastat http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html lang en and 44 in fact countries with the smallest value of water availability are also net debtors of virtual water while few big countries e g china india and canada with large reserves of water are also net exporters of vw 16 16 the correlation coefficient between water availability and net vw balance export minus import is positive both when considering absolute values 72 4 and when considering per capita figures 68 9 the findings of 49 are confirmed with a progressive diversion of virtual water from the developing china india and brazil to developed countries see table b2 in appendix b the main net importers are the us 720 km 3 japan 380 km 3 germany 300 km 3 and great britain 225 km 3 note that once compared with water availability wa there are only few countries with large water endowments china india canada and brazil which cover the greatest part of the export of virtual water big countries are rather heterogeneous some of them are net exporters china 400 km 3 india 310 km 3 canada 275 km 3 and brazil 100 km 3 while the us and most european countries were net importers of b v w note that some results differ from the ones found in the literature in particular in our case the us is net importer of vw while the asian countries are mostly net exporters the opposite of what is found in refs 2 32 34 this divergence in results confirms that including more sectors than simply the agricultural one might unravel new dynamics in the international vwt the case of russia is particularly interesting russia was an important exporter in 2001 13 km3 but became a net importer 1 4 km3 in 2009 although it is a water abundant country as it is well known in international trade theory e g the heckscher ohlin model of factor endowment inasmuch as a country is less endowed with a production factor e g water it specializes in the production of commodities with little need of the scarce production factor and it imports commodities intensive in the scarce production factor in the case of water specialization according to the heckscher ohlin would give rise to trade in virtual water here it emerges a tendency of international trade to redistribute v w from water abundant to water scarce countries with the exception of the us from a systemic point of view these facts raise the question about the vulnerability of v w trade in case negative climatic shocks hit the main nodes of the virtual water network 4 structural decomposition analysis as discussed in the previous section trade in virtual water has increased substantially in recent years the existing literature agrees that this dynamic has been driven by a variety of factors such as changes in water efficiency in terms of use of water per unit of production structural change composition of final demand and scale effects 14 in this section we dig deeper into the drivers of virtual water by decomposing recent trends of virtual water in their various components structural decomposition analysis sda is a particularly useful tool to evaluate the likely impact of demand side change and shocks as it is based on the demand driven leontief model we apply a simplified version of the sda used by ref 24 differently from ref 24 we do not evaluate changes in environmental pressures embodied in export either of final goods and services or of intermediates but we evaluate directly the water required to satisfy the final demand of each country this is particularly suitable for our purposes as we can capture the importance of the different driving forces of total v w from a methodological viewpoint sda offers as static comparative analysis that allows to quantify the variation in water requirements as a consequence of a change in one component by keeping all the other components unchanged i e ceteris paribus condition mathematical details about the decomposition are discussed in appendix a the relative change of total water use from time t to t 1 δ w w t 1 w t w t is a function of the following drivers that are 6 δ w θ i e t h q p o p q c q c a p d where the intensity effect i e refers to changes in water intensity coefficients γ t and h represent the effects of trade and change in the sectoral composition of intermediate inputs respectively captured by the leontief inverse in the mrio model the impact of final demand is decomposed into four components impact of international trade d change in the product mix q c and change in consumption per capita q c a p and population size q p o p fig 2 shows the cumulative contribution to changes in water use of each component with respect to the water use in the base year 1995 the water i e component describes the role played by changes in the vector of direct water use per unit of produced output more specifically this component describes how changes in v w in all countries affect the total water requirement of a specific country overall improvements in water efficiency reduction of γ that is less water per unit of production of production activities allowed to reduce world water use by about 90 over the period 1995 2009 the contribution of this component has been rather small in the first years of the series 1995 1999 and then accelerated substantially up to 2009 the central panel of fig 2 shows in more details the impact on water use related to intermediate goods that are t and h the component h should be interpreted as the contribution to v w of changes in the technical coefficient matrix i e mix of intermediate inputs with no consideration of the geographical origin of intermediate inputs a positive sign reveals a systematic increase in the relative importance of water intensive sectors overall this component has driven up the world water use by about 8 over the period 1995 2009 the component t accounts for changes in the geographical composition of the mix of intermediate inputs for a fixed average mix of intermediates i e h a positive sign should be interpreted as a systematic shift of the purchase of intermediates towards more water intensive in terms of average γ countries at the aggregate level this component is very small 4 and contributed positively to v w quite surprisingly the composition of trade of intermediates has remained rather stable in the considered period especially when compared to changes in production technology h trade links seem to be persistent in time and are likely to be tightly connected to stable factors that determine trade patterns such as bilateral relationships between countries comparative advantage trade costs and factor endowment this is particularly interesting as shocks in water availability that might drastically reduce the supply of water intensive goods of a specific country hit by the shock are likely to influence the demand for water quite substantially due to the rigidity of bilateral trade patterns the right panel of fig 2 shows in more details the impact on water use related to the four components of final demand the first two components q c and d are the counterparts for final demand of the components h and t respectively the component q c quantifies the role played by changes in the product mix of final demand for a given level of final demand and for a given geographical composition of final demand we find a negative contribution of this component to total water demand in the order of about 18 over the period 1995 2009 the role of changes in the geographical distribution of final demand is described by the component d results for this component are very similar to the ones found for t changes in the geographical distribution of final demand contributes positively to the overall demand of virtual water even though the effect is rather small about 3 3 the last two components refer to more aggregate driving forces that are changes in total final demand per capita in real terms and demographic growth the role played by changes in q c a p which is strongly correlated with affluence is very important final demand per capita is by far the biggest component that drives virtual water accounting for the doubling of worldwide water use over the period 1995 2009 population showed a further positive impact of about 20 4 1 country level sda results for single countries highlight a substantial degree of heterogeneity fig 3 shows the results of i e for specific countries developing left panel and developed right panel 17 17 results for other countries in wiod are not reported and remain available upon request changes in water intensity contributed to an overall reduction in water for all countries except japan but with heterogeneous magnitudes the bric countries show a consistent reduction over time with cumulative contribution that goes from 70 to almost 160 18 18 note that in this case the percentage could be smaller than 100 because each variation is computed with respect to the previous year and each year showed an increase in water use an example might clarify let assume that the water use is constant over time at 100 k m 3 and assume that there are only two factors that influence water use x and y let imagine that each year x would contribute ceteris paribus to an increase of 20 km 3 that are exactly compensated by y then if we compute the cumulative variation with respect to the value of the first year 100 we would obtain values smaller than 100 from the sixth year on i e 120 for the factor y russia showed a volatile pattern that might reflect its economic conditions indeed during the economic crisis occurred in the period 1998 2000 we observe that water efficiency worsens due to economic and institutional disruptions instead from the year 2000 onward its γ coefficient decreased in correspondence of a period of fast economic recovery and political stability 19 19 russia was the biggest exporter of wheat worldwide in 2016 while in 1993 it was the biggest importer of wheat worldwide 4 the us australia and canada show an overall reduction in the range between 50 and 70 20 20 the rather volatile trend of australia in the early 2000s is likely to be related to the so called millennium drought that hit the south east of australia in those years 50 interestingly while the overall cumulative trends go in the direction of a negative contribution i e smaller water use from γ many years have been characterized by even substantial increases in average water use per unit of output fig 4 displays the h right and t left components for dev top and ldc bottom countries showing mixed outcomes the production mix contributed positively in terms of v w only for brazil 8 5 and china 20 over the period 1995 2009 interestingly in case of brazil the contribution of h had an inverted u shape trend while for china we estimate a steep increase starting form 2003 although anticipated and deep structural change shifting away from water intensive agricultural sectors 51 but with higher use of the water intensive ewg sector that superseded the savings from aff see table b4 in the other cases the sign was negative with a magnitude 15 20 for india russia and canada and of 5 10 for australia and the us while basically no change is observed for japan overall the production technology has changed in recent years in the direction of requiring an increasing amount of virtual water fig 2 central panel the effect of changing trade patterns in intermediate goods generates smaller variations with respect to the production mix similarly to the water efficiency trends are not systematically upward or downward looking at the overall 1995 2009 cumulative contribution of the t component we observe that the major country that shifted its demand of intermediate inputs towards systematically more water intensive countries in terms of average γ is china with an increase close to 20 the contribution of this component is smaller than 10 for india brazil russia and canada while it is negative and in the order of 5 10 percent for japan and australia although japan is highly dependent on import for its food needs it was able to reshape the import to a system of relations that reduced the v w associated to the trade of intermediate goods finally we consider the role played by final demand for both the dev fig 5 and ldc fig 6 countries this component is further decomposed into four components d top left panel q c top right panel q c a p bottom left panel and q p o p bottom right panel starting from the consumption mix q c we observe a general transition of final demand towards sectors with a systematically smaller water per dollar the only exception being japan and the us for which basically no change is visible in the latter case it seems surprising because after two decades of almost linear reduction the us recover almost all the difference in only one year in correspondence with the financial crisis of 2008 09 the component is particularly big in magnitude for china and india for which changes in the sectoral composition of final demand contributed to a reduction of water of 40 over the whole time window as highlighted in the recent literature 26 49 this evidence is linked to the relative decrease in the share of final demand directed to food products which are particularly water intensive looking at the evidence for water use due to shift of trade now of final goods the evidence is mixed china was the only big country that experienced a relevant increase 21 in d i e importing from more water intensive countries about the same contribution of factor t for the same country for the other ldc the contribution of d is close to zero while the contribution is slightly negative for all dev 2 5 5 except canada 2 5 these results are in line with the ones discussed for the component t denoting a substantial rigidity of the geographical distribution of trade patterns in line with previous findings 26 the consumption per capita q c a p that is strictly correlated to affluence i e gdp per capita is the main cause of increase of v w use this effect was particularly important for ldc from about 100 brazil to a peak for china that almost tripled its v w with respect to 1995 in the dev countries the increase was less than half 50 75 than ldc and no change is observed for japan these differences reflect asymmetric macroeconomic growth across countries with evidence of a substantial convergence of emerging countries towards high income countries both in terms of affluence and in terms of water demand on the other hand the role of demography has been very stable over the period contributing to steady increase in v w the magnitude is of about 10 20 in each country with the exception of russia and japan for which the contribution is negligible over the period 1995 2009 to summarize the structural decomposition has highlighted that while size related components population and affluence and technological structural components water intensity and structure of final demand and intermediate inputs mix have contributed substantially to changes in the demand for water the geographical related components both in terms of final demand and intermediate inputs had very little influence on the demand for water also because of the time invariant nature of the factors that determine the specialization of countries including water availability this result however may suggest another possible implication if the geographical structure of trade patterns was not responsive to differences in water endowment and efficiency across countries what would happen in case of shocks to water availability that are likely to occur due to climate change how would these shocks propagate across different countries and sectors and how vulnerable is the v w trade network these questions will be the subject of section 5 4 2 sectoral level sda to complete the evaluation of the driving forces of v w we also provide evidence on the role of the driving forces broken down by sector to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to provide such a level of detail in the decomposition of water use in our opinion these findings provide additional insights about the attribution of responsibility for the depletion of water resources and open the way towards future research aiming at refining the scale of investigation e g firm level for two reasons i avoiding aggregation bias and loss of information that affect macro variables and ii providing data and analyses at lower scale i e regions can be worth to guarantee a sustainable management of local resources like water fig 7 shows the basic sda related to water efficiency trade in intermediate inputs and final demand for four macro sectors aff ewg dus and oth as expected the most relevant variation are reported only by the first two sectors with only a slight contribution coming from dus for this reason we will only shortly discuss the outcomes of a f f and e w g the trends followed by water efficiency left panel and final demand right panel are similar for the two sectors surprisingly the e w g 50 improved its water efficiency faster than a f f 40 in terms of direct use of water per dollar of sectoral output i e γ the global contribution to the increase of water from final demand is split almost equally between the two sectors 50 each interestingly the trends related to the matrix of intermediate exchange show opposite signs the a f f sector slightly decreased its use of water while the e w g reported an increase of 15 overall the two sectors contributed both to almost the same increase in the water use of about 14 3 aff and 12 5 ewg with respect to the amount of 1995 finally fig 8 shows the complete sda for each macro sector with the cumulative variation in absolute terms k m 3 in each case the most important driver is the level of consumption per capita however the magnitude of this component appears to be rather heterogeneous a f f 1000 km 3 e w g 500 km 3 and d u s 30 km 3 for the three sectors the trend accelerates steeply from the year 2003 onwards as a consequence of rapid economic growth the other components of the demand seem negligible in each case with few exceptions q c in a f f contributed to a reduction of more than 250 k m 3 17 with respect to total b w in 1995 q p o p in a f f was responsible of an increase of more than 180 k m 3 12 with respect to total b w in 1995 5 network analysis of virtual water flows network analysis is particularly suitable to evaluate the short term impact of supply side shocks to the water system differently from sda that is based on the demand driven leontief model network analysis evaluates the likely consequences of the collapse of one or more nodes of the network when considering the network of virtual water flows the collapse of a node is equivalent to assume that water is not available due to some external reason e g a drought as a primary input of a production sector in a certain country this shortage will impede the production of that sector that will not be able to export virtual water to other downstream sectors giving rise to cascade effects on the contrary long run changes in water availability cannot be evaluated with the kind of network statistics we discuss below as these long run changes influence themselves the topology and structure of the virtual water input output network following 40 we compute the topology of the b v w i o n that is described by the matrix ω whose elements are the amount of direct virtual water m 3 21 21 we filter the edges such that the minimum amount of virtual water traded is 1000 m3 this simplifies the computation without affecting the results in a substantial way since we preserve more than 99 99 of the total bvwion exchanged for intermediate goods and services defined as 7 ω γ ˆ z such that the row sum must be equal to the total amount of water used in each sector for the io trade note that the vector γ is a filter so that only those links for which the country sector directly uses water have a positive weight in the whole io network it should be noted however that the network also include all the nodes country sector pairs that do not use water directly but are connected through inter industry transactions to country sector pairs that do use water directly this is particularly important when considering possible cascade effects we investigate the directed and weighted graph of the actual exchanges of virtual water embodied in each product 22 22 differently from the approach evaluated when considering vw trade we here just consider direct requirements of water and not total requirements in this way it is possible to complement the evidence arising from the sda which quantifies the role played by a variety of drivers of virtual water at the aggregate level with useful information on the topology of the linkages among countries and sectors differently for many other existing studies that focus on the cross country trade network 2 32 35 the main novelty in our paper is that we consider the country sector pair as the node of the network links between nodes are directed on the basis of the flow of trade from exporter to the importer and they are weighted by the volume of v w ω is the weighted adjacency matrix whose elements ω i j represent the links between node i and j that is the flow of v w that goes from i to j strictly positive self loops ω i i 0 capture the idea of an industry using its own products as inputs directed networks are typically asymmetric meaning that ω i j ω j i so they allow to recover the information both from the importer and the exporter side let k i n i be the i n node degree that is the number of sectors that are exporting to sector i while s i n i σ j ω i j is the i n node strength of node i that is the total v w related to the amount of intermediate input purchased by sector i 23 23 this computation reminds the backward linkage index which returns the column sum of matrix l to assess the importance of a node symmetrically we define the o u t node degree k o u t i and strength s o u t i of node i as the sum of entries in row i of matrix ω these indicators provide information about the structure of v w network and of the presence of hubs big importers or exporters which influence the vulnerability of the whole system the graph is composed by 1400 nodes i e industries in different countries each of which trades virtual water 24 24 row has been removed because by definition it includes a great variety of countries and then it does not represent a homogeneous entity the topological structure is not affected by that with the exception of the ranking because row covers a big share of the virtual water globally traded in what follows we discuss a series of network statistics of interest for the whole graph ω to assess its vulnerability to localized shocks at the level of single country sector pairs moreover to focus our attention on the international dimension of vw we also provide a comparison of the total world vwn with the pure international trade network it that is obtained by excluding within country trade from the matrix ω to check the scale free behaviour of the network although the number of edges or links is quite large 10 5 the share of active linkages with respect to all possible combinations 14002 is very low although increasing over time from 5 to about 6 this is not surprising because many sectors are characterized by a null direct water intensity coefficient 25 25 this is a specific feature of the data collected in wiod with the bulk of direct water usage concentrated in a reduced number of water intensive sectors if also direct water use of much less water intensive sectors was considered the number of active links would have been greater even though these additional links would have been characterized by a very small average weight in the case of the international trade network it similar considerations hold true although active linkages represent only 4 of ω the distribution of node strength is highly variable both in space and over time as expected the maximum node out strength s o u t that is the magnitude of export links is always greater than the maximum node in strength s i n that is the magnitude of import links this happens because few industries are providing virtual water to all the others in 1995 the highest out strength values was 90 km3 7 km3 in case of it and of 143 km3 8 2 km3 in case of i t in 2009 similarly for in strength that oscillated from 43 km3 2 2 km3 in case of i t to 52 km3 2 km3 in case of i t this evidence suggests that the b v w i o n is expected to be characterized by scale free behaviours by the presence of fat tails as discussed later in this section these characteristics imply that the b v w i o n is particularly vulnerable to shocks due to cascade effects note that the basic statistics concerning the structure of the exchanges are really stable over time and are independent on the scale of analysis not statistically significant differences are found over time nor between the whole i o network and i t the i t network appears to be even more stable over time than ω fig 9 shows the time series of the share of b v w used by the top suppliers out strength and buyers in strength as expected the main sectors are e w g and a t b with the interesting role played by f b which is among the main absorbing sector in the b v w i o n of i t the main countries identified in the previous section are present here brazil china india the us and japan with mixed roles sometimes as exporter and sometimes as importers depending on the sector based on matrix ω we observe that virtual water use is concentrated in few pairs in 2009 1995 top 5 suppliers used together 60 51 while the buyers were sparser the top 5 covered jointly only 27 24 in case of i t the percentages are slightly higher and more stable the cumulative percentage of the top 5 suppliers was 65 over the whole time span while the cumulative percentage of the top 5 suppliers was 25 these results open the door to a deeper understanding of the asymmetric information coming from the importer in and exporter out side and on how the topology can inform us about the probability of propagation of micro shocks through cascade effects that is the possibility to observe macro fluctuations global due to local supply side shocks 5 1 systemic vulnerability on the bvwion systemic risk is the risk that a local shock will affect several players i e country sector pairs because it spreads to the entire economy through the interconnections among nodes the structure of the network is a key component that can either attenuate or amplify systemic risk and thus its understanding is crucial to assessing monitoring and regulating vw systems most of the literature focused on the propagation of financial crises 27 37 39 40 while only few attempts have been made in the context of global food chains 4 38 and global vwn 52 the concept of vulnerability refers to the possibility that idiosyncratic micro level shocks propagate due to the inter sectoral linkages leading to aggregate fluctuations in particular the rate at which aggregate volatility decays explicitly depends on the structure of the inter sectoral network 40 this explains why we only focus on matrix ω and why we develop several indexes to evaluate the structure of the network and the distribution of different kind of connectivity degrees in particular substantial heterogeneity in the size and the interconnection among nodes high levels of variability in the degrees of different sectors and the presence of high degree sectors that share common suppliers imply that the effects of a shock will dissipate at a lower rate and then that the shock can generate macro level fluctuations the remarkable difference between v w t in final and intermediate goods deserves attention since most of the literature so far has been focusing on aggregate trade neglecting the impact of the unfolding of global production chains on water exchange and consumption to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to analyse the io supply chain in terms of v w vulnerability our results might represent an integration of previous literature that focused on final consumption and can enrich the framework of investigation toward wiser water management policies the analysis of the empirical distribution of i n and o u t node degree and strength has been widely applied to assess the heterogeneity of the network connectivity and then the potential vulnerability 37 40 a very common feature of many complex network is the so called fat tail distribution which means that extreme events i e the upper and lower parts of the distribution are more frequent than what expected in a gaussian distribution this fact has relevant repercussions on the stability of the trade relations and on the probability of local shock propagation in the short term fig 10 top panels shows the empirical probability density distribution 26 26 we apply the kernel density smoothing function provided in matlab statistical toolbox see https it mathworks com help stats kernel distribution html for a detailed description for both the i n left and o u t right strength degree with the distinction between ω and it given the stability of the structure over time we draw the empirical probability density function from all nodes of all years pooled together from the figure nodes appear to be log normally distributed especially so in the case of it the most widespread fat tail distributions analysed in the context of complex systems are the log normal and the power law ones these two distributions appear very similar from an empirical viewpoint and often the distinction among the two is rather difficult 53 54 since here we are not interested in the statical process of generation of distribution we compute both the main parameters of the log normal distribution mean and standard deviation and we run year specific ols regressions between the logarithm of node s degree and the logarithm of strength both for suppliers and buyers power law table 2 reports the outcomes for each year of the log normal parameters and the ols estimations the mean of the log normal is really similar for buyers and suppliers of about 10 while in case of it is 7 5 the volatility σ is very similar in both cases 3 slightly lower for importers interestingly even the it shows similar σ meaning that the it system is more volatile given that the mean is lower then in case of ω the power law relationship has the functional form s i n k i n ξ and s o u t k o u t ζ for buyers and suppliers respectively the coefficients were relatively stable over time ξ was approximately 2 4 2 2 for it while ζ was of approximately 2 1 7 for it thus revealing a highly skewed relationship these high values indicate that there is a strong more than proportional relationship between the volume of virtual water that each country trades and the number of commercial partners in other words the i n o u t weighted degree i e strength grows faster than simple i n o u t degree so the more trade connections a country has the more it is able to participate in the exchange of vw in a highly non proportional way however the rate of decay is far slower for an estimated coefficient ξ then the rate of decay is calculated as n ξ 2 ξ 1 55 pag 30 in our case it is about n 0 16 than in a gaussian distribution where the exponent is 0 5 meaning that shocks to sectors that take more central positions in the inter sectoral network have a more than proportional effect on the whole system in other words we detect an increasing interdependency among rigid cross country systems of water distribution and consumption that enables the extensive diffusion of risks these results are robust over time the adjusted r squared r a d j 2 that provides an estimate of the share of total variance that is explained by the econometric model reveals that the power law is a good approximation for both i n and o u t relations and both in case of b v w i o n and i t the smallest values are found in case of in degree where the goodness of fit was 55 75 in case of i t while the out degree performed really well with r a d j 2 of 75 85 in case of i t these results are in line with the findings of 2 despite the fact that our study accounts for self loops and that it focuses on inter sectoral trade only ω 27 27 note that the scale free behaviour allows to conjecture similar findings even when more data and details for the row will be available indeed the system is stable at different levels of aggregation and the absence of the half of the v w trade represented by the row does not affect the topology in what follows we introduce additional measures to understand whether benefits coming from higher trade connectivity i e efficient redistribution of v w as explained in section 3 1 are counterbalanced by greater systemic risks to provide a complete framework for the investigation of the systemic vulnerability of the network we compute the first and second order network characteristics the first order connectivity degree d is an average of the importance of a sector as a direct supplier to its importers the second order degree q captures the indirect connections that is the extent to which sectors with high degrees those that are important suppliers to other sectors are interconnected to one another through common suppliers in other words q i is defined as the weighted sum of d i of the sectors that use sector i s product as inputs with weights given by the corresponding input shares the distinction between the two is crucial because two networks with identical f i r s t o r d e r degree distributions might exhibit considerably different levels of vulnerability because of the so called cascade effects 40 indeed a country sector specific idiosyncratic shock affects not only those nodes immediately connected to it but also those indirectly connected first order d and second order q degrees are defined as follows 8 ψ ω s ˆ i n 1 9 d ψ i 10 q ψ d ˆ i where ψ is the matrix of weights such that i ψ i where i is the summation vector fig 10 bottom panels shows the distribution of both d and q which are characterized by fat tail behaviour these findings suggest that the b v w i o n is vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks due to indirect connections between sectors and countries it means that the indirect inter sectoral links potentially propagate the impact of a shock that hits a node most notably if it is a big exporter because of the scale free behaviour the same considerations hold in case of i t international input trade transmits shocks across borders in the same way as domestic input trade transmits shocks across sectors they are passed downstream through the production chain directly in other countries and may generate remarkable variations in the amount of v w traded thus the it network input flows despite their tiny fraction might be a risky channel of water redistribution the main implication is that remarkable aggregate fluctuations may originate from microeconomic shocks because the b v w i o n shows asymmetries in the roles that sectors play as direct or indirect suppliers to others finally table 3 shows some descriptive statistics to check the presence of fat tails in the distribution of first and second order connectivity degrees both skewness and kurtosis were positive and high indicating asymmetric distributions and compared to the normal distribution a higher concentration around the mean and fatter tails these values were always higher in case of it and for the d index this confirms that the international vwt could be a potential channel of shock diffusion mostly through indirect links i e cascade effects that indeed are captured by the second order connectivity degree moreover contrary to the findings of 38 we find that over time the kurtosis and skewness are increasing together with the increasing standard deviation confirming once again that the distributions become less balanced and the possible presence of heavy tails increases the level of vulnerability due to local crises and abnormal events this divergence in results confirms that including more sectors than simply the agricultural one might unravel new potential risks in the international vwt the extreme heterogeneity of the connectivity patterns together with the large degree variability observed are further signals of the presence of a scale free distribution recent literature shows that the heavy tailed nature of the degree distribution has also important consequences on the network vulnerability in case of removals of vertices or exogenous shocks to vertices 55 a relevant parameter for these phenomena is the ratio between the first and the second moment of the distribution i e the coefficient of variation defined as λ in case of directed networks as those analysed so far this heterogeneity parameter has to be defined separately for i n degrees λ s i n and o u t degrees λ s o u t if λ s i n 1 and λ s o u t 1 then the network manifests some properties that are not observed for networks with exponentially decaying degree distributions table 4 confirms the heavy tailed behaviour when comparing the heterogeneity parameters and their high variances with the only exception of the i n strength of it it should be noted however that in our context in which climatic shocks may influence the existence of nodes as suppliers of virtual water what matters the most for the propagation of shocks are o u t degrees because most of the analysed degree distributions are heavy tailed heterogeneity is very large so that the linear correlation coefficient between variables is not well defined for those cases a full account of the connectivity pattern and of the system vulnerability requires further non linear indicators of degree correlations first we compute the so called one point degree correlations k i n o u t and s i n o u t for individual nodes in order to understand whether a relation exists between the number of incoming and outgoing links in single nodes these one point degree correlations are computed as 11 k i n o u t σ i k i n i k o u t i k i n 2 12 s i n o u t σ i s i n i s o u t i s i n 2 a significant positive correlation between the in degrees and the out degrees of single nodes is found in each year as summarized in table 4 this implies that sectors that have a high number of input demand relations i e a high in degree also tend to supply their output to a relatively high number of other sectors this information is crucial to better understand the structure of international trade shown in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge the assessment of these values for environmental variables is novel in the literature finally the assortativity index measures the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the node strength hence it is a correlation coefficient between the strengths weighted degrees of all nodes on two opposite ends of a link this measure is a natural candidate to investigate the correlation of the degrees of neighboring vertices through this index we assess whether relatively high degree nodes have a higher tendency to be connected to other high degree nodes a positive assortativity coefficient indicates that nodes tend to link to other nodes with the same or similar strength this property was defined by ref 56 for un weighted networks while here we introduce the weighted and directed version 57 58 13 r ω j i s j s i 2 p j i s j s j 2 p 2 j i s j 2 s i 2 2 p j i s j s i 2 p 2 where p is the sum of the weighted edges of the network either total degree column weightk in table 4 or total strength column weights in table 4 and the double summation is computed only for positive links i e ω j i 0 we compute the assortativity index for each of the four possible combinations out out in in in out and out in finding very similar results table 4 reports an average value the weighted values were close to zero negative if weighted by degree and slighlty positive if weighted by strength 28 28 this results is slightly in contrast with those of 2 then we do not identify a clear behaviour suggesting that high degree strength country sector pairs tend to have trade relationships both with small and big country sector pairs in other words this result indicates that nodes that trade large volumes of water are highly connected with many other country sector pairs so that large volumes of water can be reallocated among several countries representing a potential water security tool confirming the finding of section 3 1 6 learning from sda and network analysis of vw the above analysis that combines structural decomposition analysis and network analysis highlights a trade off in the b v w i o n the global network of virtual water might benefit from increasing exchanges however it might be a risky channel because it facilitates the propagation of shocks the topological properties of the current v w network bring about some relevant implications that call for policy actions aimed at reducing and mitigating the propagation of shocks in the supply of water due to the increasing climatic risks actions should necessarily involve a coordinated set of measures across countries due to the high degree of dependence on foreign water resources for many countries not only big countries but also smaller ones should be included fig 1 shows a positive relation between the endowment of w a and the level of net import of v w and thus of higher level of external dependency and thus exposure to external shocks being part of the v w network increases a country s vulnerability to crises that occur in other countries involved in the network due to the cascade effects in other words there is a potential trade off between the need to import water intensive goods and the associated potential saving in water resources and the vulnerability to external shocks moreover from the inter temporal comparison of the f i r s t and s e c o n d order connectivity degrees and of the indexes of degree correlations it emerges an increasing tendency of the water network to be more vulnerable in time these are remarkable results about the possibility to incur in imminent crises finally our results highlight the necessity to reinforce initiatives toward coordinated local and global water management strategies to reduce the risks coming from water stress therefore understanding the structure of this network can inform policy makers on how to prepare for and recover from adverse shocks that alter the provision and distribution of water 7 concluding remarks in this paper we study the global network of virtual water exchanges by adopting a multi faced approach that integrates input output analysis and network analysis this approach proved to be fruitful in providing a wide picture of the issues at stake highlighting that a trade off may exist between an efficient allocation of water intensive production in water abundant countries to guarantee virtual water to water scarce countries and a vw trade network that prevents the propagation of risks our analysis contributes to the existing literature that analyzes the vw trade network e g refs 38 and 35 by considering all possible uses of blue water in many different sectors the present work also contributes to the debate about the potential merits and risks associated with high trade connectivity for water security sda allowed to unravel the main drivers of v w and their evolution over time there was a substantial contribution to reducing water demand exerted by the composition of final demand and by improvements in the water efficiency of production while demographic and economic growth and changes in the intermediate input mix have more than compensated such reduction interestingly the role played by changes in trade patterns was rather marginal contributing only to a moderate increase in virtual water besides the aggregate picture we also observe some peculiarities in specific countries that seem to be related to their level of affluence and their trajectory of structural change and economic growth overall sda analysis showed that the growing usage of water has been only marginally affected by the increase of virtual water trade network theory captures the non linear relationships between i n and o u t node strength and degree distributions that follow a power law distribution this finding has important implications for the trade policy of water scarce countries that look to increase their virtual water availability because the amount of v w increases more than proportionally with the number of commercial partners this means that increasing the number of trade partners through bilateral or multilateral trade agreements would allow water scarce countries to increase substantially their consumption of water intensive commodities the fat tail behaviour of the f i r s t and s e c o n d order connectivity measures confirms that the system is particularly exposed to the propagation of localized supply side shocks due to cascade effects 40 the main policy implication of these two findings is that a cross country coordination of water management policies is needed to reduce the vulnerability of the world water supply system to negative shocks that might hit some crucial nodes that would otherwise propagate to a large number of nodes when looking at both sda and network analysis it turns out that the component international trade is still relatively small in relative terms on the other hand the technological components h and γ have ensured to save almost 30 of water at global level 29 29 it is important to recall that these two technological components consider two different dimensions of technological improvement h identifies the contribution of changes in the mix of intermediate inputs to the demand for virtual water for a given mix of consumption and direct requirement of water per unitary output while γ considers reduced direct water requirements to produce a certain level of monetary output for a given mix of production and consumption due to the rather high degree of sectoral aggregation γ also account for within sector changes in the mix of products such as the move from water intensive crops to more water efficient crops within the agricultural sector this finding points to a possible response to perturbations to the vw network that is to improve water efficiency of production and consumption this important feature has been captured by the combination of the two methodologies that in isolation cannot describe effectively both the systematic risks and the dynamic evolution of the v w t the duality of trade is determined by the apparent minor role played by trade evidenced by the sda coupled with the potential risks related to the propagation of shocks in water supply across sectors and countries evidenced by network analysis in other words there is still large room for reducing the virtual water requirements by reallocating intermediate and final consumption towards more water efficient countries such reallocation however would come at the cost of greater exposure to propagation of shocks in the supply of water from specific countries this duality is particularly challenging for what concerns the negotiation of international trade agreements and of international agreements aimed at promoting water security and an efficient use of water a reduction of trade barriers may help in principle to improve the allocation of production of water intensive products in water efficient with lower use of water per unit of production countries this would come at the cost of increasing the vulnerability of the virtual water network results from connectivity and centrality measures underline the presence of a the disassortative network meaning that countries that trade large volumes of water are open to trade with many other countries so that large volumes of water can be reallocated among several countries representing a potential water security tool our results largely differ from some recent findings in the literature in particular 38 found that the v w t network is more interconnected but not necessarily less stable the key difference between our approach and the one followed in ref 38 is that we look at the larger network of industry and country specific relationships considering all products in the economy whereas they study the aggregate cross country network of exchanges of food commodities thus we find an extremely skewed connectivity distribution among country industry pairs while the distribution is usually less concentrated when studies are carried on at the country level our findings call for coordinated actions to better manage water scarcity through the development of transboundary agreements and policies both at global and regional level trade in commodities is an imperfect substitute for the mobility of factors this problem is exacerbated in case of freshwater that is locally extracted and cannot be cheaply transferred abroad our study aims at focusing the attention on an efficient in terms of reducing the amount of resource per unit of production and rational exploitation of a scarce resource such as freshwater that is sometimes overlooked in production decisions and in international agreements the process of globalization should then be matched with a process of international cooperation because countries actions are not confined to their territorial jurisdiction but they might interfere directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of the right to virtual water in other countries currently there is an imbalance between international trade agreements under the wto system and international agreements on sustainable water use being the former strong detailed and enforceable whereas the latter are weak unsophisticated and with low enforcement power an extensions of wto rules on trade in virtual water is needed with the aim of conserving domestic water resources in water scarce countries by means for example of export bans on water intensive products on the basis of serious concerns over conservation of domestic water resources or tariffs that consider the amount of water that has been used to produce imported products this approach may look similar to the one proposed to tackle the issue of carbon leakage in the context of climate change by means of so called carbon tariffs similarly to carbon tariffs a water tariff may be difficult to implement within the wto rules 59 and would require specific international negotiations water is central in the debate about climate change especially so for what concerns adaptation strategies during the cop21 in paris december 2015 a large number of parties identified the water sector as the first priority area for mitigation actions followed by agriculture that is also strictly connected to the water sector in the synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the intended nationally determined contributions proposed by the participating parties before the cop21 30 october 2015 30 30 the document is available at the following link http unfccc int resource docs 2015 cop21 eng 07 pdf we read that water security is clearly a key development priority for most parties and therefore various types of action related to the protection of water resources have been included in the adaptation components these generally aim at saving water ensuring security of supply enhancing the allocation of water and broadening the resource base this means that a likely large share of the funds that parties agreed to mobilise for mitigation and adaptation at least usd 100 billion by 2020 will be devoted to actions aimed at adapting the water sector to climate related disruptions a comprehensive consideration of virtual water trends topology and evolution is of crucial importance for an efficient and effective allocation of these economic resources appendix a structural decomposition analysis io allows to identify and quantify the main drivers of change through the so called structural decomposition analysis sda which allows to disentangle technological change from shifts in the final demand see ref 48 ch 13 let x be the vector of total output and t and t 1 be two consecutive periods i e years expressed in a common base year price then it is possible to decompose the variation as a 1 δ x x t x t 1 1 2 δ l f t f t 1 δ f l t l t 1 where the first term on the right hand side expresses the change of the io structure technology and trade and the latter the effect of a variation of final demand it has long been recognized in the literature on sda that there is not a unique criteria to do a decomposition the results may differ significantly across the alternative procedures see ref 60 22 for comparisons to overcome the non uniqueness problem it is possible to use the average of all possible decomposition forms 60 in case of n determinants or variables the number of alternative decompositions is n the average of all decompositions can be adequately approximated by the average of the two so called polar decomposition forms the first polar form is derived by starting the decomposition with changing the first variable followed by changing the second variable changing the third variable and so forth the second polar form is derived exactly the other way around i e changing the last variable first followed by changing the second last variable and so on here we propose and additive decomposition 22 of equation 2 to describe the increase from year t 1 to year t of the total water use a 2 δ w w t w t 1 θ i e θ t e c h θ c o n s where θ i e represents the intensity effect i e water efficiency that is the variation of water use for any unit of output γ computed as a 3 θ i e 1 2 δ γ ˆ l t f t δ γ ˆ l t 1 f t 1 afterwards we calculate θ l e o n that captures the variation of leontief coefficients from which it is possible to recover the impact from the change in the technological composition h and in the trade structure t of intermediate goods exchanges static comparative analysis allows to quantify the variation in water requirements given a change of matrix l by keeping all the other variables unchanged i e ceteris paribus condition as a 4 θ l e o n 1 2 γ ˆ t 1 δ l f t γ ˆ t δ l f t 1 finally θ c o n s represents the variation of virtual water due to a shift in the volume of final demand both at domestic and international level a 5 θ c o n s 1 2 γ ˆ t 1 l t 1 δ f γ ˆ t l t δ f the additive chaining technique allows to recover the whole variation from the first and the last year of interest simply by summing consecutive one year decompositions a 6 δ w t 0 w t w 0 τ 1 t δ w τ τ 1 here we further decompose θ l e o n we start by computing the matrix h 35 x 1435 which gives the sum of technical coefficients of a for each sector by including all the intermediate imports of each country the component h should be interpreted as the contribution to water of changes in the mix of intermediate inputs with no consideration of the geographical origin of intermediate inputs for country c we have h c of size 35 35 a 7 h c j 1 r a j 1 matrix t 1435 x 1435 whose elements are the ratios between regional technical coefficient with respect of total technical coefficient h captures the impact of different a different geographical compositions of intermediate goods for country c we compute t jc j ε r as a 8 t j c a j c h c where indicates the hadamard product which in this case is the element wise ratio for two matrices of the same dimensions recall that matrix a includes both t and h then we rewrite δ l with respect to h and t through matrix a in particular we apply the multiplicative decomposition of the leontief inverse a 9 δ l p o l a r 1 2 l t 1 δ a p o l a r l t l t δ a p o l a r l t 1 hence a 10 δ a p o l a r 1 2 δ t h t δ t h t 1 t t δ h t t 1 δ h where is the hadamard product which is the element wise product for two matrices of the same dimensions at this point it is worth to decompose the matrix of final demand δ f in order to find the trade structure and the impact of product mix distribution over time we assess the impact of population of per capita consumption let define f as a rsxr matrix where each column accounts the national distribution of final demand by considering both domestic consumption and imports for each sector let q be the overall level of the final demand then for country c we have a 11 q c j 1 r f j c which is a column vector with the distribution of domestic demand plus imports of country c over all the 35 sectors let d be the trade structure for final products then for each country c we compute d 1 c d 2 c d r c or in general for each j ε r a 12 d j c f j c q c afterwards we decompose q by taking into account the population size let q be the vector of total demand in each country and φ c 1 n q c be the product of population and consumption per capita that is also given by φ q p o p q c a p moreover let q be the relative distribution of total final demand by sector i e for country c we have that φ c is a scalar then a 13 q c q c φ c the final demand vector f k c of country c for any j 1 2 r is given by a 14 f k c d k c q c q c a p c q p o p c polar decomposition technique reduces the computation to only two equations the first one in which the static comparative analysis starts from the first component d while the second equation beginning from the last element p o p in this case the polar decomposition for the final demand is given by a 15 θ c o n s d q c q c a p q p o p where d is the polar decomposition of the final demand trade structure which is the counterpart for final demand of the component t a 16 d 1 2 δ d q t δ d q t 1 q c represents the variation of in the distribution of the demand among sectors it quantifies the role played by changes in the product mix of final demand for a given level of final demand and for a given geographical composition of final demand a 17 q c 1 2 d t 1 δ q q t d t δ q q t 1 finally q p o p and q c a p indicate the impact of population and consumption per capita growth respectively a 18 q c a p 1 2 d t 1 q t 1 δ q c a p p o p t d t q t δ q c a p p o p t 1 a 19 q p o p 1 2 d t 1 q t 1 q c a p t 1 δ p o p d t q t q c a p t δ p o p therefore equation 2 can be rewritten as a 20 w γ ˆ i t h 1 d q q c a p p o p where p o p is the total population and γ ˆ is a diagonal matrix composed by the entries of the array γ appendix b additional tables table b1 time series 1995 2009 of the water intensity coefficients γ in terms of m 3 for the
