18180,this study demonstrates that meta asm a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to biological nutrient removal bnr systems with a robust single set of default parameters this model overcomes various shortcomings of existing enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr models studied over the last twenty years the model has been tested against 34 data sets from enriched lab polyphosphate accumulating organism pao glycogen accumulating organism gao cultures and experiments with full scale sludge from five water resource recovery facilities wrrfs with two different process configurations three stage phoredox a2 o and adapted biodenitro combined with a return sludge sidestream hydrolysis tank rss special attention is given to the operational conditions affecting the competition between paos and gaos capability of paos and gaos to denitrify metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and fermentation the overall good correlations obtained between the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets support that this new model which is based on in depth understanding of ebpr reduces calibration efforts on the other hand the performance comparison between meta asm and literature models demonstrates that existing literature models require extensive parameter changes and have limited predictive power especially in the prediction of long term ebpr performance the development of such a model able to describe in detail the microbial and chemical transformations of bnr systems with minimal adjustment to parameters suggests that the meta asm model is a powerful tool to predict and mitigate ebpr upsets optimise ebpr performance and to evaluate new process designs graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge model asm biological nutrient removal bnr enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr metabolic modelling polyphosphate accumulating organism pao glycogen accumulating organism gao 1 introduction biological nutrient removal bnr is the most widely applied technology worldwide for the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p at water resource recovery facilities wrrfs in addition to meeting effluent discharge regulations most wrrfs focus on achieving efficient bnr at relatively low operational costs the application of mathematical models has been shown to be a useful tool in this regard since their application provides a less time consuming and less costly methodology for the design and optimisation of wrrfs currently there are three different model concepts used in the literature to describe bnr activated sludge systems i the activated sludge models asms ii the metabolic models and iii the combination of these two approaches asm models have been proposed as mechanistic models that represent the biochemical transformations in activated sludge through several simplified process descriptions hauduc et al 2013 the asm2 henze et al 1995 and asm2d henze et al 1999 are examples of asms developed by the international water association iwa to describe enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr together with chemical oxygen demand cod and n removal oxygen consumption and sludge production other well recognised asms were also developed for these purposes the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 also known as the biowin biological model asm3 biop rieger et al 2001 and the most recent version of the university of cape town model uctpho hu et al 2007 these models have become the state of the art reference for modelling bnr activated sludge systems and they have been implemented in most of the commercial software packages available van loosdrecht et al 2015 on the other hand the metabolic models rely on the understanding of the metabolic pathways active in the process in order to explain the biochemical transformations that take place within the cells providing a better definition of the biological processes oehmen et al 2010a in this approach most of the yield coefficients are calculated theoretically through substrate energy and reducing power balances on well established biochemical pathways for the processes involved in polyphosphate accumulating organism pao and glycogen accumulating organism gao metabolism the stoichiometric yields estimated in existing pao gao metabolic models are able to describe a wide range of operational and environmental conditions as reported by several experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b carvalho et al 2007 lanham et al 2013 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005b 2005a pijuan et al 2004 2008 zeng et al 2003b the kinetic parameters of these models are the only parameters that require calibration because the metabolic approach mathematically correlates internal cellular reaction rates with observable conversion rates outside the cell to determine an overall stoichiometric reaction for each anaerobic anoxic and aerobic condition lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2005c 2010b smolders et al 1994a 1994b zeng et al 2003a therefore this method not only increases the consistency and reliability of the model but also facilitates the calibration process by reducing the number of parameters that require calibration the validation of existing pao gao metabolic models to lab lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b and field studies lanham et al 2014 demonstrated that the calibrated kinetic parameters are robust in fact these models only require recalibration of kinetic rates when the overall stoichiometric reactions and kinetic structure are modified to incorporate new process understanding the same capability is not observed with the application of current ebpr asms because they are lacking detailed and dynamic process understanding in fact some studies showed that these models require extensive stoichiometric and kinetic parameter changes dunlap et al 2016 menniti et al 2016 which reduces their predictive power and limits their practical use especially regarding the prediction of long term ebpr performance thereby combining ebpr metabolic models with the heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from asms may be seen as the most promising approach to achieve that goal since it provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to wrrfs the most referenced example of this combination is the asm2d tud model developed by the delft university of technology meijer 2004 which is the last published version of the integrated asm tud model this model combines the ordinary heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from asm2d henze et al 1999 with the metabolic model for denitrifying and non denitrifying ebpr developed by murnleitner et al 1997 there are several studies reporting that this model was successfully applied to domestic wastewater treatment plants with numerous configurations such as the university of cape town uct modified uct and three stage phoredox a2 o process with the adjustment of only a few default parameters van veldhuizen et al 1999 brdjanovic et al 2000 hao et al 2001 meijer et al 2001 although the asm2d tud model has demonstrated to indeed reduce the number of parameters requiring calibration it is one of the least used models in practice hauduc et al 2009 in addition to these models several experimental studies have improved in recent years the understanding of the mechanisms behind microbial population dynamics as a function of operational conditions in ebpr systems and suggested modifications to the currently available ebpr metabolic models examples of these developments include the description of the activity of various types of paos and their competitors e g gaos under i different operational conditions such as substrate temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b lopez vazquez et al 2009 ii different electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate and nitrite burow et al 2007 camejo et al 2019 2016 carvalho et al 2007 flowers et al 2009 kim et al 2013 lanham et al 2011 mcilroy et al 2014 rubio rinc√≥n et al 2019 2017 skennerton et al 2015 wang et al 2008 iii metabolic shifts e g glycolysis and anaerobic tricarboxylic acid tca cycle as a function of storage polymer concentrations cokro et al 2017 lanham et al 2014 2013 as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes carvalheira et al 2014c lanham et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lopez et al 2006 lu et al 2007 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 the incorporation of these additional factors into a model will enable the prediction of ebpr behaviour over a wide range of operational and environmental conditions despite this available knowledge these modifications have never been previously integrated into an overall activated sludge model and implemented in a commercial simulator therefore the development of a valuable model both in research and engineering capable of covering ebpr dynamics in a predictive way is strongly needed this paper intends to present an integrated metabolic asm model referred to as meta asm hereafter for bnr activated sludge systems capable of modelling ebpr processes in depth with minimal parameter adjustments table 1 synthesises the main limitations of the most well known ebpr literature models reviewed by hauduc et al 2013 and the new developments included in meta asm this work aims to 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta asm model 2 calibrate and 3 validate this model with different data sets from experiments using enriched lab pao gao cultures as well as full scale sludge to provide a single set of default parameters in doing this we will achieve a comprehensive combined metabolic asm model that can be used as valuable tool in research and engineering applications of bnr systems 2 material and methods 2 1 model description and development the meta asm model was implemented in simba ifak germany and describes the simultaneous removal of cod n and p it is composed of 109 processes and 41 components 23 particulate 2 colloidal and 16 soluble which describe the activity of the following six microbial groups the ordinary heterotrophic organisms xoho the ammonia oxidizing organisms xaoo the nitrite oxidizing organisms xnoo accumulibacter paos xpao competibacter lineage gaos xcpo and defluviicoccus genus gaos xdfo the standard processes of meta asm are described in table 2 while the list of state variables and the observed interactions between microbial groups are shown in appendix a the meta asm model combines the heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada a version based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 with a metabolic ebpr model based on the previous developments of lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b and updated to include modifications proposed by lanham et al 2014 both the barker dold model and metabolic models were identified previously in the review of hu et al 2003 as having potential for further development in addition to the uctpho model wentzel et al 1992 overall the meta asm model incorporates more processes than the literature models to describe the observed ebpr dynamics summarised in table 1 in this section the new model developments implemented in meta asm are described highlighting the mechanisms that were simplified or are neglected by current models 2 1 1 fermentation this process is modelled as a growth process similarly to the barker dold model but it is focused on the distribution of fermentation products acetate propionate and hydrogen see fig 1 this strategy correlates the cod loss mentioned by barker and dold 1997 with the hydrogen h2 gas formation and describes the production of two types of volatile fatty acids vfas due to the impact that these carbon sources have on the pao gao competition as detailed below note that the further description of h2 consumption by e g hydrogenotrophic methanogenic organisms was considered beyond the scope of this study 2 1 2 nitrification and denitrification ano and oho these processes are modelled as two step processes see fig 1 because wrrfs are increasingly interested in implementing new technologies such as shortcut nitrogen removal or control strategies that require the precise description of nitrate and nitrite furthermore the inclusion of the intermediate species is important to describe the observed interactions between autotrophic nitrifying organisms anos and heterotrophic organisms oho paos and gaos 2 1 3 endogenous processes in ohos and anos the decay of the oho aoo and noo is modelled according to the death regeneration concept with a component based model similarly to the barker dold model under anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions see fig 1 this concept was adopted in meta asm because it allows modelling the anaerobic decay unlike the endogenous respiration concept kinetically the decay rate coefficients are defined by considering only the contribution of the cell death rate while the effect of decreasing cellular activity was implemented through slowing down the growth rates of aoos noos and ohos according to the activity decay rates determined by hao et al 2009 under aerobic conditions the aerobic cell death rates of aoos noos and ohos were defined according to the same study instead the other models consider the total cell decay as the sum of the activity decay and cell death rates however this assumption overpredicts the conversion of dead cells to slowly biodegradable substrate xb and endogenous decay products xe which affects the other processes due to the potential increase of carbon bioavailability through hydrolysis and fermentation 2 1 4 origin of reducing power and energy for paos the influence of the reducing power i e nadh on the stoichiometry of the poly Œ≤ hydroxyalkanoates pha storage processes of paos was incorporated in meta asm the reducing power is provided via glycolysis or tca cycle pathways in the acetate uptake process according to lanham et al 2014 and via glycolysis or propionyl coa conversion to acetyl coa pathways in the propionate uptake process see fig 2 a the latter pathway is proposed in this study by considering that pao cells are able to generate nadh in the conversion of propionyl coa to acetyl coa since propionyl coa is not a direct intermediate of the tca cycle and its conversion to acetyl coa generates ample nadh for pha production these metabolic shifts are neglected in literature models and were incorporated in meta asm because each pathway provides different yields for the anaerobic pha formation and po4 release per vfa uptake for instance less pha is produced and more po4 is released when the tca cycle and propionyl coa conversion to acetyl coa pathways are active instead of glycolysis in fact the metabolic shifts between glycolysis and tca cycle were observed in lab zhou et al 2009 and full scale plants cokro et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 pijuan et al 2008 and are supported by recent metagenomics studies flowers et al 2013 mart√≠n et al 2006 skennerton et al 2015 of accumulibacter organisms lanham et al 2014 demonstrated through the application of metabolic models that lower vfa concentrations in the influent as well as longer aerobic retention times favour the dominance of the tca metabolism over glycolysis the energy source i e atp for the pha storage processes of paos was considered in meta asm to be mainly provided by hydrolysis of the intracellular polyphosphate however glycogen degradation was also considered to provide energy similarly to the asm2d tud model see fig 2 a the other models only consider the hydrolysis of the intracellular polyphosphate as source of energy 2 1 5 effect of the electron acceptor on pao yields this effect was considered in meta asm by defining distinct aerobic and anoxic yields as performed by oehmen et al 2010b the same distinction is also considered in the uctpho and asm2d tud models however it is important to clarify that the aerobic and anoxic metabolism of paos consist of the following reactions as described in murnleitner et al 1997 and smolders et al 1994a pha catabolism glycogen production biomass growth polyphosphate synthesis phosphate transport across the cell membrane and oxidative phosphorylation see fig 2 b from these reactions only the last two depend on the electron acceptor the others are independent and therefore identical for both conditions in terms of stoichiometry the amount of po4 transported per nadh2 oxidized Œµ and the amount of atp produced per nadh2 oxidized Œ¥ differ under aerobic anoxalic i e in the presence of nitrate and anoxilic conditions i e in the presence of nitrite smolders et al 1994a and kuba et al 1996 determined experimentally these parameters under aerobic and anoxic conditions respectively according to kuba et al 1996 the anoxic ax parameters Œ¥ax and Œµax are approximately 50 lower than aerobic 2 1 6 capability of paos to denitrify in addition to the effect of the electron acceptor in the anoxic yields of paos two subgroups of paos were considered in meta asm where one subgroup performs nitrate reduction hereafter dpao and both subgroups henceforth pao perform nitrite reduction these differences were modelled by multiplying a dpao fraction fdpao to all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate reduction processes of paos see fig 2 b this strategy is used to describe that some accumulibacter species are capable of performing denitrifying po4 removal with nitrate as suggested by recent studies camejo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 skennerton et al 2015 while all known accumulibacter clades are able to perform denitrification from nitrite onwards as suggested by previous research in this area camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2013 mart√≠n et al 2006 despite the differences in the stoichiometries it is considered that both subgroups denitrify at the same maximum kinetic rate the other literature models do not take into account the different denitrification capabilities of paos instead they incorporate a reduction factor in the anoxic kinetic rate equations to lower the aerobic kinetic rates according to this factor 2 1 7 capability of gaos to denitrify two subgroups were defined in meta asm for competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos to distinguish between the differences observed in their denitrification as reported in literature burow et al 2007 kong et al 2006 wang et al 2008 some competibacter can denitrify from nitrate to n2 gas dcpo hereafter and others cannot denitrify cpo while some defluviicoccus can denitrify from nitrate to nitrite ddfo hereafter while others cannot denitrify at all dfo following the same reasoning as paos all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate and nitrite reduction processes of cpo were multiplied by the dcpo fraction fdcpo and all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate reduction processes of dfo were multiplied by the ddfo fraction fddfo see fig 2 b 2 1 8 endogenous processes in paos and gaos two concepts were used sequentially in meta asm to describe the endogenous processes for paos and gaos endogenous respiration cell maintenance referred to as maintenance hereafter and the death regeneration concept see fig 3 this is consistent with available experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014c hao et al 2010 liu et al 2017 lopez et al 2006 lu et al 2007 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 wang et al 2015 2012 about the effect of starvation conditions and low organic loading rates on pao and gao metabolism these studies have demonstrated that maintenance is the main endogenous process for paos and gaos and that the cell death only corresponds to a minor fraction of the total decay hao et al 2010 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 wang et al 2012 literature models do not consider the use of different storage polymers by paos and gaos as a survival strategy prior to cell decay for this reason more details surrounding the maintenance processes are provided below for each process condition energy source for anaerobic maintenance of paos and gaos in the meta asm model the anaerobic maintenance processes for paos were modelled according to lanham et al 2014 as polyphosphate hydrolysis smolders et al 1994b followed by glycogen degradation filipe et al 2001 zeng et al 2003a when low polyphosphate levels are attained this sequential dependence was observed in several experimental studies lopez et al 2006 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 it was considered that paos only decay when these storage polymers are exhausted see fig 3 in gaos glycogen is the only storage polymer source for the anaerobic maintenance carvalheira et al 2014c stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 and therefore this process was modelled according to filipe et al 2001 and zeng et al 2003a the anaerobic maintenance rates for paos and gaos were calculated by taking into account the energy requirements obtained experimentally by stokholm bjerregaard 2016 this study showed that gaos have higher atp requirements than paos under anaerobic conditions due to this reason paos have an advantage over gaos in periods of extended anaerobic starvation conditions commonly observed in return sludge sidestream rss hydrolysis fermentation processes energy source for aerobic anoxic maintenance of paos and gaos in the meta asm model the aerobic anoxalic and anoxilic maintenance processes for paos were modelled in order to include sequential dependence on pha glycogen and polyphosphate carvalheira et al 2014c lanham et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 the same dependence was considered in the aerobic anoxalic and anoxilic maintenance processes for gaos except that these organisms do not rely on polyphosphate carvalheira et al 2014c vargas et al 2013 it was considered that paos and gaos start to decay with a maximum kinetic rate after pha glycogen and polyphosphate pools are exhausted see fig 3 the aerobic and anoxic maintenance rates for paos and gaos were calculated by taking into account the energy requirements obtained experimentally by carvalheira et al 2014c and carvalho et al 2007 the analysis of these results showed that gaos also have higher atp requirements than paos under aerobic and anoxic conditions therefore paos also have an advantage over gaos in extended periods of aerobic and anoxic starvation conditions 2 1 9 effect of operational conditions on paos and gaos type of carbon source and substrate competition ph temperature and do the effect of type of carbon source and substrate competition ph and temperature were incorporated in the processes of paos and gaos as described in the models of lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b the effect of the do was incorporated by determining the oxygen half saturation coefficients of paos and gaos through the experimental results of carvalheira et al 2014a although some literature models incorporate the effect of the temperature on the kinetics of paos barker dold and asm2d tud and the effect of ph on the model stoichiometry asm2d tud none of these models consider the effect of different types of carbon sources and do in the stoichiometry and or kinetics of paos and gaos consequently these models fail to describe the competition commonly observed between paos and gaos for the carbon source and the substrate preferences of each organism carvalheira et al 2014b oehmen et al 2005b these models also fail to describe that paos have a higher affinity for oxygen which provide them a kinetic advantage over gaos at low do levels as studied by carvalheira et al 2014a through lab studies and observed by keene et al 2017 in their pilot and full scale experiments 2 2 model calibration and validation the meta asm model was calibrated and validated through the procedure shown in fig 4 to derive a reliable default parameter set capable of predicting ebpr behaviour over a wide range of selected operational and environmental conditions the procedure followed is briefly described in this section and is consistent with the definition of model validation as stated by the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 2 2 1 data sets selection and their relevance to describe ebpr dynamics a total of 34 data sets describing different ebpr dynamics were selected from bench scale batch tests inoculated with lab scale enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge from five wrrfs from portugal pt and denmark dk table 3 and table 4 synthesize the characteristics of these sludges respectively for further details about the setup of these batch tests readers are referred to the cited studies the experiments described in table 3 were selected because they describe the dynamics of changing the carbon source and the do on the competition between paos and gaos as well as the denitrification capability of paos the experiments in table 4 describe the ebpr activity of five wrrfs from portugal and denmark with different process configurations three conventional a2 o and two adapted biodenitro combined with a rss hydrolysis tank these tests describe the different denitrification capabilities of paos and gaos the role of storage polymers in anoxic and aerobic endogenous processes and the metabolic shifts in paos as function of storage polymer concentrations e g glycolysis pathway vs tca cycle in addition these data sets also assess the effect of temperature on the activity of paos and gaos since the full scale sludge was collected in winter and summer for the portuguese wrrfs and only in winter for the danish wrrfs 2 2 2 calibration process the criteria for the selection of parameters requiring calibration was based on expert knowledge on metabolic models and sensitivity analyses performed in previous studies focussed on metabolic modelling lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b as discussed in section 3 1 1 the default parameters of aoos noos and ohos were not calibrated in this study because the experiments described in section 2 2 1 were designed to i inhibit nitrification through the addition of allyl n thiourea atu and ii reduce the activity of ohos due to the existence of an anaerobic phase preceding the anoxic and aerobic phases which favours the uptake of vfas by paos and gaos and limits the availability of this carbon source to ohos in the subsequent phases the kinetic rates of paos and gaos were the only parameters calibrated in this study to describe individually each of the 34 data sets selected the method used for the calibration of each kinetic parameter was the minimum error search using nelder mead optimizer and least squares each phase anaerobic aerobic and anoxic was calibrated separately in order to avoid error propagation and for this reason the initial model concentrations correspond to the initial experimental values see definition of initial conditions in appendix b 1 except the concentrations of xpao xcpo xdfo xoho stored polyphosphates in paos xpao pp inorganic suspended solids xig particulate unbiodegradable organics xu and xb in the aerobic and anoxic phases that were defined according to the last value simulated in the anaerobic phase the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos were determined first by fitting the measured anaerobic po4 release due to the fact that gaos were present in some experiments and therefore they also contributed for the observable vfa uptake pha production and glycogen consumption when paos are only present in the sludge any of these anaerobic conversions could also be used for the calibration of the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos because they are described by the same stoichiometric reaction in meta asm however it is recommendable to use the most reliable measurements po4 or vfas for the calibration of this parameter furthermore it should be noted that the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos were the only parameters calibrated in the anaerobic phase because those of cpo and dfo were indirectly determined through the correlations defined in equations b12 b17 see appendix b 1 these correlations assume the different substrate preferences obtained experimentally by carvalheira et al 2014b and lopez vazquez et al 2009 with enriched pao and gao cultures the aerobic and anoxic kinetic rates of each organism were determined in subsequent simulations by fitting the respective measured pha consumption glycogen production and po4 removal only in paos the effect of the do on the pao and gao competition was determined by calibrating the maximum aerobic kinetic rates and oxygen half saturation coefficients of these organisms with the data sets of carvalheira et al 2014a as the authors studied the effect of different do concentrations in enriched pao and cpo cultures due to the contrasting findings about the capability of paos to use nitrate kim et al 2013 rubio rinc√≥n et al 2017 saad et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the parameter fdpao was firstly defined as zero assuming that few full scale accumulibacter species are able to reduce nitrate and then defined according to the active dpao fraction estimated by the analytical method described in lanham et al 2018 see table 4 these two parallel calibrations were performed to confirm whether paos are able or not to reduce nitrate note that lanham et al 2018 did not find any correlation between the parameter fdpao estimated through chemical batch tests and the microbial composition determined by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation qfish especially when compared with accumulibacter type i and type ii competibacter lineage and defluviicoccus genus this study suggested instead that chemical batch tests are the best methodology for quantifying the potential of anoxic p removal in full scale wrrfs the fraction of defluviicoccus genus fddfo able to reduce nitrate and the fraction of competibacter fdcpo able to denitrify were assumed with a default value of 0 5 as discussed later for the same reasons the parameter fddfo was not defined according to the fraction of defluviicoccus vanus cluster i determined by qfish 2 2 3 validation process a single set of calibrated parameters was defined with the median values determined through the total of calibrated parameter sets obtained during the calibration process in addition the parameter fdpao was fixed with the median fraction of 0 69 determined analytically through the offline batch tests and fddfo and fdcpo were fixed with the assumed fraction of 0 5 sensitivity analysis was performed on these fractions by changing the fixed values 30 in order to evaluate the impact of these fractions on the model predictions see appendix c full cycle simulations were performed on the same data sets to validate if the selected single set of calibrated parameters can be used as a default parameter set in these simulations the anoxic and aerobic phases were initiated with the final anaerobic concentrations predicted as opposed to initiating these phases with the experimentally determined value this procedure was followed to assess the impact of error propagation between phases when a single set of default parameters is used the prediction quality of the model was assessed by plotting the predicted versus measured anaerobic po4 3 p release aerobic and anoxic po4 3 p uptake anaerobic pha production aerobic and anoxic pha consumption anaerobic glycogen consumption aerobic and anoxic glycogen production anaerobic vfas consumption and anoxic no3 n removal the goodness of fit of the model versus measured data to an ideal match y x was assessed by the adjusted r2 adj r2 parameter 2 2 4 performance comparison between models the predictive power of meta asm barker dold and asm2d was evaluated by performing full cycle simulations to the data sets of the wrrfs pt1 winter 1 dk2 winter 2 and pt2 winter 1 the default parameter set validated in this study was used in the meta asm while the parameters defined in matrices reviewed by hauduc et al 2010 were used in the barker dold and asm2d models the initial conditions in the anaerobic phase were defined as described in appendix b 1 except that in these models the concentrations of cpo and dfo were added to the concentration of oho xoho and the total concentration of pha measured was defined in the pha stored by pao xpao stor 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the procedure followed for the calibration and validation of the meta asm was based on the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 this book defines a model parameter as default when it refers to a consensus value that can be used as a starting point in a calibration process and a model parameter set as default when it has been validated on different wastewater treatment plants and has a clear explanation of how each proposed value was obtained therefore this paper discusses in detail 1 how the calibrated parameter sets were obtained in meta asm and 2 how a single set of calibrated parameters can be derived and validated as a default parameter set 3 1 1 calibration of model parameters the pao gao metabolic models only require the calibration of kinetic parameters through well designed experiments due to the fact that most of the yield coefficients are calculated theoretically through substrate energy and reducing power balances on well established biochemical pathways for the processes involved in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic pao and gao metabolism oehmen et al 2005c smolders et al 1994a 1994b zeng et al 2003a however the obtained yields depend on a few metabolic ratios such as the amount of atp produced per nadh2 oxidized Œ¥ amount of phosphate po4 transported per nadh2 oxidized Œµ and atp necessary for biomass synthesis k1 and k2 that were experimentally determined by previous studies with enriched pao and or gao cultures smolders et al 1994a zeng et al 2003a the impact of changing some of these metabolic ratios e g Œ¥ and k1 and k2 was shown to have a marginal effect on the model predictions and overall stoichiometry as demonstrated by lopez vazquez et al 2009 and zeng et al 2003a respectively based on these results the authors recommended not to change the original values of these parameters in fact several experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b carvalho et al 2007 lanham et al 2013 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005b 2005a pijuan et al 2008 2004 zeng et al 2003b conducted at different environmental and operational conditions including the data sets selected in this study have reported that the measured yield coefficients are very well described by the theoretical stoichiometric yields of previous pao gao metabolic models lanham et al 2014 lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b the data sets selected in tables 3 and 4 describe a variety of process dynamics and changes of operational conditions due to this reason the maximum kinetic rates for paos and gaos were calibrated for each data set to describe individually each process dynamic this procedure allowed a better understanding of the variations of each set of calibrated parameters and evaluate if with the model structure proposed it would be possible to derive a reliable and robust default parameter set capable of predicting these ebpr dynamics within an acceptable level of confidence table 5 shows the mean median and standard deviation values obtained for each kinetic rate calibrated note that the number of data sets depicted in table 5 used to calibrate each kinetic rate is less than 34 due to the fact that the experimental studies with the enriched cultures were not designed for all environmental conditions and in some full scale sludge tests some parameters were not available the capability of paos to reduce nitrate was also assessed during the calibration of the maximum kinetic rates through the fdpao stoichiometric parameter when this parameter is defined as zero the processes of nitrate reduction by paos are deactivated which means that paos are only able to perform anoxic p uptake using nitrite as electron acceptor some literature studies suggested that paos are not able to reduce nitrate and that the observed anoxic p uptake results from the utilization of nitrite produced by side populations such as denitrifying gaos dgaos or denitrifying ohos dohos kim et al 2013 rubio rinc√≥n et al 2017 saad et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 in this study this theory was tested with the available data sets from lanham et al 2018 table 5 shows that the model in this scenario only fitted the experimental results when the maximum anoxic kinetic rates of paos were increased to unrealistic values that are much higher than those calibrated under aerobic conditions this happens because gaos were not detected for instance in the tests performed with sludge from wrrfs pt1 dk1 and dk2 and the activity of dohos was inhibited as no external carbon source was added in the anoxic phase thus the production of nitrite by side populations is not supported from this data although other pha storing denitrifiers could also have been involved in the reduction of nitrate as suggested in section 3 1 2 this would not be enough to explain all the observed nitrate removal therefore these results from meta asm suggest that there are accumulibacter species in wrrfs able to use nitrate and perform po4 uptake as confirmed recently by camejo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and skennerton et al 2015 in addition to the kinetic rates the oxygen half saturation coefficients of paos ko2 pao 0 2 and gaos ko2 gao 0 5 were calibrated through the experimental results of carvalheira et al 2014a the obtained parameters indicate that paos have a higher affinity for oxygen which provide them a kinetic advantage over gaos at low do levels as discussed in detail in carvalheira et al 2014a fig 5 shows the meta asm model describing successfully different case studies using the calibrated parameter sets however it was still necessary to determine a single set of parameters and validate if it can be used as a default parameter set for future model applications 3 1 2 validation of the default parameter set full cycle simulations of the 34 data sets were performed using a single set of calibrated parameters defined with the median values determined during the calibration process see table 5 as well as the fixed fractions for the parameters fdcpo and fddfo despite the variations obtained in the calibration of the kinetic parameters figs 6 10 show that overall the single set of default parameters selected are reliable and robust as demonstrated by the good correlations obtained when the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets of enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge were plotted these results suggest that the model structure proposed in this study is appropriated for all systems studied the typical enriched pao gao and dpao profiles were very well described for all parameters even when different ratios of propionate to acetate and do concentrations were tested 0 844 adj r2 0 975 this was only possible because the model incorporates the key biochemical pathways for the uptake of propionate and acetate on the overall anaerobic stoichiometric reactions of paos and gaos as described in lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b as well as the different oxygen affinities of these organisms calibrated in this study furthermore the model predicted very well the po4 3 p profiles in the tests with different full scale sludge 0 742 adj r2 0 872 fig 6 b d f which strongly supports the capability of meta asm to describe different ebpr configurations a2 o and side stream ebpr systems the goodness of fit of the predicted versus measured pha to an ideal match in the tests with full scale sludge needs to be interpreted individually this parameter is reasonably described under anaerobic adj r2 0 759 fig 7 b and aerobic adj r2 0 601 fig 7 d conditions and less well described under anoxic adj r2 0 409 fig 7 f conditions fig 7 b clearly shows that the anaerobic pha production was slightly underpredicted at the end of the anaerobic phase especially in the data sets pt2 summer 2 and pt2 winter 1 these deviations may indicate the presence of other organisms in the sludge that were also able to store and consume pha in the subsequent phases the predictions of the aerobic and anoxic pha consumption were consequently affected by this anaerobic pha underestimation whose impact on adj r2 is most notable under anoxic conditions because less pha is consumed the slight underestimation observed in the prediction of no3 n removal adj r2 0 560 can also be explained by the impact that other pha storing denitrifiers could have had on the anoxic test see fig 10 b fig 9 b shows that the anaerobic vfa consumption was overall well described adj r2 0 929 glycogen is typically the most difficult parameter to be modelled accurately as has been previously pointed out in the literature lopez vazquez et al 2009 meijer et al 2002 murnleitner et al 1997 even so the predictions obtained in the tests with enriched pao gao cultures were very reasonable see fig 8 a c and e as were the anaerobic and aerobic experiments with full scale sludge in this study see fig 8 b and d furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed in this work for the fdpao fdcpo and fddfo parameters that were defined for the first time in the present study the effect of changing each parameter by 30 was assessed see appendix c and the results show that this variation had a residual impact on the model predictions it should also be pointed out that oehmen et al 2010b had previously performed a sensitivity analysis to the maximum kinetic rates that were calibrated in this study and observed that an increase or decrease of 10 of these parameters led only to a small increase 3 in the deviation between the experimental measurements and predictions thus small changes to the parameters calibrated in this study are unlikely to contribute substantial deviations to the model predictions 3 1 3 performance comparison between models the predictive power of the meta asm barker dold and asm2d was evaluated by performing full cycle simulations to the data sets of the wrrfs pt1 winter 1 pt2 winter 1 and dk2 winter 2 fig 11 a d g show that the meta asm model is able to describe all variables using the same default parameter set in the three case studies evaluated while the other two models do not the barker dold and asm2d models were able to describe the anaerobic po4 release and the aerobic po4 uptake except in the case study pt1 winter 1 the observed deviations are possibly explained by the fact that in this wrrf the glycogen pools in the cells were exhausted and paos used the tca cycle as alternative source of reducing power instead of glycolysis as explained in lanham et al 2013 this shift is responsible for the increase of the yield of po4 release per vfa utilized and this effect is well described in the meta asm model both models were not able to describe the anaerobic vfa consumption fig 11 b c e f h and i the main reason for this deviation is due to the predicted high anaerobic decay of ordinary heterotrophic organisms which increased the concentration of slowly biodegradable substrate affecting sequentially the anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation processes even so the anaerobic vfa consumption was better described in the barker dold model than in the asm2d model because the former describes the fermentation as an anaerobic growth process instead of a transformation process as described in the latter to overcome this deviation and calibrate the anaerobic vfa consumption it would be expected to change first the decay rate of oho in both models or define different decay processes as a function of the environmental conditions if these modifications are not enough to explain the measured anaerobic vfa consumption it would be required to change the kinetic rate for vfa uptake by paos in both models however this modification would cause an overprediction of the anaerobic release of po4 and pha production as a consequence the stoichiometric parameters of this process would have to be modified in order to describe the subsequent phases on the other hand both models fail to describe the simultaneous anoxic po4 and nitrate removal the previous observed deviation in the anaerobic vfa consumption is partly responsible for this failure due to the fact that the presence of vfas under anoxic conditions promotes the competition between ohos and paos for the electron acceptor which increases the removal of nitrate in addition to this correction it would be required to modify the reduction factor for anoxic growth in both models to fit the measured nitrate as illustrated in fig 11 h wherein the anaerobic vfa consumption was reasonably described by the barker dold model as a consequence of this modification the anoxic yields of paos would also have to be changed in the barker dold model and defined in the asm2d model because the initial trend of the anoxic po4 uptake seems to be well explained in both models by the current reduction factor overall the results of fig 11 support that current literature models are lacking detailed and dynamic process understanding and require extensive parameters changes as demonstrated by the application of the barker dold and asm2d models on the other hand modelling ebpr processes in depth reduces calibration efforts as demonstrated by the application of the meta asm model the effect of operational conditions on the competition between paos and gaos the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process are suggestions of modifications that should be incorporated in the literature models to increase their predictive power 3 2 challenges and limitations of the proposed approach the authors have reviewed critically the limitations of previous literature models and gathered information from targeted experiments and available literature to develop a model capable of providing an in depth understanding of ebpr systems operated at medium to long sludge retention times srts 5 43 days the available experiments published over the last 20 years focus mainly on the most well studied pao genus accumulibacter and gao competibacter lineage and the defluviicoccus genus organisms in lab and full scale systems hereafter referred to as classical pao and gao organisms however researchers have made efforts to improve the understanding of the ecophysiology of new putative pao and gao organisms such as the genera tetrasphaera and accumulimonas paos kong et al 2005 nguyen et al 2011 and micropruina gao mcilroy et al 2018 shintani et al 2000 in recent years they have been found in significant abundance in wrrfs sometimes outnumbering the classical pao and gao organisms lanham et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wu et al 2019 despite the abundance of tetrasphaera in some systems the quantification of its contribution to store intracellular p remains unclear and warrants further research it should be noted that the genera tetrasphaera and micropruina do not exhibit the typical phenotypes of pao and gao described in the meta asm model their metabolism does not rely on pha and they appear to be less competitive for vfa uptake kong et al 2008 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 instead they can grow anaerobically by fermenting amino acids or sugars and aerobically through the oxidation of glycogen micropruina spp or intracellular metabolites such as amino acids sugars and possibly fermentation products tetrasphaera spp nielsen et al 2019 due to these reasons their impact on vfa driven ebpr which is the focus of meta asm is likely to be low moreover the profile of po4 is still unclear in tetrasphaera paos an enriched lab scale study showed that these organisms are able to uptake po4 anaerobically through energy generated by fermentation of some carbon sources marques et al 2017 whereas other studies showed that they release po4 anaerobically and uptake po4 aerobically and anoxically kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 due to the need for further research the authors decided not to include these organisms in this version of the meta asm model furthermore the validation of the meta asm with the data sets presented in this study suggested that other organisms are capable of storing pha anaerobically or aerobically and could compete with pao and gao for the carbon source and contribute to denitrification if needed future work in this area could incorporate pha storage by ordinary heterotrophs into the model as performed in asm3 gujer et al 1999 on the other hand the meta asm model structure enables the incorporation of similar paos to accumulibacter e g accumulimonas to be considered as part of the same group of pao organisms which would not necessitate any structural change to the model itself in recent years some studies have focused on high rate ebpr systems operated with srts lower than 4 days where the microbial ecology and ecophysiology was observed to be different than the traditional ebpr systems ge et al 2015 valverde p√©rez et al 2016 to describe these systems the development of new mathematical models or adaptation of existing models is still required 3 3 implications for ebpr full scale systems control and optimisation tool the meta asm model summarises quantitatively the current state of knowledge of ebpr systems it has the capability of predicting ebpr performance as a function of the pao gao competition various environmental temperatures and phs different do concentrations different cod p ratios in the influent and periods of low organic loading or starvation conditions commonly observed in wrrfs without the need for extensive parameter adjustments these capabilities make the meta asm model a powerful tool for a better understanding design and control of bnr systems potential applications include side stream processes return activated sludge ras fermentation and shortcut nitrogen removal coupled with ebpr and denitrifying and low do operated ebpr systems in addition to conventional ebpr processes the description of the known conditions that affect the pao gao competition allow to estimate vfas requirements for different configurations and choose the best operating modes or process configurations the description of metabolic shifts as function of storage polymers concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes allow to select optimal srt and hydraulic retention time hrt conditions in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones this is particularly relevant for sidestream ras fermentation systems because the model captures dynamically gaos exhausting their storage polymers and decay much faster than paos in periods of extended anaerobic starvation conditions these features make the model suitable to estimate the fraction of ras diversion to fermentation as well as the optimal hrt and srt for fermentation the description of different pao and gao denitrification capabilities as well as the growth advantages of paos over gao under low do conditions 0 1 0 6 mg o2 l 1 allow the optimisation of ebpr systems with low energy and carbon consumption the next steps for further validation of the model are to 1 perform long term dynamic ebpr simulations and provide guidelines for future users of the model and 2 demonstrate the above features by applying the model in various engineering applications 4 conclusions this study produced a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model the meta asm model that provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to bnr systems with a robust single set of default parameters the advances described here overcome many of the limitations in terms of limited predictive power and extensive parameter changes required in currently available ebpr models examples of these improvements are the effect of operational conditions in the competition between paos and gaos the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process the meta asm model was tested against 34 different data sets obtained from bench scale batch tests inoculated with lab scale enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge from five wrrfs with two different process configurations a2 o and adapted biodenitro combined with a return sludge sidestream hydrolysis tank the overall good correlations obtained when the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets were compared support that this new model which is based on in depth understanding of ebpr reduces calibration efforts the theory that paos are able to use nitrate and perform anoxic p uptake was tested by activating or deactivating these processes during model calibration the anoxic kinetic rates of paos obtained when these processes were activated suggest that there are accumulibacter clades in wrrfs able to use nitrate and perform p uptake the meta asm model has the capability of predicting ebpr performance as a function of the pao gao competition various environmental temperatures and phs different do concentrations different cod p ratios in the influent and periods of low organic loading or starvation conditions commonly observed in wrrfs this study suggests that the meta asm model is a powerful tool to predict and mitigate ebpr upsets as well as to optimise ebpr performance 5

18180,this study demonstrates that meta asm a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to biological nutrient removal bnr systems with a robust single set of default parameters this model overcomes various shortcomings of existing enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr models studied over the last twenty years the model has been tested against 34 data sets from enriched lab polyphosphate accumulating organism pao glycogen accumulating organism gao cultures and experiments with full scale sludge from five water resource recovery facilities wrrfs with two different process configurations three stage phoredox a2 o and adapted biodenitro combined with a return sludge sidestream hydrolysis tank rss special attention is given to the operational conditions affecting the competition between paos and gaos capability of paos and gaos to denitrify metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and fermentation the overall good correlations obtained between the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets support that this new model which is based on in depth understanding of ebpr reduces calibration efforts on the other hand the performance comparison between meta asm and literature models demonstrates that existing literature models require extensive parameter changes and have limited predictive power especially in the prediction of long term ebpr performance the development of such a model able to describe in detail the microbial and chemical transformations of bnr systems with minimal adjustment to parameters suggests that the meta asm model is a powerful tool to predict and mitigate ebpr upsets optimise ebpr performance and to evaluate new process designs graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge model asm biological nutrient removal bnr enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr metabolic modelling polyphosphate accumulating organism pao glycogen accumulating organism gao 1 introduction biological nutrient removal bnr is the most widely applied technology worldwide for the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p at water resource recovery facilities wrrfs in addition to meeting effluent discharge regulations most wrrfs focus on achieving efficient bnr at relatively low operational costs the application of mathematical models has been shown to be a useful tool in this regard since their application provides a less time consuming and less costly methodology for the design and optimisation of wrrfs currently there are three different model concepts used in the literature to describe bnr activated sludge systems i the activated sludge models asms ii the metabolic models and iii the combination of these two approaches asm models have been proposed as mechanistic models that represent the biochemical transformations in activated sludge through several simplified process descriptions hauduc et al 2013 the asm2 henze et al 1995 and asm2d henze et al 1999 are examples of asms developed by the international water association iwa to describe enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr together with chemical oxygen demand cod and n removal oxygen consumption and sludge production other well recognised asms were also developed for these purposes the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 also known as the biowin biological model asm3 biop rieger et al 2001 and the most recent version of the university of cape town model uctpho hu et al 2007 these models have become the state of the art reference for modelling bnr activated sludge systems and they have been implemented in most of the commercial software packages available van loosdrecht et al 2015 on the other hand the metabolic models rely on the understanding of the metabolic pathways active in the process in order to explain the biochemical transformations that take place within the cells providing a better definition of the biological processes oehmen et al 2010a in this approach most of the yield coefficients are calculated theoretically through substrate energy and reducing power balances on well established biochemical pathways for the processes involved in polyphosphate accumulating organism pao and glycogen accumulating organism gao metabolism the stoichiometric yields estimated in existing pao gao metabolic models are able to describe a wide range of operational and environmental conditions as reported by several experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b carvalho et al 2007 lanham et al 2013 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005b 2005a pijuan et al 2004 2008 zeng et al 2003b the kinetic parameters of these models are the only parameters that require calibration because the metabolic approach mathematically correlates internal cellular reaction rates with observable conversion rates outside the cell to determine an overall stoichiometric reaction for each anaerobic anoxic and aerobic condition lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2005c 2010b smolders et al 1994a 1994b zeng et al 2003a therefore this method not only increases the consistency and reliability of the model but also facilitates the calibration process by reducing the number of parameters that require calibration the validation of existing pao gao metabolic models to lab lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b and field studies lanham et al 2014 demonstrated that the calibrated kinetic parameters are robust in fact these models only require recalibration of kinetic rates when the overall stoichiometric reactions and kinetic structure are modified to incorporate new process understanding the same capability is not observed with the application of current ebpr asms because they are lacking detailed and dynamic process understanding in fact some studies showed that these models require extensive stoichiometric and kinetic parameter changes dunlap et al 2016 menniti et al 2016 which reduces their predictive power and limits their practical use especially regarding the prediction of long term ebpr performance thereby combining ebpr metabolic models with the heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from asms may be seen as the most promising approach to achieve that goal since it provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to wrrfs the most referenced example of this combination is the asm2d tud model developed by the delft university of technology meijer 2004 which is the last published version of the integrated asm tud model this model combines the ordinary heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from asm2d henze et al 1999 with the metabolic model for denitrifying and non denitrifying ebpr developed by murnleitner et al 1997 there are several studies reporting that this model was successfully applied to domestic wastewater treatment plants with numerous configurations such as the university of cape town uct modified uct and three stage phoredox a2 o process with the adjustment of only a few default parameters van veldhuizen et al 1999 brdjanovic et al 2000 hao et al 2001 meijer et al 2001 although the asm2d tud model has demonstrated to indeed reduce the number of parameters requiring calibration it is one of the least used models in practice hauduc et al 2009 in addition to these models several experimental studies have improved in recent years the understanding of the mechanisms behind microbial population dynamics as a function of operational conditions in ebpr systems and suggested modifications to the currently available ebpr metabolic models examples of these developments include the description of the activity of various types of paos and their competitors e g gaos under i different operational conditions such as substrate temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b lopez vazquez et al 2009 ii different electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate and nitrite burow et al 2007 camejo et al 2019 2016 carvalho et al 2007 flowers et al 2009

al 2017 lopez et al 2006 lu et al 2007 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 the incorporation of these additional factors into a model will enable the prediction of ebpr behaviour over a wide range of operational and environmental conditions despite this available knowledge these modifications have never been previously integrated into an overall activated sludge model and implemented in a commercial simulator therefore the development of a valuable model both in research and engineering capable of covering ebpr dynamics in a predictive way is strongly needed this paper intends to present an integrated metabolic asm model referred to as meta asm hereafter for bnr activated sludge systems capable of modelling ebpr processes in depth with minimal parameter adjustments table 1 synthesises the main limitations of the most well known ebpr literature models reviewed by hauduc et al 2013 and the new developments included in meta asm this work aims to 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta asm model 2 calibrate and 3 validate this model with different data sets from experiments using enriched lab pao gao cultures as well as full scale sludge to provide a single set of default parameters in doing this we will achieve a comprehensive combined metabolic asm model that can be used as valuable tool in research and engineering applications of bnr systems 2 material and methods 2 1 model description and development the meta asm model was implemented in simba ifak germany and describes the simultaneous removal of cod n and p it is composed of 109 processes and 41 components 23 particulate 2 colloidal and 16 soluble which describe the activity of the following six microbial groups the ordinary heterotrophic organisms xoho the ammonia oxidizing organisms xaoo the nitrite oxidizing organisms xnoo accumulibacter paos xpao competibacter lineage gaos xcpo and defluviicoccus genus gaos xdfo the standard processes of meta asm are described in table 2 while the list of state variables and the observed interactions between microbial groups are shown in appendix a the meta asm model combines the heterotrophic hydrolytic and autotrophic processes from the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada a version based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 with a metabolic ebpr model based on the previous developments of lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b and updated to include modifications proposed by lanham et al 2014 both the barker dold model and metabolic models were identified previously in the review of hu et al 2003 as having potential for further development in addition to the uctpho model wentzel et al 1992 overall the meta asm model incorporates more processes than the literature models to describe the observed ebpr dynamics summarised in table 1 in this section the new model developments implemented in meta asm are described highlighting the mechanisms that were simplified or are neglected by current models 2 1 1 fermentation this process is modelled as a growth process similarly to the barker dold model but it is focused on the distribution of fermentation products acetate propionate and hydrogen see fig 1 this strategy correlates the cod loss mentioned by barker and dold 1997 with the hydrogen h2 gas formation and describes the production of two types of volatile fatty acids vfas due to the impact that these carbon sources have on the pao gao competition as detailed below note that the further description of h2 consumption by e g hydrogenotrophic methanogenic organisms was considered beyond the scope of this study 2 1 2 nitrification and denitrification ano and oho these processes are modelled as two step processes see fig 1 because wrrfs are increasingly interested in implementing new technologies such as shortcut nitrogen removal or control strategies that require the precise description of nitrate and nitrite furthermore the inclusion of the intermediate species is important to describe the observed interactions between autotrophic nitrifying organisms anos and heterotrophic organisms oho paos and gaos 2 1 3 endogenous processes in ohos and anos the decay of the oho aoo and noo is modelled according to the death regeneration concept with a component based model similarly to the barker dold model under anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions see fig 1 this concept was adopted in meta asm because it allows modelling the anaerobic decay unlike the endogenous respiration concept kinetically the decay rate coefficients are defined by considering only the contribution of the cell death rate while the effect of decreasing cellular activity was implemented through slowing down the growth rates of aoos noos and ohos according to the activity decay rates determined by hao et al 2009 under aerobic conditions the aerobic cell death rates of aoos noos and ohos were defined according to the same study instead the other models consider the total cell decay as the sum of the activity decay and cell death rates however this assumption overpredicts the conversion of dead cells to slowly biodegradable substrate xb and endogenous decay products xe which affects the other processes due to the potential increase of carbon bioavailability through hydrolysis and fermentation 2 1 4 origin of reducing power and energy for paos the influence of the reducing power i e nadh on the stoichiometry of the poly Œ≤ hydroxyalkanoates pha storage processes of paos was incorporated in meta asm the reducing power is provided via glycolysis or tca cycle pathways in the acetate uptake process according to lanham et al 2014 and via glycolysis or propionyl coa conversion to acetyl coa pathways in the propionate uptake process see fig 2 a the latter pathway is proposed in this study by considering that pao cells are able to generate nadh in the conversion of propionyl coa to acetyl coa since propionyl coa is not a direct intermediate of the tca cycle and its conversion to acetyl coa generates ample nadh for pha production these metabolic shifts are neglected in literature models and were incorporated in meta asm because each pathway provides different yields for the anaerobic pha formation and po4 release per vfa uptake for instance less pha is produced and more po4 is released when the tca cycle and propionyl coa conversion to acetyl coa pathways are active instead of glycolysis in fact the metabolic shifts between glycolysis and tca cycle were observed in lab zhou et al 2009 and full scale plants cokro et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 pijuan et al 2008 and are supported by recent metagenomics studies flowers et al 2013 mart√≠n et al 2006 skennerton et al 2015 of accumulibacter organisms lanham et al 2014 demonstrated through the application of metabolic models that lower vfa concentrations in the influent as well as longer aerobic retention times favour the dominance of the tca metabolism over glycolysis the energy source i e atp for the pha storage processes of paos was considered in meta asm to be mainly provided by hydrolysis of the intracellular polyphosphate however glycogen degradation was also considered to provide energy similarly to the asm2d tud model see fig 2 a the other models only consider the hydrolysis of the intracellular polyphosphate as source of energy 2 1 5 effect of the electron acceptor on pao yields this effect was considered in meta asm by defining distinct aerobic and anoxic yields as performed by oehmen et al 2010b the same distinction is also considered in the uctpho and asm2d tud models however it is important to clarify that the aerobic and anoxic metabolism of paos consist of the following reactions as described in murnleitner et al 1997 and smolders et al 1994a pha catabolism glycogen production biomass growth polyphosphate synthesis phosphate transport across the cell membrane and oxidative phosphorylation see fig 2 b from these reactions only the last two depend on the electron acceptor the others are independent and therefore identical for both conditions in terms of stoichiometry the amount of po4 transported per nadh2 oxidized Œµ and the amount of atp produced per nadh2 oxidized Œ¥ differ under aerobic anoxalic i e in the presence of nitrate and anoxilic conditions i e in the presence of nitrite smolders et al 1994a and kuba et al 1996 determined experimentally these parameters under aerobic and anoxic conditions respectively according to kuba et al 1996 the anoxic ax parameters Œ¥ax and Œµax are approximately 50 lower than aerobic 2 1 6 capability of paos to denitrify in addition to the effect of the electron acceptor in the anoxic yields of paos two subgroups of paos were considered in meta asm where one subgroup performs nitrate reduction hereafter dpao and both subgroups henceforth pao perform nitrite reduction these differences were modelled by multiplying a dpao fraction fdpao to all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate reduction processes of paos see fig 2 b this strategy is used to describe that some accumulibacter species are capable of performing denitrifying po4 removal with nitrate as suggested by recent studies camejo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 skennerton et al 2015 while all known accumulibacter clades are able to perform denitrification from nitrite onwards as suggested by previous research in this area camejo et al 2016 flowers et al 2013 mart√≠n et al 2006 despite the differences in the stoichiometries it is considered that both subgroups denitrify at the same maximum kinetic rate the other literature models do not take into account the different denitrification capabilities of paos instead they incorporate a reduction factor in the anoxic kinetic rate equations to lower the aerobic kinetic rates according to this factor 2 1 7 capability of gaos to denitrify two subgroups were defined in meta asm for competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos to distinguish between the differences observed in their denitrification as reported in literature burow et al 2007 kong et al 2006 wang et al 2008 some competibacter can denitrify from nitrate to n2 gas dcpo hereafter and others cannot denitrify cpo while some defluviicoccus can denitrify from nitrate to nitrite ddfo hereafter while others cannot denitrify at all dfo following the same reasoning as paos all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate and nitrite reduction processes of cpo were multiplied by the dcpo fraction fdcpo and all stoichiometric coefficients in the nitrate reduction processes of dfo were multiplied by the ddfo fraction fddfo see fig 2 b 2 1 8 endogenous processes in paos and gaos two concepts were used sequentially in meta asm to describe the endogenous processes for paos and gaos endogenous respiration cell maintenance referred to as maintenance hereafter and the death regeneration concept see fig 3 this is consistent with available experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014c hao et al 2010 liu et al 2017 lopez et al 2006 lu et al 2007 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 wang et al 2015 2012 about the effect of starvation conditions and low organic loading rates on pao and gao metabolism these studies have demonstrated that maintenance is the main endogenous process for paos and gaos and that the cell death only corresponds to a minor fraction of the total decay hao et al 2010 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 wang et al 2012 literature models do not consider the use of different storage polymers by paos and gaos as a survival strategy prior to cell decay for this reason more details surrounding the maintenance processes are provided below for each process condition energy source for anaerobic maintenance of paos and gaos in the meta asm model the anaerobic maintenance processes for paos were modelled according to lanham et al 2014 as polyphosphate hydrolysis smolders et al 1994b followed by glycogen degradation filipe et al 2001 zeng et al 2003a when low polyphosphate levels are attained this sequential dependence was observed in several experimental studies lopez et al 2006 stokholm bjerregaard 2016 it was considered that paos only decay when these storage polymers are exhausted see fig 3 in gaos glycogen is the only storage polymer source for the anaerobic maintenance carvalheira et al 2014c stokholm bjerregaard 2016 vargas et al 2013 and therefore this process was modelled according to filipe et al 2001 and zeng et al 2003a the anaerobic maintenance rates for paos and gaos were calculated by taking into account the energy requirements obtained experimentally by stokholm bjerregaard 2016 this study showed that gaos have higher atp requirements than paos under anaerobic conditions due to this reason paos have an advantage over gaos in periods of extended anaerobic starvation conditions commonly observed in return sludge sidestream rss hydrolysis fermentation processes energy source for aerobic anoxic maintenance of paos and gaos in the meta asm model the aerobic anoxalic and anoxilic maintenance processes for paos were modelled in order to include sequential dependence on pha glycogen and polyphosphate carvalheira et al 2014c lanham et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 the same dependence was considered in the aerobic anoxalic and anoxilic maintenance processes for gaos except that these organisms do not rely on polyphosphate carvalheira et al 2014c vargas et al 2013 it was considered that paos and gaos start to decay with a maximum kinetic rate after pha glycogen and polyphosphate pools are exhausted see fig 3 the aerobic and anoxic maintenance rates for paos and gaos were calculated by taking into account the energy requirements obtained experimentally by carvalheira et al 2014c and carvalho et al 2007 the analysis of these results showed that gaos also have higher atp requirements than paos under aerobic and anoxic conditions therefore paos also have an advantage over gaos in extended periods of aerobic and anoxic starvation conditions 2 1 9 effect of operational conditions on paos and gaos type of carbon source and substrate competition ph temperature and do the effect of type of carbon source and substrate competition ph and temperature were incorporated in the processes of paos and gaos as described in the models of lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b the effect of the do was incorporated by determining the oxygen half saturation coefficients of paos and gaos through the experimental results of carvalheira et al 2014a although some literature models incorporate the effect of the temperature on the kinetics of paos barker dold and asm2d tud and the effect of ph on the model stoichiometry asm2d tud none of these models consider the effect of different types of carbon sources and do in the stoichiometry and or kinetics of paos and gaos consequently these models fail to describe the competition commonly observed between paos and gaos for the carbon source and the substrate preferences of each organism carvalheira et al 2014b oehmen et al 2005b these models also fail to describe that paos have a higher affinity for oxygen which provide them a kinetic advantage over gaos at low do levels as studied by carvalheira et al 2014a through lab studies and observed by keene et al 2017 in their pilot and full scale experiments 2 2 model calibration and validation the meta asm model was calibrated and validated through the procedure shown in fig 4 to derive a reliable default parameter set capable of predicting ebpr behaviour over a wide range of selected operational and environmental conditions the procedure followed is briefly described in this section and is consistent with the definition of model validation as stated by the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 2 2 1 data sets selection and their relevance to describe ebpr dynamics a total of 34 data sets describing different ebpr dynamics were selected from bench scale batch tests inoculated with lab scale enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge from five wrrfs from portugal pt and denmark dk table 3 and table 4 synthesize the characteristics of these sludges respectively for further details about the setup of these batch tests readers are referred to the cited studies the experiments described in table 3 were selected because they describe the dynamics of changing the carbon source and the do on the competition between paos and gaos as well as the denitrification capability of paos the experiments in table 4 describe the ebpr activity of five wrrfs from portugal and denmark with different process configurations three conventional a2 o and two adapted biodenitro combined with a rss hydrolysis tank these tests describe the different denitrification capabilities of paos and gaos the role of storage polymers in anoxic and aerobic endogenous processes and the metabolic shifts in paos as function of storage polymer concentrations e g glycolysis pathway vs tca cycle in addition these data sets also assess the effect of temperature on the activity of paos and gaos since the full scale sludge was collected in winter and summer for the portuguese wrrfs and only in winter for the danish wrrfs 2 2 2 calibration process the criteria for the selection of parameters requiring calibration was based on expert knowledge on metabolic models and sensitivity analyses performed in previous studies focussed on metabolic modelling lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b as discussed in section 3 1 1 the default parameters of aoos noos and ohos were not calibrated in this study because the experiments described in section 2 2 1 were designed to i inhibit nitrification through the addition of allyl n thiourea atu and ii reduce the activity of ohos due to the existence of an anaerobic phase preceding the anoxic and aerobic phases which favours the uptake of vfas by paos and gaos and limits the availability of this carbon source to ohos in the subsequent phases the kinetic rates of paos and gaos were the only parameters calibrated in this study to describe individually each of the 34 data sets selected the method used for the calibration of each kinetic parameter was the minimum error search using nelder mead optimizer and least squares each phase anaerobic aerobic and anoxic was calibrated separately in order to avoid error propagation and for this reason the initial model concentrations correspond to the initial experimental values see definition of initial conditions in appendix b 1 except the concentrations of xpao xcpo xdfo xoho stored polyphosphates in paos xpao pp inorganic suspended solids xig particulate unbiodegradable organics xu and xb in the aerobic and anoxic phases that were defined according to the last value simulated in the anaerobic phase the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos were determined first by fitting the measured anaerobic po4 release due to the fact that gaos were present in some experiments and therefore they also contributed for the observable vfa uptake pha production and glycogen consumption when paos are only present in the sludge any of these anaerobic conversions could also be used for the calibration of the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos because they are described by the same stoichiometric reaction in meta asm however it is recommendable to use the most reliable measurements po4 or vfas for the calibration of this parameter furthermore it should be noted that the anaerobic kinetic rates of paos were the only parameters calibrated in the anaerobic phase because those of cpo and dfo were indirectly determined through the correlations defined in equations b12 b17 see appendix b 1 these correlations assume the different substrate preferences obtained experimentally by carvalheira et al 2014b and lopez vazquez et al 2009 with enriched pao and gao cultures the aerobic and anoxic kinetic rates of each organism were determined in subsequent simulations by fitting the respective measured pha consumption glycogen production and po4 removal only in paos the effect of the do on the pao and gao competition was determined by calibrating the maximum aerobic kinetic rates and oxygen half saturation coefficients of these organisms with the data sets of carvalheira et al 2014a as the authors studied the effect of different do concentrations in enriched pao and cpo cultures due to the contrasting findings about the capability of paos to use nitrate kim et al 2013 rubio rinc√≥n et al 2017 saad et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the parameter fdpao was firstly defined as zero assuming that few full scale accumulibacter species are able to reduce nitrate and then defined according to the active dpao fraction estimated by the analytical method described in lanham et al 2018 see table 4 these two parallel calibrations were performed to confirm whether paos are able or not to reduce nitrate note that lanham et al 2018 did not find any correlation between the parameter fdpao estimated through chemical batch tests and the microbial composition determined by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation qfish especially when compared with accumulibacter type i and type ii competibacter lineage and defluviicoccus genus this study suggested instead that chemical batch tests are the best methodology for quantifying the potential of anoxic p removal in full scale wrrfs the fraction of defluviicoccus genus fddfo able to reduce nitrate and the fraction of competibacter fdcpo able to denitrify were assumed with a default value of 0 5 as discussed later for the same reasons the parameter fddfo was not defined according to the fraction of defluviicoccus vanus cluster i determined by qfish 2 2 3 validation process a single set of calibrated parameters was defined with the median values determined through the total of calibrated parameter sets obtained during the calibration process in addition the parameter fdpao was fixed with the median fraction of 0 69 determined analytically through the offline batch tests and fddfo and fdcpo were fixed with the assumed fraction of 0 5 sensitivity analysis was performed on these fractions by changing the fixed values 30 in order to evaluate the impact of these fractions on the model predictions see appendix c full cycle simulations were performed on the same data sets to validate if the selected single set of calibrated parameters can be used as a default parameter set in these simulations the anoxic and aerobic phases were initiated with the final anaerobic concentrations predicted as opposed to initiating these phases with the experimentally determined value this procedure was followed to assess the impact of error propagation between phases when a single set of default parameters is used the prediction quality of the model was assessed by plotting the predicted versus measured anaerobic po4 3 p release aerobic and anoxic po4 3 p uptake anaerobic pha production aerobic and anoxic pha consumption anaerobic glycogen consumption aerobic and anoxic glycogen production anaerobic vfas consumption and anoxic no3 n removal the goodness of fit of the model versus measured data to an ideal match y x was assessed by the adjusted r2 adj r2 parameter 2 2 4 performance comparison between models the predictive power of meta asm barker dold and asm2d was evaluated by performing full cycle simulations to the data sets of the wrrfs pt1 winter 1 dk2 winter 2 and pt2 winter 1 the default parameter set validated in this study was used in the meta asm while the parameters defined in matrices reviewed by hauduc et al 2010 were used in the barker dold and asm2d models the initial conditions in the anaerobic phase were defined as described in appendix b 1 except that in these models the concentrations of cpo and dfo were added to the concentration of oho xoho and the total concentration of pha measured was defined in the pha stored by pao xpao stor 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the procedure followed for the calibration and validation of the meta asm was based on the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 this book defines a model parameter as default when it refers to a consensus value that can be used as a starting point in a calibration process and a model parameter set as default when it has been validated on different wastewater treatment plants and has a clear explanation of how each proposed value was obtained therefore this paper discusses in detail 1 how the calibrated parameter sets were obtained in meta asm and 2 how a single set of calibrated parameters can be derived and validated as a default parameter set 3 1 1 calibration of model parameters the pao gao metabolic models only require the calibration of kinetic parameters through well designed experiments due to the fact that most of the yield coefficients are calculated theoretically through substrate energy and reducing power balances on well established biochemical pathways for the processes involved in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic pao and gao metabolism oehmen et al 2005c smolders et al 1994a 1994b zeng et al 2003a however the obtained yields depend on a few metabolic ratios such as the amount of atp produced per nadh2 oxidized Œ¥ amount of phosphate po4 transported per nadh2 oxidized Œµ and atp necessary for biomass synthesis k1 and k2 that were experimentally determined by previous studies with enriched pao and or gao cultures smolders et al 1994a zeng et al 2003a the impact of changing some of these metabolic ratios e g Œ¥ and k1 and k2 was shown to have a marginal effect on the model predictions and overall stoichiometry as demonstrated by lopez vazquez et al 2009 and zeng et al 2003a respectively based on these results the authors recommended not to change the original values of these parameters in fact several experimental studies carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b carvalho et al 2007 lanham et al 2013 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005b 2005a pijuan et al 2008 2004 zeng et al 2003b conducted at different environmental and operational conditions including the data sets selected in this study have reported that the measured yield coefficients are very well described by the theoretical stoichiometric yields of previous pao gao metabolic models lanham et al 2014 lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010b the data sets selected in tables 3 and 4 describe a variety of process dynamics and changes of operational conditions due to this reason the maximum kinetic rates for paos and gaos were calibrated for each data set to describe individually each process dynamic this procedure allowed a better understanding of the variations of each set of calibrated parameters and evaluate if with the model structure proposed it would be possible to derive a reliable and robust default parameter set capable of predicting these ebpr dynamics within an acceptable level of confidence table 5 shows the mean median and standard deviation values obtained for each kinetic rate calibrated note that the number of data sets depicted in table 5 used to calibrate each kinetic rate is less than 34 due to the fact that the experimental studies with the enriched cultures were not designed for all environmental conditions and in some full scale sludge tests some parameters were not available the capability of paos to reduce nitrate was also assessed during the calibration of the maximum kinetic rates through the fdpao stoichiometric parameter when this parameter is defined as zero the processes of nitrate reduction by paos are deactivated which means that paos are only able to perform anoxic p uptake using nitrite as electron acceptor some literature studies suggested that paos are not able to reduce nitrate and that the observed anoxic p uptake results from the utilization of nitrite produced by side populations such as denitrifying gaos dgaos or denitrifying ohos dohos kim et al 2013 rubio rinc√≥n et al 2017 saad et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 in this study this theory was tested with the available data sets from lanham et al 2018 table 5 shows that the model in this scenario only fitted the experimental results when the maximum anoxic kinetic rates of paos were increased to unrealistic values that are much higher than those calibrated under aerobic conditions this happens because gaos were not detected for instance in the tests performed with sludge from wrrfs pt1 dk1 and dk2 and the activity of dohos was inhibited as no external carbon source was added in the anoxic phase thus the production of nitrite by side populations is not supported from this data although other pha storing denitrifiers could also have been involved in the reduction of nitrate as suggested in section 3 1 2 this would not be enough to explain all the observed nitrate removal therefore these results from meta asm suggest that there are accumulibacter species in wrrfs able to use nitrate and perform po4 uptake as confirmed recently by camejo et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and skennerton et al 2015 in addition to the kinetic rates the oxygen half saturation coefficients of paos ko2 pao 0 2 and gaos ko2 gao 0 5 were calibrated through the experimental results of carvalheira et al 2014a the obtained parameters indicate that paos have a higher affinity for oxygen which provide them a kinetic advantage over gaos at low do levels as discussed in detail in carvalheira et al 2014a fig 5 shows the meta asm model describing successfully different case studies using the calibrated parameter sets however it was still necessary to determine a single set of parameters and validate if it can be used as a default parameter set for future model applications 3 1 2 validation of the default parameter set full cycle simulations of the 34 data sets were performed using a single set of calibrated parameters defined with the median values determined during the calibration process see table 5 as well as the fixed fractions for the parameters fdcpo and fddfo despite the variations obtained in the calibration of the kinetic parameters figs 6 10 show that overall the single set of default parameters selected are reliable and robust as demonstrated by the good correlations obtained when the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets of enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge were plotted these results suggest that the model structure proposed in this study is appropriated for all systems studied the typical enriched pao gao and dpao profiles were very well described for all parameters even when different ratios of propionate to acetate and do concentrations were tested 0 844 adj r2 0 975 this was only possible because the model incorporates the key biochemical pathways for the uptake of propionate and acetate on the overall anaerobic stoichiometric reactions of paos and gaos as described in lopez vazquez et al 2009 and oehmen et al 2010b as well as the different oxygen affinities of these organisms calibrated in this study furthermore the model predicted very well the po4 3 p profiles in the tests with different full scale sludge 0 742 adj r2 0 872 fig 6 b d f which strongly supports the capability of meta asm to describe different ebpr configurations a2 o and side stream ebpr systems the goodness of fit of the predicted versus measured pha to an ideal match in the tests with full scale sludge needs to be interpreted individually this parameter is reasonably described under anaerobic adj r2 0 759 fig 7 b and aerobic adj r2 0 601 fig 7 d conditions and less well described under anoxic adj r2 0 409 fig 7 f conditions fig 7 b clearly shows that the anaerobic pha production was slightly underpredicted at the end of the anaerobic phase especially in the data sets pt2 summer 2 and pt2 winter 1 these deviations may indicate the presence of other organisms in the sludge that were also able to store and consume pha in the subsequent phases the predictions of the aerobic and anoxic pha consumption were consequently affected by this anaerobic pha underestimation whose impact on adj r2 is most notable under anoxic conditions because less pha is consumed the slight underestimation observed in the prediction of no3 n removal adj r2 0 560 can also be explained by the impact that other pha storing denitrifiers could have had on the anoxic test see fig 10 b fig 9 b shows that the anaerobic vfa consumption was overall well described adj r2 0 929 glycogen is typically the most difficult parameter to be modelled accurately as has been previously pointed out in the literature lopez vazquez et al 2009 meijer et al 2002 murnleitner et al 1997 even so the predictions obtained in the tests with enriched pao gao cultures were very reasonable see fig 8 a c and e as were the anaerobic and aerobic experiments with full scale sludge in this study see fig 8 b and d furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed in this work for the fdpao fdcpo and fddfo parameters that were defined for the first time in the present study the effect of changing each parameter by 30 was assessed see appendix c and the results show that this variation had a residual impact on the model predictions it should also be pointed out that oehmen et al 2010b had previously performed a sensitivity analysis to the maximum kinetic rates that were calibrated in this study and observed that an increase or decrease of 10 of these parameters led only to a small increase 3 in the deviation between the experimental measurements and predictions thus small changes to the parameters calibrated in this study are unlikely to contribute substantial deviations to the model predictions 3 1 3 performance comparison between models the predictive power of the meta asm barker dold and asm2d was evaluated by performing full cycle simulations to the data sets of the wrrfs pt1 winter 1 pt2 winter 1 and dk2 winter 2 fig 11 a d g show that the meta asm model is able to describe all variables using the same default parameter set in the three case studies evaluated while the other two models do not the barker dold and asm2d models were able to describe the anaerobic po4 release and the aerobic po4 uptake except in the case study pt1 winter 1 the observed deviations are possibly explained by the fact that in this wrrf the glycogen pools in the cells were exhausted and paos used the tca cycle as alternative source of reducing power instead of glycolysis as explained in lanham et al 2013 this shift is responsible for the increase of the yield of po4 release per vfa utilized and this effect is well described in the meta asm model both models were not able to describe the anaerobic vfa consumption fig 11 b c e f h and i the main reason for this deviation is due to the predicted high anaerobic decay of ordinary heterotrophic organisms which increased the concentration of slowly biodegradable substrate affecting sequentially the anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation processes even so the anaerobic vfa consumption was better described in the barker dold model than in the asm2d model because the former describes the fermentation as an anaerobic growth process instead of a transformation process as described in the latter to overcome this deviation and calibrate the anaerobic vfa consumption it would be expected to change first the decay rate of oho in both models or define different decay processes as a function of the environmental conditions if these modifications are not enough to explain the measured anaerobic vfa consumption it would be required to change the kinetic rate for vfa uptake by paos in both models however this modification would cause an overprediction of the anaerobic release of po4 and pha production as a consequence the stoichiometric parameters of this process would have to be modified in order to describe the subsequent phases on the other hand both models fail to describe the simultaneous anoxic po4 and nitrate removal the previous observed deviation in the anaerobic vfa consumption is partly responsible for this failure due to the fact that the presence of vfas under anoxic conditions promotes the competition between ohos and paos for the electron acceptor which increases the removal of nitrate in addition to this correction it would be required to modify the reduction factor for anoxic growth in both models to fit the measured nitrate as illustrated in fig 11 h wherein the anaerobic vfa consumption was reasonably described by the barker dold model as a consequence of this modification the anoxic yields of paos would also have to be changed in the barker dold model and defined in the asm2d model because the initial trend of the anoxic po4 uptake seems to be well explained in both models by the current reduction factor overall the results of fig 11 support that current literature models are lacking detailed and dynamic process understanding and require extensive parameters changes as demonstrated by the application of the barker dold and asm2d models on the other hand modelling ebpr processes in depth reduces calibration efforts as demonstrated by the application of the meta asm model the effect of operational conditions on the competition between paos and gaos the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process are suggestions of modifications that should be incorporated in the literature models to increase their predictive power 3 2 challenges and limitations of the proposed approach the authors have reviewed critically the limitations of previous literature models and gathered information from targeted experiments and available literature to develop a model capable of providing an in depth understanding of ebpr systems operated at medium to long sludge retention times srts 5 43 days the available experiments published over the last 20 years focus mainly on the most well studied pao genus accumulibacter and gao competibacter lineage and the defluviicoccus genus organisms in lab and full scale systems hereafter referred to as classical pao and gao organisms however researchers have made efforts to improve the understanding of the ecophysiology of new putative pao and gao organisms such as the genera tetrasphaera and accumulimonas paos kong et al 2005 nguyen et al 2011 and micropruina gao mcilroy et al 2018 shintani et al 2000 in recent years they have been found in significant abundance in wrrfs sometimes outnumbering the classical pao and gao organisms lanham et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wu et al 2019 despite the abundance of tetrasphaera in some systems the quantification of its contribution to store intracellular p remains unclear and warrants further research it should be noted that the genera tetrasphaera and micropruina do not exhibit the typical phenotypes of pao and gao described in the meta asm model their metabolism does not rely on pha and they appear to be less competitive for vfa uptake kong et al 2008 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 instead they can grow anaerobically by fermenting amino acids or sugars and aerobically through the oxidation of glycogen micropruina spp or intracellular metabolites such as amino acids sugars and possibly fermentation products tetrasphaera spp nielsen et al 2019 due to these reasons their impact on vfa driven ebpr which is the focus of meta asm is likely to be low moreover the profile of po4 is still unclear in tetrasphaera paos an enriched lab scale study showed that these organisms are able to uptake po4 anaerobically through energy generated by fermentation of some carbon sources marques et al 2017 whereas other studies showed that they release po4 anaerobically and uptake po4 aerobically and anoxically kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 due to the need for further research the authors decided not to include these organisms in this version of the meta asm model furthermore the validation of the meta asm with the data sets presented in this study suggested that other organisms are capable of storing pha anaerobically or aerobically and could compete with pao and gao for the carbon source and contribute to denitrification if needed future work in this area could incorporate pha storage by ordinary heterotrophs into the model as performed in asm3 gujer et al 1999 on the other hand the meta asm model structure enables the incorporation of similar paos to accumulibacter e g accumulimonas to be considered as part of the same group of pao organisms which would not necessitate any structural change to the model itself in recent years some studies have focused on high rate ebpr systems operated with srts lower than 4 days where the microbial ecology and ecophysiology was observed to be different than the traditional ebpr systems ge et al 2015 valverde p√©rez et al 2016 to describe these systems the development of new mathematical models or adaptation of existing models is still required 3 3 implications for ebpr full scale systems control and optimisation tool the meta asm model summarises quantitatively the current state of knowledge of ebpr systems it has the capability of predicting ebpr performance as a function of the pao gao competition various environmental temperatures and phs different do concentrations different cod p ratios in the influent and periods of low organic loading or starvation conditions commonly observed in wrrfs without the need for extensive parameter adjustments these capabilities make the meta asm model a powerful tool for a better understanding design and control of bnr systems potential applications include side stream processes return activated sludge ras fermentation and shortcut nitrogen removal coupled with ebpr and denitrifying and low do operated ebpr systems in addition to conventional ebpr processes the description of the known conditions that affect the pao gao competition allow to estimate vfas requirements for different configurations and choose the best operating modes or process configurations the description of metabolic shifts as function of storage polymers concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes allow to select optimal srt and hydraulic retention time hrt conditions in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones this is particularly relevant for sidestream ras fermentation systems because the model captures dynamically gaos exhausting their storage polymers and decay much faster than paos in periods of extended anaerobic starvation conditions these features make the model suitable to estimate the fraction of ras diversion to fermentation as well as the optimal hrt and srt for fermentation the description of different pao and gao denitrification capabilities as well as the growth advantages of paos over gao under low do conditions 0 1 0 6 mg o2 l 1 allow the optimisation of ebpr systems with low energy and carbon consumption the next steps for further validation of the model are to 1 perform long term dynamic ebpr simulations and provide guidelines for future users of the model and 2 demonstrate the above features by applying the model in various engineering applications 4 conclusions this study produced a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model the meta asm model that provides an overall platform to describe the activity of the key organisms and processes relevant to bnr systems with a robust single set of default parameters the advances described here overcome many of the limitations in terms of limited predictive power and extensive parameter changes required in currently available ebpr models examples of these improvements are the effect of operational conditions in the competition between paos and gaos the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process the meta asm model was tested against 34 different data sets obtained from bench scale batch tests inoculated with lab scale enriched pao gao cultures and full scale sludge from five wrrfs with two different process configurations a2 o and adapted biodenitro combined with a return sludge sidestream hydrolysis tank the overall good correlations obtained when the predicted versus measured ebpr profiles from different data sets were compared support that this new model which is based on in depth understanding of ebpr reduces calibration efforts the theory that paos are able to use nitrate and perform anoxic p uptake was tested by activating or deactivating these processes during model calibration the anoxic kinetic rates of paos obtained when these processes were activated suggest that there are accumulibacter clades in wrrfs able to use nitrate and perform p uptake the meta asm model has the capability of predicting ebpr performance as a function of the pao gao competition various environmental temperatures and phs different do concentrations different cod p ratios in the influent and periods of low organic loading or starvation conditions commonly observed in wrrfs this study suggests that the meta asm model is a powerful tool to predict and mitigate ebpr upsets as well as to optimise ebpr performance 5

relative enrichment factor ref defined by escher and leusch 2011 as the concentration factor during sample extraction and the dilution factor for each step in the bioassay 4 ref enrichment factor dilution factor based on if and ref values samples were considered genotoxic when 1 a dose response relationship for at least two consecutive dose levels was observed or 2 the highest non cytotoxic dose level showed an if greater than 2 quillardet et al 1982 for cells that exhibited 70 or greater viability krasner et al 2016 samples were considered different than the control but not positive if they had if values that ranged from 1 5 to 2 cachot et al 2006 comparison of samples at the highest concentration factor with cell viability of 70 in this study the if at ref 80 was performed to qualitatively contrast the maximum genotoxic potential of samples this enrichment value is substantially higher than ref values which have been reported to elicit genotoxic effects in other studies for example escher et al 2014 observed positive genotoxic responses for both drinking and recycled water at ref values of 55 since the pure and blended samples in this study were not genotoxic at ref 80 we may infer that the genotoxic potency of these ontario surface waters is low and requires a relatively high percent of wastewater 25 by volume to elicit dna damage or activate repair mechanisms the predicted genotoxicity of thms hans and hnms was determined by dividing the measured concentration of each dbp by its published genotoxicity potency data based on the cho cell comet assay wagner and plewa 2017 thus yielding a unitless value potency is defined as the effect concentration ec50 required to induce a toxic response in 50 of cells krasner et al 2016 total predicted genotoxicity x dbp was calculated by summing the values for each class of dbps where a predicted genotoxicity value of 1 signifies that a sample contains enough dbps to elicit an ec50 the method detection limit mdl

relationship between water quality parameters and genotoxicity a two tailed paired sample t test was used to compare chlorinated mixtures against their non chlorinated counterparts within each data set at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 a two tailed two sample t test assuming equal variance was used to compare different waters e g differences between surface water or wastewaters and was also assessed at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 genotoxic characterization of surface and wastewater effluents 3 1 1 comparison of wastewaters effluent samples obtained from three different wwtps located on lake ontario ww ontario lake simcoe ww simcoe and lake erie ww erie were assayed for their genotoxic response using the sos chromotest fig 2 based on the dose response curves if vs ref ww erie had significantly higher genotoxicity Œ± 0 05 when compared to either ww ontario or ww simcoe the lowered response for ww simcoe may be attributed to the additional treatment processes at that location which included a rotating biological contactor followed by flocculation and tertiary sand filtration fig 1 rotating biological contactors are typically employed by wastewater treatment facilities to provide additional removal of organic compounds and nutrients hiras 2004 the if at the 80 fold enrichment factor ifref80 was used to qualitatively compare wastewater effluents where an if value of 2 indicates a genotoxic response the wastewater with the lowest response ww simcoe was deemed to be different from the control but not genotoxic ifref80 1 86 ww ontario and ww erie were both genotoxic with ifref80 values of 2 07 and 2 51 respectively in the present study both lake simcoe and lake erie wwtps included uv disinfection however the genotoxicity response differed significantly p 0 05 therefore no conclusions regarding the impact of uv on genotoxicity can be determined fig 2 wwtps at lake ontario and simcoe have similar treatment processes but differ in terms of the final disinfection step wwtp ontario applies hypochlorous acid whereas wwtp erie applies uv incorporation of uv may be associated with elevated genotoxicity when compared to the chlorine based disinfection wwtp erie ifref80 2 51 vs wwtp ontraioifref80 2 07 also the wwtp ontario applies ferric chloride prior to the aerated grit tank which provides additional organic carbon removal and may contribute to the lowered genotoxic response in the present study incorporation of tertiary organic removal process appeared to have more impact on if than the type of disinfectant used as such no definitive correlation between uv disinfection of wastewater effluent and genotoxicity could be established 3 1 2 comparison of surface waters untreated surface waters did not elicit a genotoxic response at even the highest tested ref of 160 as such all surface waters were non reactive in the sos assay fig 2 upon chlorination c elevated genotoxicity was observed however as the if values did not exceed 1 5 all source waters were considered non genotoxic fig 3 white bars supporting the results of guzzella et al 2004 and wang et al 2011 who using the sos chromotest and umu sos bioassay respectively reported higher responses of surface waters following chlorination interestingly in a study by neale et al 2012 it was found that disinfected treated surface water when assayed by the umu sos tested elicited a genotoxic response if 2 0 at ref of 32 17 and indicates that the surface water tested by these authors was similar in reactivity to the untreated impacted chlorinated waters in this study surface water responses for both chlorinated c and non chlorinated samples nc were compared at ifref80 and found to be statistically different p 0 05 when considering water quality characteristics suva r 0 70 correlated well with genotoxicity while doc and uv254 did not r 0 01 and 0 46 respectively untreated lake ontario with the lowest doc 2 0 mg l showed elevated reactivity upon subsequent chlorination ifref80 1 39 while lake simcoe had the highest doc 4 27 mg l and upon chlorination remained non responsive ifref80 1 09 a similar inverse relationship between genotoxicity and thms formation was observed whereby chlorinated lake simcoe water was observed to form 50 3 Œºg l of thms vs 25 1 Œºg l of lake ontario water 0 fig 4 it is recognized that thms are not the drivers of toxicity which explains the discordance between thms and genotoxicity cortruvo and amato 2019 3 2 comparison of wastewater surface water mixtures given that the wastewaters when taken alone showed positive responses in the sos assay a stepwise increase in reactivity was anticipated for the wastewater surface water blends while the ifref80 increased for lake ontario and lake erie fig 3 when no chlorine was present lake simcoe showed little impact to an increase in wastewater at all percentage levels again likely a result of the tertiary organic removal processes at this wwtp this indicates that lake simcoe surface water can tolerate relatively high wastewater impacts in terms of genotoxicity fig 3a however overall thm concentrations reached levels of regulatory concern fig 4 unchlorinated ww lake erie had the highest genotoxicity ifref80 2 51 fig 2 as such this drinking water source may be more susceptible to genotoxic impacts at high ratios 25 however the data indicates low genotoxic ramifications at 5 and 10 of wastewater surface water mixtures for lake erie wtp intakes fig 3b following chlorination the genotoxic response increased for all of the tested ratios however even at 25 wastewater only modest genotoxicity was observed ifref80 1 52 the highest sos responses were observed for lake ontario fig 3c however incremental increases in ww lake ontario volume did not exhibit a toxicological impact at either 5 or 10 the ontario mixture was found to be somewhat reactive at 25 ifref80 1 8 of note the unchlorinated lake ontario mixtures were not significantly different p 0 05 than their chlorinated counterpart given that chlorination did not increase the response of wastewater blends antagonistic effects between surface water and wastewater are suspected for the initial decrease in genotoxicity for chlorinated lake ontario and lake simcoe mixtures this decrease in reactivity could reflect the oxidation of micropollutants in the effluents a decrease in mutagenicity was also reported by nakamuro et al 1989 where chlorination was observed to decrease the ames test response of a surface water comprised of 20 wastewater overall the mixture results indicate that genotoxicity was more likely to be observed for 25 wastewater surface blends if 1 5 while smaller ratios of 5 and 10 generally had responses similar to those of chlorinated surface waters if 1 5 it should be noted once more that these results were qualified at ref 80 which was selected to compare responses escher et al 2014 observed positive genotoxic responses for both drinking and recycled water at ref values of 55 because no mixtures were genotoxic if 2 0 at ref 80 this indicates that the blended surface waters tested in this study even at a high percent volume of wastewater 25 did not exhibit strong genotoxicity upon chlorination and did not form dbps with strong potencies doc r 0 90 and uv254 r 0 90 showed strong correlations with genotoxicity for all chlorinated mixtures tables s3 and s5 however for lake simcoe mixtures wastewater is subjected to advanced organic removal processes the correlations with doc r 0 80 and uv254 r 0 80 are weaker table s4 possibly owing to differences in micropollutant or nitrogen levels table 1 suva correlated well r 0 90 with genotoxicity for the lake erie mixtures and r 0 70 for the lake simcoe mixtures and negatively for the lake ontario mixtures another unexpected finding was the lack of correlation between dbp concentration and genotoxicity lake simcoe mixtures were observed to have the highest dbp concentrations upon chlorination fig 4 but were associated with low sos responses fig 3a in contrast the lake ontario samples had the lowest doc and dbp concentrations while exerting the highest genotoxicity response this underscores the importance of measuring the genotoxicity with bioassays rather than relying on water quality parameters such as doc suva or dbp concentrations 3 3 comparison of predicted and measured sos chromotest genotoxicity predicted genotoxicity is based on the sum of relative toxicities for the measured dbps and calculated using published genotoxicity potency data from the mammalian cho comet assay wagner and plewa 2017 table s1 a value of 1 indicates that the summed relative potencies for the measured dbps total dbps fig 5 were sufficient to elicit an ec50 genotoxic response in cho cells ie 50 effect concentration individual potencies varied widely both between dbp classes and within dbp species for example the potency of bdcnm 6 32 10 5 m is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than that of tcan 1 01 x 10 3 m while thms tcm bdcm cdbm tbm were not significantly different from the negative control table s1 hans represented the primary driver of overall predicted genotoxicity and increased with greater ratios of wastewater fig 5 although hans and hnms are more genotoxic than most regulated carbon based dbps the predicted genotoxicity never exceeded 10 4 for ratios from 0 to 25 v v therefore the measured dbps represent a very low score in terms of calculated toxicity since a value of 1 indicates a toxic effect ec50 thms did not contribute to the predicted genotoxicity although by mass this class of dbps represented 72 94 of the overall halogenated compounds examined fig 4 however the correlation between thm concentrations and predicted genotoxicity were strong r 0 9 similarly the sos genotoxicity was strongly correlated with both predicted genotoxicity r 0 80 0 90 and thm concentrations r 0 80 0 90 tables s3 s5 as such thms serve as useful surrogates for the formation of unknown halogenated dbps that contribute to sos genotoxicity all of the tested wastewater effluents had very low dbp concentrations 0 5 Œºg l and therefore low predicted genotoxicity 1 6 10 6 suggesting that unknown compounds are likely the drivers of observed reactivity in the sos assay a strong linear relationship r2 0 90 was observed between the measured sos response of the chlorinated mixtures and the predicted genotoxicity for example n nitroso compounds and pahs are not considered to be dbps yet are potent genotoxins that are known to be present in municipal wastewaters white and rasmussen 1998 compared to the calculated toxicity model the sos chromotest measured whole mixture effects and provided an estimate of each wastewater s overall reactivity in cells 4 conclusions this study evaluated the genotoxicity of wastewaters and surface waters both alone and as chlorinated and unchlorinated mixtures wastewaters were typically genotoxic the extent of which is partially dictated by the treatment they are subjected to prior to discharge genotoxicity can potentially be reduced by the presence of additional organic removal steps in contrast neither unchlorinated nor chlorinated surface waters were observed to be genotoxic this study provided a framework for the amount of wastewater impact their receiving waters can tolerate before we see impacts on the genotoxicity when exposed to drinking water disinfection specifically wastewater impacts of 25 increased the genotoxicity of surface waters pre and post chlorination however low wastewater ratios v v of 5 and 10 were similar to those of unimpacted surface waters although 25 v v ratios were more likely to show higher genotoxic effect they still did not meet the criteria for being classed as genotoxic of particular interest the toxicity for the blends was not additive and highlights the importance of toxicity testing rather than extrapolations of toxicity to provide further insight thm concentrations were correlated to the predicted genotoxicity values based on the cho comet assay and sos genotoxicity although the predicted genotoxicity of thms themselves was zero thm concentrations correlated well with predicted genotoxicity and sos genotoxicity for the chlorinated mixtures suggesting that thms serve as surrogates for both known and unknown dbps that drive genotoxicity when considering chlorinated surface waters bioassays such as the sos chromotest are powerful tools that may be used to assess whole mixture effects and should

toxicity index for each sample based on published potencies in the comet assay and subsequently referred to as predicted genotoxicity wastewater effluents were observed to be reactive in the genotoxicity assay whereas raw and chlorinated surface waters were not upon chlorination surface waters containing 5 or 10 wastewater did not elicit a response and only modest effects were observed for higher wastewater ratios 25 the measured sos responses correlated well with predicted genotoxicity r 0 92 and thm concentrations r 0 92 this is important since thms themselves are non reactive in

relative enrichment factor ref defined by escher and leusch 2011 as the concentration factor during sample extraction and the dilution factor for each step in the bioassay 4 ref enrichment factor dilution factor based on if and ref values samples were considered genotoxic when 1 a dose response relationship for at least two consecutive dose levels was observed or 2 the highest non cytotoxic dose level showed an if greater than 2 quillardet et al 1982 for cells that exhibited 70 or greater viability krasner et al 2016 samples were considered different than the control but not positive if they had if values that ranged from 1 5 to 2 cachot et al 2006 comparison of samples at the highest concentration factor with cell viability of 70 in this study the if at ref 80 was performed to qualitatively contrast the maximum genotoxic potential of samples this enrichment value is substantially higher than ref values which have been reported to elicit genotoxic effects in other studies for example escher et al 2014 observed positive genotoxic responses for both drinking and recycled water at ref values of 55 since the pure and blended samples in this study were not genotoxic at ref 80 we may infer that the genotoxic potency of these ontario surface waters is low and requires a relatively high percent of wastewater 25 by volume to elicit dna damage or activate repair mechanisms the predicted genotoxicity of thms hans and hnms was determined by dividing the measured concentration of each dbp by its published genotoxicity potency data based on the cho cell comet assay wagner and plewa 2017 thus yielding a unitless value potency is defined as the effect concentration ec50 required to induce a toxic response in 50 of cells krasner et al 2016 total predicted genotoxicity x dbp was calculated by summing the values for each class of dbps where a predicted genotoxicity value of 1 signifies that a sample contains enough dbps to elicit an ec50 the method detection limit mdl for all measured dbps was 1 Œºg l a list of the measured dbps and their potencies is provided in table s1 pearson correlation analyses were performed using the slopes in fig s1 to determine the relationship between water quality parameters and genotoxicity a two tailed paired sample t test was used to compare chlorinated mixtures against their non chlorinated counterparts within each data set at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 a two tailed two sample t test assuming equal variance was used to compare different waters e g differences between surface water or wastewaters and was also assessed at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 genotoxic characterization of surface and wastewater effluents 3 1 1 comparison of wastewaters effluent samples obtained from three different wwtps located on lake ontario ww ontario lake simcoe ww simcoe and lake erie ww erie were assayed for their genotoxic response using the sos chromotest fig 2 based on the dose response curves if vs ref ww erie had significantly higher genotoxicity Œ± 0 05 when compared to either ww ontario or ww simcoe the lowered response for ww simcoe may be attributed to the additional treatment processes at that location which included a rotating biological contactor followed by flocculation and tertiary sand filtration fig 1 rotating biological contactors are typically employed by wastewater treatment facilities to provide additional removal of organic compounds and nutrients hiras 2004 the if at the 80 fold enrichment factor ifref80 was used to qualitatively compare wastewater effluents where an if value of 2 indicates a genotoxic response the wastewater with the lowest response ww simcoe was deemed to be different from the control but not genotoxic ifref80 1 86 ww ontario and ww erie were both genotoxic with ifref80 values of 2 07 and 2 51 respectively in the present study both lake simcoe and lake erie wwtps included uv disinfection however the genotoxicity response differed significantly p 0 05 therefore no conclusions regarding the impact of uv on genotoxicity can be determined fig 2 wwtps at lake ontario and simcoe have similar treatment processes but differ in terms of the final disinfection step wwtp ontario applies hypochlorous acid whereas wwtp erie applies uv incorporation of uv may be associated with elevated genotoxicity when compared to the chlorine based disinfection wwtp erie ifref80 2 51 vs wwtp ontraioifref80 2 07 also the wwtp ontario applies ferric chloride prior to the aerated grit tank which provides additional organic carbon removal and may contribute to the lowered genotoxic response in the present study incorporation of tertiary organic removal process appeared to have more impact on if than the type of disinfectant used as such no definitive correlation between uv disinfection of wastewater effluent and genotoxicity could be established 3 1 2 comparison of surface waters untreated surface waters did not elicit a genotoxic response at even the highest tested ref of 160 as such all surface waters were non reactive in the sos assay fig 2 upon chlorination c elevated genotoxicity was observed however as the if values did not exceed 1 5 all source waters were considered non genotoxic fig 3 white bars supporting the results of guzzella et al 2004 and wang et al 2011 who using the sos chromotest and umu sos bioassay respectively reported higher responses of surface waters following chlorination interestingly in a study by neale et al 2012 it was found that disinfected treated surface water when assayed by the umu sos tested elicited a genotoxic response if 2 0 at ref of 32 17 and indicates that the surface water tested by these authors was similar in reactivity to the untreated impacted chlorinated waters in this study surface water responses for both chlorinated c and non chlorinated samples nc were compared at ifref80 and found to be statistically different p 0 05 when considering water quality characteristics suva r 0 70 correlated well with genotoxicity while doc and uv254 did not r 0 01 and 0 46 respectively untreated lake ontario with the lowest doc 2 0 mg l showed elevated reactivity upon subsequent chlorination ifref80 1 39 while lake simcoe had the highest doc 4 27 mg l and upon chlorination remained non responsive ifref80 1 09 a similar inverse relationship between genotoxicity and thms formation was observed whereby chlorinated lake simcoe water was observed to form 50 3 Œºg l of thms vs 25 1 Œºg l of lake ontario water 0 fig 4 it is recognized that thms are not the drivers of toxicity which explains the discordance between thms and genotoxicity cortruvo and amato 2019 3 2 comparison of wastewater surface water mixtures given that the wastewaters when taken alone showed positive responses in the sos assay a stepwise increase in reactivity was anticipated for the wastewater surface water blends while the ifref80 increased for lake ontario and lake erie fig 3 when no chlorine was present lake simcoe showed little impact to an increase in wastewater at all percentage levels again likely a result of the tertiary organic removal processes at this wwtp this indicates that lake simcoe surface water can tolerate relatively high wastewater impacts in terms of genotoxicity fig 3a however overall thm concentrations reached levels of regulatory concern fig 4 unchlorinated ww lake erie had the highest genotoxicity ifref80 2 51 fig 2 as such this drinking water source may be more susceptible to genotoxic impacts at high ratios 25 however the data indicates low genotoxic ramifications at 5 and 10 of wastewater surface water mixtures for lake erie wtp intakes fig 3b following chlorination the genotoxic response increased for all of the tested ratios however even at 25 wastewater only modest genotoxicity was observed ifref80 1 52 the highest sos responses were observed for lake ontario fig 3c however incremental increases in ww lake ontario volume did not exhibit a toxicological impact at either 5 or 10 the ontario mixture was found to be somewhat reactive at 25 ifref80 1 8 of note the unchlorinated lake ontario mixtures were not significantly different p 0 05 than their chlorinated counterpart given that chlorination did not increase the response of wastewater blends antagonistic effects between surface water and wastewater are suspected for the initial decrease in genotoxicity for chlorinated lake ontario and lake simcoe mixtures this decrease in reactivity could reflect the oxidation of micropollutants in the effluents a decrease in mutagenicity was also reported by nakamuro et al 1989 where chlorination was observed to decrease the ames test response of a surface water comprised of 20 wastewater overall the mixture results indicate that genotoxicity was more likely to be observed for 25 wastewater surface blends if 1 5 while smaller ratios of 5 and 10 generally had responses similar to those of chlorinated surface waters if 1 5 it should be noted once more that these results were qualified at ref 80 which was selected to compare responses escher et al 2014 observed positive genotoxic responses for both drinking and recycled water at ref values of 55 because no mixtures were genotoxic if 2 0 at ref 80 this indicates that the blended surface waters tested in this study even at a high percent volume of wastewater 25 did not exhibit strong genotoxicity upon chlorination and did not form dbps with strong potencies doc r 0 90 and uv254 r 0 90 showed strong correlations with genotoxicity for all chlorinated mixtures tables s3 and s5 however for lake simcoe mixtures wastewater is subjected to advanced organic removal processes the correlations with doc r 0 80 and uv254 r 0 80 are weaker table s4 possibly owing to differences in micropollutant or nitrogen levels table 1 suva correlated well r 0 90 with genotoxicity for the lake erie mixtures and r 0 70 for the lake simcoe mixtures and negatively for the lake ontario mixtures another unexpected finding was the lack of correlation between dbp concentration and genotoxicity lake simcoe mixtures were observed to have the highest dbp concentrations upon chlorination fig 4 but were associated with low sos responses fig 3a in contrast the lake ontario samples had the lowest doc and dbp concentrations while exerting the highest genotoxicity response this underscores the importance of measuring the genotoxicity with bioassays rather than relying on water quality parameters such as doc suva or dbp concentrations 3 3 comparison of predicted and measured sos chromotest genotoxicity predicted genotoxicity is based on the sum of relative toxicities for the measured dbps and calculated using published genotoxicity potency data from the mammalian cho comet assay wagner and plewa 2017 table s1 a value of 1 indicates that the summed relative potencies for the measured dbps total dbps fig 5 were sufficient to elicit an ec50 genotoxic response in cho cells ie 50 effect concentration individual potencies varied widely both between dbp classes and within dbp species for example the potency of bdcnm 6 32 10 5 m is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than that of tcan 1 01 x 10 3 m while thms tcm bdcm cdbm tbm were not significantly different from the negative control table s1 hans represented the primary driver of overall predicted genotoxicity and increased with greater ratios of wastewater fig 5 although hans and hnms are more genotoxic than most regulated carbon based dbps the predicted genotoxicity never exceeded 10 4 for ratios from 0 to 25 v v therefore the measured dbps represent a very low score in terms of calculated toxicity since a value of 1 indicates a toxic effect ec50 thms did not contribute to the predicted genotoxicity although by mass this class of dbps represented 72 94 of the overall halogenated compounds examined fig 4 however the correlation between thm concentrations and predicted genotoxicity were strong r 0 9 similarly the sos genotoxicity was strongly correlated with both predicted genotoxicity r 0 80 0 90 and thm concentrations r 0 80 0 90 tables s3 s5 as such thms serve as useful surrogates for the formation of unknown halogenated dbps that contribute to sos genotoxicity all of the tested wastewater effluents had very low dbp concentrations 0 5 Œºg l and therefore low predicted genotoxicity 1 6 10 6 suggesting that unknown compounds are likely the drivers of observed reactivity in the sos assay a strong linear relationship r2 0 90 was observed between the measured sos response of the chlorinated mixtures and the predicted genotoxicity for example n nitroso compounds and pahs are not considered to be dbps yet are potent genotoxins that are known to be present in municipal wastewaters white and rasmussen 1998 compared to the calculated toxicity model the sos chromotest measured whole mixture effects and provided an estimate of each wastewater s overall reactivity in cells 4 conclusions this study evaluated the genotoxicity of wastewaters and surface waters both alone and as chlorinated and unchlorinated mixtures wastewaters were typically genotoxic the extent of which is partially dictated by the treatment they are subjected to prior to discharge genotoxicity can potentially be reduced by the presence of additional organic removal steps in contrast neither unchlorinated nor chlorinated surface waters were observed to be genotoxic this study provided a framework for the amount of wastewater impact their receiving waters can tolerate before we see impacts on the genotoxicity when exposed to drinking water disinfection specifically wastewater impacts of 25 increased the genotoxicity of surface waters pre and post chlorination however low wastewater ratios v v of 5 and 10 were similar to those of unimpacted surface waters although 25 v v ratios were more likely to show higher genotoxic effect they still did not meet the criteria for being classed as genotoxic of particular interest the toxicity for the blends was not additive and highlights the importance of toxicity testing rather than extrapolations of toxicity to provide further insight thm concentrations were correlated to the predicted genotoxicity values based on the cho comet assay and sos genotoxicity although the predicted genotoxicity of thms themselves was zero thm concentrations correlated well with predicted genotoxicity and sos genotoxicity for the chlorinated mixtures suggesting that thms serve as surrogates for both known and unknown dbps that drive genotoxicity when considering chlorinated surface waters bioassays such as the sos chromotest are powerful tools that may be used to assess whole mixture effects and should therefore be considered as part of long term monitoring plans for drinking water sources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

widely known that iron is the fourth most abundant element by mass with its distribution on earth only second to oxygen silicon and aluminum khatri et al 2017 iron is mainly present in the divalent

ferric ions using cdi cells nearly 30 of iron was observed to accumulate on the carbon electrodes every operation cycle resulting in significant deterioration 10 in cdi treatment efficiency mossad and zou 2013 however the authors did not investigate the electrolyte composition and fundamental mechanisms associated with the ferric ion fouling and scaling phenomenon meanwhile researches on the migration of iron ions in cdi the main components and formation mechanism of iron scale and the mechanism of cdi performance degradation caused by iron scaling could provide theoretical guidance and research directions for how to alleviate iron scaling in the cdi system in this study we evaluated the effect of iron in brackish water on the desalination performances of cdi system the transformation of iron species iron fouling and scaling behaviors the major component of iron foulants and the underlying scaling mechanisms were thoroughly investigated via a wide range of tests and characterizations in addition representative natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa were used to further illustrate their synergistic effects with iron on the desalination and fouling behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents analytical reagent grade chemicals nacl and fecl3 were obtained from aladdin chemical china ha and bsa were purchased from sigma

activated carbon carbon black and pvdf were dissolved in n n dimethylacetamide under ultrasonic conditions and then stirred in an 80 c water bath to form a uniform coating slurry finally the slurry

glass support plates 150 150 50 mm a pair of titanium plates 200 150 1 mm an insulating mesh 0 2 mm and silicone pads 0 5 mm the effect of fe scaling on the cdi system were evaluated using a batch model experiment which included two processing stages adsorption and desorption in the adsorption stage 100 ml of nacl solution containing different concentrations of fecl3 was circulated in the cdi system for 20 min at 1 4 v dc in the desorption stage deionized water was used to clean the cdi system under short circuit the reaction solution was reconfigured after each cycle of the experiment the effect of nom on the fe scaling was illustrated by adding different concentrations of ha and bsa to the reaction system the concentration of ions was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical

effects of iron on cdi desalination performance the effects of fe concentrations on cdi desalination performance were tested and the results are shown in fig 1 the salt adsorption capacity sac of the cdi decreased throughout the operating cycle meanwhile higher fe concentrations led to faster sac deterioration for instance when 1 mg l fe was presented in the influent groundwater the sac of cdi decreased from 97 to 87 after a 5 cycle continuous operation while when a higher fe concentration 10 mg l was used the sac showed a sharp decreasing from 85 to 70 these results are similar to previous studies in which it was reported that cdi adsorption capacity dropped to 81 after 30 h operation mossad and zou 2013 in addition the trend of charge efficiency was also similar to that of sac decreasing form 45 35 as the fe concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg l fig 1b the formation of iron scale on the electrode might be responsible for the decrease in the desalination performance of the cdi system 3 2 effects of iron and nom combinations on cdi desalination performance to determine the combined effects of fe and nom on the cdi desalination performance brackish waters containing 1 mg l fe and different amounts and types of nom ha bsa and ha bsa were treated as illustrated in fig 2 a synergistic negative effect was observed when combining iron with various organic matter with the sac decreased with the increasing of initial nom concentration more importantly the ternary complex i e fe ha bsa resulted in a more severe decline in salt removal performance compared to that of the binary complex i e fe ha and fe bsa for instance the sac decreased to 54 after five cycle operation treating saline water containing 1 mg l fe 5 mg l ha and 5 mg l bsa while lower reductions were found when treating saline waters containing binary compounds 20 9 for fe ha and 41 6 for fe bsa regarding charge efficiency it presented a decreasing trend as the number of cycles increased meanwhile a high concentration of nom caused a more severe decline in charge efficiency 3 3 fate and distribution of iron 3 3 1 mass balance analysis to clarify the cause of the decline in desalination performance of cdi induced by fe fe migration in the cdi system was investigated by measuring the fe concentration in the effluent and backwash as shown in fig 3 a the iron that was removed from the electrode by backwashing was scarce the amount of desorption only accounted for a small portion of the adsorption amount and the proportion varied between 5 and 18 the results indicated that the adsorbed fe could not be completely removed and most of the adsorbed fe accumulated on the electrode this process caused irreversible inorganic fouling of the cdi electrode inducing a continuous decrease in the desalination performance of the cdi system this effect was consistent with the above results of the desalination performance decreasing over time therefore incomplete desorption of iron was the main cause of cdi fouling caused by fe moreover the amount of iron desorption decreased gradually with increasing numbers of operating cycles this was mainly because that the amount of iron adsorbed on the electrode per cycle decreased as the running time increased the deposition of fe on the electrode in each cycle exhibited similar tendencies in the concentration range investigated and decreased as the running time increased at low initial concentrations the downward trend was gentle whereas at high initial concentrations the downward trend became steep the results were attributed to the fe that had deposited on the electrode hindered the adsorption of fe in the solution on the electrode in addition as the initial concentration of fe increased the proportion of iron that could be adsorbed by the electrode decreased limited adsorption sites on the electrode were responsible for the phenomena the accumulated deposition amount exhibited an increasing trend as the fe concentration increased as shown in fig 3b meanwhile the accumulated deposition amount increased linearly with time the effluent of the cdi system was filtered by 0 45 Œºm membrane and it formed a yellow brown deposit on the membrane in addition there was a significant change in the iron concentration of the effluent before and after filtration at 10 mg l fe3 the iron concentration in the effluent without membrane filtration was 5 933 mg l while the iron concentration after membrane filtration was only 0 172 mg l the results showed that after cdi treatment the iron in the solution was almost completely in the form of insoluble iron compounds 3 3 2 correlation between iron scaling and desalination performance decline based on the analysis in the previous section it can be found that the presence of fe in groundwater caused irreversible fouling of the cdi electrode the correlation between the amount of fe deposited on the cdi electrode and the desalination performance is shown in fig 4 obviously more fe precipitation led to more severe desalination deterioration when the precipitated amount of fe increased from 0 to 1 2 mg g sac decreased from 100 to 66 5 meanwhile the specific sac began to decrease rapidly as the deposition amount of fe scaling increased and then the downward trend became flat 3 3 3 effects of nom on iron distribution the effects of organic matter on fe fate and distribution were investigated and are shown in figs s2 4 interestingly increasing the organic matter concentration in saline waters led to a decline in the fe precipitation on the carbon electrodes ferric chloride can be used as a coagulant and the following reactions may be occurred in the presence of ha 1 complexation reaction between fe3 and dissolved ha 2 charge neutralization and precipitation of fe ha 3 adsorption of iron oxyhydroxide by colloidal ha and 4 adsorption of ha by precipitation of iron oxyhydroxide previous study also reported similar nom and fe removal mechanisms when nom and fe coexisted in the feed streams davis and edwards 2017 under the abovementioned series of reactions an insoluble complex of fe ha was finally formed obvious brown yellow flocs were observed after the cdi effluent was settled for a while these flocs contained a large amount of fe hence the fe scaling on the electrode was prevented by the interaction between fe and ha resulting in a decrease in the precipitation of fe on the electrode additionally the interaction became stronger as the ha concentration increased further reducing the adsorption of fe on the electrode however the ha precipitation on the electrode exacerbated the irreversible fouling of the cdi as a protein substance in nom bsa also reacted with ferric iron in the four reactions mentioned this process could induce aggregation of bsa and formation of fe bsa colloid complexes resulting in a reduction in the fe precipitation this result was consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the aggregation of bsa and formation of the fe bsa complex by dynamic light scattering however it can be found that the coexistence of fe and bsa could not produce any obvious precipitate while the coexistence of fe and ha caused brown yellow flocs this difference was attributed to the narrow molecular weight of bsa leading to the formation of smaller floc cheng et al 2017 hao et al 2013 compared with that in the combination of fe and ha the micro flocs in the combination of fe and bsa reduced the capture of fe moreover the adsorption of fe by bsa was weaker than that by ha mizuno et al 2005 hence the fe adsorption on the electrode in the presence of fe and bsa was greater than that in the presence of fe and ha the precipitation of fe in the presence of fe ha and bsa was greater than that in the presence of fe and bsa while it was less than that in the presence of fe and ha the strong interaction between ha and fe could further hindered the adsorption of fe on the electrode compared with that for fe and bsa however bsa was encapsulated by ha under electrostatic force tan et al 2009 resulting in a decrease in the capture of fe 3 4 fouling and scaling characterization 3 4 1 form of iron scaling after treatment of the iron containing salt solution the surface of the cathode was covered with a layer of yellow substance fig s5a while the anode remained unchanged this phenomenon was mainly due to fe3 moving toward the cathode in the electric field at the same time a yellow brown layer remained on the 0 45 Œºm membrane after filtering the cdi effluent fig s5b to further identify the phases of fe scale on the electrode and precipitation on the microfiltration membrane the raman spectral analysis was performed as shown in fig s6a sharp peaks appeared at 219 9 286 4 403 4 488 1 and 605 1 cm 1 demonstrating that fe2o3 was formed on the cdi cathode binitha et al 2013 jian et al 2014 lu et al 2014 however for the residue on the filtration membrane feooh was shown to exist due to the appearance of peaks such as those of 382 and 477 cm 1 hanesch 2009 spray and choi 2009 and fe2o3 was also generated based on the peaks at 211 274 and 1277 cm 1 previous study also reported similar findings that the feooh could be converted into fe2o3 under the action within the electrostatic force meng et al 2016 therefore the transformation of fe in the cdi system can be described as follows meng et al 2016 song et al 2018 while the carbon oxidation reactions are on going at the anode he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 2019 cathode 4 4fe3 3o2 12e

compositions and valences of the fe species fig s7 the xps survey spectrum of both samples confirmed the existence of fe and o elements fig s7a in the fe 2p core level xps spectra of fe scale fe 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 peaks were located at 711 2 and 724 7 ev fig s7b respectively which was characteristic of fe3 lu et al 2014 quan et al 2016 meanwhile a satellite peak centered at 719 9 ev further confirmed the existence of fe3 the precipitate revealed similar xps results wei et al 2017 in addition three peaks were observed in the o 1s spectrum of the precipitation sample fig s7c the peaks located at 529 6 ev corresponded to fe o fe while the peak centered at 531 2 ev was attributed to fe o h which indicated the presence of feooh previous research reported similar results when analysis the electrodeposition of fe2o3 on electrodes song et al 2018 the last peak at 533 3 ev was associated with adsorbed water chen et al 2016 additionally the xrd patterns of the samples were recorded to characterize the crystal structures as shown in fig s8 no obvious peaks were observed in either samples indicating that the samples were amorphous chen et al 2016 song et al 2018 similar to previous results which shown a hump in the xrd patterns of the amorphous feooh the morphology of the fe scale on the electrode was analyzed by sem three samples of complete scaling partial scaling and raw electrode were selected with sem images shown in fig 5 compared with the surface of the raw electrode it can be clearly seen that the fouled electrode surfaces were covered by a layer of iron scale the precipitation of iron scale hindered the access of ion for transport and reduced the adsorption sites on the electrode resulting in a decrease in desalination performance 3 4 2 variations in electrode pore structure after fouling to investigate the effect of fe scaling on the specific surface area and pore distribution of the electrode n2 sorption desorption isotherms were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a n2 uptake mainly occurred in the relatively low pressure range indicated that all electrodes had abundant micropores with a typical type i isotherm for the n2 sorption desorption curve tang et al 2017 the surface areas that were calculated according to the n2 sorption desorption isotherms are presented in fig 6b compared with those of the raw electrode the decline in specific surface area and micropore surface area of the fe scaled electrode were 104 76 and 88 84 m2 g respectively with the decrease in micropore surface area contributing to 84 8 of the total decrease these results further revealed that the decrease of electrode performance was mainly due to the blocking of micropores and reduction in accessible adsorption sites after fe fouling after addition of organic matter to the influent the specific surface area of the electrode further decreased the reduction in the specific surface area of fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa was 14 3 14 6 and 24 53 higher than that of fe alone respectively this result indicated that not only fe scale but also organic matter was present on the electrode however there was almost no difference in the micropore surface area of the fouled electrode under different conditions this phenomenon may be attributed to pore size limitation and most of the micropores were not suitable for electrode foulants to enter a similar conclusion was obtained by analyzing the pore size distribution of the electrode fig s9 all fouled electrodes presented an analogous pore size distribution and the majority of micropores were not blocked by electrode foulants 3 4 3 electrochemical characterization electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the impact of fe scaling on the cdi resistance was investigated by eis analysis and the results are presented in fig 7 the curves of all samples contained a high frequency semicircle loop and a low frequency sloped line and the results was consistent with the study of luo luo et al 2018 the intercept on the x axis of the curves represented the series resistance r s which included the intrinsic resistance of the salt solution the current collector the electrodes and the any wires qu et al 2015 the semicircle loop in the high frequency was attributed to ion accumulation on the interface of electrode and electrolyte which was the parallel connection of the charge transfer resistance r ct and the electric double layer capacitor c 1 and the diameter of the semicircle loop indicated value of r ct mendoza hernandez et al 2014 the sloped line in the low frequency was a warburg impendence indicating the diffusion of ions in the pores of the electrode the ion diffusion property was assessed by warburg coefficient which was equal to the slope of the randle plot in the low frequency region min et al 2018 the component of the internal resistance was obtained by fitting the eis plot according to the equivalent circuit and fig 7b presents the resistance of all samples the r s of the raw electrode was 0 072 œâ considerably smaller than that of the electrode fouled by fe 0 091 œâ the results indicated that fe scaling induced an increase in the intrinsic resistance of the electrode resulting in a decline in the conductivity of the electrode compared with the value of raw electrode 0 074 œâ the r ct of the electrode fouled by fe was increased by 145 the intrinsic resistivity of the electrode and the contact area between the electrode and the reaction solution are two factors that affect the charge transfer resistance of the cdi cheng et al 2011 fe scaling reduced the specific surface area of the electrode by blocking pores resulting in a decline in contact area between the electrode and the reaction solution on the other hand the intrinsic resistivity of the electrode was improved by fe scaling the warburg coefficient of the electrode fouled by fe increased from 0 0167 raw electrode to 0 0271 œâ s 1 2 demonstrating that fe scaling hindered the migration of ions in the electrode the addition of nom resulted in an increase in the internal resistance of cdi compared to that with a single fe scaling the r s and r ct of the cdi fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa increased by 48 7 59 5 97 5 and 267 339 639 respectively in addition nom further decreased the rate of ion diffusion the warburg coefficient of the electrode fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa increased from 0 0271 to 0 0363 0 0509 and 0 0858 œâ s 1 2 respectively cyclic voltammetry cv cv measurements can be used to evaluate the capacity of ion accumulation at the electrode electrolyte interface as shown in fig 8 the cv curves exhibited a nearly rectangular shape without obvious redox peaks demonstrating the ideal capacitive behavior of cdi electrodes tang et al 2017 the area of the closed curves decreased when fouling and scaling formed on the electrodes with the synergetic combination of fe ha and bsa fouling resulting in the smallest area fig 8b shows the specific capacitance of the electrode calculated according to eq 3 compared with that of the raw electrode the specific capacitance of the fe fouled electrode was reduced by 15 the capacitance of the cdi was affected by the specific surface area of the electrode and the conductivity of the electrode wang et al 2014 fe scaling decreased the specific surface area and caused a reduction in the contact area between the electrode and the solution resulting in the loss of capacitance moreover the conductivity of the cdi was decreased by fe scaling thereby hindering ion accumulation on the electrode when ha and or bsa were presented in the electrolyte the specific capacitance of the cdi fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa decreased by 30 36 and 55 compared to that of the cdi fouled by fe only the precipitation of nom reduced the ion accumulation these results however are not surprising as we demonstrated in previous section that fe nom related species would block the carbon surface and micropores leading to a lower electrode capacitance 4 conclusions this study investigated the fouling and scaling behavior in a cdi module when treating brackish water containing fe the causes and main component of fe scaling were revealed which could provide a theoretical guidance for relieving fe scaling in cdi systems the major conclusions in the study are i the presence of fe caused a significant decrease in cdi performances with salt adsorption capacity decreased 31 and charge efficiency reduced 25 ii the deteriorated performances were mainly attributed to fe scaling of the carbon electrodes fe2o3 precipitation was proved to be the predominant foulant which blocked the micropores of the carbon electrodes and prevented the ion transportation into the microspores resulting in lower surface areas and capacitance as well as elevated electric resistances of the carbon electrodes iii the presence of nom alleviated the fe scaling through nom fe complexing effects while nom itself was found to have negative impacts on cdi desalination performance due to their strong interactions with the carbon electrodes iv these foulants were irreversible and cannot be removed by backwash once formed on the

unavoidable that groundwater may contain excess compounds such as calcium magnesium iron and natural organic matter previous works demonstrated that calcium and magnesium could cause serious scaling

crystallization benecke et al 2018 thompson et al 2012 the formed crystal is deposited on the membrane surface and results in the scaling and fouling of the no ro membrane however the presence of

with less than a 2 reduction in tds removal efficiency throughout a 30 h continuous operation mossad and zou 2013 iron however could be another potential threat for scaling of the cdi system it is widely known that iron is the fourth most abundant element by mass with its distribution on earth only second to oxygen silicon and aluminum khatri et al 2017 iron is mainly present in the divalent form in groundwater due to the reducing environment of groundwater doggaz et al 2018 ellis et al 2000 hamdouni et al 2016 michalakos et al 1997 however ferrous iron is liable to be oxidized and converted into ferric iron when groundwater is in contacts with the air knocke et al 1992 van halem et al 2012 vries et al 2017 previous studies showed that when treating a solution containing ferrous ferric ions using cdi cells nearly 30 of iron was observed to accumulate on the carbon electrodes every operation cycle resulting in significant deterioration 10 in cdi treatment efficiency mossad and zou 2013 however the authors did not investigate the electrolyte composition and fundamental mechanisms associated with the ferric ion fouling and scaling phenomenon meanwhile researches on the migration of iron ions in cdi the main components and formation mechanism of iron scale and the mechanism of cdi performance degradation caused by iron scaling could provide theoretical guidance and research directions for how to alleviate iron scaling in the cdi system in this study we evaluated the effect of iron in brackish water on the desalination performances of cdi system the transformation of iron species iron fouling and scaling behaviors the major component of iron foulants and the underlying scaling mechanisms were thoroughly investigated via a wide range of tests and characterizations in addition representative natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa were used to further illustrate their synergistic effects with iron on the desalination and fouling behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents analytical reagent grade chemicals nacl and fecl3 were obtained from aladdin chemical china ha and bsa were purchased from sigma

activated carbon carbon black and pvdf were dissolved in n n dimethylacetamide under ultrasonic conditions and then stirred in an 80 c water bath to form a uniform coating slurry finally the slurry was applied to a titanium plate which was placed in a 65 c oven for 12 h the experimental device consisted of a cdi system a computer a dc power supply hcp01 5b2 yangzhou huatai electronics china a multimeter vc 8246a victor china and a conductivity meter ddsj 308f rex electric chemical china as presented in fig s1 the cdi system was composed of two activated carbon electrodes 90 90 mm a pair of glass support plates 150 150 50 mm a pair of titanium plates 200 150 1 mm an insulating mesh 0 2 mm and silicone pads 0 5 mm the effect of fe scaling on the cdi system were evaluated using a batch model experiment which included two processing stages adsorption and desorption in the adsorption stage 100 ml of nacl solution containing different concentrations of fecl3 was circulated in the cdi system for 20 min at 1 4 v dc in the desorption stage deionized water was used to clean the cdi system under short circuit the reaction solution was reconfigured after each cycle of the experiment the effect of nom on the fe scaling was illustrated by adding different concentrations of ha and bsa to the reaction system the concentration of ions was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical

effects of iron on cdi desalination performance the effects of fe concentrations on cdi desalination performance were tested and the results are shown in fig 1 the salt adsorption capacity sac of the cdi decreased throughout the operating cycle meanwhile higher fe concentrations led to faster sac deterioration for instance when 1 mg l fe was presented in the influent groundwater the sac of cdi decreased from 97 to 87 after a 5 cycle continuous operation while when a higher fe concentration 10 mg l was used the sac showed a sharp decreasing from 85 to 70 these results are similar to previous studies in which it was reported that cdi adsorption capacity dropped to 81 after 30 h operation mossad and zou 2013 in addition the trend of charge efficiency was also similar to that of sac decreasing form 45 35 as the fe concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg l fig 1b the formation of iron scale on the electrode might be responsible for the decrease in the desalination performance of the cdi system 3 2 effects of iron and nom combinations on cdi desalination performance to determine the combined effects of fe and nom on the cdi desalination performance brackish waters containing 1 mg l fe and different amounts and types of nom ha bsa and ha bsa were treated as illustrated in fig 2 a synergistic negative effect was observed when combining iron with various organic matter with the sac decreased with the increasing of initial nom concentration more importantly the ternary complex i e fe ha bsa resulted in a more severe decline in salt removal performance compared to that of the binary complex i e fe ha and fe bsa for instance the sac decreased to 54 after five cycle operation treating saline water containing 1 mg l fe 5 mg l ha and 5 mg l bsa while lower reductions were found when treating saline waters containing binary compounds 20 9 for fe ha and 41 6 for fe bsa regarding charge efficiency it presented a decreasing trend as the number of cycles increased meanwhile a high concentration of nom caused a more severe decline in charge efficiency 3 3 fate and distribution of iron 3 3 1 mass balance analysis to clarify the cause of the decline in desalination performance of cdi induced by fe fe migration in the cdi system was investigated by measuring the fe concentration in the effluent and backwash as shown in fig 3 a the iron that was removed from the electrode by backwashing was scarce the amount of desorption only accounted for a small portion of the adsorption amount and the proportion varied between 5 and 18 the results indicated that the adsorbed fe could not be completely removed and most of the adsorbed fe accumulated on the electrode this process caused irreversible inorganic fouling of the cdi electrode inducing a continuous decrease in the desalination performance of the cdi system this effect was consistent with the above results of the desalination performance decreasing over time therefore incomplete desorption of iron was the main cause of cdi fouling caused by fe moreover the amount of iron desorption decreased gradually with increasing numbers of operating cycles this was mainly because that the amount of iron adsorbed on the electrode per cycle decreased as the running time increased the deposition of fe on the electrode in each cycle exhibited similar tendencies in the concentration range investigated and decreased as the running time increased at low initial concentrations the downward trend was gentle whereas at high initial concentrations the downward trend became steep the results were attributed to the fe that had deposited on the electrode hindered the adsorption of fe in the solution on the electrode in addition as the initial concentration of fe increased the proportion of iron that could be adsorbed by the electrode decreased limited adsorption sites on the electrode were responsible for the phenomena the accumulated deposition amount exhibited an increasing trend as the fe concentration increased as shown in fig 3b meanwhile the accumulated deposition amount increased linearly with time the effluent of the cdi system was filtered by 0 45 Œºm membrane and it formed a yellow brown deposit on the membrane in addition there was a significant change in the iron concentration of the effluent before and after filtration at 10 mg l fe3 the iron concentration in the effluent without membrane filtration was 5 933 mg l while the iron concentration after membrane filtration was only 0 172 mg l the results showed that after cdi treatment the iron in the solution was almost completely in the form of insoluble iron compounds 3 3 2 correlation between iron scaling and desalination performance decline based on the analysis in the previous section it can be found that the presence of fe in groundwater caused irreversible fouling of the cdi electrode the correlation between the amount of fe deposited on the cdi electrode and the desalination performance is shown in fig 4 obviously more fe precipitation led to more severe desalination deterioration when the precipitated amount of fe increased from 0 to 1 2 mg g sac decreased from 100 to 66 5 meanwhile the specific sac began to decrease rapidly as the deposition amount of fe scaling increased and then the downward trend became flat 3 3 3 effects of nom on iron distribution the effects of organic matter on fe fate and distribution were investigated and are shown in figs s2 4 interestingly increasing the organic matter concentration in saline waters led to a decline in the fe precipitation on the carbon electrodes ferric chloride can be used as a coagulant and the following reactions may be occurred in the presence of ha 1 complexation reaction between fe3 and dissolved ha 2 charge neutralization and precipitation of fe ha 3 adsorption of iron oxyhydroxide by colloidal ha and 4 adsorption of ha by precipitation of iron oxyhydroxide previous study also reported similar nom and fe removal mechanisms when nom and fe coexisted in the feed streams davis and edwards 2017 under the abovementioned series of reactions an insoluble complex of fe ha was finally formed obvious brown yellow flocs were observed after the cdi effluent was settled for a while these flocs contained a large amount of fe hence the fe scaling on the electrode was prevented by the interaction between fe and ha resulting in a decrease in the precipitation of fe on the electrode additionally the interaction became stronger as the ha concentration increased further reducing the adsorption of fe on the electrode however the ha precipitation on the electrode exacerbated the irreversible fouling of the cdi as a protein substance in nom bsa also reacted with ferric iron in the four reactions mentioned this process could induce aggregation of bsa and formation of fe bsa colloid complexes resulting in a reduction in the fe precipitation this result was consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the aggregation of bsa and formation of the fe bsa complex by dynamic light scattering however it can be found that the coexistence of fe and bsa could not produce any obvious precipitate while the coexistence of fe and ha caused brown yellow flocs this difference was attributed to the narrow molecular weight of bsa leading to the formation of smaller floc cheng et al 2017 hao et al 2013 compared with that in the combination of fe and ha the micro flocs in the combination of fe and bsa reduced the capture of fe moreover the adsorption of fe by bsa was weaker than that by ha mizuno et al 2005 hence the fe adsorption on the electrode in the presence of fe and bsa was greater than that in the presence of fe and ha the precipitation of fe in the presence of fe ha and bsa was greater than that in the presence of fe and bsa while it was less than that in the presence of fe and ha the strong interaction between ha and fe could further hindered the adsorption of fe on the electrode compared with that for fe and bsa however bsa was encapsulated by ha under electrostatic force tan et al 2009 resulting in a decrease in the capture of fe 3 4 fouling and scaling characterization 3 4 1 form of iron scaling after treatment of the iron containing salt solution the surface of the cathode was covered with a layer of yellow substance fig s5a while the anode remained unchanged this phenomenon was mainly due to fe3 moving toward the cathode in the electric field at the same time a yellow brown layer remained on the 0 45 Œºm membrane after filtering the cdi effluent fig s5b to further identify the phases of fe scale on the electrode and precipitation on the microfiltration membrane the raman spectral analysis was performed as shown in fig s6a sharp peaks appeared at 219 9 286 4 403 4 488 1 and 605 1 cm 1 demonstrating that fe2o3 was formed on the cdi cathode binitha et al 2013 jian et al 2014 lu et al 2014 however for the residue on the filtration membrane feooh was shown to exist due to the appearance of peaks such as those of 382 and 477 cm 1 hanesch 2009 spray and choi 2009 and fe2o3 was also generated based on the peaks at 211 274 and 1277 cm 1 previous study also reported similar findings that the feooh could be converted into fe2o3 under the action within the electrostatic force meng et al 2016 therefore the transformation of fe in the cdi system can be described as follows meng et al 2016 song et al 2018 while the carbon oxidation reactions are on going at the anode he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 2019 cathode 4 4fe3 3o2 12e

and 2p1 2 peaks were located at 711 2 and 724 7 ev fig s7b respectively which was characteristic of fe3 lu et al 2014 quan et al 2016 meanwhile a satellite peak centered at 719 9 ev further confirmed the existence of fe3 the precipitate revealed similar xps results wei et al 2017 in addition three peaks were observed in the o 1s spectrum of the precipitation sample fig s7c the peaks located at 529 6 ev corresponded to fe o fe while the peak centered at 531 2 ev was attributed to fe o h which indicated the presence of feooh previous research reported similar results when analysis the electrodeposition of fe2o3 on electrodes song et al 2018 the last peak at 533 3 ev was associated with adsorbed water chen et al 2016 additionally the xrd patterns of the samples were recorded to characterize the crystal structures as shown in fig s8 no obvious peaks were observed in either samples indicating that the samples were amorphous chen et al 2016 song et al 2018 similar to previous results which shown a hump in the xrd patterns of the amorphous feooh the morphology of the fe scale on the electrode was analyzed by sem three samples of complete scaling partial scaling and raw electrode were selected with sem images shown in fig 5 compared with the surface of the raw electrode it can be clearly seen that the fouled electrode surfaces were covered by a layer of iron scale the precipitation of iron scale hindered the access of ion for transport and reduced the adsorption sites on the electrode resulting in a decrease in desalination performance 3 4 2 variations in electrode pore structure after fouling to investigate the effect of fe scaling on the specific surface area and pore distribution of the electrode n2 sorption desorption isotherms were analyzed as shown in fig 6 a n2 uptake mainly occurred in the relatively low pressure range indicated that all electrodes had abundant micropores with a typical type i isotherm for the n2 sorption desorption curve tang et al 2017 the surface areas that were calculated according to the n2 sorption desorption isotherms are presented in fig 6b compared with those of the raw electrode the decline in specific surface area and micropore surface area of the fe scaled electrode were 104 76 and 88 84 m2 g respectively with the decrease in micropore surface area contributing to 84 8 of the total decrease these results further revealed that the decrease of electrode performance was mainly due to the blocking of micropores and reduction in accessible adsorption sites after fe fouling after addition of organic matter to the influent the specific surface area of the electrode further decreased the reduction in the specific surface area of fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa was 14 3 14 6 and 24 53 higher than that of fe alone respectively this result indicated that not only fe scale but also organic matter was present on the electrode however there was almost no difference in the micropore surface area of the fouled electrode under different conditions this phenomenon may be attributed to pore size limitation and most of the micropores were not suitable for electrode foulants to enter a similar conclusion was obtained by analyzing the pore size distribution of the electrode fig s9 all fouled electrodes presented an analogous pore size distribution and the majority of micropores were not blocked by electrode foulants 3 4 3 electrochemical characterization electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the impact of fe scaling on the cdi resistance was investigated by eis analysis and the results are presented in fig 7 the curves of all samples contained a high frequency semicircle loop and a low frequency sloped line and the results was consistent with the study of luo luo et al 2018 the intercept on the x axis of the curves represented the series resistance r s which included the intrinsic resistance of the salt solution the current collector the electrodes and the any wires qu et al 2015 the semicircle loop in the high frequency was attributed to ion accumulation on the interface of electrode and electrolyte which was the parallel connection of the charge transfer resistance r ct and the electric double layer capacitor c 1 and the diameter of the semicircle loop indicated value of r ct mendoza hernandez et al 2014 the sloped line in the low frequency was a warburg impendence indicating the diffusion of ions in the pores of the electrode the ion diffusion property was assessed by warburg coefficient which was equal to the slope of the randle plot in the low frequency region min et al 2018 the component of the internal resistance was obtained by fitting the eis plot according to the equivalent circuit and fig 7b presents the resistance of all samples the r s of the raw electrode was 0 072 œâ considerably smaller than that of the electrode fouled by fe 0 091 œâ the results indicated that fe scaling induced an increase in the intrinsic resistance of the electrode resulting in a decline in the conductivity of the electrode compared with the value of raw electrode 0 074 œâ the r ct of the electrode fouled by fe was increased by 145 the intrinsic resistivity of the electrode and the contact area between the electrode and the reaction solution are two factors that affect the charge transfer resistance of the cdi cheng et al 2011 fe scaling reduced the specific surface area of the electrode by blocking pores resulting in a decline in contact area between the electrode and the reaction solution on the other hand the intrinsic resistivity of the electrode was improved by fe scaling the warburg coefficient of the electrode fouled by fe increased from 0 0167 raw electrode to 0 0271 œâ s 1 2 demonstrating that fe scaling hindered the migration of ions in the electrode the addition of nom resulted in an increase in the internal resistance of cdi compared to that with a single fe scaling the r s and r ct of the cdi fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa increased by 48 7 59 5 97 5 and 267 339 639 respectively in addition nom further decreased the rate of ion diffusion the warburg coefficient of the electrode fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa increased from 0 0271 to 0 0363 0 0509 and 0 0858 œâ s 1 2 respectively cyclic voltammetry cv cv measurements can be used to evaluate the capacity of ion accumulation at the electrode electrolyte interface as shown in fig 8 the cv curves exhibited a nearly rectangular shape without obvious redox peaks demonstrating the ideal capacitive behavior of cdi electrodes tang et al 2017 the area of the closed curves decreased when fouling and scaling formed on the electrodes with the synergetic combination of fe ha and bsa fouling resulting in the smallest area fig 8b shows the specific capacitance of the electrode calculated according to eq 3 compared with that of the raw electrode the specific capacitance of the fe fouled electrode was reduced by 15 the capacitance of the cdi was affected by the specific surface area of the electrode and the conductivity of the electrode wang et al 2014 fe scaling decreased the specific surface area and caused a reduction in the contact area between the electrode and the solution resulting in the loss of capacitance moreover the conductivity of the cdi was decreased by fe scaling thereby hindering ion accumulation on the electrode when ha and or bsa were presented in the electrolyte the specific capacitance of the cdi fouled by fe ha fe bsa and fe ha bsa decreased by 30 36 and 55 compared to that of the cdi fouled by fe only the precipitation of nom reduced the ion accumulation these results however are not surprising as we demonstrated in previous section that fe nom related species would block the carbon surface and micropores leading to a lower electrode capacitance 4 conclusions this study investigated the fouling and scaling behavior in a cdi module when treating brackish water containing fe the causes and main component of fe scaling were revealed which could provide a theoretical guidance for relieving fe scaling in cdi systems the major conclusions in the study are i the presence of fe caused a significant decrease in cdi performances with salt adsorption capacity decreased 31 and charge efficiency reduced 25 ii the deteriorated performances were mainly attributed to fe scaling of the carbon electrodes fe2o3 precipitation was proved to be the predominant foulant which blocked the micropores of the carbon electrodes and prevented the ion transportation into the microspores resulting in lower surface areas and capacitance as well as elevated electric resistances of the carbon electrodes iii the presence of nom alleviated the fe scaling through nom fe complexing effects while nom itself was found to have negative impacts on cdi desalination performance due to their strong interactions with the carbon electrodes iv these foulants were irreversible and cannot be removed by backwash once formed on the

18183,thermal hydrolysis th increases the anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge was but also refractory organic and nutrient return load to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp this could lead to an increase in effluent chemical oxygen demand cod of the wwtp the aim of this study was to investigate the trade off between increase in biogas production through th and anaerobic digestion and increase in refractory cod in dewatered sludge liquors at different temperatures of th in lab scale was was thermally hydrolyzed in temperature range of 130 170 c for 30 min to determine its biomethane potential bmp after bmp test sludge was dewatered and sludge liquor was aerated in zahn wellens test to determine its non biodegradable soluble cod known as refractory soluble cod scodref with increasing temperature in the range of 130 170 c bmp of was increased by 17 27 while scodref increased by 3 9 8 4 dewaterability was also enhanced through relative increase in cake solids by 12 30 a conversion factor was defined through mass balance to relate scodref to volatile solids of raw was based on the conversion factor expected increase in effluent cods of six wwtps in berlin were predicted to be in the range of 2 15 mg l after implementation of th at different temperatures it was concluded that with a slight decrease in temperature formation of scodref could be significantly reduced while still benefiting from a substantial increase in biogas production and dewaterability improvement graphical abstract image 1 keywords thermal hydrolysis biomethane potential zahn wellens test anaerobic digestion sludge liquor effluent cod 1 introduction the activated sludge process is the most widely used process for wastewater treatment throughout the world for its convenience and efficiency waste activated sludge was is the unfavorable byproduct of this process its handling and disposal accounts for up to 50 of operational costs on a wastewater treatment plant wwtp appels et al 2008 therefore it is profitable to reduce the amount of was as much as possible before disposal anaerobic digestion ad has established itself as an efficient way of reducing sludge with benefit of producing biogas as a renewable energy source appels et al 2008 however digestibility of was is limited due to its microbial structure whereas pretreatment processes are known to boost its ad barjenbruch and kopplow 2003 different physical chemical thermal and biological pretreatment methods have been investigated extensively for their potential effects on enhancing ad of was carlsson et al 2012 carrere et al 2010 2016 joo et al 2015 neumann et al 2016 tyagi and lo 2011 zhen et al 2017 amongst all thermal pretreatments have shown the highest potential when it comes to energy efficiency and integration on a wwtp cano et al 2015 fern√°ndez polanco and tatsumi 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 high temperature thermal pretreatment also known as thermal hydrolysis th has been commercialized and implemented in full scale globally as an established was pretreatment process barber 2016 th increases biogas production basically through solubilization of hardly biodegradable organic matter which in turn leads to increase in concentration of organic and inorganic substances in sludge liquors in practice sludge liquors are usually returned back to headworks of wwtp for retreatment return load part of this increased return load from was th nh 4 n po 4 3 p etc can be eliminated in the main treatment line without modification of the process steps albeit with increasing operational costs this part can also be recovered although installation of recovery units is needed mehta et al 2014 another part of return load referred to as dissolved organic part organic nitrogen phosphorus and carbon cannot be eliminated thoroughly in conventional treatment lines and poses a risk to impair wwtp effluent quality control parameters dwyer et al 2008 2009 gupta et al 2015 there is abundant research concerning ad enhancement after th over a wide range of temperatures many researchers have reported the optimum temperature of th to be in the range of 160 180 c regarding maximum biogas yield after which the anaerobic biodegradability decreases bjerg nielsen et al 2018 choi et al 2018 higgins et al 2017 jeong et al 2019 svensson et al 2018 most commercialized processes also operate th in the temperature range of 165 170 c nevertheless it has not yet been reported to which extent lower temperatures during th can mitigate the finally remaining refractory soluble chemical oxygen demand scodref scodref is a part of the soluble cod scod which is resistant to biological anaerobic and aerobic degradation and can lead to potential deterioration of wwtp effluent quality the aim of this study was to assess the effect of decreasing usual temperature of th on biogas yield of was and on the following aerobic biodegradability of its centrates in a series of batch tests consequently a conversion factor was defined which can be used to predict the effect of th temperature on effluent cod increase of a wwtp data of six wwtps in berlin and conversion factor were used to show their potential effluent cod increase after th implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge thickened was was obtained from a large wwtp in berlin operated with pre denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr was was stored at 4 c in refrigerator no longer than two days before the tests the characteristics of was are summarized in table 1 the required aerobic inoculum for zahn wellens test was collected from the aerated activated sludge tanks and anaerobic inoculum for biomethane potential test from the anaerobic sludge digestion tanks 2 2 procedure of the experiments the procedure of the experiments carried out is shown in fig 1 first was was thermally hydrolyzed and subsequently anaerobically digested to determine its biogas yield in the next step the digestate was dewatered and the supernatant was used for the zahn wellens test each step is described in detail in the following 2 2 1 high temperature thermal hydrolysis th was carried out with a lab scale rig cambi group as norway see fig s1 the rig included a steam generating unit a reactor and a flash tank thickened was was hydrolyzed at desired temperatures and related pressures by injecting vapor into the 1 l volume reactor it was followed by an abrupt pressure relief through an orifice into a flash chamber steam explosion to maximize the breakdown of the microbial cell structures th time was fixed on 30 min and time was recorded as soon as the reactor reached the desired temperature th temperature was varied from 130 c to 170 c within 10 c intervals th130 th140 th150 th160 and th170 for each temperature the whole test series shown in fig 1 were run two times after each test the test rig was cleaned with water for 30 min at 170 c to wash out the remainders of the previous th of was 2 2 2 biomethane potential test an automatic test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden was used to measure biomethane potential bmp inoculum to substrate ratio isr of 2 based on volatile solids vs content was chosen and kept constant throughout the tests to avoid volatile fatty acids vfa inhibition and to check the kinetics 500 ml bottles were filled with inoculum and sludge and flushed with nitrogen gas for 1 min to assure anaerobic conditions intermittent automatic mixing 30 s on off was applied to all bottles with speed adjustment set on 30 the tests were run under mesophilic temperature of 37 c 1 until daily methane production was below 1 percent of total volume of methane produced holliger et al 2016 the system included intermediate absorption of co2 and h2s using a solution of naoh 3 m in order that only methane volume is finally measured and recorded activity of anaerobic inoculum was checked through parallel incubating of microcrystalline cellulose cas number 9004 34 6 anaerobic inoculum was also incubated separately to determine its endogenous methane production tests were always run in triplicate 2 2 3 dewaterability test samples of digestate were centrifuged at 25000 g for 30 min avanti j e beckman coulter the sludge cakes were separated and used for determination of total solids ts according to standard methods apha and wpcf 1998 dwa 2008 in order to have same samples for duplicate ts measurements the cakes were cut in half vertically 2 2 4 zahn wellens test anaerobically digested sludge after the bmp tests was filtered with polyester filters and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was taken as test substance centrate for zahn wellens test procedures of oecd guideline 302 b were followed empa 1992 aerobic inoculum was washed three times with tap water to reduce the amount of inherent scod before mixing with the samples to check the activity of the inoculum and the validity of the test biodegradability of ethylene glycol cas number 107 21 1 as a reference compound was always monitored and checked in parallel moreover the aerobic inoculum was aerated separately to determine its inherent scodref the mineral medium was prepared before the start of the test and included the nutrients described in standard procedure empa 1992 1 l volume bottles were used for the test in which 500 ml of mineral medium was always mixed with a suitable amount of inoculum and test substance and filled up to 1 l the bottles were placed in an incubator set at 22 1 c and aerated for 28 days using two sets of laboratory air pumps continuous mixing was provided by magnetic stirrers ph value was regularly adjusted to 7 0 0 1 using naoh 3 0 m and hcl 3 0 m the loss of water in the bottles due to evaporation was always compensated with deionized water before taking samples tests were run in duplicate and biodegradation was monitored by scod measurement 2 3 analytics total solids ts and vs were determined using the guidelines of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha and wpcf 1998 ph was measured using a hach lange multimeter hq40d model intellical probes total cod tcod total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn were determined after proper dilution of the sample by photometric measurements using test cuvettes hach lange dr 5000 to measure soluble cod scod

and sinks of scodref during experiments in this study are shown in fig 2 ultimately remaining scod after zahn wellens test was measured and defined as scodref afterwards inherent scodref fraction of aerobic inoculum blank was deduced from it based on mixing fractions due to mixing of was with anaerobic inoculum during bmp tests anaerobic inoculum was also incubated separately in zahn wellens test to determine its inherent scodref subsequently a parameter named conversion factor cf was defined which can be used to estimate the amount of remaining scodref in centrate after aerobic degradation i e in effluent of an activated sludge tank based on the total amount of vs in was fed to the anaerobic digestors see fig 1 this factor is also useful for comparison of the effect of different th temperatures on formation of scodref and its potential impact on the wwtp effluent quality first cf for anaerobic inoculum was defined as following 8 c f a n i n o s c o d r e f v s i n 100 cf an ino conversion factor for anaerobic inoculum scod ref g fraction of scod remaining after zahn wellens test of anaerobic inoculum vs in g fraction of vs of anaerobic inoculum fed into bmp test bottles

test bottles scod ref s g fraction of scod remaining after zahn wellens test of was or thermally hydrolyzed was at different temperatures with anaerobic inoculum vs an ino s g fraction of vs of anaerobic inoculum fed into bmp test bottles of was or thermally hydrolyzed was at different temperatures vs was chosen instead of cod here because cod measurements of thickened was are not as accurate and common as of vs in practice 2 4 5 modelling the effect of thermal hydrolysis on the effluent cod of wwtps residual scod in effluent of a wwtp without ad of sludge originates from different external sources including also industrial wastewater ad of sludge is an internal source of scodref which increases cod concentration in the wwtp effluent through the return load by implementing th of was before ad another contributor of scodref is added in the process scheme influent volume rate of a wwtp equals its effluent volume rate therefore daily production of was in relation to daily wastewater flow of the wwtp determines the potential increase of effluent scod by th implementation using conversion factors of th from this study and knowing was productions and volume flow rates of wwtps the potential increase in effluent scod at these wwtps can be predicted for different th temperatures first was production as vs per unit volume of influent is calculated by using the following equation 11 s w a s p v s w a s q 10 6 swasp g m¬≥ specific was production vs was t d daily was production as vs q m3 d daily volume flow rate of wwtp then by having swasp and cf scod increase in effluent of the wwtps after implementing ad or ad preceded by th of was at different temperatures are calculated as following 12 s c o d e f f i n c c f i 100 s w a s p scod eff inc mg l increase in effluent scod 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature on solubilization of cod p o 4 3 p and n h 4 n ph ts and vs ts ratio of was and hydrolyzed was are shown in fig 3 a with increasing temperature of th between 130 and 170 c in 10 c intervals ph decreases from 6 10 to 5 98 5 89 5 79 5 50 and 5 35 after th respectively reduction of ph is mainly due to release of organic acids from microbial structure bougrier et al 2008 jeong et al 2019 wilson and novak 2009 xue et al 2015 with increasing temperature of th more vapor needs to be injected into the reactor which resulted in reduction of ts from 7 20 to 4 62 4 69 3 88 4 40 and 3 87 for respective temperatures on the contrary vs ts ratio did not change significantly ranging from 79 62 to 80 32 showing almost no loss of organic content during th at the tested temperatures jo et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b sdcod increased with increasing temperature from 130 to 170 c within 10 c intervals from 20 6 to 23 4 29 3 35 5 and 41 5 this is also in accordance with results of jeong et al 2019 which reported 15 40 increase in sdcod moreover wilson and novak 2009 showed increase of sdcod from 8 0 up to 21 4 for was hydrolyzed at 130 200 c there is an agreement in literature that with increasing temperature of th sdcod constantly increases in this temperature range barber 2016 pilli et al 2014 with increase in th temperature from 130 to 170 c sdpo4 p similarly increased from 21 9 to 27 7 31 9 41 0 and 43 1 respectively fig 3c laurent et al 2011 also reported an increase of orthophosphate from 29 to 50 mg l with th at 170 c due to the fact that was was taken from a wwtp with ebpr in this study it was concluded that solubilized orthophosphate increased during th through destruction of orthophosphate bonds of phospholipids in cell membranes release of orthophosphate after th of ebpr was could be regarded as the first step of a potential solution to the problem of struvite precipitation in digesters pipelines and subsequent equipment when chemically precipitated and separated after th and before digestion it could reduce maintenance costs related to removing incrustations or lower consumption of the costly anti scalant chemicals which are currently applied to hinder precipitation processes in digesters heinzmann and engel 2006 kuroda et al 2002 liao et al 2003 takiguchi et al 2004 sdnh4 n was negligible 1 for all th temperatures from 130 to 170 c fig 3d this is in agreement with xue et al 2015 who reported no significant increase of nh 4 n after th at temperatures of 120 180 c for 30 min treatment time however according to their study nh 4 n drastically increased in higher temperatures 160 c when combined with longer treatment time 30 min similarly jeong et al 2019 showed a very slight increase of nh 4 n for temperatures of 100 160 c followed by a sharp increase for temperatures above 180 c up to 220 c wilson and novak 2009 also reported increase of total ammonia nitrogen tan from 100 mg l up to 250 mg l for th of was at 170 c similarly the release percentage was also intensified in their study by increasing temperature to 190 and 220 c resulting in increase of tan to 650 and 900 mg l respectively they clearly showed that in spite of significant solubilization of proteins in temperature range of 130 170 c tan release intensified above 170 c all of these results show that ammonification of organic nitrogen in was could also occur non biologically although at severe th conditions longer th time or higher temperature 3 2 effect of temperature on the biomethane potential bmp of microcrystalline cellulose was 344 9 nml g vsadded which was consistent with the values reported in literature raposo et al 2011 this proved the activity of anaerobic inoculum and validity of the gas measurements specific methane production of was and hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 150 and 170 c are depicted in fig 4 a as illustrative examples of gas production curves kinetically observed despite a total increase in specific methane production through pretreatment the time needed for sludge to reach the ultimate specific methane production did not change significantly the percentage of daily specific methane production to the ultimate specific methane production is presented in fig 4b as it could be seen the rate of methane production increases from the start until the day 2 and then decreases continually until the end of the test however for the th temperature of 170 c and to a lesser intensity for 150 c there was another increase of methane production rate at the day 5 until the day 7 after which it decreased again this effect could be attributed to two probable reasons first higher th temperatures 150 c could cause an increase in formation of more slowly biodegradable compounds which need more time to be hydrolyzed and broken down to favorable substrates another reason could be the increase of vfas caused by higher release of available substrates at higher th temperatures jeong et al 2019 xue et al 2015 that could potentially lead to partial and temporary inhibition of methanogens during the first methane production peak pratt et al 2012 consequently this partial inhibition is mitigated as soon as vfas are converted which is followed by a second peak of methane production rate bmp absolute values as well as bmp percentage increases of thermally hydrolyzed was in comparison to was without th at different temperatures are shown in fig 4c overall reproducibility of absolute bmp results was good between duplicate experiments for each temperature variation 10 while bmp of was was 212 nml g vsadded bmp of thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c increased to 253 247 255 250 and 274 nml g vsadded respectively even at the lowest th temperature of 130 c an increase of bmp up to 17 1 was achieved compared to the was without th by further increasing the temperature of th from 140 to 170 c bmp increased by 17 4 21 0 18 9 and 27 1 respectively svensson et al 2018 reported 18 bmp increase of thermally hydrolyzed digested sludge in temperature range of 153 175 c with negligible change in the range of 134 153 c jeong et al 2019 studied thermal hydrolysis of was with different ts values between 1 and 7 in temperature range of 100 220 c and reported maximum biomethane yield at temperature of 180 c higgins et al 2017 reported 6 increase in bmp of mixed sludge with increases of th temperature from 130 to 170 c they also reviewed several studies which have reported increase of bmp for was or mixed sludge until a threshold in temperature 160 180 c after which it declined this has been reported to be due to reaction of simple sugars with amino acids and production of melanoidins through maillard reactions at higher temperatures dwyer et al 2008 vsr increased from 42 8 for was without th to 50 8 50 7 51 2 50 3 and 55 1 for thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c fig 4d therefore in comparison to was without th vsr increased by 18 7 18 4 19 6 17 5 and 28 6 for thermally hydrolyzed was at respective temperatures 3 3 effect of temperature on dewaterability of digested sludge results of dewaterability tests are shown in fig 5 the final ts of was after ad was 14 28 while with increasing th temperature from 130 to 170 c ts in cake increased constantly from 15 98 to 18 58 making 12 30 relative increase higgins et al 2017 also reported constant increase in dewaterability of mixed sludge from 27 to 32 in cake solids an increase of 18 5 within temperature range of 130 170 c dewaterability plays a decisive role on disposal costs as it directly deals with amount of water which is bound to flocs of mechanically dewatered sludge the most important cost saving by implementation of th comes from disposal costs reduction due to dewaterability improvement 3 4 effect of temperature on refractory soluble cod scod elimination percentage during the zahn wellens test for reference substance ethylene glycol centrates of digested was and thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 150 and 170 c are shown as illustrative examples in fig 6 a the reference substance was always degraded 99 in less than 7 days which proved good activity of aerobic inoculum and hence the validity of all tests for other samples curves of scod elimination split into two separate phases during the first 7 days of the test scod concentration increased as shown by negative elimination degrees which could probably be attributed to a higher rate of hydrolysis of particulate cod into scod in comparison to the parallel elimination rate of scod afterwards scod elimination starts to increase continuously until the end of the test in this period scod elimination outpaces hydrolysis of particulate cod cod of organic substances greater than 0 45 Œºm into scod at the end of the aerobic biodegradability test period scod elimination rate diminished as described in section 2 4 4 a conversion factor cf was defined to relate mass of scodref after zahn wellens test to vs input mass into bmp bottles the mass balance through bmp and zahn wellens tests based on input and output concentrations volumes and fractions is presented in table 2 for further clarification moreover the final cf average values are shown in fig 6b reproducibility of absolute zahn wellens results and related cf was not as good as that of bmp results a reason for that might be having filtered samples with remaining particles of different sizes after filtration process of digested sludge before starting zahn wellens test in other words having more identical filtered samples after dewatering could lead to better reproducibility since the zahn wellens test is a well reproducible test per se empa 1992 one issue to bear in mind is that samples should at best represent the properties of centrate of dewatering machines on the wwtp to have the best prediction results as shown in fig 6b the cf increased from 2 6 for was to 3 94 4 26 3 62 5 08 and 8 42 for thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c respectively this corresponded to a 51 2 63 5 39 1 95 1 and 223 4 increase in cf for thermally hydrolyzed was at respective temperatures in comparison to was without th the colors of the samples before and after bmp tests for different temperatures are displayed in fig s2 intensification of color with th temperature for samples after bmp tests was obviously noticeable fig s2b moreover the relative increase of cf and bmp for th temperatures of 130 170 c is shown in fig 6c stepwise increase of bmp and cf with increase in temperature clearly shows that there is a trade off between biogas increase and refractory scod increase interestingly by lowering the th temperature from 170 to 160 c the cf increase dropped from 223 to 95 while bmp increase dropped only from 27 to 19 both parameters were fitted to exponential models the results of this fitting are presented in table 3 percentage increase of cf versus percentage increase of bmp in temperature range of 130 170 c is shown in fig 6d there are no quite similar studies to which the results of this section can be compared however higgins et al 2017 reported effluent scod of anaerobic digesters fed with thermally hydrolyzed mixed sludge to be 12 5 to 9 0 g l in temperature range of 130 170 c in another study by dwyer et al 2008 scod of thermally hydrolyzed mixed sludge after digestion in th temperature range of 140 165 c was 7 11 g l none of them carried out an aerobic biodegradability test similar to what was done in this study it should be noted that the inocula used in bmp and zahn wellens tests of this study were not adapted to thermally hydrolyzed sludge batch tests in other words a potential positive adaptation effect of the biomass over time could not be simulated in this study this aspect needs continuous biological tests over a longer period of time 3 5 modelling the effect of thermal hydrolysis on effluent cod of six wwtps in berlin the relationship between different values of swasp defined in section 2 4 5 and increase in effluent cod of wwtps using cfs calculated in section 3 3 is shown in fig 7 a equation 12 was used to depict these graphs as shown increase in effluent cod of a wwtp is dependent of its swasp the implementation of ad or th ad and the th temperature to make use of these results actual data from six wwtps in berlin was obtained to predict the effect of th temperature on their effluent cod increase see table 4 swasp for these wwtps lies in the range of 141 251 g m¬≥ effect of th temperature on effluent cod increase of these six wwtps is shown in fig 7b a higher swasp more was production per inflow volume unit leads to a higher increase in effluent cod after th implementation however swasp and th temperature are not the only determining factors yet when considering implementation of th since each wwtp has its own unique effluent cod concentration before th determined mainly by its inflow composition and process different final effluent cods are to be expected with th looking again at table 4 although the order of swasp follows wwtp6 wwtp5 wwtp4 wwtp3 wwtp2 wwtp1 the order of predicted final effluent cod with th is wwtp4 wwtp3 wwtp2 wwtp6 wwtp5 wwtp1 due to the actual effluent cod before th accordingly effluent cod of a wwtp before implementing th its swasp temperature of th and the regional cod discharge limit should be taken into account when considering suitability of th for a specific region or plant it should be noted that other controlled effluent quality parameters such as tn tp etc could also be affected by th but were not the focus of this study to the best of the authors knowledge there is no distinctive literature available regarding the increase of effluent cod after th implementation for a comparison to the results of this study however a technical report of the german association of water and wastewater dwa on sewage sludge disintegration estimates roughly 5 mg l or 10 increase in effluent cod load for th implementation at usual temperatures 165 c according to full scale experience dwa 2016 this is within the range of the results of the current study 4 conclusions lab scale th of was in temperature range of 130 170 c was carried out the following conclusions were drawn increase in biomethane potential of was 17 27 was accompanied by increase in refractory scod in return load 3 9 8 4 and dewaterability enhancement 12 30 reducing th temperature from 170 to 160 c decreased refractory scod by half while still benefiting from increase in biogas production by 19 and dewaterability enhancement by 20 reproducibility of zahn wellens results was not as good as that of bmp results which may be attributed to filtered samples with different particle sizes a conversion factor can be defined und used to predict the impact of th temperature on refractory scod in sludge liquor increase in effluent cod of a specific wwtp after th is dependent of its was production total volume flow rate and th temperature

18183,thermal hydrolysis th increases the anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge was but also refractory organic and nutrient return load to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp this could lead to an increase in effluent chemical oxygen demand cod of the wwtp the aim of this study was to investigate the trade off between increase in biogas production through th and anaerobic digestion and increase in refractory cod in dewatered sludge liquors at different temperatures of th in lab scale was was thermally hydrolyzed in temperature range of 130 170 c for 30 min to determine its biomethane potential bmp after bmp test sludge was dewatered and sludge liquor was aerated in zahn wellens test to determine its non biodegradable soluble cod known as refractory soluble cod scodref with increasing temperature in the range of 130 170 c bmp of was increased by 17 27 while scodref increased by 3 9 8 4 dewaterability was also enhanced through relative increase in cake solids by 12 30 a conversion factor was defined through mass balance to relate scodref to volatile solids of raw was based on the conversion factor expected increase in effluent cods of six wwtps in berlin were predicted to be in the range of 2 15 mg l after implementation of th at different temperatures it was concluded that with a slight decrease in temperature formation of scodref could be significantly reduced while still benefiting from a substantial increase in biogas production and dewaterability improvement graphical abstract image 1 keywords thermal hydrolysis biomethane potential zahn wellens test anaerobic digestion sludge liquor effluent cod 1 introduction the activated sludge process is the most widely used process for wastewater treatment throughout the world for its convenience and efficiency waste activated sludge was is the unfavorable byproduct of this process its handling and disposal accounts for up to 50 of operational costs on a wastewater treatment plant wwtp appels et al 2008 therefore it is profitable to reduce the amount of was as much as possible before disposal anaerobic digestion ad has established itself as an efficient way of reducing sludge with benefit of producing biogas as a renewable energy source appels et al 2008 however digestibility of was is limited due to its microbial structure whereas pretreatment processes are known to boost its ad barjenbruch and kopplow 2003 different physical chemical thermal and biological pretreatment methods have been investigated extensively for their potential effects on enhancing ad of was carlsson et al 2012 carrere et al 2010 2016 joo et al 2015 neumann et al 2016 tyagi and lo 2011 zhen et al 2017 amongst all thermal pretreatments have shown the highest potential when it comes to energy efficiency and integration on a wwtp cano et al 2015 fern√°ndez polanco and tatsumi 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 high temperature thermal pretreatment also known as thermal hydrolysis th has been commercialized and implemented in full scale globally as an established was pretreatment process barber 2016 th increases biogas production basically through solubilization of hardly biodegradable organic matter which in turn leads to increase in concentration of organic and inorganic substances in sludge liquors in practice sludge liquors are usually returned back to headworks of wwtp for retreatment return load part of this increased return load from was th nh 4 n po 4 3 p etc can be eliminated in the main treatment line without modification of the process steps albeit with increasing operational costs this part can also be recovered although installation of recovery units is needed mehta et al 2014 another part of return load referred to as dissolved organic part organic nitrogen phosphorus and carbon cannot be eliminated thoroughly in conventional treatment lines and poses a risk to impair wwtp effluent quality control parameters dwyer et al 2008 2009 gupta et al 2015 there is abundant research concerning ad enhancement after th over a wide range of temperatures many researchers have reported the optimum temperature of th to be in the range of 160 180 c regarding maximum biogas yield after which the anaerobic biodegradability decreases bjerg nielsen et al 2018 choi et al 2018 higgins et al 2017 jeong et al 2019 svensson et al 2018 most commercialized processes also operate th in the temperature range of 165 170 c nevertheless it has not yet been reported to which extent lower temperatures during th can mitigate the finally remaining refractory soluble chemical oxygen demand scodref scodref is a part of the soluble cod scod which is resistant to biological anaerobic and aerobic degradation and can lead to potential deterioration of wwtp effluent quality the aim of this study was to assess the effect of decreasing usual temperature of th on biogas yield of was and on the following aerobic biodegradability of its centrates in a series of batch tests consequently a conversion factor was defined which can be used to predict the effect of th temperature on effluent cod increase of a wwtp data of six wwtps in berlin and conversion factor were used to show their potential effluent cod increase after th implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge thickened was was obtained from a large wwtp in berlin operated with pre denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr was was stored at 4 c in refrigerator no longer than two days before the tests the characteristics of was are summarized in table 1 the required aerobic inoculum for zahn wellens test was collected from the aerated activated sludge tanks and anaerobic inoculum for biomethane potential test from the anaerobic sludge digestion tanks 2 2 procedure of the experiments the procedure of the experiments carried out is shown in fig 1 first was was thermally hydrolyzed and subsequently anaerobically digested to determine its biogas yield in the next step the digestate was dewatered and the supernatant was used for the zahn wellens test each step is described in detail in the following 2 2 1 high temperature thermal hydrolysis th was carried out with a lab scale rig cambi group as norway see fig s1 the rig included a steam generating unit a reactor and a flash tank thickened was was hydrolyzed at desired temperatures and related pressures by injecting vapor into the 1 l volume reactor it was followed by an abrupt pressure relief through an orifice into a flash chamber steam explosion to maximize the breakdown of the microbial cell structures th time was fixed on 30 min and time was recorded as soon as the reactor reached the desired temperature th temperature was varied from 130 c to 170 c within 10 c intervals th130 th140 th150 th160 and th170 for each temperature the whole test series shown in fig 1 were run two times after each test the test rig was cleaned with water for 30 min at 170 c to wash out the remainders of the previous th of was 2 2 2 biomethane potential test an automatic test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden was used to measure biomethane potential bmp inoculum to substrate ratio isr of 2 based on volatile solids vs content was chosen and kept constant throughout the tests to avoid volatile fatty acids vfa inhibition and to check the kinetics 500 ml bottles were filled with inoculum and sludge and flushed with nitrogen gas for 1 min to assure anaerobic conditions intermittent automatic mixing 30 s on off was applied to all bottles with speed adjustment set on 30 the tests were run under mesophilic temperature of 37 c 1 until daily methane production was below 1 percent of total volume of methane produced holliger et al 2016 the system included intermediate absorption of co2 and h2s using a solution of naoh 3 m in order that only methane volume is finally measured and recorded activity of anaerobic inoculum was checked through parallel incubating of microcrystalline cellulose cas number 9004 34 6 anaerobic inoculum was also incubated separately to determine its endogenous methane production tests were always run in triplicate 2 2 3 dewaterability test samples of digestate were centrifuged at 25000 g for 30 min avanti j e beckman coulter the sludge cakes were separated and used for determination of total solids ts according to standard methods apha and wpcf 1998 dwa 2008 in order to have same samples for duplicate ts measurements the cakes were cut in half vertically 2 2 4 zahn wellens test anaerobically digested sludge after the bmp tests was filtered with polyester filters and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was taken as test substance centrate for zahn wellens test procedures of oecd guideline 302 b were followed empa 1992 aerobic inoculum was washed three times with tap water to reduce the amount of inherent scod before mixing with the samples to check the activity of the inoculum and the validity of the test biodegradability of ethylene glycol cas number 107 21 1 as a reference compound was always monitored and checked in parallel moreover the aerobic inoculum was aerated separately to determine its inherent scodref the mineral medium was prepared before the start of the test and included the nutrients described in standard procedure empa 1992 1 l volume bottles were used for the test in which 500 ml of mineral medium was always mixed with a suitable amount of inoculum and test substance and filled up to 1 l the bottles were placed in an incubator set at 22 1 c and aerated for 28 days using two sets of laboratory air pumps continuous mixing was provided by magnetic stirrers ph value was regularly adjusted to 7 0 0 1 using naoh 3 0 m and hcl 3 0 m the loss of water in the bottles due to evaporation was always compensated with deionized water before taking samples tests were run in duplicate and biodegradation was monitored by scod measurement 2 3 analytics total solids ts and vs were determined using the guidelines of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha and wpcf 1998 ph was measured using a hach lange multimeter hq40d model intellical probes total cod tcod total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn were determined after proper dilution of the sample by photometric measurements using test cuvettes hach lange dr 5000 to measure soluble cod scod

and sinks of scodref during experiments in this study are shown in fig 2 ultimately remaining scod after zahn wellens test was measured and defined as scodref afterwards inherent scodref fraction of aerobic inoculum blank was deduced from it based on mixing fractions due to mixing of was with anaerobic inoculum during bmp tests anaerobic inoculum was also incubated separately in zahn wellens test to determine its inherent scodref subsequently a parameter named conversion factor cf was defined which can be used to estimate the amount of remaining scodref in centrate after aerobic degradation i e in effluent of an activated sludge tank based on the total amount of vs in was fed to the anaerobic digestors see fig 1 this factor is also useful for comparison of the effect of different th temperatures on formation of scodref and its potential impact on the wwtp effluent quality first cf for anaerobic inoculum was defined as following 8 c f a n i n o s c o d r e f v s i n 100 cf an ino conversion factor for anaerobic inoculum scod ref g fraction of scod remaining after zahn wellens test of anaerobic inoculum vs in g fraction of vs of anaerobic inoculum fed into bmp test bottles

test bottles scod ref s g fraction of scod remaining after zahn wellens test of was or thermally hydrolyzed was at different temperatures with anaerobic inoculum vs an ino s g fraction of vs of anaerobic inoculum fed into bmp test bottles of was or thermally hydrolyzed was at different temperatures vs was chosen instead of cod here because cod measurements of thickened was are not as accurate and common as of vs in practice 2 4 5 modelling the effect of thermal hydrolysis on the effluent cod of wwtps residual scod in effluent of a wwtp without ad of sludge originates from different external sources including also industrial wastewater ad of sludge is an internal source of scodref which increases cod concentration in the wwtp effluent through the return load by implementing th of was before ad another contributor of scodref is added in the process scheme influent volume rate of a wwtp equals its effluent volume rate therefore daily production of was in relation to daily wastewater flow of the wwtp determines the potential increase of effluent scod by th implementation using conversion factors of th from this study and knowing was productions and volume flow rates of wwtps the potential increase in effluent scod at these wwtps can be predicted for different th temperatures first was production as vs per unit volume of influent is calculated by using the following equation 11 s w a s p v s w a s q 10 6 swasp g m¬≥ specific was production vs was t d daily was production as vs q m3 d daily volume flow rate of wwtp then by having swasp and cf scod increase in effluent of the wwtps after implementing ad or ad preceded by th of was at different temperatures are calculated as following 12 s c o d e f f i n c c f i 100 s w a s p scod eff inc mg l increase in effluent scod 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature on solubilization of cod p o 4 3 p and n h 4 n ph ts and vs ts ratio of was and hydrolyzed was are shown in fig 3 a with increasing temperature of th between 130 and 170 c in 10 c intervals ph decreases from 6 10 to 5 98 5 89 5 79 5 50 and 5 35 after th respectively reduction of ph is mainly due to release of organic acids from microbial structure bougrier et al 2008 jeong et al 2019 wilson and novak 2009 xue et al 2015 with increasing temperature of th more vapor needs to be injected into the reactor which resulted in reduction of ts from 7 20 to 4 62 4 69 3 88 4 40 and 3 87 for respective temperatures on the contrary vs ts ratio did not change significantly ranging from 79 62 to 80 32 showing almost no loss of organic content during th at the tested temperatures jo et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b sdcod increased with increasing temperature from 130 to 170 c within 10 c intervals from 20 6 to 23 4 29 3 35 5 and 41 5 this is also in accordance with results of jeong et al 2019 which reported 15 40 increase in sdcod moreover wilson and novak 2009 showed increase of sdcod from 8 0 up to 21 4 for was hydrolyzed at 130 200 c there is an agreement in literature that with increasing temperature of th sdcod constantly increases in this temperature range barber 2016 pilli et al 2014 with increase in th temperature from 130 to 170 c sdpo4 p similarly increased from 21 9 to 27 7 31 9 41 0 and 43 1 respectively fig 3c laurent et al 2011 also reported an increase of orthophosphate from 29 to 50 mg l with th at 170 c due to the fact that was was taken from a wwtp with ebpr in this study it was concluded that solubilized orthophosphate increased during th through destruction of orthophosphate bonds of phospholipids in cell membranes release of orthophosphate after th of ebpr was could be regarded as the first step of a potential solution to the problem of struvite precipitation in digesters pipelines and subsequent equipment when chemically precipitated and separated after th and before digestion it could reduce maintenance costs related to removing incrustations or lower consumption of the costly anti scalant chemicals which are currently applied to hinder precipitation processes in digesters heinzmann and engel 2006 kuroda et al 2002 liao et al 2003 takiguchi et al 2004 sdnh4 n was negligible 1 for all th temperatures from 130 to 170 c fig 3d this is in agreement with xue et al 2015 who reported no significant increase of nh 4 n after th at temperatures of 120 180 c for 30 min treatment time however according to their study nh 4 n drastically increased in higher temperatures 160 c when combined with longer treatment time 30 min similarly jeong et al 2019 showed a very slight increase of nh 4 n for temperatures of 100 160 c followed by a sharp increase for temperatures above 180 c up to 220 c wilson and novak 2009 also reported increase of total ammonia nitrogen tan from 100 mg l up to 250 mg l for th of was at 170 c similarly the release percentage was also intensified in their study by increasing temperature to 190 and 220 c resulting in increase of tan to 650 and 900 mg l respectively they clearly showed that in spite of significant solubilization of proteins in temperature range of 130 170 c tan release intensified above 170 c all of these results show that ammonification of organic nitrogen in was could also occur non biologically although at severe th conditions longer th time or higher temperature 3 2 effect of temperature on the biomethane potential bmp of microcrystalline cellulose was 344 9 nml g vsadded which was consistent with the values reported in literature raposo et al 2011 this proved the activity of anaerobic inoculum and validity of the gas measurements specific methane production of was and hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 150 and 170 c are depicted in fig 4 a as illustrative examples of gas production curves kinetically observed despite a total increase in specific methane production through pretreatment the time needed for sludge to reach the ultimate specific methane production did not change significantly the percentage of daily specific methane production to the ultimate specific methane production is presented in fig 4b as it could be seen the rate of methane production increases from the start until the day 2 and then decreases continually until the end of the test however for the th temperature of 170 c and to a lesser intensity for 150 c there was another increase of methane production rate at the day 5 until the day 7 after which it decreased again this effect could be attributed to two probable reasons first higher th temperatures 150 c could cause an increase in formation of more slowly biodegradable compounds which need more time to be hydrolyzed and broken down to favorable substrates another reason could be the increase of vfas caused by higher release of available substrates at higher th temperatures jeong et al 2019 xue et al 2015 that could potentially lead to partial and temporary inhibition of methanogens during the first methane production peak pratt et al 2012 consequently this partial inhibition is mitigated as soon as vfas are converted which is followed by a second peak of methane production rate bmp absolute values as well as bmp percentage increases of thermally hydrolyzed was in comparison to was without th at different temperatures are shown in fig 4c overall reproducibility of absolute bmp results was good between duplicate experiments for each temperature variation 10 while bmp of was was 212 nml g vsadded bmp of thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c increased to 253 247 255 250 and 274 nml g vsadded respectively even at the lowest th temperature of 130 c an increase of bmp up to 17 1 was achieved compared to the was without th by further increasing the temperature of th from 140 to 170 c bmp increased by 17 4 21 0 18 9 and 27 1 respectively svensson et al 2018 reported 18 bmp increase of thermally hydrolyzed digested sludge in temperature range of 153 175 c with negligible change in the range of 134 153 c jeong et al 2019 studied thermal hydrolysis of was with different ts values between 1 and 7 in temperature range of 100 220 c and reported maximum biomethane yield at temperature of 180 c higgins et al 2017 reported 6 increase in bmp of mixed sludge with increases of th temperature from 130 to 170 c they also reviewed several studies which have reported increase of bmp for was or mixed sludge until a threshold in temperature 160 180 c after which it declined this has been reported to be due to reaction of simple sugars with amino acids and production of melanoidins through maillard reactions at higher temperatures dwyer et al 2008 vsr increased from 42 8 for was without th to 50 8 50 7 51 2 50 3 and 55 1 for thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c fig 4d therefore in comparison to was without th vsr increased by 18 7 18 4 19 6 17 5 and 28 6 for thermally hydrolyzed was at respective temperatures 3 3 effect of temperature on dewaterability of digested sludge results of dewaterability tests are shown in fig 5 the final ts of was after ad was 14 28 while with increasing th temperature from 130 to 170 c ts in cake increased constantly from 15 98 to 18 58 making 12 30 relative increase higgins et al 2017 also reported constant increase in dewaterability of mixed sludge from 27 to 32 in cake solids an increase of 18 5 within temperature range of 130 170 c dewaterability plays a decisive role on disposal costs as it directly deals with amount of water which is bound to flocs of mechanically dewatered sludge the most important cost saving by implementation of th comes from disposal costs reduction due to dewaterability improvement 3 4 effect of temperature on refractory soluble cod scod elimination percentage during the zahn wellens test for reference substance ethylene glycol centrates of digested was and thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 150 and 170 c are shown as illustrative examples in fig 6 a the reference substance was always degraded 99 in less than 7 days which proved good activity of aerobic inoculum and hence the validity of all tests for other samples curves of scod elimination split into two separate phases during the first 7 days of the test scod concentration increased as shown by negative elimination degrees which could probably be attributed to a higher rate of hydrolysis of particulate cod into scod in comparison to the parallel elimination rate of scod afterwards scod elimination starts to increase continuously until the end of the test in this period scod elimination outpaces hydrolysis of particulate cod cod of organic substances greater than 0 45 Œºm into scod at the end of the aerobic biodegradability test period scod elimination rate diminished as described in section 2 4 4 a conversion factor cf was defined to relate mass of scodref after zahn wellens test to vs input mass into bmp bottles the mass balance through bmp and zahn wellens tests based on input and output concentrations volumes and fractions is presented in table 2 for further clarification moreover the final cf average values are shown in fig 6b reproducibility of absolute zahn wellens results and related cf was not as good as that of bmp results a reason for that might be having filtered samples with remaining particles of different sizes after filtration process of digested sludge before starting zahn wellens test in other words having more identical filtered samples after dewatering could lead to better reproducibility since the zahn wellens test is a well reproducible test per se empa 1992 one issue to bear in mind is that samples should at best represent the properties of centrate of dewatering machines on the wwtp to have the best prediction results as shown in fig 6b the cf increased from 2 6 for was to 3 94 4 26 3 62 5 08 and 8 42 for thermally hydrolyzed was at temperatures of 130 170 c respectively this corresponded to a 51 2 63 5 39 1 95 1 and 223 4 increase in cf for thermally hydrolyzed was at respective temperatures in comparison to was without th the colors of the samples before and after bmp tests for different temperatures are displayed in fig s2 intensification of color with th temperature for samples after bmp tests was obviously noticeable fig s2b moreover the relative increase of cf and bmp for th temperatures of 130 170 c is shown in fig 6c stepwise increase of bmp and cf with increase in temperature clearly shows that there is a trade off between biogas increase and refractory scod increase interestingly by lowering the th temperature from 170 to 160 c the cf increase dropped from 223 to 95 while bmp increase dropped only from 27 to 19 both parameters were fitted to exponential models the results of this fitting are presented in table 3 percentage increase of cf versus percentage increase of bmp in temperature range of 130 170 c is shown in fig 6d there are no quite similar studies to which the results of this section can be compared however higgins et al 2017 reported effluent scod of anaerobic digesters fed with thermally hydrolyzed mixed sludge to be 12 5 to 9 0 g l in temperature range of 130 170 c in another study by dwyer et al 2008 scod of thermally hydrolyzed mixed sludge after digestion in th temperature range of 140 165 c was 7 11 g l none of them carried out an aerobic biodegradability test similar to what was done in this study it should be noted that the inocula used in bmp and zahn wellens tests of this study were not adapted to thermally hydrolyzed sludge batch tests in other words a potential positive adaptation effect of the biomass over time could not be simulated in this study this aspect needs continuous biological tests over a longer period of time 3 5 modelling the effect of thermal hydrolysis on effluent cod of six wwtps in berlin the relationship between different values of swasp defined in section 2 4 5 and increase in effluent cod of wwtps using cfs calculated in section 3 3 is shown in fig 7 a equation 12 was used to depict these graphs as shown increase in effluent cod of a wwtp is dependent of its swasp the implementation of ad or th ad and the th temperature to make use of these results actual data from six wwtps in berlin was obtained to predict the effect of th temperature on their effluent cod increase see table 4 swasp for these wwtps lies in the range of 141 251 g m¬≥ effect of th temperature on effluent cod increase of these six wwtps is shown in fig 7b a higher swasp more was production per inflow volume unit leads to a higher increase in effluent cod after th implementation however swasp and th temperature are not the only determining factors yet when considering implementation of th since each wwtp has its own unique effluent cod concentration before th determined mainly by its inflow composition and process different final effluent cods are to be expected with th looking again at table 4 although the order of swasp follows wwtp6 wwtp5 wwtp4 wwtp3 wwtp2 wwtp1 the order of predicted final effluent cod with th is wwtp4 wwtp3 wwtp2 wwtp6 wwtp5 wwtp1 due to the actual effluent cod before th accordingly effluent cod of a wwtp before implementing th its swasp temperature of th and the regional cod discharge limit should be taken into account when considering suitability of th for a specific region or plant it should be noted that other controlled effluent quality parameters such as tn tp etc could also be affected by th but were not the focus of this study to the best of the authors knowledge there is no distinctive literature available regarding the increase of effluent cod after th implementation for a comparison to the results of this study however a technical report of the german association of water and wastewater dwa on sewage sludge disintegration estimates roughly 5 mg l or 10 increase in effluent cod load for th implementation at usual temperatures 165 c according to full scale experience dwa 2016 this is within the range of the results of the current study 4 conclusions lab scale th of was in temperature range of 130 170 c

of zahn wellens results was not as good as that of bmp results which may be attributed to filtered samples with different particle sizes a conversion factor can be defined und used to predict the

18184,excessive addition of nitrogen n has threatened aquatic ecosystems for decades traditional water quality and biological monitoring assessment tools are widely used for monitoring nutrient loads and ecosystem health but most of these methods cannot distinguish between different types and sources of pollution this is a challenge particularly when dealing with non point sources of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into freshwater systems recent laboratory studies using stable isotopic ratios Œ¥15n and c n of aquatic macrophytes duckweed spirodela spp have shown successful differentiation and mapping between different n sources and further showed abilities to act as early warning indicators for environmental n loading therefore the aim of this study was to field test the potential of stable isotopic values of transplanted spirodela spp to map temporal and spatial n loading variation and determine the main sources of n loading in two river systems in the eastern cape province of south africa using previously grown isotopically calibrated and transplanted spirodela plants collected over a 13 month sampling period nitrogen isotopic values Œ¥15n of spirodela plants traced environmental n loading and identified pollution hotspots and sources through time and space over a wide range of nutrient gradients Œ¥15n isotopic values of spirodela spp provided detailed dynamics on n loading therefore supporting its utilisation in the biological monitoring of ecosystem health and the early detection of eutrophication in freshwater systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords anthropogenic nitrogen inputs eutrophication generalised least squares models nutrient loading hot spots transplanted spirodela species 1 introduction the global nitrogen cycle has been substantially altered by humans over the past century camargo and alonso 2006 expanding populations have led to a higher demand for food causing a spike in industrialisation and the production of synthetic crop

1998 howarth et al 2000 rabalais 2002 erisman et al 2013 thus in addition to natural sources of nutrients i e leaching and atmospheric deposition ohte 2012 aquatic ecosystems are often subject to anthropogenic nitrogen inputs through point and non point sources vitousek et al 1997 carpenter et al 1998 howarth et al 2000 rabalais 2002 camargo and alonso 2006 erisman et al 2013 moreover anthropogenic inputs of particulate and organic nitrogen can further result in inorganic n pollution smil 2001 in addition to being a direct threat to human consumers who 2011 high levels of nitrogen in water are now also acknowledged to be one of the primary drivers of aquatic ecosystem degradation i e cabana and rasmussen 1996 smil 1999 howarth et al 2000 anderson et al 2002 galloway and cowling 2002 rabalais 2002 excessive nitrogen loads damage organismal capacity for survival growth and reproduction camargo and alonso 2006 and the eutrophication resulting from elevated n loads can have myriad knock on effects on ecosystem functioning these include reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations increased turbidity an increase in toxic algal blooms massive organismal die offs and in some cases promotes alien aquatic weed invasions rabalais 2002 camargo and alonso 2006 selman et al 2008 coetzee and hill 2012 erisman et al 2013 traditionally the assessment of eutrophication and aquatic ecosystem health has been achieved through methods such as direct nutrient assays chapman 1992 monitoring heavy metal concentrations fatoki and awofolu 2003 de villiers 2007 and microbial assemblages xu et al 2011 seanego and moyo 2013 and investigating taxonomic changes in the abundance of aquatic biota kleynhans 1999 usseglio polatera et al 2000 taylor et al 2007 loomer et al 2014 aazami et al

system sass5 chutter 1994 dickens and graham 2002 however most of these methods typically reflect eutrophication problems only once ecosystem level effects have already manifested moreover it is often not possible to link changes in biota to specific forms of disturbance particularly where pollutants originate from non point sources fry 2006 jona lasinio et al 2015 any methods that would allow detection of incipient eutrophication and permit mapping of n loading and n hot spots in the natural environment would greatly add to our ability to successfully manage freshwater resources recent studies have suggested stable isotopic values of macrophytes as reliable indicators of n loading in marine ecosystems potentially providing early indications of eutrophication i e cohen and fong 2005 costanzo et al 2001 2005 deutsch and voss 2006 inglett and reddy 2006 dailer et al 2010 schubert et al 2013 the Œ¥15n 15n 14n in per mil notation isotopic value of a macrophyte is determined by a combination of the isotopic composition of the nitrogen source and the physiological fractionation of the plant tissue heaton 1986 hobson and clark 1992 kendall 1998 costanzo et al 2001 plants assimilating nitrogen from synthetic fertilisers for example received through agricultural run off will have Œ¥15n values that reflect the atmospheric n2 source of the fertiliser 2 to 2 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 curt et al 2004 comparatively plants assimilating nitrogen from treated sewage or manure have more enriched values isotopically heavier because colonising bacteria preferentially process the lighter 14n isotope leading to an overall enrichment in the Œ¥15n isotopic value of the remaining waste typically 10 to 25 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 curt et al 2004 hill et al 2012 morrissey et al 2013 loomer et al 2014 using stable isotopic analysis sia costanzo et al 2001 pioneered a sewage plume mapping analysis that used macroalgal Œ¥15n values to map the concentration and spatial spread of sewage inputs in moreton bay australia a second study by costanzo et al 2005 after substantial wastewater infrastructure upgrades showed a large reduction in nitrogen concentrations and spatial extent of sewage inputs demonstrating that mapping anthropogenic n loading using Œ¥15n values of macrophytes can provide ecologists and environmental managers with an assessment tool for intensive eutrophication monitoring in aquatic ecosystems Œ¥15n values can thus provide a time integrated assessment of n loading at sites with the potential to identify problems and ultimate n sources before ecosystem degradation takes place hill et al 2012 rather than spot analyses of nutrients which may be affected by variable nutrient discharge and flow regime in a river system with the current global shortage of clean freshwater pahl wostl et al 2013 developing a similar sewage plume mapping analyses for freshwater ecosystems is warranted however there is some evidence to suggest that isotope fractionation in aquatic plants may vary strongly between species aberle and malzahn 2007 and thus species specific baseline data is a pre requisite to successfully using this method in a natural setting duckweeds spirodela sp are the world smallest and simplest floating macrophytes and have a wide natural distribution excluding polar regions and deserts hill et al 2012 the main form of reproduction is vegetative through the production of daughter plants and growth is known to be explosive under high levels on nutrients and light goopy and murray 2003 recently a baseline laboratory study using the floating duckweed spirodela spp freshwater macrophytes a combination of spirodela polyrrhiza and spirodela punctata was undertaken which showed that duckweed Œ¥15n values clearly reflect environmental n loading distinguishing between different n types i e ammonia nh3 and nitrate no3 within 4 10 days of exposure plant tissue also showed depleted and enriched isotopic values with increasing concentrations of no3 and nh3 respectively hill et al 2012 using a combination of stable isotope methods and nutrient uptake identifiers i e c n ratios spirodela plants are therefore potentially useful for isotopic monitoring in freshwater systems under long term continuous nutrient inputs hill et al 2012 with the laboratory baseline validated and established for spirodela duckweed see hill et al 2012 follow up field testing is required to confirm the applicability of this method in a natural freshwater environment thus the following research aimed to present a case study to evaluate the ability of Œ¥15n isotopic values of transplanted spirodela spp assemblages to 1 map spatiotemporal n loading dynamics and 2 identify n loading hot spots and nitrogen concentrations in the surface water across a well defined nutrient gradient on two freshwater river systems in the eastern cape province of south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at 19 sites located on two river systems in the eastern cape south africa fig 1 a and b nine sites on the bloukrans kowie river system sites a1 a9 fig 1c and ten sites on the bushmans new year s river system sites b1 b10 fig 1d together the bloukrans kowie and the bushmans new year s river systems flow directly into the south eastern coastal belt of south africa situated within the kowie thicket biome at an altitudinal range of 0 700 m above sea level allanson et al 1990 and with an annual rainfall of 545 mm south african weather service over the study period described below august 2013 august 2014 the bloukrans kowie river system drains the majority of the grahamstown area and surrounding game farms and agricultural lands eady et al 2013 dalu et al 2014 the kowie river system is about 70 km in length flowing through relatively undisturbed habitats that are largely forest thickets and game farms the heavily disturbed bloukrans river is a tributary of the kowie barber james et al 2003 and flows easterly through the urban formal and informal settlement areas of grahamstown into the belmont valley where it is subjected to water abstraction for farm irrigation slaughter 2011 inputs from sewerage facilities belmont valley sewerage treatment works bvstws and run off from agricultural lands barber james et al 2003 eady et al 2013 fig 1c the bloukrans river meets the kowie river upstream of hollingrove game farm site a9 and then flows down to the indian ocean at the town of port alfred the bloukrans kowie river system sites were chosen to cover a range of pollution gradients six impacted sites on the bloukrans river a1 a6 two largely natural sites on the upper reaches of the kowie river a7 and a8 and one site after the confluence of the bloukrans and kowie rivers a9 fig 1c comparatively the bushmans river system drains a catchment area of 2700 km2 and is about 293 km long passing through the easterly region of alicedale heydorn and grindley 1982 vromans et al 2012 the new year s river is a tributary joining the bushmans river system at alicedale and then flowing down to the indian ocean at kenton on sea fig 1d the bushmans new year s river system drains most of the surrounding areas including the urban and rural alicedale settlements neighbouring game farms nature reserves and golf courses i e bushman sands nature reserve bushman sands golf course the system is reported to be heavily disturbed gambiza and palmer 2004 with inputs from sewerage settling ponds the failing alicedale sewerage treatment works astws and golf course fertilisers from the banks of the new year s river and it is also subjected to water abstraction on the bushmans whitfield 2005 above the confluence of the bushmans and new year s rivers ten sites were chosen on this system over a range of pollution gradients one relatively undisturbed site upstream of new year s dam b1 six impacted sites on the new year s river below the dam wall b2 b3 b5 adjacent to b4 the sewerage settling pond and within the bushman sands golf course grounds b6 b7 one site on the bushmans river above the confluence also relatively undisturbed b8 and two sites after the bushman new year river confluence b9 b10 fig 1d although site b4 was not directly connected to the river Œ¥15n and c n ratios for plants assimilating sewage were considered be to extremely useful for mapping and are included in the study design 2 2 experimental design to identify nutrient loading at 19 field sites along two river systems this study compared Œ¥15n and c n ratios of duckweed spirodela plant species which were originally transplanted from the laboratory to each field site plants were then allowed to grow for a minimum of 10 days and samples were collected monthly from august 2013 until august 2014 prior to field transplantation a stock population of the spirodela spp a combination of spirodela polyrrhiza and spirodela punctata was grown following a modified version of the protocol from hill et al 2012 briefly fresh spirodela spp was grown in two 20l tubs at the waainek mass rearing research facility rhodes university grahamstown

consisting of clear polyethylene containers 250 ml with small holes punched through the walls to ensure water flow each cage was fitted with two high density foam floats to allow the cages to float on the water surface at the beginning of august 2013 45 g of stock spirodela plants grown at the waainek mass rearing research facility were added to each cage and five cages were deployed and allowed to float on top of the water column at each site within each river system cages were attached with string to submerged cement weights to prevent drifting on site whenever necessary floating cages were washed to remove dirt and algae repaired and refilled with plants throughout the study 3 data collection 3 1 physicochemical variables water quality variables were recorded at each site between 12h00

2012 hill 2014 overall averages of the 13 month in situ Œ¥15n and c n ratios were mapped with bubble plots to show the spatial extent of n loading and identify n hot spots on each river system to

however variables did not consistently contribute significantly to models assessed here using student s t test which is likely because the environmental variables were measured at discrete times and do not integrate the state of the system over the time period which duckweed was grown therefore models were simplified to the two main fixed effects models were fitted for each system with site and

where more than one candidate model existed aic and bic were used to select a single model for each river system and to compare candidate models burnham and anderson 2002 supplemental material models were validated by assessing normalised standardised model residuals rather than ordinary residuals because of the variation structure for each model normalised residuals were tested for normality and variance homogeneity supplemental material figs 1 4 model predictions were compared between sites using tukey hsd pairwise comparisons and plotted in compact letter designation values with like

situ Œ¥15n and c n isotopic ratios of spirodela plants clearly illustrated distinct spatial and temporal patterns in the natural environment on both the bloukrans kowie and bushmans new year s river systems over the 13 month sampling period fig 2 while eutrophication was evident at all sites on the bloukrans river tributary over the entire sampling period a pronounced sewage manure plume Œ¥15n 10

june and august 2014 fertiliser inputs 2 00 Œ¥15n 2 00 and c n ratios 15 00 into the bloukrans river were minimal with isolated events in the upper reaches site a1 in june july 2014 site a2 in april 2014 and june july 2014 comparatively spirodela plants transplanted on the kowie river showed the system to be largely natural with some evidence of nutrient limitation site a8 2 00 Œ¥15n 10 00 and 5 c n ratios 25 the bloukrans river system showed elevated water nutrient concentrations in one or both nitrate and ammonia from site a1 nh3 5 96 mg l no3 1 86 mg l which was downstream of grahamstown urban and formal settlements to site a2 nh3 12 17 mg l no3 3 98 mg l situated further downstream from site a1 and below the bvstws sewerage outfall site a2 recorded the highest mean nitrate and ammonia concentrations throughout the bloukrans kowie river system august 2013 and october 2013 recorded the highest nitrate and ammonia mean concentrations throughout the 13 month sampling period respectively downstream of site a2 a decrease in average water nutrient concentration was observed when moving further downstream the bloukrans river from sites a3 nh3 7 49 mg l no3 2 13 mg l a4 nh3 4 37 mg l no3 1 60 mg l and site a5 nh3 1 08 mg l no3 0 31 mg l with a slight increase at site a6 nh3 3 07 mg l no3 1 79 mg l which likely integrated the urban sewage outfall and agricultural runoff activities within the bloukrans river tributary the kowie river system upstream site a7 nh3 2 48 mg l no3 1 37 mg l was moderately enriched compared to the downstream site a8 nh3 0 53 mg l no3 0 18 mg l site a8 was the least nutrient impacted site in the bloukrans kowie river system throughout the study site a9 nh3 1 51 mg l no3 0 84 mg l after the confluence of the bloukrans and kowie river systems recorded minimum to moderate water nutrient enrichment fig 4 a the new year s river tributary transplanted spirodela plants Œ¥15n and c n isotopic ratios showed minimal n enrichment relative to the bloukrans kowie system with eutrophication present at fewer sites and on a smaller scale fig 2c 2d and 3b a sewage manure plume was evident at sites b3 b4 and b5 between august 2013 march 2014 and site b4 displayed extremely enriched Œ¥15n values between november 2013 february 2014 smaller isolated events were also observed at site b2 february march 2014 and sites b3 and b4 august 2014 fertiliser inputs into the new year s river were effectively absent with one exception site b2 in july 2014 spirodela plants transplanted in the bushman river showed minimal sewage manure inputs site b8 november december 2013 n limitation was more prevalent in the bushmans new year s system both in some new year s tributary see sites b1 b6 and b7 and confluence sites see sites b9 and b10 mean nitrate concentrations were higher in the bushmans new year s river system relative to ammonia opposite to the trend in the bloukrans kowie river system ammonia concentration was low range 0 15 0 38 mg l for the majority of sites i e sites b1 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 except at sites b4 sewage settling pond 2 77 mg l and both sites b3 0 98 mg l and b5 0 71 mg l which were adjacent to the sewage settling pond an elevated ammonia concentration was observed at site b2 1 29 mg l which was upstream site b3 and below the dam wall nitrate concentration was different between sites showing three tiers of concentrations site b1 b5 and b8 were least enriched 1st tier range 0 25 1 08 mg l sites b2 b3 b7 b9 and b10 were moderately enriched 2nd tier range 1 25 1 97 mg l and sites b4 and b6 were highly enriched 3rd tier range 2 19 mg l 2 93 mg l fig 4b based on 13 month averages of spirodela Œ¥15n and c n ratios seven persistent n loading hotspots Œ¥15n 10 00 and c n 15 00 were identified on the bloukrans kowie river a1 a6 and a9 figs 2a and 3a and five on the bushmans new year s river b3 b4 b5 b8 b9 figs 2b and 3b predicted Œ¥15n and c n ratios for each system follow this trend support the trends described for n loading on the contour plot and the hot spots plot and predict well the raw monthly averages figs 4 and 5 the bloukrans river showed variable predicted n loading in three tiers fig 4a sites a1 and a8 are not significantly different in Œ¥15n and these sites are in the lower tier the second tier includes sites a2 a5 a6 a7 and a9 but these sites represent a transition between less nutrient rich sites in the lower tier and sites a3 and a4 in the upper tier sites a3 and a4 in particular are significantly different from all other sites and each other fig 5 in general the kowie river site a1 and a8 shows limited nutrient enrichment compared with the rest of the bloukrans kowie river system sites trends in nh3 and no3 tend to follow predicted Œ¥15n except for sites a3 a4 and a9 with higher concentrations in sites a1 and a2 and lower concentrations in sites a5 a8 fig 4a predicted c n ratios show an increasing trend moving downstream in the bloukrans river with site a8 in the kowie river significantly greater than all other sites in this system monthly trends show an increase from august 2013 to january 2014 then a declining trend to july 2014 and predict well the raw site averages fig 5a a cyclic pattern is apparent in both months and sites and both raw and predicted values have high variability more so in sites when both site and month trends are taken in concert they reflect the patterns in the contour plots for example high predicted Œ¥15n values in sites a2 a4 from october 2013 to march 2014 agree strongly with the contour plot fig 2a the sewerage settling pond site b4 adjacent to the bushmans new year s river system had the greatest 15n enrichment but was not significantly different from its nearest sites b3 and b5 moreover no sites were statistically different fig 4c in general the bushmans new year s river system sites fell into two tiers the lower tier included sites b1 b2 b6 b7 and b10 all of which were on the new year s river except site b10 all sites in this lower tier were below the nitrogen hotspot threshold excluding site b4 because it was not within the river c n ratios were basically similar i e many overlapping or non significantly different sites both nh3 and no3 on the bushmans new year s river had lower concentrations relative to raw or predicted values than the bloukrans kowie river still concentrations from b1 b4 increased and a general decrease was observed from b6 b10 this pattern roughly followed the raw and predicted values fig 4c the bushmans new year s river system followed a similar temporal pattern to the bloukrans kowie river system with increasing Œ¥15n from august 2013 to march 2014 followed by a decrease and reaching lower values until the cyclic trend repeats fig 5c as with the bloukrans kowie river system high variability among sites contributes to increased variability monthly values reflected in overlapping standard errors fig 5 with the exceptions of sites a1 a3 predicted c n ratios for both bloukrans kowie and the bushmans new year s river systems were roughly inverse in relation to predicted nitrogen isotopic values this supports the nutrient limitation and enrichment as seen in the contour plots and hotspot maps fig 4b and 4d 5 discussion intensive field applications of the sewage plume mapping technique using transplanted spirodela spp calibrated against the baselines described by hill et al 2012 clearly resolved temporal and spatial dynamics of n loading in both the bloukrans kowie and bushmans new year s river systems using Œ¥15n and c n ratios of spirodela plants while all sites on the bloukrans river tributary experienced varying levels of eutrophication throughout the year an intense sewage manure plume was evident over a period of about 8 months stemming from site a2 and moving downriver this excessive n loading was almost certainly a reflection of treated sewage inputs from the bvstws located just upriver of site a2 and was exacerbated by agricultural manure runoff from the local dairy pineapple and cabbage farms found between sites a2 a3 and a3 a4 spot analyses of inorganic salts and south african scoring system sass biomonitoring scores have previously reported the bloukrans river tributary to be severely disturbed de moor et al 2002 barber james et al 2003 haigh et al 2008 and Œ¥15n and c n ratios have shown these pollution events to be associated with anthropogenic nutrient inputs sewage out fall and or manure runoff and were temporally variable with irregular pulses of sewage and runoff this was also confirmed in part by anecdotal observations and communications with both farmers and municipalities s motitsoe and j hill pers comm between makana and alicedale municipalities and the kowie catchment campaign kcc while the kowie river was shown to be comparatively oligotrophic the nitrogen inputs from the upper reaches of the bloukrans river tributary extended tens of kilometres downstream impacting water quality at sites after the confluence of the bloukrans and kowie rivers average Œ¥15n and c n ratios of spirodela plants grown within this system identified six nitrogen hotspots which are likely to suffer from ecosystem degradation and should be tagged for management interest with decreasing importance from site a2 the new year s river tributary was relatively more oligotrophic than the bloukrans river tributary with eutrophication present at fewer sites and extending out on a smaller spatial scale a sewage manure plume with less enriched Œ¥15n values was apparent here for about 8 months centered directly around the alicedale sewerage settling pond astws b4 while the sewerage settling pond is not directly connected to the river system the adjacent river sites upstream and downstream of the settling pond demonstrated concurrently enriched Œ¥15n values suggesting the likelihood of groundwater seepage from b4 or because of overtopping events supporting local reports of failing sewerage infrastructure at astws leap 2004 like the bloukrans kowie river system pollution inputs were temporally variable with no clear patterns in nitrogen loading while there is some evidence of a dilution effect milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 when moving downstream from the sewerage settling pond on the new year s tributary the addition of water from the largely mesotrophic bushmans river resulted in the first site immediately after the confluence of the new year s and bushmans rivers being included as a nitrogen rich hotspot and identified for management interest spot analyses of nh3 and no3 generally followed similar patterns increasing or decreasing to those seen in the Œ¥15n of spirodela plants with a few exceptions but could not be directly linked to plant isotopic values this is not surprising if we consider that rivers display strong variability in nutrients and flow regime both temporally and spatially nilsson and malm ren√∂f√§lt 2008 lavelle et al 2019 and that nutrient uptake and isotopic equilibration i e isotopic incorporation rate into tissue are not immediate fry and arnold 1982 mccutchan and lewis 2001 kendall and doctor 2003 furthermore water chemistry may influence the rates of plant nutrient uptake to some degree i e hillman 1961 k√∂rner et al 2003 chaiprapat et al 2005 lasfar et al 2007 when applying the sewage manure concentration baselines for Œ¥15n in duckweed see hill et al 2012 the nh3 recorded at numerous sites and times on both river systems regularly exceeded 8 50 mg n l Œ¥15n value of 10 00 and were periodically much higher 20 00 mg n l Œ¥15n value of 15 00 which is in line with concentrations of ammonia in other south african ecosystems subjected to substantial point source sewage inputs morrison et al 2001 scharler and baird 2005 odume and muller 2011 these values exceed the upper limits of water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystem health both in south africa 0 015 mg n l dwaf 1996a and elsewhere 2 30 mg n l australia new zealand anzecc 2000 2 50 mg n l total n europe unece 1994 and in some cases surpassed the acceptable limits for the safe use of south african domestic water use 10 00 mg n l dwaf 1996b while the values inferred by the calibrated baseline from hill et al 2012 were often much higher than the spot analyses of nh3 and no3 plant isotopic values represent a longer term incorporation of nutrient levels which are also likely dependent on water chemistry thus providing a more integrated measure of biologically ecologically available nitrogen in the river system indeed as duckweed nutrient uptake can be sensitive to other water chemistry characteristics associated with wastewaters or manure plumes the weak relationship between spot analyses of nh3 no3 and duckweed isotopic values is not surprising the popularity of duckweeds in phytoremediation also suggests an increase in duckweed biomass can lower nitrogen values in the water column i e tripathi et al 1991 gijzen and veenstra 2000 ng and chan 2018 thus spot analyses of water quality likely underestimate nutrient levels in dynamic systems particularly where nutrient loading is non point source and stochastic pollution mapping using isotope values of floating aquatic plants may thus be more likely to identify re occurring and persistent hot spots of nutrient loading providing better indications of nutrient concentrations available to aquatic biota the temporal and spatial variability in n loading apparent in both river systems highlights the natural self purification capacity of rivers cooper et al 1919 milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 supported by the river continuum concept by vannote et al 1980 Œ¥15n and c n values reflected increasing river health i e decline in nitrogen enrichment when moving downstream of sewage manure inputs despite this trend the 13 month average values for Œ¥15n and c n show that inputs from local sewage out falls and agricultural runoff can accumulate to substantial levels which are toxic to the majority of aquatic organisms unece 1994 dwaf 1996a anzecc 2000 agricultural and waste runoff appear to contribute to nutrient loading in both river systems this may be a result off enriched loads of runoff waste from the landscape finding their way into the river systems causing a significant spike in accumulated nitrogen sites a1 a5 for example were surrounded by formal and informal settlements land use and experienced sewage spills out fall and agricultural runoff similarly the sewerage settling pond b4 on the bushmans new year s river may experience overflowing of nutrient rich waste that could have reached adjacent and downstream environments it is likely that the self purification process on both river systems may have been compromised by two major factors 1 increased water runoff that led to increased current speeds and water volume see slaughter 2011 leap 2004 and 2 the continuous influx of anthropogenic pollution loads due to runoff from land use which exceed the ecosystem s ability to process and thus leading to eutrophication cooper et al 1919 milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 this phenomenon anthropogenic nitrogen pollution is often described as the urban stream syndrome a term originally coined by meyer et al 2005 where even with innovative developments and advancements in infrastructure and legislature excessive nutrient loads through treated untreated sewage out falls and agricultural runoff are regularly released into aquatic ecosystems see meyer et al 2005 walsh et al 2005a 2005b morrissey et al 2013 with the majority of sites along both river systems failing to meet water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystem health and safe domestic water use there is a clear need to review current waste management plans to ensure wastewater treatment facilities are up to standard as well as revise current country wide water quality standards see also boyd et al 2015 a finding which has been echoed by numerous other studies i e dickens and graham 1998 morrison et al 2001 mema 2010 osuolale and okoh 2015 comparatively evidence of commercial fertiliser inputs was minimal in both rivers and farmers confirmed that domestic cow manure was preferentially used to fertilise pineapple and cabbage crops and grass fields used for cattle grazing g vroom pers comm furthermore the ability of duckweed to accurately reflect fertiliser inputs may be complicated by duckweed s overall preference for assimilation of ammonia over nitrate when both are readily available al nozaly et al 2000 ruenglertpanyakul et al 2004 thus the application of isotopic mapping techniques will be most appropriate for mapping and tracing organic pollution inputs because while fertiliser inputs may be identified they are likely to be obscured by concurrent sewage and manure loads furthermore diebel and vander zanden 2009 highlighted some uncertainties on the documented overlapping isotopic ranges describing anthropogenic nutrients inputs particularly when using aquatic biota as biological indicators combined with some evidence that isotopic fractionation may be species specific and potentially influenced by geographic locality peterson and fry 1987 cole et al 2004 aberle and malzahn 2007 hill et al 2012 baseline studies of indicator organisms are essential prior to field applications of sewage plume mapping the continuous alteration of freshwater resources by excessive addition of nutrients the urban stream syndrome has serious destructive long term consequences excessive n loading often results in chronic water quality impairment which makes mediation difficult and prevents system rehabilitation withers et al 2014 it also promotes the loss of aquatic biodiversity and may provide suitable environments for alien aquatic species kadye and booth 2012 coetzee et al 2014 hill et al 2015 subsequently facilitating trophic cascades and regime shifts folke et al 2004 troell et al 2005 cr√©pin et al 2012 thus the ability to identify pollution hotspots before ecosystem degradation and map the temporal variation and spatial extent of n loading in aquatic ecosystems is a powerful management tool for the conservation and ultimately the rehabilitation of impacted aquatic ecosystems costanzo et al 2001 2005 clearly illustrate how hotspot identification improves the understanding of the marine environment they adopted isotopic mapping methods to reveal the spatial extent of sewage pollution in moreton bay australia eventually leading to refurbishment of the sewerage treatment facility and gradual system recovery the use of similar methods in freshwater environments are equally as useful and demonstrated herein with spirodela spp that easily identified eutrophication problem areas as being adjacent to or downstream of sewerage treatment facilities and agricultural fields proposed upgrades of local wastewater facilities mokonyane 2015 may ameliorate these issues particularly in combination with river self purification capacities and re mapping both river systems after these upgrades will help to assess their effectiveness on ecosystem health recovery and rehabilitation 6 conclusions this case study shows that mapping n loading with Œ¥15n and c n values of spirodela duckweed provides a spatial and temporal assessment of n loading hotspots in freshwater ecosystems while this technique may not provide exact nitrogen concentrations or reliably reflect fertiliser inputs available in the water column it clearly provides a time integrated map of organic nitrogen dynamics that can identify the spatial extent to which sewage manure inputs are seen downstream of a pollution point source the technique is not fieldwork intensive nor does it require particular expertise and with small sample size requirements it is cost effective overall mapping pollution hotspots is a versatile tool for the monitoring and assessment of ecosystem health more specifically Œ¥15n and c n values of spirodela spp allow for the identification of incipient eutrophication before ecosystem degradation mapping hotspots provides a tool for tagging areas of management interest either at a smaller temporal scale or on an overall ecosystem scale where infrastructure may be failing or agricultural inputs are greater than expected application of the isotopic mapping methods in general may allow the identification of emerging pollution problems and the ultimate sources of nitrogen pollution which will aid in the conservation and management of freshwater

18184,excessive addition of nitrogen n has threatened aquatic ecosystems for decades traditional water quality and biological monitoring assessment tools are widely used for monitoring nutrient loads and ecosystem health but most of these methods cannot distinguish between different types and sources of pollution this is a challenge particularly when dealing with non point sources of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into freshwater systems recent laboratory studies using stable isotopic ratios Œ¥15n and c n of aquatic macrophytes duckweed spirodela spp have shown successful differentiation and mapping between different n sources and further showed abilities to act as early warning indicators for environmental n loading therefore the aim of this study was to field test the potential of stable isotopic values of transplanted spirodela spp to map temporal and spatial n loading variation and determine the main sources of n loading in two river systems in the eastern cape province of south africa using previously grown isotopically calibrated and transplanted spirodela plants collected over a 13 month sampling period nitrogen isotopic values Œ¥15n of spirodela plants traced environmental n loading and identified pollution hotspots and sources through time and space over a wide range of nutrient gradients Œ¥15n isotopic values of spirodela spp provided detailed dynamics on n loading therefore supporting its utilisation in the biological monitoring of ecosystem health and the early detection of eutrophication in freshwater systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords

2002 rabalais 2002 excessive nitrogen loads damage organismal capacity for survival growth and reproduction camargo and alonso 2006 and the eutrophication resulting from elevated n loads can have

system sass5 chutter 1994 dickens and graham 2002 however most of these methods typically reflect eutrophication problems only once ecosystem level effects have already manifested moreover it is often not possible to link changes in biota to specific forms of disturbance particularly where pollutants originate from non point sources fry 2006 jona lasinio et al 2015 any methods that would allow detection of incipient eutrophication and permit mapping of n loading and n hot spots in the natural environment would greatly add to our ability to successfully manage freshwater resources recent studies have suggested stable isotopic values of macrophytes as reliable indicators of n loading in marine ecosystems potentially providing early indications of eutrophication i e cohen and fong 2005 costanzo et al 2001 2005 deutsch and voss 2006 inglett and reddy 2006 dailer et al 2010 schubert et al 2013 the Œ¥15n 15n 14n in per mil notation isotopic value of a macrophyte is determined by a combination of the isotopic composition of the nitrogen source and the physiological fractionation of the plant tissue heaton 1986 hobson and clark 1992 kendall 1998 costanzo et al 2001 plants assimilating nitrogen from synthetic fertilisers for example received through agricultural run off will have Œ¥15n values that reflect the atmospheric n2 source of the fertiliser 2 to 2 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 curt et al 2004 comparatively plants assimilating nitrogen from treated sewage or manure have more enriched values isotopically heavier because colonising bacteria preferentially process the lighter 14n isotope leading to an overall enrichment in the Œ¥15n isotopic value of the remaining waste typically 10 to 25 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 curt et al 2004 hill et al 2012 morrissey et al 2013 loomer et al 2014 using stable isotopic analysis sia costanzo et al 2001 pioneered a sewage plume mapping analysis that used macroalgal Œ¥15n values to map the concentration and spatial spread of sewage inputs in moreton bay australia a second study by costanzo et al 2005 after substantial wastewater infrastructure upgrades showed a large reduction in nitrogen concentrations and spatial extent of sewage inputs demonstrating that mapping anthropogenic n loading using Œ¥15n values of macrophytes can provide ecologists and environmental managers with an assessment tool for intensive eutrophication monitoring in aquatic ecosystems Œ¥15n values can thus provide a time integrated assessment of n loading at sites with the potential to identify problems and ultimate n sources before ecosystem degradation takes place hill et al 2012 rather than spot analyses of nutrients which may be affected by variable nutrient discharge and flow regime in a river system with the current global shortage of clean freshwater pahl wostl et al 2013 developing a similar sewage plume mapping analyses for freshwater ecosystems is warranted however there is some evidence to suggest that isotope fractionation in aquatic plants may vary strongly between species aberle and malzahn 2007 and thus species specific baseline data is a pre requisite to successfully using this method in a natural setting duckweeds spirodela sp are the world smallest and simplest floating macrophytes and have a wide natural distribution excluding polar regions and deserts hill et al 2012 the main form of reproduction is vegetative through the production of daughter plants and growth is known to be explosive under high levels on nutrients and light goopy and murray 2003 recently a baseline laboratory study using the floating duckweed spirodela spp freshwater macrophytes a combination of spirodela polyrrhiza and spirodela punctata was undertaken which showed that duckweed Œ¥15n values clearly reflect environmental n loading distinguishing between different n types i e ammonia nh3 and nitrate no3 within 4 10 days of exposure plant tissue also showed depleted and enriched isotopic values with increasing concentrations of no3 and nh3 respectively hill et al 2012 using a combination of stable isotope methods and nutrient uptake identifiers i e c n ratios spirodela plants are therefore potentially useful for isotopic monitoring in freshwater systems under long term continuous nutrient inputs hill et al 2012 with the laboratory baseline validated and established for spirodela duckweed see hill et al 2012 follow up field testing is required to confirm the applicability of this method in a natural freshwater environment thus the following research aimed to present a case study to evaluate the ability of Œ¥15n isotopic values of transplanted spirodela spp assemblages to 1 map spatiotemporal n loading dynamics and 2 identify n loading hot spots and nitrogen concentrations in the surface water across a well defined nutrient gradient on two freshwater river systems in the eastern cape province of south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at 19 sites located on two river systems in the eastern cape south africa fig 1 a and b nine sites on the bloukrans kowie river system sites a1 a9 fig 1c and ten sites on the

the kowie river system is about 70 km in length flowing through relatively undisturbed habitats that are largely forest thickets and game farms the heavily disturbed bloukrans river is a tributary of

cover a range of pollution gradients six impacted sites on the bloukrans river a1 a6 two largely natural sites on the upper reaches of the kowie river a7 and a8 and one site after the confluence of

collected monthly from august 2013 until august 2014 prior to field transplantation a stock population of the spirodela spp a combination of spirodela polyrrhiza and spirodela punctata was grown

the water surface at the beginning of august 2013 45 g of stock spirodela plants grown at the waainek mass rearing research facility were added to each cage and five cages were deployed and allowed to float on top of the water column at each site within each river system cages were attached with string to submerged cement weights to prevent drifting on site whenever necessary floating cages were

ammonia concentrations throughout the bloukrans kowie river system august 2013 and october 2013 recorded the highest nitrate and ammonia mean concentrations throughout the 13 month sampling period respectively downstream of site a2 a decrease in average water nutrient concentration was observed when moving further downstream the bloukrans river from sites a3 nh3 7 49 mg l no3 2 13 mg l a4 nh3 4 37 mg l no3 1 60 mg l and site a5 nh3 1 08 mg l no3 0 31 mg l with a slight increase at site a6 nh3 3 07 mg l no3 1 79 mg l which likely integrated the urban sewage outfall and agricultural runoff activities within the bloukrans river tributary the kowie river system upstream site a7 nh3 2 48 mg l no3 1 37 mg l was moderately enriched compared to the downstream site a8 nh3 0 53 mg l no3 0 18 mg l site a8 was the least nutrient impacted site in the bloukrans kowie river system throughout the study site a9 nh3 1 51 mg l no3 0 84 mg l after the confluence of the bloukrans and kowie river systems recorded minimum to moderate water nutrient enrichment fig 4 a the new year s river tributary transplanted spirodela plants Œ¥15n and c n isotopic ratios showed minimal n enrichment relative to the bloukrans kowie system with eutrophication present at fewer sites and on a smaller scale fig 2c 2d and 3b a sewage manure plume was evident at sites b3 b4 and b5 between august 2013 march 2014 and site b4 displayed extremely enriched Œ¥15n values between november 2013 february 2014 smaller isolated events were also observed at site b2 february march 2014 and sites b3 and b4 august 2014 fertiliser inputs into the new year s river were effectively absent with one exception site b2 in july 2014 spirodela plants transplanted in the bushman river showed minimal sewage manure inputs site b8 november december 2013 n limitation was more prevalent in the bushmans new year s system both in some new year s tributary see sites b1 b6 and b7 and confluence sites see sites b9 and b10 mean nitrate concentrations were higher in the bushmans new year s river system relative to ammonia opposite to the trend in the bloukrans kowie river system ammonia concentration was low range 0 15 0 38 mg l for the majority of sites i e sites b1 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 except at sites b4 sewage settling pond 2 77 mg l and both sites b3 0 98 mg l and b5 0 71 mg l which were adjacent to the sewage settling pond an elevated ammonia concentration was observed at site b2 1 29 mg l which was upstream site b3 and below the dam wall nitrate concentration was different between sites showing three tiers of concentrations site b1 b5 and b8 were least enriched 1st tier range 0 25 1 08 mg l sites b2 b3 b7 b9 and b10 were moderately enriched 2nd tier range 1 25 1 97 mg l and sites b4 and b6 were highly enriched 3rd tier range 2 19 mg l 2 93 mg l fig 4b based on 13 month averages of spirodela Œ¥15n and c n ratios seven persistent n loading hotspots Œ¥15n 10 00 and c n 15 00 were identified on the bloukrans kowie river a1 a6 and a9 figs 2a and 3a and five on the bushmans new year s river b3 b4 b5 b8 b9 figs 2b and 3b predicted Œ¥15n and c n ratios for each system follow this trend support the trends described for n loading on the contour plot and the hot spots plot and predict well the raw monthly averages figs 4 and 5 the bloukrans river showed variable predicted n loading in three tiers fig 4a sites a1 and a8 are not significantly different in Œ¥15n and these sites are in the lower tier the second tier includes sites a2 a5 a6 a7 and a9 but these sites represent a transition between less nutrient rich sites in the lower tier and sites a3 and a4 in the upper tier sites a3 and a4 in particular are significantly different from all other sites and each other fig 5 in general the kowie river site a1 and a8 shows limited nutrient enrichment compared with the rest of the bloukrans kowie river system sites trends in nh3 and no3 tend to follow predicted Œ¥15n except for sites a3 a4 and a9 with higher concentrations in sites a1 and a2 and lower concentrations in sites a5 a8 fig 4a predicted c n ratios show an increasing trend moving downstream in the bloukrans river with site a8 in the kowie river significantly greater than all other sites in this system monthly trends show an increase from august 2013 to january 2014 then a declining trend to july 2014 and predict well the raw site averages fig 5a a cyclic pattern is apparent in both months and sites and both raw and predicted values have high variability more so in sites when both site and month trends are taken in concert they reflect the patterns in the contour plots for example high predicted Œ¥15n values in sites a2 a4 from october 2013 to march 2014 agree strongly with the contour plot fig 2a the sewerage settling pond site b4 adjacent to the bushmans new year s river system had the greatest 15n enrichment but was not significantly different from its nearest sites b3 and b5 moreover no sites were statistically different fig 4c in general the bushmans new year s river system sites fell into two tiers the lower tier included sites b1 b2 b6 b7 and b10 all of which were on the new year s river except site b10 all sites in this lower tier were below the nitrogen hotspot threshold excluding site b4 because it was not within the river c n ratios were basically similar i e many overlapping or non significantly different sites both nh3 and no3 on the bushmans new year s river had lower concentrations relative to raw or predicted values than the bloukrans kowie river still concentrations from b1 b4 increased and a general decrease was observed from b6 b10 this pattern roughly followed the raw and predicted values fig 4c the bushmans new year s river system followed a similar temporal pattern to the bloukrans kowie river system with increasing Œ¥15n from august 2013 to march 2014 followed by a decrease and reaching lower values until the cyclic trend repeats fig 5c as with the bloukrans kowie river system high variability among sites contributes to increased variability monthly values reflected in overlapping standard errors fig 5 with the exceptions of sites a1 a3 predicted c n ratios for both bloukrans kowie and the bushmans new year s river systems were roughly inverse in relation to predicted nitrogen isotopic values this supports the nutrient limitation and enrichment as seen in the contour plots and hotspot maps fig 4b and 4d 5 discussion intensive field applications of the sewage plume mapping technique using transplanted spirodela spp calibrated against the baselines described by hill et al 2012 clearly resolved temporal and spatial dynamics of n loading in both the bloukrans kowie and bushmans new year s river systems using Œ¥15n and c n ratios of spirodela plants while all sites on the bloukrans river tributary experienced varying levels of eutrophication throughout the year an intense sewage manure plume was evident over a period of about 8 months stemming from site a2 and moving downriver this excessive n loading was almost certainly a reflection of treated sewage inputs from the bvstws located just upriver of site a2 and was exacerbated by agricultural manure runoff from the local dairy pineapple and cabbage farms found between sites a2 a3 and a3 a4 spot analyses of inorganic salts and south african scoring system sass biomonitoring scores have previously reported the bloukrans river tributary to be severely disturbed de moor et al 2002 barber james et al 2003 haigh et al 2008 and Œ¥15n and c n ratios have shown these pollution events to be associated with anthropogenic nutrient inputs sewage out fall and or manure runoff and were temporally variable with irregular pulses of sewage and runoff this was also confirmed in part by anecdotal observations and communications with both farmers and municipalities s motitsoe and j hill pers comm between makana and alicedale municipalities and the kowie catchment campaign kcc while the kowie river was shown to be comparatively oligotrophic the nitrogen inputs from the upper reaches of the bloukrans river tributary extended tens of kilometres downstream impacting water quality at sites after the confluence of the bloukrans and kowie rivers average Œ¥15n and c n ratios of spirodela plants grown within this system identified six nitrogen hotspots which are likely to suffer from ecosystem degradation and should be tagged for management interest with decreasing importance from site a2 the new year s river tributary was relatively more oligotrophic than the bloukrans river tributary with eutrophication present at fewer sites and extending out on a smaller spatial scale a sewage manure plume with less enriched Œ¥15n values was apparent here for about 8 months centered directly around the alicedale sewerage settling pond astws b4 while the sewerage settling pond is not directly connected to the river system the adjacent river sites upstream and downstream of the settling pond demonstrated concurrently enriched Œ¥15n values suggesting the likelihood of groundwater seepage from b4 or because of overtopping events supporting local reports of failing sewerage infrastructure at astws leap 2004 like the bloukrans kowie river system pollution inputs were temporally variable with no clear patterns in nitrogen loading while there is some evidence of a dilution effect milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 when moving downstream from the sewerage settling pond on the new year s tributary the addition of water from the largely mesotrophic bushmans river resulted in the first site immediately after the confluence of the new year s and bushmans rivers being included as a nitrogen rich hotspot and identified for management interest spot analyses of nh3 and no3 generally followed similar patterns increasing or decreasing to those seen in the Œ¥15n of spirodela plants with a few exceptions but could not be directly linked to plant isotopic values this is not surprising if we consider that rivers display strong variability in nutrients and flow regime both temporally and spatially nilsson and malm ren√∂f√§lt 2008 lavelle et al 2019 and that nutrient uptake and isotopic equilibration i e isotopic incorporation rate into tissue are not immediate fry and arnold 1982 mccutchan and lewis 2001 kendall and doctor 2003 furthermore water chemistry may influence the rates of plant nutrient uptake to some degree i e hillman 1961 k√∂rner et al 2003 chaiprapat et al 2005 lasfar et al 2007 when applying the sewage manure concentration baselines for Œ¥15n in duckweed see hill et al 2012 the nh3 recorded at numerous sites and times on both river systems regularly exceeded 8 50 mg n l Œ¥15n value of 10 00 and were periodically much higher 20 00 mg n l Œ¥15n value of 15 00 which is in line with concentrations of ammonia in other south african ecosystems subjected to substantial point source sewage inputs morrison et al 2001 scharler and baird 2005 odume and muller 2011 these values exceed the upper limits of water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystem health both in south africa 0 015 mg n l dwaf 1996a and elsewhere 2 30 mg n l australia new zealand anzecc 2000 2 50 mg n l total n europe unece 1994 and in some cases surpassed the acceptable limits for the safe use of south african domestic water use 10 00 mg n l dwaf 1996b while the values inferred by the calibrated baseline from hill et al 2012 were often much higher than the spot analyses of nh3 and no3 plant isotopic values represent a longer term incorporation of nutrient levels which are also likely dependent on water chemistry thus providing a more integrated measure of biologically ecologically available nitrogen in the river system indeed as duckweed nutrient uptake can be sensitive to other water chemistry characteristics associated with wastewaters or manure plumes the weak relationship between spot analyses of nh3 no3 and duckweed isotopic values is not surprising the popularity of duckweeds in phytoremediation also suggests an increase in duckweed biomass can lower nitrogen values in the water column i e tripathi et al 1991 gijzen and veenstra 2000 ng and chan 2018 thus spot analyses of water quality likely underestimate nutrient levels in dynamic systems particularly where nutrient loading is non point source and stochastic pollution mapping using isotope values of floating aquatic plants may thus be more likely to identify re occurring and persistent hot spots of nutrient loading providing better indications of nutrient concentrations available to aquatic biota the temporal and spatial variability in n loading apparent in both river systems highlights the natural self purification capacity of rivers cooper et al 1919 milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 supported by the river continuum concept by vannote et al 1980 Œ¥15n and c n values reflected increasing river health i e decline in nitrogen enrichment when moving downstream of sewage manure inputs despite this trend the 13 month average values for Œ¥15n and c n show that inputs from local sewage out falls and agricultural runoff can accumulate to substantial levels which are toxic to the majority of aquatic organisms unece 1994 dwaf 1996a anzecc 2000 agricultural and waste runoff appear to contribute to nutrient loading in both river systems this may be a result off enriched loads of runoff waste from the landscape finding their way into the river systems causing a significant spike in accumulated nitrogen sites a1 a5 for example were surrounded by formal and informal settlements land use and experienced sewage spills out fall and agricultural runoff similarly the sewerage settling pond b4 on the bushmans new year s river may experience overflowing of nutrient rich waste that could have reached adjacent and downstream environments it is likely that the self purification process on both river systems may have been compromised by two major factors 1 increased water runoff that led to increased current speeds and water volume see slaughter 2011 leap 2004 and 2 the continuous influx of anthropogenic pollution loads due to runoff from land use which exceed the ecosystem s ability to process and thus leading to eutrophication cooper et al 1919 milner 1994 everard and powell 2002 this phenomenon anthropogenic nitrogen pollution is often described as the urban stream syndrome a term originally coined by meyer et al 2005 where even with innovative developments and advancements in infrastructure and legislature excessive nutrient loads through treated untreated sewage out falls and agricultural runoff are regularly released into aquatic ecosystems see meyer et al 2005 walsh et al 2005a 2005b morrissey et al 2013 with the majority of sites along both river systems failing to meet water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystem health and safe domestic water use there is a clear need to review current waste management plans to ensure wastewater treatment facilities are up to standard as well as revise current country wide water quality standards see also boyd et al 2015 a finding which has been echoed by numerous other studies i e dickens and graham 1998 morrison et al 2001 mema 2010 osuolale and okoh 2015 comparatively evidence of commercial fertiliser inputs was minimal in both rivers and farmers confirmed that domestic cow manure was preferentially used to fertilise pineapple and cabbage crops and grass fields used for cattle grazing g vroom pers comm furthermore the ability of duckweed to accurately reflect fertiliser inputs may be complicated by duckweed s overall preference for assimilation of ammonia over nitrate when both are readily available al nozaly et al 2000 ruenglertpanyakul et al 2004 thus the application of isotopic mapping techniques will be most appropriate for mapping and tracing organic pollution inputs because while fertiliser inputs may be identified they are likely to be obscured by concurrent sewage and manure loads furthermore diebel and vander zanden 2009 highlighted some uncertainties on the documented overlapping isotopic ranges describing anthropogenic nutrients inputs particularly when using aquatic biota as biological indicators combined with some evidence that isotopic fractionation may be species specific and potentially influenced by geographic locality peterson and fry 1987 cole et al 2004 aberle and malzahn 2007 hill et al 2012 baseline studies of indicator organisms are essential prior to field applications of sewage plume mapping the continuous alteration of freshwater resources by excessive addition of nutrients the urban stream syndrome has serious destructive long term consequences excessive n loading often results in chronic water quality impairment which makes mediation difficult and prevents system rehabilitation withers et al 2014 it also promotes the loss of aquatic biodiversity and may provide suitable environments for alien aquatic species kadye and booth 2012 coetzee et al 2014 hill et al 2015 subsequently facilitating trophic cascades and regime shifts folke et al 2004 troell et al 2005 cr√©pin et al 2012 thus the ability to identify pollution hotspots before ecosystem degradation and map the temporal variation and spatial extent of n loading in aquatic ecosystems is a powerful management tool for the conservation and ultimately the rehabilitation of impacted aquatic ecosystems costanzo et al 2001 2005 clearly illustrate how hotspot identification improves the understanding of the marine environment they adopted isotopic mapping methods to reveal the spatial extent of sewage pollution in moreton bay australia eventually leading to refurbishment of the sewerage treatment facility and gradual system recovery the use of similar methods in freshwater environments are equally as useful and demonstrated herein with spirodela spp that easily identified eutrophication problem areas as being adjacent to or downstream of sewerage treatment facilities and agricultural fields proposed upgrades of local wastewater facilities mokonyane 2015 may ameliorate these issues particularly in combination with river self purification capacities and re mapping both river systems after these upgrades will help to assess their effectiveness on ecosystem health recovery and rehabilitation 6 conclusions this case study shows that mapping n loading with Œ¥15n and c n values of spirodela duckweed provides a spatial and temporal assessment of n loading hotspots in freshwater ecosystems while this technique may not provide exact nitrogen concentrations or reliably reflect fertiliser inputs available in the water column it clearly provides a time integrated map of organic nitrogen dynamics that can identify the spatial extent to which sewage manure inputs are seen downstream of a pollution point source the technique is not fieldwork intensive nor does it require particular expertise and with small sample size requirements it is cost effective overall mapping pollution hotspots is a versatile tool for the monitoring and assessment of ecosystem health more specifically Œ¥15n and c n values of spirodela spp allow for the identification of incipient eutrophication before ecosystem degradation mapping hotspots provides a tool for tagging areas of management interest either at a smaller temporal scale or on an overall ecosystem scale where infrastructure may be failing or agricultural inputs are greater than expected application of the isotopic mapping methods in general may allow the identification of emerging pollution problems and the ultimate sources of nitrogen pollution which will aid in the conservation and management of freshwater
