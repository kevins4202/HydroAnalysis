4780,maps of ecosystem services are becoming increasingly useful for reporting on the potential impacts of human activity on the environment however interactions in watersheds are complex and mapping hydrological ecosystem services hes requires indicators which accurately measure underlying processes the main objective of this study was to take advantage of the soil and water assessment tool swat and light detection and ranging lidar data to map the erosion regulation service for a managed boreal forest watershed to do so swat and partial least squares pls regression were used to select explanatory variables for sediment yield variables of importance in projection vip with a score 1 were selected to develop lidar based ecological indicators four categories of variables were identified as vip from the pls i climate annual precipitation ii land use forest cutovers iii land use patterns cutover patch cohesion index and iv morphometric main channel length channel length and sub watershed area the height of the 95th percentile of lidar returns p95 5 m provided the most accurate spatial representation of cutovers and the optimal cutover patch cohesion index other morphometrics were obtained from a lidar based digital terrain model explanatory variables for sediment yield were combined in a sediment erosion control sec index except for yearly average precipitation because the sec index is not actually used as a temporal index as expected a negative relationship was found between sediment yield and sec index rankings for the 2006 2015 period spearman rho 0 6 p 0 05 moreover the overall agreement between swat and sec index classes was 87 for 31 sub watersheds the study provides a list of relevant explanatory variables for modelling sediment yield in a boreal forest watershed where timber harvest activities occur it also demonstrates the use of lidar data for deriving an index of the erosion regulation ecosystem service in a proxy based approach as it had not been demonstrated previously at the watershed level the validation method applied here fills a gap in ecosystem services mapping that could benefit studies in other watershed contexts keywords lidar hydrological ecosystem services sustainable forest management swat sediment yield 1 introduction ecosystem services are generally defined as benefits that humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions costanza et al 2017 methods are being developed to quantify and map specific types of services such as hydrological ecosystem services hes brauman 2015 dennedy frank et al 2016 sun et al 2017 however these methods are often limited by the complexity of interactions at play in watersheds dennedy frank et al 2016 quantifying a watershed s capacity to provide hes could be achieved by calculating ecological indicators ei de groot et al 2010 fisher et al 2009 kandziora et al 2013 ei are considered here as measures of ecosystem components structures and processes and therefore related to a watershed s ability to supply hes burkhard et al 2012 cimon morin et al 2013 dale and beyeler 2001 seppelt et al 2011 climatic variability and cumulative disturbance are the two main drivers that result in changes in water quality and water quantity giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 yet the hydrologic response to timber harvest activities remains a difficult challenge to quantify brogna et al 2017 hawthorne et al 2013 wei and zhang 2010 some studies have reported that timber harvesting results in an increase in annual water yield arthur et al 1998 khanal and parajuli 2013 while others more equivocally report either a decrease or no change bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 other studies show that water yield increases in the first years following timber harvest and then decreases as the forest regenerates carvalho santos et al 2014 swank et al 2001 it could take up to 10 years for water yield to return to pre treatment levels this time frame is hard to define given the paucity of long term studies assessing post treatment equilibrium states in watersheds arthur et al 1998 some studies have concluded that a threshold of 20 to 25 of timber harvest area is required before a measurable hydrologic response can be detected brogna et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 tremblay et al 2008 moreover these studies were undertaken in small watersheds 100 km2 and may not be transferable or scalable to larger watersheds increases in sediment yield after harvest activities have also been reported with an increase of peak flow molina et al 2012 troendle and olsen 1994 these conflicting results suggest limitations of adopting causal relationships for hes mapping in a forest watershed context while proxy based approaches are renowned for their ease of use they could benefit from a validation method that is capable of assessing the effect of change in forest cover on water quality there are three main approaches to studying the effects of timber harvest activities on hydrological ecosystem services the first approach relies on paired watersheds which consist of a control and a treatment paired watershed studies are possible when working on small watersheds 100 km2 because they exhibit little variation in land use and conditions are easier to control conclusions drawn from these studies are difficult to apply to larger watersheds with greater complexity more land use classes and lakes or reservoirs hawthorne et al 2013 wei and zhang 2010 the second approach utilizes time series analysis which permits evaluations of sensitivity and resilience to timber harvest activities on large watersheds bosch and hewlett 1982 lin and wei 2008 yan et al 2018 but suitable time series datasets frequently are not available the last approach is based upon hydrological modelling the long term effect of forest management on water yield was studied with hydrological modelling with successful application of models and scenario development for selective cutting yu et al 2015 hydrologic models can also be used to spatialize changes in land cover simulate cutovers in a watershed and assess their impacts on specified outputs ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 quintero et al 2009 schmalz et al 2016 physically based or hydrologic watershed modelling has been used to reduce uncertainties in hes studies aznar s√°nchez et al 2019 francesconi et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 for example the invest tool sharp et al 2020 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 were used to study spatial patterns priorities and trade offs in water supply soil conservation and water purification with similar results cong et al 2020 vigerstol and aukema 2011 recommended the use of swat only if water related ecosystem services are being modelled and there are sufficient data and expertise swat has been used to study hydrologic responses to forest cover changes in watersheds peraza castro et al 2018 schmalz et al 2016 and can simulate several processes that are useful for hes therefore it is considered suitable for hes studies ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 despite the common use of hydrological models for quantifying hes they require a high level of knowledge and large amounts of data which may not always be available brogna et al 2017 schmalz et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 yu et al 2015 for these reasons one might prefer to map hes with proxies that are easier to use and more readily available without sufficient scientific rigour for the development or selection of indicators however such proxies may not provide appropriate information for monitoring or evaluating hes capacity dale and beyeler 2001 since the use of hydrological models for hes is largely accepted logsdon and chaubey 2013 quintero et al 2009 schmalz et al 2016 several studies have used them to determine explanatory variables that are responsible for water quality degradation but none of them apply to boreal forest watersheds aladejana et al 2018 shi et al 2014 yan et al 2018 moreover hydrological models are used less frequently to validate proxy based methods of mapping hes an exception is the study by schmidt et al 2020 who used swat to validate their proxy based method for mapping the sediment control service in their review on ecosystem service quantification boerema et al 2017 stated that 33 of 405 papers did not report any validation validating maps of ecosystem services remains a complex challenge seppelt et al 2011 taking advantage of the strength of the hydrological model is therefore an appropriate and innovative way of assuring a robust methodology for the development of new indicators light detection and ranging lidar data has proven its usefulness in forestry to the point of becoming one of the primary sources of data for forest management kane 2010 knapp et al 2018 lefsky et al 2002 for example nijland et al 2015 studied sensitivity to treatments in a boreal forest environment they found that specific metrics performed best in a conifer dominated context however they didn t use them to identify regenerating stage hawthorne et al 2013 identified thinning patterns from visual observations of canopy height profiles and maximum vegetation height metrics but they worked at the cutover patch level at a 2 m cell resolution which is not the appropriate level for watershed studies lidar has also proven to be reliable for providing stream width and length biron et al 2013 and identifying headwater streams lindsay and dhun 2015 murphy et al 2008 lidar data provide accurate digital terrain models dtm and can also be used to characterize forest structure consequently lidar is a good candidate for ecosystem services mapping andrew et al 2014 harpold et al 2015 simonson et al 2014 wulder et al 2013 lists of indicators for hes mapping in a forested watershed can help to identify potential proxies for mapping hes from lidar blattert et al 2017 brogna et al 2017 carvalho santos et al 2014 sutherland et al 2016 although lidar has been used to estimate forest biodiversity guo et al 2017 assess riparian habitat quality de sosa et al 2018 and water storage capacity guzha and shukla 2012 it has not been used to assess the erosion regulation service of large boreal forest watersheds using a proxy based framework the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the use of swat and lidar data to map the erosion regulation service for a managed boreal forest watershed the research was conducted in a boreal forest watershed which ranged between 500 and 1000 km2 where the sustainable forest management objective was maintenance of water quality at the sub watershed level the development of a lidar based hes framework for mapping the erosion regulation service is expected to benefit decision makers by increasing their capacity to make appropriate decisions regarding timber harvest areas and to report on indicators to environmental authorities the main goal was reached through three specific objectives i to identify explanatory variables of sediment yield in boreal forest watershed using the swat model ii to develop ei of these variables using lidar data and iii to combine these lidar derived ei into a sediment erosion control sec index to map the erosion regulation service our hypothesis was that a map of the sec index would yield estimates that are comparable to those predicted by swat 2 study area the harry river

hydrological model setup requires specific data as input namely dtm climate precipitation temperature soil type land cover and hydrometric data which were available from schmidt et al 2020 table 1 precipitation mm and temperature oc from 1980 to 2018 were available for two weather stations fig 1 the national hydrological network nhn was used to burn the stream while processing the dtm soil type was available from soil landscapes of canada version 3 2 and was considered homogeneous across the watershed original land cover data were available from canadian earth observation for sustainable development of forests eosd land cover data 2000 wulder et al 2008 and modified by schmidt et al 2020 hydrometric data are also required for the calibration and the validation of the swat model time series of daily discharge m3 s were available from 1980 to 2015 and daily sediment load for the period from 1980 to 1986 polygons of cutover areas for 1995 2018 were provided by cbppl airborne lidar data for hrw were acquired between 15 august and 24 september 2016 with a riegllms q680i at an altitude of 1000 m average point density was 7 34 pulses m2 point clouds were classified ground vegetation by the service provider a total of 739 tiles each measuring 1 km 1 km cover the study site 4 methodology our approach to defining suitable lidar based ei for mapping the erosion regulation service took advantage of swat and followed a methodological framework with five main steps fig 3 the swat model for hrw developed in a precedent study looking at es provided by forest schmidt et al 2020 was used here to support the development of our methodology in step1 the swat sensitivity to cutovers was validated for sediment yield outputs in step2 variables of importance for explaining sediment yield were identified using partial least squares pls regression in step3 lidar metrics or lidar dtm explanatory variables were derived for use in a proxy based mapping framework in step 4 a sediment erosion control sec index was constructed to quantify the erosion regulation service finally in step5 the sediment yield output from swat was compared with the sec index this last step provided a quantitative assessment of the proxy based framework for mapping sec with lidar based ei 4 1 modelling sediment yield with the swat hydrological model swat is a physically based semi distributed river basin model that takes as input temperature and precipitation and that also uses characteristics derived from land use soil type and dtm such as slopes and watershed delineation arnold et al 2012 in our study modification of the land use data with cutovers was exploited to simulate timber harvest activities sediment yield estimation with swat is based upon the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 1 sed 11 8 q surf q area area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle c f r g where qsurf is the surface runoff volume mm h2o ha qarea is the peak runoff rate m3 s areahru is the area m2 kusle is the usle soil erodibility factor k cusle is the usle cover and management factor c pusle is the usle support practice factor p lsusle is the usle topographic factor ls and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor surface runoff in turn can be computed with the usda soil conservation service scs curve number cn procedure khanal and parajuli 2013 musle is computed at the level of hydrological response unit hru whereby hru are units with similar soil land use and slope which are represented as proportions of the sub watershed arnold et al 2012 in a previous study of hrw schmidt et al 2020 defined 0 3 3 7 and 7 slope classes each class had a similar number of hrus soil type was homogeneous for hrw and cutovers were incorporated in the land use raster using cutover areas that were provided by the forest industry operating in hrw timber harvest activities prior to 1995 were not available this forest cutover land use class fcut was added to the swat database and assigned a curve number for moisture condition cn2 of 65 and a usle p factor of 1 which considers that no best management practices bmps are used woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 whereas for evergreen forest frse cn2 was set to 55 as was proposed by khanal and parajuli 2013 the cn2 and the usle p factor were adjusted for urban urbn 1 and wetland wetl 0 0664 cover fcut land use was further used to understand the effect of cutovers on sediment yield in the hydrological model the watershed was first divided into sub watersheds 31 for hrw according to topographic and hydrographic conditions that consider spatial heterogeneity the area was further divided into hru 361 for hrw the hru are not contiguous but they can account for processes occurring at the sub watershed level the fraction of each land use was obtained by calculating its area km2 in each sub watershed divided by the area of that sub watershed km2 prior to performing simulations swat was calibrated to local conditions schmidt et al 2020 used 20 parameters to calibrate for water quantity and 6 for water quality global sensitivity analysis was performed to adjust parameters arnold et al 2012 the period from 1980 to 1990 was used for streamflow calibration including three years of warm up using the semi automated parameter solution parasol from the swat calibration and uncertainty procedure arnold et al 2012 van griensven and meixner 2007 nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate model performance gupta and kling 2011 schmidt et al 2020 tarigan et al 2018 results are considered good when nse was 0 75 satisfactory when nse was between 0 36 and 0 75 and unsatisfactory when nse was 0 36 nash and sutcliffe 1970 khanal and parajuli 2013 yan et al 2018 sediment load calibration was performed with the 1980 1986 daily sediment load it would have been preferable if the calibration represented the same years as the modeling results however the calibration data used were the only sufficient years of data available for the study site schmidt et al 2020 validation of swat outputs was necessary to demonstrate that parameter adjustment was sufficiently accurate for simulation according to the project s objectives arnold et al 2012 validation of streamflow was conducted on the 1990 1995 period moriasi et al 2007 suggested that model performance was satisfactory when 0 5 nse 0 65 and when pbias 55 for sediment yield similarly khanal and parajuli 2013 suggested that calibration was satisfactory with nse of 0 62 r2 of 0 68 and pbias of 22 although it was not possible to validate sediment load due to a lack of data it has been shown that long term water quantity data for calibration and validation can overcome scarce water quality information arnold et al 2012 in this study step 1 swat was used to simulate the impact of cutovers on sediment yield outputs to do this swat was first run under the baseline or reference scenario which is based on initial land cover spatial data fig 4 a for the baseline scenario the fraction of hru corresponding to fcut in each sub watershed was transferred to hru corresponding to frse the fraction of the hru corresponding to fcut was set to 0 as if no cutovers had been performed sediment yield values t ha were available for the 31 sub watersheds sub on a daily basis for each year from 1995 to 2018 cutovers and precipitation are foreseen as potential explanatory variable for sediment yield it was hence preferred to select the same time period to run the swat model second swat was run under the cutover scenario by changing the fraction of the corresponding hru from frse to fcut in each sub watershed fig 4b differences in sediment yield between the baseline scenario and the cutover scenario were analyzed to determine whether the model could simulate timber harvest activities and therefore if it was well suited for the purpose of this study these differences or deltas were obtained by subtracting the value of the cutover scenario from the value of the baseline scenario and dividing the results by the baseline scenario value 4 2 identifying potential explanatory variables of sediment yield for the cutover scenario the aim of step2 was to identify potential explanatory variables for sediment yield using a historical cutover scenario since swat was run on a daily time step sediment yields were summed for each year from 1995 to 2018 for each of the 31 sub watersheds giving annual estimates of sediment yield t ha as the dependent variable potential explanatory variables were grouped into four different categories climate land use landscape patterns and morphometric table 2 although soil was considered to be important it was not selected as a potential explanatory variable in this study because available soil data were homogenous for hrw a pls regression model was then used to establish a relationship between the potential explanatory variables and the sediment yield outputs for the hrw variables that were selected in this step further guided those to include as lidar based ei in the sec index the proportion of land use was obtained by calculating the area km2 in each sub watershed divided by the area of that sub watershed km2 seven potential land use variables were considered agriculture cutover area forest non forest area barren and range urban water and wetlands five landscape pattern variables were calculated on the cutover patches contagion edge density patch cohesion index patch density and proximity index input data include the 20 m 20 m land use raster with fcut i e the modified input land cover data preparation prior to landscape pattern analysis included a reclassification step to derive a final raster where cutovers 1 and other land uses 0 landscape pattern indicators were measured for each sub watershed individually to represent the spatially explicit effects of timber harvesting on hydrological processes all landscape pattern variables were computed in r version 3 6 5 using sdmtools vanderwal et al 2019 or following steps in fletcher and fortin 2018 the contagion index refers to the probability of a land cover type being adjacent to a different land cover type from the equation 2 2 contagion 1 i 1 n j 1 n p ij l n p ij 2 l n n where pij pipj i and 3 p j i n ij n i where n is the number of land cover types and p is the proportions of the landscape for the land cover types classes small dispersed patches have a low contagion index value whereas large contiguous patches have a high contagion index mcgarigal and marks 1994 the cohesion index was also calculated for cutover patches with the following equation 4 cohesion 1 j 1 n p ij j 1 n p ij a ij 1 1 z 100 where a ij is the area m2 of patch ij in terms of number of cells p ij is the perimeter of patch ij in terms of number of cells and z is the total number of cells in the landscape cohesion index values between 0 and 100 are possible where values near 0 mean that the class of interest is composed of disconnected patches its value increases as patches become more aggregated i e more physically connected gustafson 2018 in addition the proximity index was used to measure patch isolation gustafson and parker 1994 5 proximity index j 1 n a j d ij 2 where a is the area of the patch and d which is the edge edge distance to other patches within a focal neighbourhood is defined here as 1000 m fletcher and fortin 2018 the proximity index has a high value when a patch is surrounded by large nearby patches the value of the index decreases when a given patch is surrounded by smaller and sparser patches seven morphometric variables were readily available from the swat setup with the arcswat plugin in arcgis and were added to the list of potential explanatory variables i channel slope ii longest tributary channel length iii channel width iv length of the main channel v average slope of the main channel and vi area and vii average slope table 2 proportion of steep slopes was also used as an explanatory variable which was available from the proportion of hru that was defined as steep slope 7 for each of the 31 sub watersheds topographic wetness index twi was obtained with the saga wetness index from the saga tools in qgis v3 4 from the swat input dtm from equation 6 twi ln a tan Œ≤ where a is the upslope area draining through a given point in the dtm per unit contour length and tan Œ≤ is the local slope in radians beven and kirkby 1979 twi is a relative index where values of 75th percentile were considered as good for water and sediment retention pearson product moment correlation r was used to study the relationship among the explanatory variables correlations were considered to be strong when the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ranged between r 0 80 and 1 00 moderate between 0 50 and 0 80 and weak when 0 50 partial least squares regression pls was used to identify explanatory variables for sediment yield in the cutover scenario pls uses principal component analysis pca to predict dependent variables from independent variables which are identified as predictors abdi 2010 pls is a form of multivariate multiple regression that can develop a predictive model from a large number of independent variables despite having a small number of observations another justification for employing pls was that the set of variables does not have to follow a normal distribution and can be highly correlated wold et al 2001 when considered as a fixed effect model rather than as a predictive model the observations are not only a sample of the population but they also represent the population of interest abdi 2010 a number of latent variables in the model can also be measured with wold s criterion to run pls all potential explanatory variables were assembled in a matrix in which the y variable was determined as sediment yield syld in t ha year from swat for the cutover scenario and the x variables which are the potential explanatory variables all variables were normalized by dividing them by their standard deviations and centered by subtracting averages from all variables boongaling et al 2018 wold et al 2001 the mdatools package in r kucheryavskiy 2019 was used to run pls variables of importance in projection vip that are 1 best explain the dependent variable although vip 0 8 are also considered as relevant aladejana et al 2018 from pls a suite of variables explaining the sediment yield response from swat was obtained and used to develop lidar based ei 4 3 deriving lidar based ecological indicators ei three of the four categories of potential variables explaining sediment yield from swat for the cutover simulation could be derived from lidar data and served as ei for the erosion regulation service these included morphometric land use and landscape patterns climate variables representing the fourth category could not benefit from lidar land use and landscape pattern variables were derived from the 3d structural information that was available from the lidar point clouds mainly by locating cutover areas the morphometric variables were derived from the lidar dtm all variables that were derived from the lidar data provided a link to explaining sediment yield syld potential explanatory variables from the land use category forest cutovers and landscape pattern categories contagion edgedensity patchcohesion patchdensity proxindex were derived from lidar structural information other land uses remained unchanged agri nonforest urban water and wetlands the first step in the analysis involved identifying the cutovers to do so we computed lidar metrics for 25 plots in each of the 2015 2010 2006 and 2000 cutover areas and for an additional 25 plots outside the cutover areas resulting in 125 plots in total each plot was 400 m2 these plots were used to assess which lidar metric could best represent the year of harvesting a 1 m 1 m resolution dtm was produced using default parameters of the blast2dem tool from las tools isenburg 2018 with all points classified as ground surfaces this dtm was used to normalize point clouds and estimate canopy height above the ground with the lidr package in r version 2 3 1 roussel et al 2020 the lidr package was also used to produce the following five lidar metrics to serve as potential cutover identifiers i maximum height of all returns zmax in m ii height of the 95th percentile of all returns p95 iii coefficient of variation cv iv number of first returns above 2 m height divided by the total number of returns and v penetration number of first returns below 2 m divided by the total number of returns barber et al 2016 guo et al 2017 hawthorne et al 2013 nijland et al 2015 canopy height profiles chp were used as visual references to determine differences in distributions of the point clouds between years of timber harvesting chp were represented by the proportions of vegetation hits at different heights over the total number of hits from all plots in each cutover year hawthorne et al 2013 boxplots facilitated the selection of the best metric nijland et al 2015 once the metric was identified it was further tested on 20 m 20 m raster cells to separate cutover and forest areas the cell size of the raster 400 m2 is similar to the size of a field plot that is used by the industry separation of cutover and forest areas was achieved with a simple height threshold that was applied to the selected metric the raster from this metric was further used to derive landscape patterns based upon cutover patch areas from the methodology presented in section4 2 each land use and landscape variable that was obtained from the lidar point clouds in addition to agri nonforest urban water and wetlands were further calculated for each sub watershed and available as ei the morphometric variables table 3 were derived using the methodology presented in section 4 2 and using the 10 m 10 m resampled lidar instead of the 20 m 20 m resolution raster used for non lidar based ei the finer resolution dtm was used because of its ability to improve representation of field topography and to derive hydrological attributes lindsay 2006 woodrow et al 2016 the use of different resolutions to derive ei was not an issue since ei were calculated and used at the sub watershed level guzha and shukla 2012 showed that even a lidar dtm resampled to 10 m enhanced the capacity to map water storage compared to the 10 m 10 m national elevation dataset from the united states geological survey usgs we also avoided using the high resolution of 1 m 1 m dtm because it unnecessarily increased the computing time the latter was not required to study processes at the landscape level goulden et al 2014 moreover accurate knowledge was needed on how to remove errors due to high resolution or lower point cloud density under forest cover cho et al 2011 vianello et al 2009 woodrow et al 2016 the morphometric variables that were obtained with the lidar dtm were further calculated for each sub watershed and ready to use as ei 4 4 quantifying sec as an index of the erosion regulation service the previous steps guided the selection of lidar based eis to map the erosion regulation service all eis were summed to form a composite index to do this the proxy based mapping framework provided by schmidt et al 2020 was used as a reference to construct the sediment erosion control sec index schmidt et al 2020 performed a redundancy analysis to eliminate highly correlated indicators to avoid including redundant information in the index in the present study pls replaced redundancy analysis in selecting the variables that explained sediment yield the normalization step and index construction were maintained normalization of indicators was required to constrain the index range between 0 and 1 eis having a positive or negative relationship with sediment yield were normalized as follows 7 e i n o r m positive ei e i min e i max e i min 8 e i n o r m negative e i max e i e i max e i min where eimin and eimax are respectively the minimum and maximum value of the ei for the test area the sec index was constructed by summing all individual indicators 9 sec index i 1 n ei norm i w i where sec is the sediment erosion control index einorm is a normalized ei w is the weight applied to i indicators and n is the total number of indicators in this study equal weights were applied to all indicators for the sake of simplicity 4 5 assessing the accuracy of the sec index with swat in step5 accuracy of the sec index was assessed by comparing results to sediment yield outputs that were obtained from swat to do this two methods were used spearman rank correlation rho and a confusion matrix since lidar data were acquired in 2016 results of sediment yield from swat close to that period were first selected using observed cutovers from 2011 to 2015 sediment yield t ha year from the period 2011 2015 were averaged to obtain a unique value to compare with the sec index a second period covering the years 2006 to 2015 was also tested since hydrological function recovery has been observed over the long term arthur et al 1998 brown et al 2005 observed cutovers for the period 2006 2015 were used for that second simulation spearman rank correlations were used to compare ranked observations between two sets of data one set was represented by the sub watershed rank values of sediment yield that were obtained from swat with the cutover scenario the other set was the sub watershed ranks obtained with the sec index data the rho values are bounded by 1 and 1 a value of 1 indicates perfect negative correlation between two sets of ranked observations i e syld vs sec while a value of 1 indicates perfect positive correlation between the two ranked sets for the confusion matrix the same two datasets were classified into 5 classes with the natural break approach classes ranged from very poor to poor average good and very good since the relationship between sediment yield and sec index is negative the classes were reversed for the index the overall agreement of the confusion matrix was used to determine the performance of our sec index 5 results 5 1 sensitivity analysis of swat to the cutover scenario the performance statistics of swat for predicting streamflow on a daily time step were nse of 0 64 r2 of 0 67 and pbias of 18 for calibration and nse of 0 62 r2 of 0 65 and pbias of 22 for validation reduction in forest cover between the baseline and cutover scenario ranged from 0 to 74 fig 5 a forest cover losses were highest for sub watersheds 12 74 10 68 7 50 1 40 14 40 5 39 2 38 4 30 increases in syld ranged from 0 to 81 fig 5b syld increases were highest for sub watersheds 10 average 81 3 12 80 5 2 79 7 7 78 9 and 4 72 2 sub watersheds27 9 11 3 17 and 1 showed increases in syld over 30 ranging from 59 2 for sub watershed27 and 37 4 for sub watershed 1 in most of the sub watersheds 26 of 31 either the absence of cutovers corresponded with an absence of change in syld or the increase in syld corresponded to a loss of forest cover when comparing deltas fig 6 however loss of forest cover from cutovers did not always result in a syld increase fig 6 sub watersheds 9 11 17 and 23 had a strong increase in syld despite a low loss of forest cover whereas sub watershed 14 exhibited a moderate to high loss of forest cover but a low increase in syld excluding 0 0 pairs the correlation coefficient of loss of forest cover and syld is r 0 78 p 0 0001 n 23 5 2 lidar based ecological indicators of sediment yield average sediment yield syld outputs that were derived from swat varied between 0 04 and 12 28 t ha yr descriptive statistics of the potential explanatory variables for syld are reported in table 3 pearson correlation analysis identified significant correlations p 0 05 between variables that were simulated with swat and the potential explanatory variables fig 7 moderate positive correlations were found between syld and edgedensity 0 69 cutovers 0 67 and urban 0 52 syld and forest had a weak negative correlation 0 45 other variables had significant correlations with syld but these were 0 4 some explanatory variables had strong positive correlations with other explanatory variables for example cutovers and edgedensity 0 98 cutovers and proxindex 0 8 chwidth and sup 0 98 chwidth and chlength 0 92 chlength and sup 0 92 and chlength and mainlength 0 85 other relationships had moderate correlations including edgedensity and proxindex 0 74 sup and mainlength 0 73 contagion and patchcohesion 0 71 forest and cutovers 0 69 and wetland and slope 0 68 the total variance of syld explained with pls was 63 2 the first principal component of pls explained 54 3 of variation in syld the second component explained 6 5 of the syld variance and the third components 2 4 with the exception of yearave vips that were 1 from the pls regression were selected for the sec index table 4 yearave was not included in the sec index because the data that were available to represent yearave were spatially homogenous across the hrw moreover this study did not focus on temporal evaluation of erosion regulation capacity yearave mainlength cutovers and patchcohesion had negative relationships with syld whereas forest chlength and sup had positive relationships with syld as indicated by the signs of their weights the three morphometric variables were selected for the sec index despite their strong or moderate correlations with one another fig 7 in contrast to the other non lidar morphometric variables chlength mainlength and sup had a wide range of values among the sub watersheds table 3 the ei representing chlength mainlength and sup that were developed with lidar and non lidar data were similar with deltas of 5 12 and 2 respectively fig 8 non lidar variables came from the swat model setup the spatial distribution of the morphometric variables that were derived from the lidar dtm are presented in fig 9 a and 9b the variable sup refers to the area of the watershed and can be observed with the delineation of the sub watersheds on fig 9 two land use variables were identified as vips i e forest and cutovers table 4 at the sub watershed level the percentage of forest and cutovers varied from 24 to 95 and from 0 to 71 respectively table 3 chp in undisturbed forest no cutovers indicated a dominant overstory layer at 11 m whereas the dominant vegetation for cutovers was 2 m tall fig 10 a this suggested that the vegetation structure of undisturbed forest was 11 m or greater and that low vegetation or cutovers had a vegetation structure under 2 m the plots extracted from the cutover of 2000 16 years after timber harvesting showed a pattern of vegetation regrowth to a 5 m height fig 10a thus the vegetation structure between 5 and 11 m could represent regenerating stands the boxplots shown in fig 10 indicated which metrics perform the best to distinguish undisturbed forest from regenerating stands maximum height fig 10b and p95 fig 10c were strongly related with chps fig 10a but p95 better differentiated between cutover years outliers that were found with maximum height fig 10b in cutover years2006 2010 and 2015 reduced the ability to identify cutover years p95 exhibited less variation within each year of reference fig 10c and consequently was adopted to identify regenerating stands more specifically the condition p95 5 m was tested to determine whether it was suitable for spatially representing cutover patches the other three metrics in contrast could not sufficiently differentiate between cutover years fig 10d f the spatial comparison of two land use states reveals great similarity between i cells with p95 5 m and ii cells with p95 5 m the former represents low vegetation or cutovers while the latter cells represent high vegetation or forest with non lidar data of cutover ei in fig 11 a the cutover polygons are shown according to the year that they were harvested green for 1995 2005 yellow for 2006 2010 and red for 2011 2015 in fig 11b the cells of the p95 5m raster that fall within a cutover polygon are coloured using the same range for that of cutover years green for 1995 2005 yellow for 2006 2010 and red for 2011 2015 cells of p95 5m outside of cutover polygons are coloured in grey fig 11b good correspondence was observed between the cutover polygons fig 11a and the p95 values that were under 5 m fig 11b for instance recent cutovers 2011 2015 red polygons in fig 11a were well represented by pixels of p95 5m falling in same polygons red coloured cells in fig 11b p95 5m also corresponded with cutovers that occurred between 2006 and 2010 yellow polygons in fig 11a and yellow coloured cells fig 11b cutover polygons from the period 1995 2005 green polygons fig 11a were noticeable with the p95 5m as shown by green coloured cells in fig 11b but less evident it should be noted that sub watersheds1 and 19 had several closely occurring cells of p95 5m that could look like cutovers but these were not represented in fig 11a other sub watershed had cells of p95 5m that were sparsely distributed depicted as grey cells in fig 11b the final category of variables explaining syld from pls was the landscape pattern variables for which the selected vip was patchcohesion table 4 from the non lidar ei this variable had a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6075 which represented the widest range of values among sub watersheds when compared to the other landscape pattern variables table 3 therefore patchcohesion was selected to form part of the sec index the comparison between the non lidar and lidar estimates of land use variables cutovers forest and the landscape pattern variable patchcohesion revealed that a better match was obtained between the lidar ei and the non lidar ei when using the cutover polygons of 2006 2015 fig 12 b with deltas that were respectively 73 10 and 44 than when using the cutover polygons of 2011 2015 fig 12a with deltas that were respectively 85 16 and 63 this response follows the same trend as seen in fig 11b where p95 5m identifies cutovers from timber harvests between 2011 and 2015 as well as between 2006 and 2010 the lidar based variables for land use and landscape patterns suggest that regenerating stands after timber activities are detectable for at least 10 years in hrw from the p95 5m raster cutover patches fig 13 a and forest fig 13b can be mapped after which patchcohesion can be obtained the final sec index shows the overall capacity of sub watersheds in the hrw to regulate erosion by reducing sediment yield fig 14 g globally sub watersheds in the hrw perform well in controlling sediment erosion 27 of 31 sub watersheds were classified as very good good or average however the sec index value of sub watershed 10 is very poor very poor values in sub watershed 10 were noted for cutover fig 14c and sup fig 14f and poor values were noted for forest fig 14b chlength fig 14d and patchcohesion fig 14e 5 3 sediment yield from swat and the proxy based sec index according to spearman rank correlation analysis for the period 2011 2015 there was a significant negative correlation between swat output and the proxy based sec index rho 0 45 p 0 05 n 31 the negative coefficient was expected since we compared syld with the sec index almost 78 of classes for the 31 sub watersheds from the predicted sec index fell into the same or an adjacent syld class from swat fig 15 a for the period 2006 2015 fig 15b there was an even stronger negative correlation between swat output and the proxy based sec index rho 0 60 p 0 05 n 31 in terms of overall agreement 87 of classes for the 31 sub watersheds from the predicted sec index fell into the same or an adjacent syld class from swat when comparing both cases the period 2006 2015 always yielded better results than did 2011 2015 mapped results for syld from swat and the sec index are presented in fig 16 the cross hatching fig 16b reveals the sub watersheds 27 of 31 having a similar class or differing by only one class 6 discussion this study demonstrated the capacity of lidar for mapping sec as an index of the erosion regulation ecosystem service our lidar derived sec map was considered to be in 87 agreement with the map of sediment yield classes that were produced with the swat model of the 31 sub watersheds in hrw 27 were classified as belonging to the same or to an adjacent class this comparison was possible after demonstrating that 1 the swat model for hrw was able to simulate sediment yield increases from cutovers and that 2 explanatory variables of sediment yield that were identified with swat could be mapped using lidar data our combined use of swat with a proxy based mapping approach resulted in the development of a lidar based index of the erosion regulation service several methodological objectives were achieved first the study identified variables explaining sediment yields in a forested boreal watershed using the pls and the swat model seven variables representing climate land use morphometrics and landscape patterns capture the complexity of interactions in hrw table 4 yearly average precipitation yearave percentage of forest area forest and percentage of cutover area cutover were among the significant explanatory variables that are consistent with those identified in previous studies giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 pls regression results further suggested patchcohesion other studies included landscape patterns variables boongaling et al 2018 liu et al 2018 yet our study stands out by applying the patch cohesion index to the cutover patches which had not been experimented in studies using the pls and swat model combined three morphometrics variables were also significant in our study i the main channel length mainlength ii the channel length chlength and iii the sub watershed area sup selection of these variables is consistent with brogna et al 2017 who found that hes were affected not only by land cover but also by the effect of topography although the musle equation considers topographic factors slope length and angle of slope slope was not selected in our study possibly due to the fact that the steepest slopes category was 7 schmidt et al 2020 on the contrary an increase in sediment yield was reported in steeply sloped timber areas by arthur et al 1998 but slopes in that study ranged from 25 to 45 a combination of slope and channel length as potential explanatory variables should be further tested to explain sediment yield the signs of the relationships between selected explanatory variables agreed with other studies with forest area channel length and sub watershed area having an inverse relationship with sediment yield arthur et al 1998 cl√©ment et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2014 for hrw this study successfully used the swat model to select variables and further to map the sec index from lidar based indicators identification of explanatory variables with the aid of the swat model reduced uncertainties by minimizing possible non random errors that were due to missing explanatory variables kangas et al 2018 this methodology can be generalized to other watershed contexts perhaps leading to a different list of selected explanatory variables yet the selection for boreal forest reflects the complexity of the interactions in a watershed second this study demonstrated the use of lidar data to develop ei of explanatory variables for the erosion regulation service the p95 metric with a 5 m threshold provided the most accurate spatial representation of cutovers in hrw timber harvesting activities are mainly cutovers with deciduous trees and a few small coniferous trees often left standing the use of maximum height to detect cutovers was affected by the presence of those standing trees that were left after harvesting several authors have dealt with the assessment of stand height for areas under regeneration and our study suggests a method to assess the height threshold in a simple manner the p95 5m clearly discriminated cutover patches for periods of about 10 years i e for the periods 2011 2015 and 2006 2010 fig 12 the use of p95 5m to identify cutover patches was less obvious for the period 1995 2005 but it was possible to identify cutovers during this earlier period for sub watersheds 1 13 15 23 and 27 remaining gaps within the regenerating stand may have created some confusion regarding the identification of cutover areas as it was the case in sub watersheds 8 9 16 18 and 19 in these cases p95 5m represented shrubs rather than cutovers the very poor and poor classes for forest can also be attributed to the strong presence of wetlands cutovers or lakes nevertheless areas of short vegetation can reduce the sediment control capacity of the sub watershed and p95 5m was suitably efficient in informing on the percentage of area in the watershed that was not covered by trees taller than 5 m furthermore p95 5m could be used to derive patchcohesion as the latter was identified as an important variable contributing to sediment yield many sub watersheds had poor or average values for patchcohesion in the sec index fig 14e which was not observed for cutover moreover forest managers could use the p95 5m indicator in forest sustainability management since cutover patches are still detectable after many years for slow growing boreal forests such as hrw third this study also demonstrated the combination of lidar derived ei into a sediment erosion control sec index that could be used to map the erosion regulation service our hypothesis was that a map of the sec index derived with lidar based ei would yield estimates that are comparable to those predicted by swat although hydrological models are an imperfect representation of the processes that are involved they rely upon biophysical data and on calibrated values to forecast sediment yield which is closer to field experiments than relying upon expert judgment causal relationships or lookup tables crossman et al 2013 francesconi et al 2016 kangas et al 2018 therefore validation of our lidar based sec index for mapping the erosion regulation service using the swat model provided a means to validate hes mapping the overall agreement of 87 between our lidar based sec index with the swat sediment yield output demonstrates that the construction of our index was appropriate generally the sec index tended to underestimate the class when compared to the corresponding swat classes this underestimation may be attributed either to overestimates of p95 5m due to low vegetation in cutover areas or to shrubs or overestimation of wetland areas leading to lower forest area our combined use of swat and a proxy based methodology has many advantages ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 first it avoids subjectivity in indicator selection or when defining interrelations between indicators kandziora et al 2013 using pls regression to select explanatory variables explaining sediment yield from swat allowed us to retain a preliminary list of variables that were highly correlated which would not have been possible using only pearson correlation coefficients second pls regression reduced uncertainties by limiting non random errors due to variation of indicators across the watershed kangas et al 2018 using the semi distributed swat model allowed us to simulate sediment yield outputs in all 31 sub watersheds in hrw while considering constant parameters and local characteristics from hru third use of pls allowed us to quantify the effects of land use changes and consider the landscape pattern within the complex interactions of a watershed kangas et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in contrast two limitations of our study are noteworthy first not all vips that were identified with pls regression could be included in the sec index although climate has been recognized as one of the main drivers of water quality giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 precipitation could not be included in our index because the data available for representing precipitation were invariant for the hrw studies with variable precipitation throughout the study site should include precipitation in the sec index second the primary list of potential explanatory variables was limited to those that could be considered in swat therefore the contribution of roads and their effects on sediment delivery were not tested al chokhachy et al 2016 schmidt et al 2020 takken et al 2008 despite these limitations lidar derived ei could be used to develop a sec index for other boreal forest watersheds however the height threshold for the p95 should be adapted to the context especially for watersheds with different climate conditions or extensive deforestation while providing a list of explanatory variables for a boreal forest watershed this study demonstrated the limits of adopting causal relationship to map hes by revealing new explanatory variables and assessing their potential effect on water quality using swat and pls regression the selection of cutover as an explanatory variable was expected khanal and parajuli 2013 moreover sub watersheds having 25 or more of cutovers were classified as average to very poor using swat brogna et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 tremblay et al 2008 however a few divergent results remained some sub watersheds predicted sediment yield increases with only a small proportion of cutovers whereas other sub watersheds predicted low sediment yield increases regardless of a large proportion of cutovers these results highlight the fact that cutover size may be a dominant factor but it does not explain sediment yield increases alone among the variables over which forest managers can exert control we found that larger cutover patches and more connected cutover patches had a negative effect on the sec index smaller cutover areas that are less connected may be beneficial in reducing sediment yield liu et al 2018 however they may increase sediment transportation especially at river crossings or on steep slopes al chokhachy et al 2016 liu et al 2018 forest managers should therefore plan scattered cutovers combined with best management practices to mitigate the potential impacts of timber harvesting on water quality anderson and lockaby 2011 arthur et al 1998 although the purpose of our study highlighted the use of lidar based ei rather than validating recovery time following disturbance the long regrowth cycle that is found in hrw suggests that timber activities may affect sediment control capacity at the watershed scale for 10 years moore and wondzell 2005 this result should guide forest managers to limit the planning of new timber activities in a sub watershed for a range of at least ten years our validation method using the swat model and the pls provided explanatory variables that were not found in the literature and provided a means to assess their effect on water quality other studies often took place in small paired watershed studies the results of which may not apply to larger watersheds or tested with dummy datasets which may not apply to real life timber harvesting in a watershed khanal and parajuli 2013 peraza castro et al 2018 introducing lidar based indicators to map ecosystem services increases our ability to describe spatially and temporally the explanatory variables to map hes andrew et al 2014 wulder et al 2013 the sec index could be used in turn to monitor the aquatic habitat quality and water quality for forest certification planning and aid decision makers in defining appropriate areas and locations for timber harvesting activities jaung et al 2018 savilaakso and guariguata 2017 a few suggestions to improve the study were noted that deserve to be mentioned first the potential explanatory variables that were included in the pls model only explained about 65 of sediment yield output from the swat model since no validation dataset on sediment load was available for hrw it was not possible to validate the swat performance for sediment load consequently we relied upon calibration and validation of water quantity using a long term dataset to improve the performance of swat in simulating sediment yield arnold et al 1998 finer adjustments of swat parameters might also help to represent more accurately all processes that are affected by timber activities in sub watersheds for example water bodies and wetlands were not taken into account for the hrw however their capacity to collect sediment load can be modelled in swat jalowska and yuan 2019 bmps for salmon rivers and spawning streams are applied in hrw filter strips but these were not simulated in swat yet cho et al 2011 and moriasi et al 2011 have shown it can be done another limitation was defining an appropriate way for which the effects of timber activities on sediment yield can be accounted blattert et al 2017 suggested that some eis may not follow a linear function but the estimation of a realistic function requires proper validation gr√™t regamey et al 2013 further studies are needed to provide the relationship between cutover area and hydrological recovery after timber harvesting for example lin and wei 2008 studied the effects of equivalent of clear cut area from timber activities on water quality using a 1950 2005 time series long time series are not frequently available as was the case for hrw but a review of their applications in boreal forests could substantially improve our understanding of hydrological recovery and development of realistic functions for hes mapping the limitations described so far can contribute to improved simulation of sediment yields with hydrological models and therefore provide a more rigorous link with variables explaining sediment yield however these suggested improvements do not represent a weakness in the methodology the framework that we have proposed combines a physically based model with lidar based ei and provides a reproducible method lidar data offer new perspectives for ecosystem services mapping in hes and for other ecosystem services that are applicable to watersheds dominated by forest cover lidar data can contribute to mapping forest attributes that are relevant to monitoring other ecological services that are provided by forests such as wood provisioning vauhkonen 2018 vauhkonen and ruotsalainen 2017 and carbon sequestration and storage blattert et al 2017 hudak et al 2012 zhao and sander 2015 using lidar based ei for trade off analysis between ecosystem services in a forest watershed context is a promising avenue for land managers to take advantage of ei maps bennett et al 2009 forio et al 2015 sutherland et al 2016 lastly hydrological models can further contribute to improving proxy based methods for hes mapping based upon lidar data or other secondary data kangas et al 2018 ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 for instance they can be used to quantify the weight of individual eis in constructing composite indices schmidt et al 2020 shi et al 2014 and provide a framework for building and testing management scenarios towards more efficient erosion control including potential benefits of best management practices lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 moreover our approach is well designed for temporal studies including precipitation while helping to adjust decision making in future climate conditions for sustainable forest management brogna et al 2017 giles hansen et al 2019 peraza castro et al 2018 7 conclusions in this study we demonstrate that the swat model and pls regression was effective for identifying variables that represent the complex interactions in watersheds and influence sediment yield in a boreal forest watershed while it is widely accepted that water quality in boreal forest watersheds are affected by cutovers this study confirmed that climate yearly average precipitation morphometric main channel length channel length sub watershed area land use forest cutovers and landscape pattern patch cohesion index variables identified with swat also significantly affected sediment yield in the hrw we also demonstrate the use of lidar data to derive important explanatory variables the contribution of which p95 5m was particularly significant to identify cutovers using all explanatory variables except precipitation we established that a lidar based sec index could be used to map erosion control at the landscape level finally we conclude that a map of the sec index derived with lidar based ei yielded estimates that are comparable to those predicted by the swat for the hrw the lidar based sec map performed accurately in 87 of the sub watersheds when compared with sediment yield classes that were derived from swat over a 10 year period this is a significant finding because proxy based methods are easier to use than hydrologic models and important tools for mapping hes in scarce data environments further the adoption of lidar data to derive ei for mapping ecosystem services is a promising way to increase precision and reliability to support the proxy based approach beyond our study there is potential for the methods to be applied to other areas where major land use change can be observed and where water quality is an issue for example all of the variables explaining sediment yields can be derived in a straightforward way with lidar data and using existing tools further the lidar derived eis could be used to develop a sec index for other boreal forest watersheds however the height threshold for p95 should be adapted to the context especially for watersheds with different climate conditions or extensive deforestation further our method to validate the erosion regulation service using swat could be reused in other watershed contexts and for other hes credit authorship contribution statement catherine

4780,maps of ecosystem services are becoming increasingly useful for reporting on the potential impacts of human activity on the environment however interactions in watersheds are complex and mapping hydrological ecosystem services hes requires indicators which accurately measure underlying processes the main objective of this study was to take advantage of the soil and water assessment tool swat and light detection and ranging lidar data to map the erosion regulation service for a managed boreal forest watershed to do so swat and partial least squares pls regression were used to select explanatory variables for sediment yield variables of importance in projection vip with a score 1 were selected to develop lidar based ecological indicators four categories of variables were identified as vip from the pls i climate annual precipitation ii land use forest cutovers iii land use patterns cutover patch cohesion index and iv morphometric main channel length channel length and sub watershed area the height of the 95th percentile of lidar returns p95 5 m provided the most accurate spatial representation of cutovers and the optimal cutover patch cohesion index other morphometrics were obtained from a lidar based digital terrain model explanatory variables for sediment yield were combined in a sediment erosion control sec index except for yearly average precipitation because the sec index is not actually used as a temporal index as expected a negative relationship was found between sediment yield and sec index rankings for the 2006 2015 period spearman rho 0 6 p 0 05 moreover the overall agreement between swat and sec index classes was 87 for 31 sub watersheds the study provides a list of relevant explanatory variables for modelling sediment yield in a boreal forest watershed where timber harvest activities occur it also demonstrates the use of lidar data for deriving an index of the erosion regulation ecosystem service in a proxy based approach as it had not been demonstrated previously at the watershed level the validation method applied here fills a gap in ecosystem services mapping that could benefit studies in other watershed contexts keywords lidar hydrological ecosystem services sustainable forest management swat sediment yield 1 introduction ecosystem services are generally defined as benefits that humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions costanza et al 2017 methods are being developed to quantify and map specific types of services such as hydrological ecosystem services hes brauman 2015 dennedy frank et al 2016 sun et al 2017 however these methods are often limited by the complexity of interactions at play in watersheds dennedy frank et al 2016 quantifying a watershed s capacity to provide hes could be achieved by calculating ecological indicators ei de groot et al 2010 fisher et al 2009 kandziora et al 2013 ei are considered here as measures of ecosystem components structures and processes and therefore related to a watershed s ability to supply hes burkhard et al 2012 cimon morin et al 2013 dale and beyeler 2001 seppelt et al 2011 climatic variability and cumulative disturbance are the two main drivers that result in changes in water quality and water quantity giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 yet the hydrologic response to timber harvest activities remains a difficult challenge to quantify brogna et al 2017 hawthorne et al 2013 wei and zhang 2010 some studies have reported that timber harvesting results in an increase in annual water yield arthur et al 1998 khanal and parajuli 2013 while others more equivocally report either a decrease or no change bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 other studies show that water yield increases in the first years following timber harvest and then decreases as the forest regenerates carvalho santos et al 2014 swank et al 2001 it could take up to 10 years for water yield to return to pre treatment levels this time frame is hard to define given the paucity of long term studies assessing post treatment equilibrium states in watersheds arthur et al 1998 some studies have concluded that a threshold of 20 to 25 of timber harvest area is required before a measurable hydrologic response can be detected brogna et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 tremblay et al 2008 moreover these studies were undertaken in small watersheds 100 km2 and may not be transferable or scalable to larger watersheds increases in sediment yield after harvest activities have also been reported with an increase of peak flow molina et al 2012 troendle and olsen 1994 these conflicting results suggest limitations of adopting causal relationships for hes mapping in a forest watershed context while proxy based approaches are renowned for their ease of use they could benefit from a validation method that is capable of assessing the effect of change in forest cover on water quality there are three main approaches to studying the effects of timber harvest activities on hydrological ecosystem services the first approach relies on paired watersheds which consist of a control and a treatment paired watershed studies are possible when working on small watersheds 100 km2 because they exhibit little variation in land use and conditions are easier to control conclusions drawn from these studies are difficult to apply to larger watersheds with greater complexity more land use classes and lakes or reservoirs hawthorne et al 2013 wei and zhang 2010 the second approach utilizes time series analysis which permits evaluations of sensitivity and resilience to timber harvest activities on large watersheds bosch and hewlett 1982 lin and wei 2008 yan et al 2018 but suitable time series datasets frequently are not available the last approach is based upon hydrological modelling the long term effect of forest management on water yield was studied with hydrological modelling with successful application of models and scenario development for selective cutting yu et al 2015 hydrologic models can also be used to spatialize changes in land cover simulate cutovers in a watershed and assess their impacts on specified outputs ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 quintero et al 2009 schmalz et al 2016 physically based or hydrologic watershed modelling has been used to reduce uncertainties in hes studies aznar s√°nchez et al 2019 francesconi et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 for example the invest tool sharp et al 2020 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 were used to study spatial patterns priorities and trade offs in water supply soil conservation and water purification with similar results cong et al 2020 vigerstol and aukema 2011 recommended the use of swat only if water related ecosystem services are being modelled and there are sufficient data and expertise swat has been used to study hydrologic responses to forest cover changes in watersheds peraza castro et al 2018 schmalz et al 2016 and can simulate several processes that are useful for hes therefore it is considered suitable for hes studies ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 despite the common use of hydrological models for quantifying hes they require a high level of knowledge and large amounts of data which may not always be available brogna et al 2017 schmalz et al 2016 vigerstol and aukema 2011 yu et al 2015 for these reasons one might prefer to map hes with proxies that are easier to use and more readily available without sufficient scientific rigour for the development or selection of indicators however such proxies may not provide appropriate information for monitoring or evaluating hes capacity dale and beyeler 2001 since the use of hydrological models for hes is largely accepted logsdon and chaubey 2013 quintero et al 2009 schmalz et al 2016 several studies have used them to determine explanatory variables that are responsible for water quality degradation but none of them apply to boreal forest watersheds aladejana et al 2018 shi et al 2014 yan et al 2018 moreover hydrological models are used less frequently to validate proxy based methods of mapping hes an exception is the study by schmidt et al 2020 who used swat to validate their proxy based method for mapping the sediment control service in their review on ecosystem service quantification boerema et al 2017 stated that 33 of 405 papers did not report any validation validating maps of ecosystem services remains a complex challenge seppelt et al 2011 taking advantage of the strength of the hydrological model is therefore an appropriate and innovative way of assuring a robust methodology for the development of new indicators light detection and ranging lidar data has proven its usefulness in forestry to the point of becoming one of the primary sources of data for forest management kane 2010 knapp et al 2018 lefsky et al 2002 for example nijland et al 2015 studied sensitivity to treatments in a boreal forest environment they found that specific metrics performed best in a conifer dominated context however they didn t use them to identify regenerating stage hawthorne et al 2013 identified thinning patterns from visual observations of canopy height profiles and maximum vegetation height metrics but they worked at the cutover patch level at a 2 m cell resolution which is not the appropriate level for watershed studies lidar has also proven to be reliable for providing stream width and length biron et al 2013 and identifying headwater streams lindsay and dhun 2015 murphy et al 2008 lidar data provide accurate digital terrain models dtm and can also be used to characterize forest structure consequently lidar is a good candidate for ecosystem services mapping andrew et al 2014 harpold et al 2015 simonson et al 2014 wulder et al 2013 lists of indicators for hes mapping in a forested watershed can help to identify potential proxies for mapping hes from lidar blattert et al 2017 brogna et al 2017 carvalho santos et al 2014 sutherland et al 2016 although lidar has been used to estimate forest biodiversity guo et al 2017 assess riparian habitat quality de sosa et al 2018 and water storage capacity guzha and shukla 2012 it has not been used to assess the erosion regulation service of large boreal forest watersheds using a proxy based framework the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the use of swat and lidar data to map the erosion regulation service for a managed boreal forest watershed the research was conducted in a boreal forest watershed which ranged between 500 and 1000 km2 where the sustainable forest management objective was maintenance of water quality at the sub watershed level the development of a lidar based hes framework for mapping the erosion regulation service is expected to benefit decision makers by increasing their capacity to make appropriate decisions regarding timber harvest areas and to report on indicators to environmental authorities the main goal was reached through three specific objectives i to identify explanatory variables of sediment yield in boreal forest watershed using the swat model ii to develop ei of these variables using lidar data and iii to combine these lidar derived ei into a sediment erosion control sec index to map the erosion regulation service our hypothesis was that a map of the sec index would yield estimates that are comparable to those predicted by swat 2 study area the harry river

hydrological model setup requires specific data as input namely dtm climate precipitation temperature soil type land cover and hydrometric data which were available from schmidt et al 2020 table 1 precipitation mm and temperature oc from 1980 to 2018 were available for two weather stations fig 1 the national hydrological network nhn was used to burn the stream while processing the dtm soil type was available from soil landscapes of canada version 3 2 and was considered homogeneous across the watershed original land cover data were available from canadian earth observation for sustainable development of forests eosd land cover data 2000 wulder et al 2008 and modified by schmidt et al 2020 hydrometric data are also required for the calibration and the validation of the swat model time series of daily discharge m3 s were available from 1980 to 2015 and daily sediment load for the period from 1980 to 1986 polygons of cutover areas for 1995 2018 were provided by cbppl airborne lidar data for hrw were acquired between 15 august and 24 september 2016 with a riegllms q680i at an altitude of 1000 m average point density was 7 34 pulses m2 point clouds were classified ground vegetation by the service provider a total of 739 tiles each measuring 1 km 1 km cover the study site 4 methodology our approach to defining suitable lidar based ei for mapping the erosion regulation service took advantage of swat and followed a methodological framework with five main steps fig 3 the swat model for hrw developed in a precedent study looking at es provided by forest schmidt et al 2020 was used here to support the development of our methodology in step1 the swat sensitivity to cutovers was validated for sediment yield outputs in step2 variables of importance for explaining sediment yield were identified using partial least squares pls regression in step3 lidar metrics or lidar dtm explanatory variables were derived for use in a proxy based mapping framework in step 4 a sediment erosion control sec index was constructed to quantify the erosion regulation service finally in step5 the sediment yield output from swat was compared with the sec index this last step provided a quantitative assessment of the proxy based framework for mapping sec with lidar based ei 4 1 modelling sediment yield with the swat hydrological model swat is a physically based semi distributed river basin model that takes as input temperature and precipitation and that also uses characteristics derived from land use soil type and dtm such as slopes and watershed delineation arnold et al 2012 in our study modification of the land use data with cutovers was exploited to simulate timber harvest activities sediment yield estimation with swat is based upon the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 1 sed 11 8 q surf q area area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle c f r g where qsurf is the surface runoff volume mm h2o ha qarea is the peak runoff rate m3 s areahru is the area m2 kusle is the usle soil erodibility factor k cusle is the usle cover and management factor c pusle is the usle support practice factor p lsusle is the usle topographic factor ls and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor surface runoff in turn can be computed with the usda soil conservation service scs curve number cn procedure khanal and parajuli 2013 musle is computed at the level of hydrological response unit hru whereby hru are units with similar soil land use and slope which are represented as proportions of the sub watershed arnold et al 2012 in a previous study of hrw schmidt et al 2020 defined 0 3 3 7 and 7 slope classes each class had a similar number of hrus soil type was homogeneous for hrw and cutovers were incorporated in the land use raster using cutover areas that were provided by the forest industry operating in hrw timber harvest activities prior to 1995 were not available this forest cutover land use class fcut was added to the swat database and assigned a curve number for moisture condition cn2 of 65 and a usle p factor of 1 which considers that no best management practices bmps are used woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 whereas for evergreen forest frse cn2 was set to 55 as was proposed by khanal and parajuli 2013 the cn2 and the usle p factor were adjusted for urban urbn 1 and wetland wetl 0 0664 cover fcut land use was further used to understand the effect of cutovers on sediment yield in the hydrological model the watershed was first divided into sub watersheds 31 for hrw according to topographic and hydrographic conditions that consider spatial heterogeneity the area was further divided into hru 361 for hrw the hru are not contiguous but they can account for processes occurring at the sub watershed level the fraction of each land use was obtained by calculating its area km2 in each sub watershed divided by the area of that sub watershed km2 prior to performing simulations swat was calibrated to local conditions schmidt et al 2020 used 20 parameters to calibrate for water quantity and 6 for water quality global sensitivity analysis was performed to adjust parameters arnold et al 2012 the period from 1980 to 1990 was used for streamflow calibration including three years of warm up using the semi automated parameter solution parasol from the swat calibration and uncertainty procedure arnold et al 2012 van griensven and meixner 2007 nash sutcliff efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate model performance gupta and kling 2011 schmidt et al 2020 tarigan et al 2018 results are considered good when nse was 0 75 satisfactory when nse was between 0 36 and 0 75 and unsatisfactory when nse was 0 36 nash and sutcliffe 1970 khanal and parajuli 2013 yan et al 2018 sediment load calibration was performed with the 1980 1986 daily sediment load it would have been preferable if the calibration represented the same years as the modeling results however the calibration data used were the only sufficient years of data available for the study site schmidt et al 2020 validation of swat outputs was necessary to demonstrate that parameter adjustment was sufficiently accurate for simulation according to the project s objectives arnold et al 2012 validation of streamflow was conducted on the 1990 1995 period moriasi et al 2007 suggested that model performance was satisfactory when 0 5 nse 0 65 and when pbias 55 for sediment yield similarly khanal and parajuli 2013 suggested that calibration was satisfactory with nse of 0 62 r2 of 0 68 and pbias of 22 although it was not possible to validate sediment load due to a lack of data it has been shown that long term water quantity data for calibration and validation can overcome scarce water quality information arnold et al 2012 in this study step 1 swat was used to simulate the impact of cutovers on sediment yield outputs to do this swat was first run under the baseline or reference scenario which is based on initial land cover spatial data fig 4 a for the baseline scenario the fraction of hru corresponding to fcut in each sub watershed was transferred to hru corresponding to frse the fraction of the hru corresponding to fcut was set to 0 as if no cutovers had been performed sediment yield values t ha were available for the 31 sub watersheds sub on a daily basis for each year from 1995 to 2018 cutovers and precipitation are foreseen as potential explanatory variable for sediment yield it was hence preferred to select the same time period to run the swat model second swat was run under the cutover scenario by changing the fraction of the corresponding hru from frse to fcut in each sub watershed fig 4b differences in sediment yield between the baseline scenario and the cutover scenario were analyzed to determine whether the model could simulate timber harvest activities and therefore if it was well suited for the purpose of this study these differences or deltas were obtained by subtracting the value of the cutover scenario from the value of the baseline scenario and dividing the results by the baseline scenario value 4 2 identifying potential explanatory variables of sediment yield for the cutover scenario the aim of step2 was to identify potential explanatory variables for sediment yield using a historical cutover scenario since swat was run on a daily time step sediment yields were summed for each year from 1995 to 2018 for each of the 31 sub watersheds giving annual estimates of sediment yield t ha as the dependent variable potential explanatory variables were grouped into four different categories climate land use landscape patterns and morphometric table 2 although soil was considered to be important it was not selected as a potential explanatory variable in this study because available soil data were homogenous for hrw a pls regression model was then used to establish a relationship between the potential explanatory variables and the sediment yield outputs for the hrw variables that were selected in this step further guided those to include as lidar based ei in the sec index the proportion of land use was obtained by calculating the area km2 in each sub watershed divided by the area of that sub watershed km2 seven potential land use variables were considered agriculture cutover area forest non forest area barren and range urban water and wetlands five landscape pattern variables were calculated on the cutover patches contagion edge density patch cohesion index patch density and proximity index input data include the 20 m 20 m land use raster with fcut i e the modified input land cover data preparation prior to landscape pattern analysis included a reclassification step to derive a final raster where cutovers 1 and other land uses 0 landscape pattern indicators were measured for each sub watershed individually to represent the spatially explicit effects of timber harvesting on hydrological processes all landscape pattern variables were computed in r version 3 6 5 using sdmtools vanderwal et al 2019 or following steps in fletcher and fortin 2018 the contagion index refers to the probability of a land cover type being adjacent to a different land cover type from the equation 2 2 contagion 1 i 1 n j 1 n p ij l n p ij 2 l n n where pij pipj i and 3 p j i n ij n i where n is the number of land cover types and p is the proportions of the landscape for the land cover types classes small dispersed patches have a low contagion index value whereas large contiguous patches have a high contagion index mcgarigal and marks 1994 the cohesion index was also calculated for cutover patches with the following equation 4 cohesion 1 j 1 n p ij j 1 n p ij a ij 1 1 z 100 where a ij is the area m2 of patch ij in terms of number of cells p ij is the perimeter of patch ij in terms of number of cells and z is the total number of cells in the landscape cohesion index values between 0 and 100 are possible where values near 0 mean that the class of interest is composed of disconnected patches its value increases as patches become more aggregated i e more physically connected gustafson 2018 in addition the proximity index was used to measure patch isolation gustafson and parker 1994 5 proximity index j 1 n a j d ij 2 where a is the area of the patch and d which is the edge edge distance to other patches within a focal neighbourhood is defined here as 1000 m fletcher and fortin 2018 the proximity index has a high value when a patch is surrounded by large nearby patches the value of the index decreases when a given patch is surrounded by smaller and sparser patches seven morphometric variables were readily available from the swat setup with the arcswat plugin in arcgis and were added to the list of potential explanatory variables i channel slope ii longest tributary channel length iii channel width iv length of the main channel v average slope of the main channel and vi area and vii average slope table 2 proportion of steep slopes was also used as an explanatory variable which was available from the proportion of hru that was defined as steep slope 7 for each of the 31 sub watersheds topographic wetness index twi was obtained with the saga wetness index from the saga tools in qgis v3 4 from the swat input dtm from equation 6 twi ln a tan Œ≤ where a is the upslope area draining through a given point in the dtm per unit contour length and tan Œ≤ is the local slope in radians beven and kirkby 1979 twi is a relative index where values of 75th percentile were considered as good for water and sediment retention pearson product moment correlation r was used to study the relationship among the explanatory variables correlations were considered to be strong when the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ranged between r 0 80 and 1 00 moderate between 0 50 and 0 80 and weak when 0 50 partial least squares regression pls was used to identify explanatory variables for sediment yield in the cutover scenario pls uses principal component analysis pca to predict dependent variables from independent variables which are identified as predictors abdi 2010 pls is a form of multivariate multiple regression that can develop a predictive model from a large number of independent variables despite having a small number of observations another justification for employing pls was that the set of variables does not have to follow a normal distribution and can be highly correlated wold et al 2001 when considered as a fixed effect model rather than as a predictive model the observations are not only a sample of the population but they also represent the population of interest abdi 2010 a number of latent variables in the model can also be measured with wold s criterion to run pls all potential explanatory variables were assembled in a matrix in which the y variable was determined as sediment yield syld in t ha year from swat for the cutover scenario and the x variables which are the potential explanatory variables all variables were normalized by dividing them by their standard deviations and centered by subtracting averages from all variables boongaling et al 2018 wold et al 2001 the mdatools package in r kucheryavskiy 2019 was used to run pls variables of importance in projection vip that are 1 best explain the dependent variable although vip 0 8 are also considered as relevant aladejana et al 2018 from pls a suite of variables explaining the sediment yield response from swat was obtained and used to develop lidar based ei 4 3 deriving lidar based ecological indicators ei three of the four categories of potential variables explaining sediment yield from swat for the cutover simulation could be derived from lidar data and served as ei for the erosion regulation service these included morphometric land use and landscape patterns climate variables representing the fourth category could not benefit from lidar land use and landscape pattern variables were derived from the 3d structural information that was available from the lidar point clouds mainly by locating cutover areas the morphometric variables were derived from the lidar dtm all variables that were derived from the lidar data provided a link to explaining sediment yield syld potential explanatory variables from the land use category forest cutovers and landscape pattern categories contagion edgedensity patchcohesion patchdensity proxindex were derived from lidar structural information other land uses remained unchanged agri nonforest urban water and wetlands the first step in the analysis involved identifying the cutovers to do so we computed lidar metrics for 25 plots in each of the 2015 2010 2006 and 2000 cutover areas and for an additional 25 plots outside the cutover areas resulting in 125 plots in total each plot was 400 m2 these plots were used to assess which lidar metric could best represent the year of harvesting a 1 m 1 m resolution dtm was produced using default parameters of the blast2dem tool from las tools isenburg 2018 with all points classified as ground surfaces this dtm was used to normalize point clouds and estimate canopy height above the ground with the lidr package in r version 2 3 1 roussel et al 2020 the lidr package was also used to produce the following five lidar metrics to serve as potential cutover identifiers i maximum height of all returns zmax in m ii height of the 95th percentile of all returns p95 iii coefficient of variation cv iv number of first returns above 2 m height divided by the total number of returns and v penetration number of first returns below 2 m divided by the total number of returns barber et al 2016 guo et al 2017 hawthorne et al 2013 nijland et al 2015 canopy height profiles chp were used as visual references to determine differences in distributions of the point clouds between years of timber harvesting chp were represented by the proportions of vegetation hits at different heights over the total number of hits from all plots in each cutover year hawthorne et al 2013 boxplots facilitated the selection of the best metric nijland et al 2015 once the metric was identified it was further tested on 20 m 20 m raster cells to separate cutover and forest areas the cell size of the raster 400 m2 is similar to the size of a field plot that is used by the industry separation of cutover and forest areas was achieved with a simple height threshold that was applied to the selected metric the raster from this metric was further used to derive landscape patterns based upon cutover patch areas from the methodology presented in section4 2 each land use and landscape variable that was obtained from the lidar point clouds in addition to agri nonforest urban water and wetlands were further calculated for each sub watershed and available as ei the morphometric variables table 3 were derived using the methodology presented in section 4 2 and using the 10 m 10 m resampled lidar instead of the 20 m 20 m resolution raster used for non lidar based ei the finer resolution dtm was used because of its ability to improve representation of field topography and to derive hydrological attributes lindsay 2006 woodrow et al 2016 the use of different resolutions to derive ei was not an issue since ei were calculated and used at the sub watershed level guzha and shukla 2012 showed that even a lidar dtm resampled to 10 m enhanced the capacity to map water storage compared to the 10 m 10 m national elevation dataset from the united states geological survey usgs we also avoided using the high resolution of 1 m 1 m dtm because it unnecessarily increased the computing time the latter was not required to study processes at the landscape level goulden et al 2014 moreover accurate knowledge was needed on how to remove errors due to high resolution or lower point cloud density under forest cover cho et al 2011 vianello et al 2009 woodrow et al 2016 the morphometric variables that were obtained with the lidar dtm were further calculated for each sub watershed and ready to use as ei 4 4 quantifying sec as an index of the erosion regulation service the previous steps guided the selection of lidar based eis to map the erosion regulation service all eis were summed to form a composite index to do this the proxy based mapping framework provided by schmidt et al 2020 was used as a reference to construct the sediment erosion control sec index schmidt et al 2020 performed a redundancy analysis to eliminate highly correlated indicators to avoid including redundant information in the index in the present study pls replaced redundancy analysis in selecting the variables that explained sediment yield the normalization step and index construction were maintained normalization of indicators was required to constrain the index range between 0 and 1 eis having a positive or negative relationship with sediment yield were normalized as follows 7 e i n o r m positive ei e i min e i max e i min 8 e i n o r m negative e i max e i e i max e i min where eimin and eimax are respectively the minimum and maximum value of the ei for the test area the sec index was constructed by summing all individual indicators 9 sec index i 1 n ei norm i w i where sec is the sediment erosion control index einorm is a normalized ei w is the weight applied to i indicators and n is the total number of indicators in this study equal weights were applied to all indicators for the sake of simplicity 4 5 assessing the accuracy of the sec index with swat in step5 accuracy of the sec index was assessed by comparing results to sediment yield outputs that were obtained from swat to do this two methods were used spearman rank correlation rho and a confusion matrix since lidar data were acquired in 2016 results of sediment yield from swat close to that period were first selected using observed cutovers from 2011 to 2015 sediment yield t ha year from the period 2011 2015 were averaged to obtain a unique value to compare with the sec index a second period covering the years 2006 to 2015 was also tested since hydrological function recovery has been observed over the long term arthur et al 1998 brown et al 2005 observed cutovers for the period 2006 2015 were used for that second simulation spearman rank correlations were used to compare ranked observations between two sets of data one set was represented by the sub watershed rank values of sediment yield that were obtained from swat with the cutover scenario the other set was the sub watershed ranks obtained with the sec index data the rho values are bounded by 1 and 1 a value of 1 indicates perfect negative correlation between two sets of ranked observations i e syld vs sec while a value of 1 indicates perfect positive correlation between the two ranked sets for the confusion matrix the same two datasets were classified into 5 classes with the natural break approach classes ranged from very poor to poor average good and very good since the relationship between sediment yield and sec index is negative the classes were reversed for the index the overall agreement of the confusion matrix was used to determine the performance of our sec index 5 results 5 1 sensitivity analysis of swat to the cutover scenario the performance statistics of swat for predicting streamflow on a daily time step were nse of 0 64 r2 of 0 67 and pbias of 18 for calibration and nse of 0 62 r2 of 0 65 and pbias of 22 for validation reduction in forest cover between the baseline and cutover scenario ranged from 0 to 74 fig 5 a forest cover losses were highest for sub watersheds 12 74 10 68 7 50 1 40 14 40 5 39 2 38 4 30 increases in syld ranged from 0 to 81 fig 5b syld increases were highest for sub watersheds 10 average 81 3 12 80 5 2 79 7 7 78 9 and 4 72 2 sub watersheds27 9 11 3 17 and 1 showed increases in syld over 30 ranging from 59 2 for sub watershed27 and 37 4 for sub watershed 1 in most of the sub watersheds 26 of 31 either the absence of cutovers corresponded with an absence of change in syld or the increase in syld corresponded to a loss of forest cover when comparing deltas fig 6 however loss of forest cover from cutovers did not always result in a syld increase fig 6 sub watersheds 9 11 17 and 23 had a strong increase in syld despite a low loss of forest cover whereas sub watershed 14 exhibited a moderate to high loss of forest cover but a low increase in syld excluding 0 0 pairs the correlation coefficient of loss of forest cover and syld is r 0 78 p 0 0001 n 23 5 2 lidar based ecological indicators of sediment yield average sediment yield syld outputs that were derived from swat varied between 0 04 and 12 28 t ha yr descriptive statistics of the potential explanatory variables for syld are reported in table 3 pearson correlation analysis identified significant correlations p 0 05 between variables that were simulated with swat and the potential explanatory variables fig 7 moderate positive correlations were found between syld and edgedensity 0 69 cutovers 0 67 and urban 0 52 syld and forest had a weak negative correlation 0 45 other variables had significant correlations with syld but these were 0 4 some explanatory variables had strong positive correlations with other explanatory variables for example cutovers and edgedensity 0 98 cutovers and proxindex 0 8 chwidth and sup 0 98 chwidth and chlength 0 92 chlength and sup 0 92 and chlength and mainlength 0 85 other relationships had moderate correlations including edgedensity and proxindex 0 74 sup and mainlength 0 73 contagion and patchcohesion 0 71 forest and cutovers 0 69 and wetland and slope 0 68 the total variance of syld explained with pls was 63 2 the first principal component of pls explained 54 3 of variation in syld the second component explained 6 5 of the syld variance and the third components 2 4 with the exception of yearave vips that were 1 from the pls regression were selected for the sec index table 4 yearave was not included in the sec index because the data that were available to represent yearave were spatially homogenous across the hrw moreover this study did not focus on temporal evaluation of erosion regulation capacity yearave mainlength cutovers and patchcohesion had negative relationships with syld whereas forest chlength and sup had positive relationships with syld as indicated by the signs of their weights the three morphometric variables were selected for the sec index despite their strong or moderate correlations with one another fig 7 in contrast to the other non lidar morphometric variables chlength mainlength and sup had a wide range of values among the sub watersheds table 3 the ei representing chlength mainlength and sup that were developed with lidar and non lidar data were similar with deltas of 5 12 and 2 respectively fig 8 non lidar variables came from the swat model setup the spatial distribution of the morphometric variables that were derived from the lidar dtm are presented in fig 9 a and 9b the variable sup refers to the area of the watershed and can be observed with the delineation of the sub watersheds on fig 9 two land use variables were identified as vips i e forest and cutovers table 4 at the sub watershed level the percentage of forest and cutovers varied from 24 to 95 and from 0 to 71 respectively table 3 chp in undisturbed forest no cutovers indicated a dominant overstory layer at 11 m whereas the dominant vegetation for cutovers was 2 m tall fig 10 a this suggested that the vegetation structure of undisturbed forest was 11 m or greater and that low vegetation or cutovers had a vegetation structure under 2 m the plots extracted from the cutover of 2000 16 years after timber harvesting showed a pattern of vegetation regrowth to a 5 m height fig 10a thus the vegetation structure between 5 and 11 m could represent regenerating stands the boxplots shown in fig 10 indicated which metrics perform the best to distinguish undisturbed forest from regenerating stands maximum height fig 10b and p95 fig 10c were strongly related with chps fig 10a but p95 better differentiated between cutover years outliers that were found with maximum height fig 10b in cutover years2006 2010 and 2015 reduced the ability to identify cutover years p95 exhibited less variation within each year of reference fig 10c and consequently was adopted to identify regenerating stands more specifically the condition p95 5 m was tested to determine whether it was suitable for spatially representing cutover patches the other three metrics in contrast could not sufficiently differentiate between cutover years fig 10d f the spatial comparison of two land use states reveals great similarity between i cells with p95 5 m and ii cells with p95 5 m the former represents low vegetation or cutovers while the latter cells represent high vegetation or forest with non lidar data of cutover ei in fig 11 a the cutover polygons are shown according to the year that they were harvested green for 1995 2005 yellow for 2006 2010 and red for 2011 2015 in fig 11b the cells of the p95 5m raster that fall within a cutover polygon are coloured using the same range for that of cutover years green for 1995 2005 yellow for 2006 2010 and red for 2011 2015 cells of p95 5m outside of cutover polygons are coloured in grey fig 11b good correspondence was observed between the cutover polygons fig 11a and the p95 values that were under 5 m fig 11b for instance recent cutovers 2011 2015 red polygons in fig 11a were well represented by pixels of p95 5m falling in same polygons red coloured cells in fig 11b p95 5m also corresponded with cutovers that occurred between 2006 and 2010 yellow polygons in fig 11a and yellow coloured cells fig 11b cutover polygons from the period 1995 2005 green polygons fig 11a were noticeable with the p95 5m as shown by green coloured cells in fig 11b but less evident it should be noted that sub watersheds1 and 19 had several closely occurring cells of p95 5m that could look like cutovers but these were not represented in fig 11a other sub watershed had cells of p95 5m that were sparsely distributed depicted as grey cells in fig 11b the final category of variables explaining syld from pls was the landscape pattern variables for which the selected vip was patchcohesion table 4 from the non lidar ei this variable had a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6075 which represented the widest range of values among sub watersheds when compared to the other landscape pattern variables table 3 therefore patchcohesion was selected to form part of the sec index the comparison between the non lidar and lidar estimates of land use variables cutovers forest and the landscape pattern variable patchcohesion revealed that a better match was obtained between the lidar ei and the non lidar ei when using the cutover polygons of 2006 2015 fig 12 b with deltas that were respectively 73 10 and 44 than when using the cutover polygons of 2011 2015 fig 12a with deltas that were respectively 85 16 and 63 this response follows the same trend as seen in fig 11b where p95 5m identifies cutovers from timber harvests between 2011 and 2015 as well as between 2006 and 2010 the lidar based variables for land use and landscape patterns suggest that regenerating stands after timber activities are detectable for at least 10 years in hrw from the p95 5m raster cutover patches fig 13 a and forest fig 13b can be mapped after which patchcohesion can be obtained the final sec index shows the overall capacity of sub watersheds in the hrw to regulate erosion by reducing sediment yield fig 14 g globally sub watersheds in the hrw perform well in controlling sediment erosion 27 of 31 sub watersheds were classified as very good good or average however the sec index value of sub watershed 10 is very poor very poor values in sub watershed 10 were noted for cutover fig 14c and sup fig 14f and poor values were noted for forest fig 14b chlength fig 14d and patchcohesion fig 14e 5 3 sediment yield from swat and the proxy based sec index according to spearman rank correlation analysis for the period 2011 2015 there was a significant negative correlation between swat output and the proxy based sec index rho 0 45 p 0 05 n 31 the negative coefficient was expected since we compared syld with the sec index almost 78 of classes for the 31 sub watersheds from the predicted sec index fell into the same or an adjacent syld class from swat fig 15 a for the period 2006 2015 fig 15b there was an even stronger negative correlation between swat output and the proxy based sec index rho 0 60 p 0 05 n 31 in terms of overall agreement 87 of classes for the 31 sub watersheds from the predicted sec index fell into the same or an adjacent syld class from swat when comparing both cases the period 2006 2015 always yielded better results than did 2011 2015 mapped results for syld from swat and the sec index are presented in fig 16 the cross hatching fig 16b reveals the sub watersheds 27 of 31 having a similar class or differing by only one class 6 discussion this study demonstrated the capacity of lidar for mapping sec as an index of the erosion regulation ecosystem service our lidar derived sec map was considered to be in 87 agreement with the map of sediment yield classes that were produced with the swat model of the 31 sub watersheds in hrw 27 were classified as belonging to the same or to an adjacent class this comparison was possible after demonstrating that 1 the swat model for hrw was able to simulate sediment yield increases from cutovers and that 2 explanatory variables of sediment yield that were identified with swat could be mapped using lidar data our combined use of swat with a proxy based mapping approach resulted in the development of a lidar based index of the erosion regulation service several methodological objectives were achieved first the study identified variables explaining sediment yields in a forested boreal watershed using the pls and the swat model seven variables representing climate land use morphometrics and landscape patterns capture the complexity of interactions in hrw table 4 yearly average precipitation yearave percentage of forest area forest and percentage of cutover area cutover were among the significant explanatory variables that are consistent with those identified in previous studies giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 pls regression results further suggested patchcohesion other studies included landscape patterns variables boongaling et al 2018 liu et al 2018 yet our study stands out by applying the patch cohesion index to the cutover patches which had not been experimented in studies using the pls and swat model combined three morphometrics variables were also significant in our study i the main channel length mainlength ii the channel length chlength and iii the sub watershed area sup selection of these variables is consistent with brogna et al 2017 who found that hes were affected not only by land cover but also by the effect of topography although the musle equation considers topographic factors slope length and angle of slope slope was not selected in our study possibly due to the fact that the steepest slopes category was 7 schmidt et al 2020 on the contrary an increase in sediment yield was reported in steeply sloped timber areas by arthur et al 1998 but slopes in that study ranged from 25 to 45 a combination of slope and channel length as potential explanatory variables should be further tested to explain sediment yield the signs of the relationships between selected explanatory variables agreed with other studies with forest area channel length and sub watershed area having an inverse relationship with sediment yield arthur et al 1998 cl√©ment et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2014 for hrw this study successfully used the swat model to select variables and further to map the sec index from lidar based indicators identification of explanatory variables with the aid of the swat model reduced uncertainties by minimizing possible non random errors that were due to missing explanatory variables kangas et al 2018 this methodology can be generalized to other watershed contexts perhaps leading to a different list of selected explanatory variables yet the selection for boreal forest reflects the complexity of the interactions in a watershed second this study demonstrated the use of lidar data to develop ei of explanatory variables for the erosion regulation service the p95 metric with a 5 m threshold provided the most accurate spatial representation of cutovers in hrw timber harvesting activities are mainly cutovers with deciduous trees and a few small coniferous trees often left standing the use of maximum height to detect cutovers was affected by the presence of those standing trees that were left after harvesting several authors have dealt with the assessment of stand height for areas under regeneration and our study suggests a method to assess the height threshold in a simple manner the p95 5m clearly discriminated cutover patches for periods of about 10 years i e for the periods 2011 2015 and 2006 2010 fig 12 the use of p95 5m to identify cutover patches was less obvious for the period 1995 2005 but it was possible to identify cutovers during this earlier period for sub watersheds 1 13 15 23 and 27 remaining gaps within the regenerating stand may have created some confusion regarding the identification of cutover areas as it was the case in sub watersheds 8 9 16 18 and 19 in these cases p95 5m represented shrubs rather than cutovers the very poor and poor classes for forest can also be attributed to the strong presence of wetlands cutovers or lakes nevertheless areas of short vegetation can reduce the sediment control capacity of the sub watershed and p95 5m was suitably efficient in informing on the percentage of area in the watershed that was not covered by trees taller than 5 m furthermore p95 5m could be used to derive patchcohesion as the latter was identified as an important variable contributing to sediment yield many sub watersheds had poor or average values for patchcohesion in the sec index fig 14e which was not observed for cutover moreover forest managers could use the p95 5m indicator in forest sustainability management since cutover patches are still detectable after many years for slow growing boreal forests such as hrw third this study also demonstrated the combination of lidar derived ei into a sediment erosion control sec index that could be used to map the erosion regulation service our hypothesis was that a map of the sec index derived with lidar based ei would yield estimates that are comparable to those predicted by swat although hydrological models are an imperfect representation of the processes that are involved they rely upon biophysical data and on calibrated values to forecast sediment yield which is closer to field experiments than relying upon expert judgment causal relationships or lookup tables crossman et al 2013 francesconi et al 2016 kangas et al 2018 therefore validation of our lidar based sec index for mapping the erosion regulation service using the swat model provided a means to validate hes mapping the overall agreement of 87 between our lidar based sec index with the swat sediment yield output demonstrates that the construction of our index was appropriate generally the sec index tended to underestimate the class when compared to the corresponding swat classes this underestimation may be attributed either to overestimates of p95 5m due to low vegetation in cutover areas or to shrubs or overestimation of wetland areas leading to lower forest area our combined use of swat and a proxy based methodology has many advantages ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 first it avoids subjectivity in indicator selection or when defining interrelations between indicators kandziora et al 2013 using pls regression to select explanatory variables explaining sediment yield from swat allowed us to retain a preliminary list of variables that were highly correlated which would not have been possible using only pearson correlation coefficients second pls regression reduced uncertainties by limiting non random errors due to variation of indicators across the watershed kangas et al 2018 using the semi distributed swat model allowed us to simulate sediment yield outputs in all 31 sub watersheds in hrw while considering constant parameters and local characteristics from hru third use of pls allowed us to quantify the effects of land use changes and consider the landscape pattern within the complex interactions of a watershed kangas et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in contrast two limitations of our study are noteworthy first not all vips that were identified with pls regression could be included in the sec index although climate has been recognized as one of the main drivers of water quality giles hansen et al 2019 li et al 2017 precipitation could not be included in our index because the data available for representing precipitation were invariant for the hrw studies with variable precipitation throughout the study site should include precipitation in the sec index second the primary list of potential explanatory variables was limited to those that could be considered in swat therefore the contribution of roads and their effects on sediment delivery were not tested al chokhachy et al 2016 schmidt et al 2020 takken et al 2008 despite these limitations lidar derived ei could be used to develop a sec index for other boreal forest watersheds however the height threshold for the p95 should be adapted to the context especially for watersheds with different climate conditions or extensive deforestation while providing a list of explanatory variables for a boreal forest watershed this study demonstrated the limits of adopting causal relationship to map hes by revealing new explanatory variables and assessing their potential effect on water quality using swat and pls regression the selection of cutover as an explanatory variable was expected khanal and parajuli 2013 moreover sub watersheds having 25 or more of cutovers were classified as average to very poor using swat brogna et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin and wei 2008 tremblay et al 2008 however a few divergent results remained some sub watersheds predicted sediment yield increases with only a small proportion of cutovers whereas other sub watersheds predicted low sediment yield increases regardless of a large proportion of cutovers these results highlight the fact that cutover size may be a dominant factor but it does not explain sediment yield increases alone among the variables over which forest managers can exert control we found that larger cutover patches and more connected cutover patches had a negative effect on the sec index smaller cutover areas that are less connected may be beneficial in reducing sediment yield liu et al 2018 however they may increase sediment transportation especially at river crossings or on steep slopes al chokhachy et al 2016 liu et al 2018 forest managers should therefore plan scattered cutovers combined with best management practices to mitigate the potential impacts of timber harvesting on water quality anderson and lockaby 2011 arthur et al 1998 although the purpose of our study highlighted the use of lidar based ei rather than validating recovery time following disturbance the long regrowth cycle that is found in hrw suggests that timber activities may affect sediment control capacity at the watershed scale for 10 years moore and wondzell 2005 this result should guide forest managers to limit the planning of new timber activities in a sub watershed for a range of at least ten years our validation method using the swat model and the pls provided explanatory variables that were not found in the literature and provided a means to assess their effect on water quality other studies often took place in small paired watershed studies the results of which may not apply to larger watersheds or tested with dummy datasets which may not apply to real life timber harvesting in a watershed khanal and parajuli 2013 peraza castro et al 2018 introducing lidar based indicators to map ecosystem services increases our ability to describe spatially and temporally the explanatory variables to map hes andrew et al 2014 wulder et al 2013 the sec index could be used in turn to monitor the aquatic habitat quality and water quality for forest certification planning and aid decision makers in defining appropriate areas and locations for timber harvesting activities jaung et al 2018 savilaakso and guariguata 2017 a few suggestions to improve the study were noted that deserve to be mentioned first the potential explanatory variables that were included in the pls model only explained about 65 of sediment yield output from the swat model since no validation dataset on sediment load was available for hrw it was not possible to validate the swat performance for sediment load consequently we relied upon calibration and validation of water quantity using a long term dataset to improve the performance of swat in simulating sediment yield arnold et al 1998 finer adjustments of swat parameters might also help to represent more accurately all processes that are affected by timber activities in sub watersheds for example water bodies and wetlands were not taken into account for the hrw however their capacity to collect sediment load can be modelled in swat jalowska and yuan 2019 bmps for salmon rivers and spawning streams are applied in hrw filter strips but these were not simulated in swat yet cho et al 2011 and moriasi et al 2011 have shown it can be done another limitation was defining an appropriate way for which the effects of timber activities on sediment yield can be accounted blattert et al 2017 suggested that some eis may not follow a linear function but the estimation of a realistic function requires proper validation gr√™t regamey et al 2013 further studies are needed to provide the relationship between cutover area and hydrological recovery after timber harvesting for example lin and wei 2008 studied the effects of equivalent of clear cut area from timber activities on water quality using a 1950 2005 time series long time series are not frequently available as was the case for hrw but a review of their applications in boreal forests could substantially improve our understanding of hydrological recovery and development of realistic functions for hes mapping the limitations described so far can contribute to improved simulation of sediment yields with hydrological models and therefore provide a more rigorous link with variables explaining sediment yield however these suggested improvements do not represent a weakness in the methodology the framework that we have proposed combines a physically based model with lidar based ei and provides a reproducible method lidar data offer new perspectives for ecosystem services mapping in hes and for other ecosystem services that are applicable to watersheds dominated by forest cover lidar data can contribute to mapping forest attributes that are relevant to monitoring other ecological services that are provided by forests such as wood provisioning vauhkonen 2018 vauhkonen and ruotsalainen 2017 and carbon sequestration and storage blattert et al 2017 hudak et al 2012 zhao and sander 2015 using lidar based ei for trade off analysis between ecosystem services in a forest watershed context is a promising avenue for land managers to take advantage of ei maps bennett et al 2009 forio et al 2015 sutherland et al 2016 lastly hydrological models can further contribute to improving proxy based methods for hes mapping based upon lidar data or other secondary data kangas et al 2018 ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 for instance they can be used to quantify the weight of individual eis in constructing composite indices schmidt et al 2020 shi et al 2014 and provide a framework for building and testing management scenarios towards more efficient erosion control including potential benefits of best management practices lin and wei 2008 wei and zhang 2010 moreover our approach is well designed for temporal studies including precipitation while helping to adjust decision making in future climate conditions for sustainable forest management brogna et al 2017 giles hansen et al 2019 peraza castro et al 2018 7 conclusions in this study we demonstrate that the swat model and pls regression was effective for identifying variables that represent the complex interactions in watersheds and influence sediment yield in a boreal forest watershed while it is widely accepted that water quality in boreal forest watersheds are affected by cutovers this study confirmed that climate yearly average precipitation morphometric main channel length channel length sub watershed area land use forest cutovers and landscape pattern patch cohesion index variables identified with swat also significantly affected sediment yield in the hrw we also demonstrate the use of lidar data to derive important explanatory variables the contribution of which p95 5m was particularly significant to identify cutovers using all explanatory variables except precipitation we established that a lidar based sec index could be used to map erosion control at the landscape level finally we conclude that a map of the sec index derived with lidar based ei yielded estimates that are comparable to those predicted by the swat for the hrw the lidar based sec map performed accurately in 87 of the sub watersheds when compared with sediment yield classes that were derived from swat over a 10 year period this is a significant finding because proxy based methods are easier to use than hydrologic models and important tools for mapping hes in scarce data environments further the adoption of lidar data to derive ei for mapping ecosystem services is a promising way to increase precision and reliability to support the proxy based approach beyond our study there is potential for the methods to be applied to other areas where major land use change can be observed and where water quality is an issue for example all of the variables explaining sediment yields can be derived in a straightforward way with lidar data and using existing tools further the lidar derived eis could be used to develop a sec index for other boreal forest watersheds however the height threshold for p95 should be adapted to the context especially for watersheds with different climate conditions or extensive deforestation further our method to validate the erosion regulation service using swat could be reused in other watershed contexts and for other hes credit authorship contribution statement catherine

4781,streamflow forecasts play an important role in real time reservoir operation especially during the flood season however nowcast short term and mid term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use to make the most of these forecasts this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon rfh and proposes a model based on the three stage based operation rule three or in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model it is applied to the wan an reservoir located at the midstream of the ganjiang river in china with the objectives of flood control and water utilization i e hydropower generation and water supply the results reveal the following 1 both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule 2 floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using three or 3 a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization and 4 the extension of the rfh is beneficial for reservoir operation as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large otherwise it can help improve water utilization in summary the proposed model based on three or can make the best use of streamflow information thus improving the real time reservoir operation during the flood season keywords three stage reliable forecast horizon flood control water utilization kkt 1 introduction real time reservoir operation is critical during the flood season for both flood control and water utilization cheng and chau 2004 li et al 2010a most large reservoirs serve multiple purposes including flood control water supply hydropower generation and others lin and rutten 2016 nohara et al 2016 conflicts between flood control and other objectives always exist yun and singh 2008 uysal et al 2016 flood control requires a certain amount of empty space in the reservoir during the flood season while water utilization requires storing water for current and future hydropower generation and water supply ding et al 2015 therefore real time flood operations should be carried out through a multi stage operation with consideration of other objectives usually flood operations include pre release and flood detention processes in which the streamflow forecast plays an important role chou and wu 2015 hsu and wei 2007 raso and malaterre 2017 because of finite reservoir storage and uncertain inflow forecasts a dilemma is inevitable during the real time flood operation especially during the late flood season when it is more desired to retain inflow for water use in the dry season chou and wu 2015 li et al 2010b if a predicted flood does not occur or comes later than expected then the pre release will directly lead to water shortage or loss of hydropower on the contrary if the predicted flood begins earlier than expected then the insufficient empty volume will probably result in a large flood loss furthermore when the reservoir system is subject to more extreme streamflow variability the above issue will become more severe zhao et al 2011a in recent decades the forecast horizon of streamflow has been continuously extended owing to the use of climatological information advances in weather forecasting hydrologic modelling and hydraulic modelling have significantly reduced forecast uncertainties anghileri et al 2016 bogner et al 2018 day 1985 schwanenberg et al 2015 however major challenges still exist in effectively using the forecast information because different sources of streamflow forecasts involve different uncertainties and result in different levels of risks the full use of streamflow information is a crucial issue in real time flood operation in general three sources of streamflow forecasting information are directly used for real time flood operation anghileri et al 2019 bartholmes and todini 2005 todini 2004 one is the nowcasted streamflow information based on flood routing models supported by observations from hydrologic gauge stations this source has the smallest uncertainty but the shortest lead time the second is short term streamflow forecasting information from hydrological models with gauged rainfall input corresponding to inflow hydrographs with relatively high accuracy in a median lead time the third is mid term streamflow forecasting information from hydrological models combined with weather models which can offer future precipitation thus largely extending the forecast horizon wei and xun 2019 but involves the largest uncertainty within the scope of a flood event the three sources of streamflow information are closely engaged and implicitly employed in three sequential stages che and mays 2015 thus far most of the currently used operation rules assume that the relative forecast errors follow a stationary probability distribution chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 this assumption bares considerable risk in levee failure and the utility loss of water resources zhang et al 2015 to make full use of the forecasts and accurately quantify the flood risk two issues should be addressed 1 how to simulate the characteristics of the time varying forecast errors and evaluate their impacts on flood operation and 2 because the horizons of the three sources of streamflow forecasts are not definite zhao et al 2012 2019 how to explicitly divide the three sequential stages and effectively use the corresponding forecasting information hedging rules hrs are promising in real time flood operation in terms of making the most of the forecasting information wang and liu 2013 zhao et al 2014 hrs can minimize the whole flood risk by optimizing the flood control storage between current and future stages ding et al 2015 hui et al 2016 in an economic sense the hrs balance the marginal values of uncertain temporal benefits costs thus balancing the purposes of flood risk mitigation and water utilization wan et al 2019 however the commonly used two stage based operation rule two or assumes that the entire flood event is forecasted with the same level of accuracy or the inflow hydrograph can be surrogated with an average discharge hui et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 these simplifications in streamflow uncertainty result in technical gaps between theoretical models and practice in real time flood operation to make the most of forecast information this paper proposes a reliable forecast horizon rfh that divides the entire forecast horizon into three stages according to the accuracy of streamflow forecasts subsequently a three stage real time flood operation model is developed along with a three stage based operation rule three or within the rfh streamflow is forecasted with a relatively small error corresponding to the first two sources of streamflow forecasts with relatively small uncertainties li et al 2010b liu et al 2019 a three stage model can then be developed using rfh as a tool to identify the stages with different levels of forecast uncertainties thus improving the reservoir operation the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the three stage model is derived according to the uncertainties of the three sources of streamflow forecasts section 3 presents the application of the proposed model to a case study in section 4 the model performance and the impacts of the forecast uncertainties are discussed finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 definitions of rfh and the three stages the forecast reliability deteriorates when the lead time is extended chen et al 2016 simonovic and burn 1989 wei and xun 2019 as shown in fig 1 in this figure the two reliability indicators relative forecast error and forecast uncertainty present significant characteristics of variation in time in the short term stages the relative forecast error is approximately constant however the streamflow uncertainty increases along with the magnitude of inflow to match the different sources of streamflow forecasts you and cai 2008 zhao et al 2012 2019 rfh is defined as follows with respect to the entire forecast horizon t 1 of a flood event the rfh t 0 is a relatively short time within which nowcast and short term forecast are available with relatively small forecast errors generally less than 20 based on the concept of rfh the entire forecast horizon can be explicitly divided into three stages the current stage with the smallest uncertainty from the nowcast the second stage with the median uncertainty from the short term forecast and the third stage with the largest uncertainty from the mid term forecast 2 2 three stage model for forecast informed real time flood operation 2 2 1 model formulation neglecting evaporation and leakage real time flood routing in reservoirs can generally be formulated as follows liu et al 2015a 1 ds d t q in q out 2 s f z where s is the reservoir water storage m3 q in and q out are the reservoir inflow and release m3 s respectively z is the water level m and f z represents the relationship between reservoir water storage and water level in eq 1 the reservoir inflow q in is obtained from the forecast models while the release q out is determined by the real time operation based on the forecasted inflow and water balance therefore the uncertainty from the inflow is transferred directly to the release furthermore the released flow will further involve uncertainties from river flood routing and the forecast of intermediate inflow considering the above mentioned uncertainties of streamflow at the downstream flood control point the gaussian distributed levee failure can be estimated with the probability function fig 2 as follows 3 r p q d q dmax 1 f q dmax q out q 1 q dmax q out q 1 2 œÄ œÉ d exp q d 2 2 œÉ d 2 d q d where r represents the risk of levee failure q d is the flow discharge at the downstream flood control point m3 s q out is the forecasted reservoir release m3 s q is the forecasted intermediate inflow between the reservoir and the downstream flood control point m3 s q dmax is the flood conveyance capacity fcc m3 s f denotes the cumulative distribution function of normal distribution n 0 œÉ d and œÉ d is the standard derivation of the probability distribution of q d in real time flood operation the issue of forecast error and its uncertainty has aroused numerical research cuo et al 2011 jain et al 2018 however the probability distribution of the forecast error is considerably complicated due to the runoff diversity and complexity of catchments as the core of this research is how to make full use of the forecast but not how to improve the forecast information a common assumption that the relative forecast error is normally distributed is followed stedinger et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2011a further as shown in fig 1 the relative forecast uncertainty in three stages is depicted by a step wise curve to simulate its time variation which is similar to the forecast results by zhang et al 2015 the linear function shown in eqs 4 and 5 is significantly beneficial to the understanding of our methodology if necessary the methodology is equally feasible with a more complex forecast error model 4 œÉ t a t q in t 5 a t a 0 0 t Œ¥ t a 1 Œ¥ t t t 0 a 1 b 0 t t 0 t 0 t t 1 where t represents the time h Œ¥ t is the interval time of real time reservoir operation h t 1 is the whole forecast horizon h t 0 is rfh h a t is a linear coefficient representing the uncertainty magnitude on base of that larger streamflow produces a larger forecast error chen et al 2016 li et al 2010b zhao and zhao 2014 and a 0 a 1 b 0 are constants estimated from the historical streamflow forecasts although the linear function in eq 5 is employed the proposed method can be effective when using a more complex forecast error model with the forecast uncertainty quantified an optimization model for minimum flooding risk can be developed when a flood occurs the reservoir water level usually rises from the flood limited water level flwl and should not be higher than the maximum flood control water level mwl the storage capacity between flwl and mwl serves the flood control the objective of controlling a flood event is to minimize the total failure risk of downstream levees national research council 2000 by optimizing the flood control storage allocation as follows 6 min r 1 1 r 1 r 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the failure risk of the downstream levees in the three stages respectively in this study the failure probability instead of economic loss is used in the objective function by assuming that the catastrophic flood damage measured in monetary terms caused by levee failure is fixed in addition considering that the current levee failure directly affects its operation state in the following stages hui et al 2016 liu et al 2015b the objective function is composed of three dependent risk terms that are constrained to 0 1 the decision variables s i i 1 2 3 that is flood control storage to be allocated in three stages shown in fig 3 are constrained as follows 7a s i s lim s 0 7b s i s max s 0 7c s 1 s 2 s 3 s end s 0 where s lim is the water storage corresponding to flwl m3 s max is the water storage corresponding to mwl m3 s 0 is the initial water storage of each operation m3 and s end is the ending water storage of the entire flood event which is generally the starting storage for the next flood m3 2 2 2 variable clarification in this work a real time flood operation model is presented based on the three or to be more understandable several easily confused variables are compared as follows 1 the reservoir water storage s and flood control storage s reservoir water storage s refers to the volume of stored water corresponding to a specific water level it is the storage that has been used flood control storage s is the empty volume to be used for flood control 2 the forecasted streamflow q the gauged streamflow q and the real streamflow in the real world the streamflow is always unknown and can only be measured by instruments with some observation errors in this work the real streamflow is approximated by gauged q with observation errors not considered however in real time reservoir operation the decision employed streamflow is forecasted with a lead time the forecasted streamflow is denoted as q 3 the relative forecast error Œµ and the forecast uncertainty œÉ the forecast error refers to the difference between the forecasted and the real streamflow and the relative forecast error is estimated with the forecast error divided by the real streamflow which is approximated by its gauged value unlike the forecast error representing accuracy the forecast uncertainty refers to fluctuation and stability quantified by the standard derivation œÉ of the probability distribution of forecast error 4 uncertainty in reservoir inflow q in and release q out intermediate inflow q and streamflow at the downstream flood control point q d the release q out is estimated from the inflow based on the water balance this variable is assumed to hold the same uncertainty as that of inflow q in from the forecast model zhao et al 2014 for the uncertainty of q d represented by œÉ d at the downstream flood control point it generally originates from the reservoir and intermediate inflow forecasts and the river flood routing bozzi et al 2015 chen et al 2017 herein the uncertainty œÉ in of q in and œÉ q of q are the primary risk sources for real time flood operation liu et al 2015a therefore the uncertainty of q d can be estimated as follows 8 œÉ d 2 œÉ in 2 œÉ q 2 2 œÅ œÉ in œÉ q where œÉ in and œÉ q are the standard derivation of the probability distribution of the reservoir inflow and intermediate inflow respectively and œÅ is the correlation coefficient estimated by statistics 2

stage is denoted as follows 25 risk i f i s i 1 r 3 i i 1 2 2 4 implementation procedure as shown in fig 3 the outer two stage model allocates the flood control storage to the stages within the rfh and then the inner two stage model determines the currently used storage and real time release the implementation procedure is generalized as follows fig 4 i determine rfh based on historical forecasts the rfh is first defined according to the rfh the three stages are divided ii allocate flood control storage to the first two stages by solving the outer two stage model iii allocate flood control storage to the current stage by solving the inner two stage model for each operation of release decision the flood control storage allocated to the current stage is finally employed and there is no need to determine how the other storage is allocated in the second stages with several time intervals iv calculate the reservoir release according to the reservoir flood routing model and physical constraints such as flwl mwl and the spill capacity v go to the next operation go to step ii until the flood ends 3 case study 3 1 case description a real case study of the wan an wa reservoir located at the midstream of ganjiang river south of china e 114 41 n 26 33 was employed to show and demonstrate the proposed real time reservoir operation model with three or the function of the wa reservoir mainly includes water utilization hydropower generation and water supply and flood control the wa reservoir collects runoff from a basin of 36900 km2 where the average annual precipitation is about 1600 mm with an extremely uneven distribution throughout the calendar year half of the total annual precipitation falls from april to june a total of 12 typical floods since 1995 were selected fig 5 to demonstrate the flood control capacity of three or all the selected floods hold a peak larger than the downstream fcc 8800 m3 s in addition a two peak flood was also considered the real time flood operation of the wa reservoir is implemented every 6 h the primary information for flood control of the wa reservoir is listed in table 1 3 2 performance metrics in real time flood operation of a multi purpose reservoir the performance is usually assessed through reduced flood risk loss and increased water resources correspondingly three metrics are commonly used for flood control the highest reservoir water level the maximum release and the frequency of release larger than the fcc to ensure the safety and reliability of dams and levees the highest water level should be kept lower than the mwl and the release should be less than the fcc on the contrary for the purpose of water utilization we hope to retain the inflow as much as possible and then to maximize hydropower generation finally the performance metrics in this study are the frequency of release larger than the fcc and hydropower generation 3 3 results the real time reservoir operation results of the 12 floods are calculated in table 2 both flood control and water utilization can benefit and all the floods especially the first three floods are successfully controlled in the fcc largely reducing the flood risk with the proposed model applied the original 10 year flood control capacity of levees can be significantly improved the higher reservoir water level with fewer spills also produces more power generation and water resources this positive result is in line with previous work on streamflow forecasts anghileri et al 2019 further the time variable operation results from three or and current operation rule cor are compared in fig 6 and table 2 and the real time risks defined in eqs 16 and 25 are presented in fig 7 at first glance all the floods in fig 6 have been significantly reduced at their peaks the smooth release with the same discharge of 8800 m3 s during flood peaks is more intuitive because reducing the release to the fcc is not only beneficial for downstream protection but also can better serve for water utilization with more water captured in more detail the pre release and flood detention can be identified in fig 7 at the initial stage the future flood risk always dominates and a pre release is needed to spare more empty volume close to the end of the pre release all three stages reach the same level of risk and a significant decreased in release can be observed when the water level approaches the flwl as the flood continuously rises the current risk increases the reservoir begins retaining inflow when the current risk is larger than the future one as long as the flood control storage is sufficient the inflow will be cut to the fcc as the marginal risk at the current stage is larger than that in the future stage after the peak the inflow falls within the fcc and the water level gradually drops to the starting and ending operation water level ewl because of the increased confidence in forecasts a higher water level can be sustained at the recession stage in addition if there is no reservoir operation the average frequency of larger than the fcc will reach 16 19 about a 6 year flood control capacity in fig 6 there is a slight fluctuation in the optimal release hydrograph especially in the pre release process this abnormal phenomenon is mainly caused by uncertain forecasts with a finite lead time in the pre release process the large risk in future stages suggests that the water level lowers to the flwl as soon as possible and a release larger than inflow is employed before approaching the flwl in practice with real time human machine interaction this slight fluctuation can be manually corrected based on the water balance and the cor 4 discussion real time reservoir operation may be influenced by many factors such as the flood pattern peak and shape the forecast accuracy and the forecast horizon investigation of these factors is helpful for improving the operation results 4 1 flood pattern all selected floods are grouped into three types according to their hydrograph shapes malekmohammadi et al 2010 as shown in fig 8 and table 3 in fig 8 the operation results of all 12 floods are presented predictably the performance in different types of floods shows significant differences for the first type with a high peak and large volume almost all the flood control storage between flwl and mwl was used and a large amount of water was captured in the reservoir for flood control as well as better water utilization compared with the results from cor the higher water level of three or requires a spill process in flood recession to lower the water level to ewl in contrast for the second type with relatively short duration but a high peak less water storage and a lower water level result in insignificant improvement in water utilization for the last type with a low peak both the performance of flood control and water utilization were slightly improved owing to the low flood risk overall the first group performs best implying that large floods hold a greater need for our proposed model to make full use of the forecast information 4 2 forecast error the forecast errors will be reduced in the future however different improvements in forecast accuracy in the three stages are highly possible because of the different approaches for streamflow information table 4 compares the effects of the forecast error with 12 scenarios in terms of different relative forecast errors in three stages somewhat surprisingly the results in table 4 indicate that a smaller future forecast error does not always mean a better operation result what really contributes to the operation improvements is the difference in the forecast error between stages this finding is obvious when comparing s1 with s2 and s3 or s1 with s4 and s11 in more detail when only the current error is improved s1 s2 s3 the power generation performs a little worse which is not in accordance with intuition this is because a relatively larger uncertainty in the future discourages current water utilization on the contrary when the relative error of future stages decreases the benefits of water utilization increase for example comparing s1 with s8 the results in table 4 reveal that the priority is to improve the weather forecasts in the third stage to narrow the difference in streamflow forecast error between the three stages 4 3 reliable forecast horizon although the difference in forecast error between stages is more influential the length of the rfh is directly related to three or three possible cases with rfh extended to 30 36 and 60 h are compared in fig 9 to investigate the effects of rfh clearly as the reservoir becomes stronger via better use of forecasts the extension of the rfh makes almost no difference in flood control risk all less than fcc but significantly increases the water utilization the effects of rfh on flood control cannot be observed because the selected floods are relatively small therefore we amplify all the selected floods with a ratio of 1 5 for example and the operation results are recalculated as shown in fig 10 the amplified floods cause conflicts between flood control and water utilization in this case the extended rfh helps to improve flood control with some reduction in water utilization the results in figs 9 and 10 are in accordance with an intuitive understanding as the extended rfh can help to improve flood control if the flood is large otherwise it can improve water utilization with greater confidence to consider the water resources 4 4 comparison with other operation rules the results from cor and two or are compared in table 5 and fig 11 in two or the second and third stages of three or are merged into the same future stage compared with cor and two or the proposed three or can better use the forecasts and achieve a finer compromise between flood control and water utilization in comparison with three or the two or uses the flood control storage earlier and intensively inducing a higher flood risk while significantly improving the hydropower generation and water collection the results evidently demonstrate the advantage of hrs in water utilization however the two or seems to be more ambitious in water utilization than three or 5 conclusions for real time flood operation of multi purpose reservoirs the full use of the streamflow forecasts is helpful for simultaneously improving flood control and water utilization however the existing operation rules including cor and two or assume that future floods are predicted with the same level of accuracy which gives up much forecast information this study defined the rfh and then derived the three or based model to make the most of forecasts the flood control storage was first allocated to the two stages within the rfh and then to the current stage to minimize the total levee failure risk after an application to the case study of the wa reservoir it reveals the following 1 using three or is beneficial for both flood control and water utilization and all 12 floods are successfully controlled in the fcc with their peaks significantly reduced much better than using cor or two or 2 the performance of three or in different types of floods shows significant differences and it applied in the type with a high peak and large volume gains the best results 3 a smaller difference in forecast error between the three stages produces better performance in water utilization 4 the extension of the rfh is beneficial for reservoir operation when the flood is large the extended rfh helps to improve flood control with some reduction in water utilization otherwise it can help improve water utilization with more confidence to consider the water resources the work presented in this paper can surely be used to re evaluate the cor and provide a promising orientation for real time flood control as more and more forecasts can be used in the future however it should be further improved for more practical achievements we define the rfh referring to a relative forecast error of 20 which is not authoritative and publicly accepted and there is a slight fluctuation in the optimal release hydrograph which is not perfect because of the inconvenience in gate regulation in most real cases the ongoing operation trajectory is unexpectedly conducted by human operators with professional justification the operation results provided by our models can be corrected by operators in real time interaction between computation and humans

4781,streamflow forecasts play an important role in real time reservoir operation especially during the flood season however nowcast short term and mid term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use to make the most of these forecasts this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon rfh and proposes a model based on the three stage based operation rule three or in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model it is applied to the wan an reservoir located at the midstream of the ganjiang river in china with the objectives of flood control and water utilization i e hydropower generation and water supply the results reveal the following 1 both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule 2 floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using three or 3 a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization and 4 the extension of the rfh is beneficial for reservoir operation as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large otherwise it can help improve water utilization in summary the proposed model based on three or can make the best use of streamflow information thus improving the real time reservoir operation during the flood season keywords three stage reliable forecast horizon flood control water utilization kkt 1 introduction real time reservoir operation is critical during the flood season for both flood control and water utilization cheng and chau 2004 li et al 2010a most large reservoirs serve multiple purposes including flood control water supply hydropower generation and others lin and rutten 2016 nohara et al 2016 conflicts between flood control and other objectives always exist yun and singh 2008 uysal et al 2016 flood control requires a certain amount of empty space in the reservoir during the flood season while water utilization requires storing water for current and future hydropower generation and water supply ding et al 2015 therefore real time flood operations should be carried out through a multi stage operation with consideration of other objectives usually flood operations include pre release and flood detention processes in which the streamflow forecast plays an important role chou and wu 2015 hsu and wei 2007 raso and malaterre 2017 because of finite reservoir storage and uncertain inflow forecasts a dilemma is inevitable during the real time flood operation especially during the late flood season when it is more desired to retain inflow for water use in the dry season chou and wu 2015 li et al 2010b if a predicted flood does not occur or comes later than expected then the pre release will directly lead to water shortage or loss of hydropower on the contrary if the predicted flood begins earlier than expected then the insufficient empty volume will probably result in a large flood loss furthermore when the reservoir system is subject to more extreme streamflow variability the above issue will become more severe zhao et al 2011a in recent decades the forecast horizon of streamflow has been continuously extended owing to the use of climatological information advances in weather forecasting hydrologic modelling and hydraulic modelling have significantly reduced forecast uncertainties anghileri et al 2016 bogner et al 2018 day 1985 schwanenberg et al 2015 however major challenges still exist in effectively using the forecast information because different sources of streamflow forecasts involve different uncertainties and result in different levels of risks the full use of streamflow information is a crucial issue in real time flood operation in general three sources of streamflow forecasting information are directly used for real time flood operation anghileri et al 2019 bartholmes and todini 2005 todini 2004 one is the nowcasted streamflow information based on flood routing models supported by observations from hydrologic gauge stations this source has the smallest uncertainty but the shortest lead time the second is short term streamflow forecasting information from hydrological models with gauged rainfall input corresponding to inflow hydrographs with relatively high accuracy in a median lead time the third is mid term streamflow forecasting information from hydrological models combined with weather models which can offer future precipitation thus largely extending the forecast horizon wei and xun 2019 but involves the largest uncertainty within the scope of a flood event the three sources of streamflow information are closely engaged and implicitly employed in three sequential stages che and mays 2015 thus far most of the currently used operation rules assume that the relative forecast errors follow a stationary probability distribution chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 this assumption bares considerable risk in levee failure and the utility loss of water resources zhang et al 2015 to make full use of the forecasts and accurately quantify the flood risk two issues should be addressed 1 how to simulate the characteristics of the time varying forecast errors and evaluate their impacts on flood operation and 2 because the horizons of the three sources of streamflow forecasts are not definite zhao et al 2012 2019 how to explicitly divide the three sequential stages and effectively use the corresponding forecasting information hedging rules hrs are promising in real time flood operation in terms of making the most of the forecasting information wang and liu 2013 zhao et al 2014 hrs can minimize the whole flood risk by optimizing the flood control storage between current and future stages ding et al 2015 hui et al 2016 in an economic sense the hrs balance the marginal values of uncertain temporal benefits costs thus balancing the purposes of flood risk mitigation and water utilization wan et al 2019 however the commonly used two stage based operation rule two or assumes that the entire flood event is forecasted with the same level of accuracy or the inflow hydrograph can be surrogated with an average discharge hui et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 these simplifications in streamflow uncertainty result in technical gaps between theoretical models and practice in real time flood operation to make the most of forecast information this paper proposes a reliable forecast horizon rfh that divides the entire forecast horizon into three stages according to the accuracy of streamflow forecasts subsequently a three stage real time flood operation model is developed along with a three stage based operation rule three or within the rfh streamflow is forecasted with a relatively small error corresponding to the first two sources of streamflow forecasts with relatively small uncertainties li et al 2010b liu et al 2019 a three stage model can then be developed using rfh as a tool to identify the stages with different levels of forecast uncertainties thus improving the reservoir operation the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the three stage model is derived according to the uncertainties of the three sources of streamflow forecasts section 3 presents the application of the proposed model to a case study in section 4 the model performance and the impacts of the forecast uncertainties are discussed finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 definitions of rfh and the three stages the forecast reliability deteriorates when the lead time is extended chen et al 2016 simonovic and burn 1989 wei and xun 2019 as shown in fig 1 in this figure the two reliability indicators relative forecast error and forecast uncertainty present significant characteristics of variation in time in the short term stages the relative forecast error is approximately constant however the streamflow uncertainty increases along with the magnitude of inflow to match the different sources of streamflow forecasts you and cai 2008 zhao et al 2012 2019 rfh is defined as follows with respect to the entire forecast horizon t 1 of a flood event the rfh t 0 is a relatively short time within which nowcast and short term forecast are available with relatively small forecast errors generally less than 20 based on the concept of rfh the entire forecast horizon can be explicitly divided into three stages the current stage with the smallest uncertainty from the nowcast the second stage with the median uncertainty from the short term forecast and the third stage with the largest uncertainty from the mid term forecast 2 2 three stage model for forecast informed real time flood operation 2 2 1 model formulation neglecting evaporation and leakage real time flood routing in reservoirs can generally be formulated as follows liu et al 2015a 1 ds d t q in q out 2 s f z where s is the reservoir water storage m3 q in and q out are the reservoir inflow and release m3 s respectively z is the water level m and f z represents the relationship between reservoir water storage and water level in eq 1 the reservoir inflow q in is obtained from the forecast models while the release q out is determined by the real time operation based on the forecasted inflow and water balance therefore the uncertainty from the inflow is transferred directly to the release furthermore the released flow will further involve uncertainties from river flood routing and the forecast of intermediate inflow considering the above mentioned uncertainties of streamflow at the downstream flood control point the gaussian distributed levee failure can be estimated with the probability function fig 2 as follows 3 r p q d q dmax 1 f q dmax q out q 1 q dmax q out q 1 2 œÄ œÉ d exp q d 2 2 œÉ d 2 d q d where r represents the risk of levee failure q d is the flow discharge at the downstream flood control point m3 s q out is the forecasted reservoir release m3 s q is the forecasted intermediate inflow between the reservoir and the downstream flood control point m3 s q dmax is the flood conveyance capacity fcc m3 s f denotes the cumulative distribution function of normal distribution n 0 œÉ d and œÉ d is the standard derivation of the probability distribution of q d in real time flood operation the issue of forecast error and its uncertainty has aroused numerical research cuo et al 2011 jain et al 2018 however the probability distribution of the forecast error is considerably complicated due to the runoff diversity and complexity of catchments as the core of this research is how to make full use of the forecast but not how to improve the forecast information a common assumption that the relative forecast error is normally distributed is followed stedinger et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2011a further as shown in fig 1 the relative forecast uncertainty in three stages is depicted by a step wise curve to simulate its time variation which is similar to the forecast results by zhang et al 2015 the linear function shown in eqs 4 and 5 is significantly beneficial to the understanding of our methodology if necessary the methodology is equally feasible with a more complex forecast error model 4 œÉ t a t q in t 5 a t a 0 0 t Œ¥ t a 1 Œ¥ t

representing the uncertainty magnitude on base of that larger streamflow produces a larger forecast error chen et al 2016 li et al 2010b zhao and zhao 2014 and a 0 a 1 b 0 are constants estimated from the historical streamflow forecasts although the linear function in eq 5 is employed the proposed method can be effective when using a more complex forecast error model with the forecast uncertainty quantified an optimization model for minimum flooding risk can be developed when a flood occurs the reservoir water level usually rises from the flood limited water level flwl and should not be higher than the maximum flood control water level mwl the storage capacity between flwl and mwl serves the flood control the objective of controlling a flood event is to minimize the total failure risk of downstream levees national research council 2000 by optimizing the flood control storage allocation as follows 6 min r 1 1 r 1 r 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the failure risk of the downstream levees in the three stages respectively in this study the failure probability instead of economic loss is used in the objective function by assuming that the catastrophic flood damage measured in monetary terms caused by levee failure is fixed in addition considering that the current levee failure directly affects its operation state in the following stages hui et al 2016 liu et al 2015b the objective function is composed of three dependent risk terms that are constrained to 0 1 the decision variables s i i 1 2 3 that is flood control storage to be allocated in three stages shown in fig 3 are constrained as follows 7a s i s lim s 0 7b s i s max s 0 7c s 1 s 2 s 3 s end s 0 where s lim is the water storage corresponding to flwl m3 s max is the water storage corresponding to mwl m3 s 0 is the initial water storage of each operation m3 and s end is the ending water storage of the entire flood event which is generally the starting storage for the next flood m3 2 2 2 variable clarification in this work a real time flood operation model is presented based on the three or to be more understandable several easily confused variables are compared as follows 1 the reservoir water storage s and flood control storage s reservoir water storage s refers to the volume of stored water corresponding to a specific water level it is the storage that has been used flood control storage s is the empty volume to be used for flood control 2 the forecasted streamflow q the gauged streamflow q and the real streamflow in the real world the streamflow is always unknown and can only be measured by instruments with some observation errors in this work the real streamflow is approximated by gauged q with observation errors not considered however in real time reservoir operation the decision employed streamflow is forecasted with a lead time the forecasted streamflow is denoted as q 3 the relative forecast error Œµ and the forecast uncertainty œÉ the forecast error refers to the difference between the forecasted and the real streamflow and the relative forecast error is estimated with the forecast error divided by the real streamflow which is approximated by its gauged value unlike the forecast error representing accuracy the forecast uncertainty refers to fluctuation and stability quantified by the standard derivation œÉ of the probability distribution of forecast error 4 uncertainty in reservoir inflow q in and release q out intermediate inflow q and streamflow at the downstream flood control point q d the release q out is estimated from the inflow based on the water balance this variable is assumed to hold the same uncertainty as that of inflow q in from the forecast model zhao et al 2014 for the uncertainty of q d represented by œÉ d at the downstream flood control point it generally originates from the reservoir and intermediate inflow forecasts and the river flood routing bozzi et al 2015 chen et al 2017 herein the uncertainty œÉ in of q in and œÉ q of q are the primary risk sources for real time flood operation liu et al 2015a therefore the uncertainty of q d can be estimated as follows 8 œÉ d 2 œÉ in 2 œÉ q 2 2 œÅ œÉ in œÉ q where œÉ in and œÉ q are the standard derivation of the probability distribution of the reservoir inflow and intermediate inflow respectively and œÅ is the correlation coefficient estimated by statistics 2 3 optimal allocation of flood control storage 2 3 1 decomposition of the three stage based optimization a decomposition of eq 6 is theoretically derived as follows 9 r 1 1 r 1 r 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 r 3 r 1

3 and then minimize r 1 1 r 1 r 2 the three stage optimization can be decomposed into two step optimization with their goal function as follows 1 min r 12 1 r 12 r 3 and 2 min r 1 1 r 1 r 2 the decomposition essentially reveals two hedging processes between the three stages in order to minimize the total flooding risk on full forecast information the first goal function allocates the flood control storage for the stages in and out of the rfh outer two stage model s 1 s 2 is determined and the second goal function determines the current optimal flood control storage inner two stage model s 1 is determined for operation decision as shown in fig 3 2 3 2 solution to the outer two stage model in the outer two stage the total flood water in each operation is predicted and then used for allocation the goal function of minimum flooding risk is given by eq 11 in an operation interval Œ¥ t h the forecast uncertainty œÉ d is assumed to be constant to derive the analytical solution of eq

are constrained as follows 13a s 12 s lim s 0 0 13b s 12 s max s 0 0 13c s 12 s 3 s end s 0 0 the convexity of eq 11 proved in the appendix indicates that its karush kuhn tucker kkt condition is necessary and sufficient for optimal allocation of flood control storage zhao et al 2011b denoting the dual values corresponding to eqs 13a as Œª 1 13b as Œª 2 and eq 13c as Œª 3 the kkt condition of eq 11 can be derived as follows 14a f 12 s 12 1 r 3 Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª 3 0 14b f 3 s 3 1 r 12 Œª 3 0 14c Œª 1 s 12 s lim s 0 0 14d Œª 2 s 12 s max s 0 0 where Œª 1 0 Œª 2 0 then 15 f 12 s 12 1 r 3 Œª 1 Œª 2

r 12 in this case the flood in the first two stages is larger and all the flood control storage should be allocated to the stages in rfh ‚ë¢ if Œª 1 Œª 2 0 s lim s 0 s 12 s max s 0 then f 12 s 12 1 r 3 f 3 s 3 1 r 12 in this general case the flood control storage should be allocated according to the marginal risk which can be denoted as follows 16a risk 12 f 12 s 12 1 r 3 16b risk 3 f 3 s 3 1 r 12 where risk 12 and risk 3 denote the marginal risk in and out of the rfh respectively 2 3 3 solution to the inner two stage model based on the outer two stage optimization the flood control storage used for the current stage can be determined via the inner two stage optimization herein the discharge series is employed for the updating release decision again the goal function is as follows 17 min

calculation of r 2 the flood control storage s 2 is averaged to all the time intervals in the second stage for a conservative decision the decision variables s 1 and s 2 are constrained to the allocated storage s 12 depending on whether s 12 is positive or negative the following two sub cases are discussed 1 when s 12 0 the reservoir is operated for flood detention and the decision variables s 1 and s 2 are constrained as follows 19a s 1 0 19b s 2 0 19c s 1 s 2 s 12 similar to the outer two stage model the convexity of eq 17 can be proved and its kkt condition is derived as

not allocated any flood control storage ‚ë° if Œª 2 0 s 2 0 s 1 s 12 Œª 1 0 then f 1 s 1 1 r 2 f 2 s 2 1 r 1 in this case the future flood is predicted to be smaller than the current stage and all flood control storage is currently used ‚ë¢ if Œª 1 0 Œª 2 0 then f 1 s 1 1 r 2 f 2 s 2 1 r 1 in this general case the storage should be allocated to both stages according to the marginal risk 2 when s 12 0 the reservoir is operated for pre release and the decision variables s 1 and s 2 are constrained as follows 22a s 1 0 22b s 2 0 22c s 1 s 2 s 12 the kkt condition of eq 17 is derived as follows

of different values of Œª 1 and Œª 2 ‚ë† if Œª 1 0 s 1 0 s 2 s 12 Œª 2 0 then f 1 s 1 1 r 2 f 2 s 2 1 r 1 in this case the pre release should be implemented in the second stage because the current flow is larger ‚ë° if Œª 2 0 s 2 0 s 1 s 12 Œª 1 0 then f 1 s 1 1 r 2 f 2 s 2 1 r 1 in this case the pre release is arranged at the current stage because the current flow is smaller ‚ë¢ if Œª 1 0 Œª 2 0 then f 1 s 1 1 r 2 f 2 s 2 1 r 1 in this general case the pre release should be allocated to both stages according to the marginal risk similar to the outer two stage the marginal risk of inner two stage is denoted as follows 25 risk i f i s i 1 r 3 i i 1 2 2 4 implementation procedure as shown in fig 3 the outer two stage model allocates the flood control storage to the stages within the rfh and then the inner two stage model determines the currently used storage and real time release the implementation procedure is generalized as follows fig 4 i determine rfh based on historical forecasts the rfh is first defined according to the rfh the three stages are divided ii allocate flood control storage to the first two stages by solving the outer two stage model iii allocate flood control storage to the current stage by solving the inner two stage model for each operation of release decision the flood control storage allocated to the current stage is finally employed and there is no need to determine how the other storage is allocated in the second stages with several time intervals iv calculate the reservoir release according to the reservoir flood routing model and physical constraints such as flwl mwl and the spill capacity v go to the next operation go to step ii until the flood ends 3 case study 3 1 case description a real case study of the wan an wa reservoir located at the midstream of ganjiang river south of china e 114 41 n 26 33 was employed to show and demonstrate the proposed real time reservoir operation model with three or the function of the wa reservoir mainly includes water utilization hydropower generation and water supply and flood control the wa reservoir collects runoff from a basin of 36900 km2 where the average annual precipitation is about 1600 mm with an extremely uneven distribution throughout the calendar year half of the total annual precipitation falls from april to june a total of 12 typical floods since 1995 were selected fig 5 to demonstrate the flood control capacity of three or all the selected floods hold a peak larger than the downstream fcc 8800 m3 s in addition a two peak flood was also considered the real time flood operation of the wa reservoir is implemented every 6 h the primary information for flood control of the wa reservoir is listed in table 1 3 2 performance metrics in real time flood operation of a multi purpose reservoir the performance is usually assessed through reduced flood risk loss and increased water resources correspondingly three metrics are commonly used for flood control the highest reservoir water level the maximum release and the frequency of release larger than the fcc to ensure the safety and reliability of dams and levees the highest water level should be kept lower than the mwl and the release should be less than the fcc on the contrary for the purpose of water utilization we hope to retain the inflow as much as possible and then to maximize hydropower generation finally the performance metrics in this study are the frequency of release larger than the fcc and hydropower generation 3 3 results the real time reservoir operation results of the 12 floods are calculated in table 2 both flood control and water utilization can benefit and all the floods especially the first three floods are successfully controlled in the fcc largely reducing the flood risk with the proposed model applied the original 10 year flood control capacity of levees can be significantly improved the higher reservoir water level with fewer spills also produces more power generation and water resources this positive result is in line with previous work on streamflow forecasts anghileri et al 2019 further the time variable operation results from three or and current operation rule cor are compared in fig 6 and table 2 and the real time risks defined in eqs 16 and 25 are presented in fig 7 at first glance all the floods in fig 6 have been significantly reduced at their peaks the smooth release with the same discharge of 8800 m3 s during flood peaks is more intuitive because reducing the release to the fcc is not only beneficial for downstream protection but also can better serve for water utilization with more water captured in more detail the pre release and flood detention can be identified in fig 7 at the initial stage the future flood risk always dominates and a pre release is needed to spare more empty volume close to the end of the pre release all three stages reach the same level of risk and a significant decreased in release can be observed when the water level approaches the flwl as the flood continuously rises the current risk increases the reservoir begins retaining inflow when the current risk is larger than the future one as long as the flood control storage is sufficient the inflow will be cut to the fcc as the marginal risk at the current stage is larger than that in the future stage after the peak the inflow falls within the fcc and the water level gradually drops to the starting and ending operation water level ewl because of the increased confidence in forecasts a higher water level can be sustained at the recession stage in addition if there is no reservoir operation the average frequency of larger than the fcc will reach 16 19 about a 6 year flood control capacity in fig 6 there is a slight fluctuation in the optimal release hydrograph especially in the pre release process this abnormal phenomenon is mainly caused by uncertain forecasts with a finite lead time in the pre release process the large risk in future stages suggests that the water level lowers to the flwl as soon as possible and a release larger than inflow is employed before approaching the flwl in practice with real time human machine interaction this slight fluctuation can be manually corrected based on the water balance and the cor 4 discussion real time reservoir operation may be influenced by many factors such as the flood pattern peak and shape the forecast accuracy and the forecast horizon investigation of these factors is helpful for improving the operation results 4 1 flood pattern all selected floods are grouped into three types according to their hydrograph shapes malekmohammadi et al 2010 as shown in fig 8 and table 3 in fig 8 the operation results of all 12 floods are presented predictably the performance in different types of floods shows significant differences for the first type with a high peak and large volume almost all the flood control storage between flwl and mwl was used and a large amount of water was captured in the reservoir for flood control as well as better water utilization compared with the results from cor the higher water level of three or requires a spill process in flood recession to lower the water level to ewl in contrast for the second type with relatively short duration but a high peak less water storage and a lower water level result in insignificant improvement in water utilization for the last type with a low peak both the performance of flood control and water utilization were slightly improved owing to the low flood risk overall the first group performs best implying that large floods hold a greater need for our proposed model to make full use of the forecast information 4 2 forecast error the forecast errors will be reduced in the future however different improvements in forecast accuracy in the three stages are highly possible because of the different approaches for streamflow information table 4 compares the effects of the forecast error with 12 scenarios in terms of different relative forecast errors in three stages somewhat surprisingly the results in table 4 indicate that a smaller future forecast error does not always mean a better operation result what really contributes to the operation improvements is the difference in the forecast error between stages this finding is obvious when comparing s1 with s2 and s3 or s1 with s4 and s11 in more detail when only the current error is improved s1 s2 s3 the power generation performs a little worse which is not in accordance with intuition this is because a relatively larger uncertainty in the future discourages current water utilization on the contrary when the relative error of future stages decreases the benefits of water utilization increase for example comparing s1 with s8 the results in table 4 reveal that the priority is to improve the weather forecasts in the third stage to narrow the difference in streamflow forecast error between the three stages 4 3 reliable forecast horizon although the difference in forecast error between stages is more influential the length of the rfh is directly related to three or three possible cases with rfh extended to 30 36 and 60 h are compared in fig 9 to investigate the effects of rfh clearly as the reservoir becomes stronger via better use of forecasts the extension of the rfh makes almost no difference in flood control risk all less than fcc but significantly increases the water utilization the effects of rfh on flood control cannot be observed because the selected floods are relatively small therefore we amplify all the selected floods with a ratio of 1 5 for example and the operation results are recalculated as shown in fig 10 the amplified floods cause conflicts between flood control and water utilization in this case the extended rfh helps to improve flood control with some reduction in water utilization the results in figs 9 and 10 are in accordance with an intuitive understanding as the extended rfh can help to improve flood control if the flood is large otherwise it can improve water utilization with greater confidence to consider the water resources 4 4 comparison with other operation rules the results from cor and two or are compared in table 5 and fig 11 in two or the second and third stages of three or are merged into the same future stage compared with cor and two or the proposed three or can better use the forecasts and achieve a finer compromise between flood control and water utilization in comparison with three or the two or uses the flood control storage earlier and intensively inducing a higher flood risk while significantly improving the hydropower generation and water collection the results evidently demonstrate the advantage of hrs in water utilization however the two or seems to be more ambitious in water utilization than three or 5 conclusions for real time flood operation of multi purpose reservoirs the full use of the streamflow forecasts is helpful for simultaneously improving flood control and water utilization however the existing operation rules including cor and two or assume that future floods are predicted with the same level of accuracy which gives up much forecast information this study defined the rfh and then derived the three or based model to make the most of forecasts the flood control storage was first allocated to the two stages within the rfh and then to the current stage to minimize the total levee failure risk after an application to the case study of the wa reservoir it reveals the following 1 using three or is beneficial for both flood control and water utilization and all 12 floods are successfully controlled in the fcc with their peaks significantly reduced much better than using cor or two or 2 the performance of three or in different types of floods shows significant differences and it applied in the type with a high peak and large volume gains the best results 3 a smaller difference in forecast error between the three stages produces better performance in water utilization 4 the extension of the rfh is beneficial for reservoir operation when the flood is large the extended rfh helps to improve flood control with some reduction in water utilization otherwise it can help improve water utilization with more confidence to consider the water resources the work presented in this paper can surely be used to re evaluate the cor and provide a promising orientation for real time flood control as more and more forecasts can be used in the future however it should be further improved for more practical achievements we define the rfh referring to a relative forecast error of 20 which is not authoritative and publicly accepted and there is a slight fluctuation in the optimal release hydrograph which is not perfect because of the inconvenience in gate regulation in most real cases the ongoing operation trajectory is unexpectedly conducted by human operators with professional justification the operation results provided by our models can be corrected by operators in real time interaction between computation and humans

4782,benthic oxygen fluxes at the sediment water interface swi regulate the process and even direction of biochemical interfacial reactions thus they are crucial to the water quality however many medium and large sized reservoirs suffer from thermal stratification and human operations lead to a significant impact on swi oxygen exchanges a 3 month long noninvasive measurement of swi oxygen fluxes was conducted in the daheiting reservoir using the eddy correlation method its result shows that reservoir stratification markedly affects the benthic boundary layer environment factors such as temperature dissolved oxygen do concentration and hydrodynamics in contrast reservoir operations determine the benthic flow directions and its correlation to velocities in the mixed stage a further discussion suggests that benthic temperatures mainly participate in the thermal structure rather than directly affecting the benthic fluxes conversely it is do concentrations coupled with hydrodynamics that control swi oxygen fluxes the flux is inhibited by do shortage in anoxic conditions but it is mainly controlled by hydrodynamics with redundant do likewise the hydrodynamics affects the fluxes by changing the diffusive boundary layer thickness but this effect is also restrained by the do field these results indicate that a long term and in situ measurement of swi oxygen fluxes in drinking reservoirs is of considerable significance to forecast water quality disasters optimize operation plans and ensure water security keywords reservoir thermal stratification human operations benthic oxygen fluxes sediment water interface eddy correlation method 1 introduction approximately 2 8 million dams with reservoir areas over 103 m2 have been built worldwide grill et al 2019 to generate power supply water etc however the increased water depth leads to a seasonal stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen do thus a long term anoxic area occurs at the bottom of reservoirs greatly threatening the water ecology bosch and allan 2008 furthermore differently from natural deep lakes and rivers the reservoir flow is regulated by human operations li et al 2010 which exert a considerable impact on the benthic boundary layer bbl environment as well lorke and peeters 2006 allison and pratt 2017 sediment is a primary sink for do in the bbl schwefel et al 2016 and oxygen consumption at the sediment water interface swi is closely associated with the respiration of benthic animals the degradation of organic matter and the oxidation of decay products the swi oxygen flux provides valuable information on these biochemical processes and is an important water quality parameter in studies of aquatic sediment berg et al 2003 for example a high swi oxygen flux inhibits the release of nutrients such as n and p in the sediment thouvenot et al 2007 banks et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 while a relatively low flux prevents the diffusion of heavy metals such as cu and cr and affects their occurrence state burgess and kester 2002 yan et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 therefore the magnitude of swi oxygen fluxes and their dependence on reservoir stratification and operation are essential for understanding the reservoir oxygen budget as well as ensuring the quality of supplied water measurements of swi oxygen fluxes are often restricted to invasive or ex situ methods such as micro profiling benthic chambers and core incubations these techniques however neglect the effect of natural flow and exchange of water bound constituents on swi fluxes perran et al 2007 reidenbach et al 2010 moreover they can only determine the fluxes for a small and enclosed area with do depletion as the measurement progresses tengberg et al 2005 for example a typical benthic chamber has an area of only 0 25 m2 wild et al 2009 therefore it cannot account for reservoir operations by comparison the eddy correlation technique is a relatively new alternative for measuring benthic oxygen fluxes as it derives fluxes at real in situ conditions by recording vertical flow velocities and do concentrations simultaneously berg et al 2003 this is a noninvasive approach with a high temporal resolution rheuban and berg 2013 which integrates over a large area of 10 100 m2 berg et al 2007 while resolving fluxes down to at least 1 mmol m 2 d 1 berg et al 2009 these distinctive characteristics make the eddy correlation technique applicable to study reservoirs where traditional methods are less feasible a number of studies most of which focusing on ecosystem metabolism and carbon budgets in shallow waters have adopted the eddy correlation technique to measure swi oxygen fluxes glud et al 2010 for instance quantified swi oxygen exchange rates in different substrates and revealed that hardbottom communities play an important role in coastal carbon cycling berg et al 2013 documented the control that current flow and light have on swi oxygen fluxes the authors also developed an applicative fitting model and found that net ecosystem metabolism varies substantially among days volaric et al 2019 measured benthic oxygen uptake at tidal flats to confirm that an invasive macroalgal enhances ecosystem productivity while attenuates flow and turbulence however few studies have reported the impact of thermal stratification and human operations on oxygen uptake by the eddy correlation technique and only one research analyzed the effect of ship locking on swi fluxes in impounded rivers lorke et al 2012 so far the majority of eddy correlation measurements have been conducted in rivers murniati et al 2015 lakes mcginnis et al 2008 brand et al 2008 shallow coastal areas koopmans and berg 2015 long et al 2019 rodil et al 2019 and deep ocean berg et al 2009 de froe et al 2019 on the other hand reservoirs whose benthic oxygen exchange rate is difficult to acquire but of great significance to the quality of supplied water is still poorly explored in this study we conducted eddy correlation measurements covering three months in the daheiting reservoir an important source of water supply in north china we aimed to analyze the benthic environment characteristic of this naturally stratified and artificially operated reservoir and then explore the response of swi oxygen fluxes to three benthic environmental factors benthic temperature do concentration and hydrodynamic conditions the leading factor controlling swi oxygen fluxes was distinguished under different conditions and a concentration threshold of do in a dominant position was proposed in this reservoir providing a reference to construct water quality models and plan water quality improvement measures 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the daheiting reservoir is located 30 km downstream of the panjiakou reservoir 5 km north of qianxi county in hebei province china this reservoir is shallower in upstream while deeper in downstream with an average depth of 13 84 m during normal operation but the water depth in front of the dam can reach 25 m at the same time it has a length of 22 km and a storage capacity of 337 million m3 thus it is a medium sized reservoir that participates in the cascaded development of the luanhe river in the past 30 years a total of nearly 35 9 billion m3 of water had been supplied to tianjin from the daheiting reservoir by the luanhe water diversion project and the vast farmland in its lower reaches was benefited as well however an extensive cage fish farming was carried out in this reservoir from the 1990 s to 2017 and large amounts of organic pesticides entered the reservoir with the runoff as a result numerous nutrients organics and heavy metals have been deposited together with the sediment xu et al 2019 and the water quality of the daheiting reservoir has deteriorated thereby threatening the drinking water safety and the regional coordinated development the measurement station of swi oxygen fluxes was established upstream of the daheiting dam 40 12 7 07 n 118 18 43 49 e fig 1 this station has a flat underlying surface and a robust spatial representation with a depth varying from 18 m to 24 m in 2019 moreover the distance from the station and the spillway and the outlet are both less than 800 m therefore the measurements can adequately reflect the impact of reservoir operation on the bbl environment 2 2 methods the eddy correlation technique has been adopted to conduct a noninvasive long term and in situ measurement of swi oxygen fluxes in the daheiting reservoir this method fixes a measurement point in the logarithmic layer above the swi where i do diffuses steadily and ii its source or sink between the point and the swi are negligible it also requires the measurement point to have a long and flat underlying surface in the upstream so that iii the advection and horizontal gradient of do also can be neglected based on the above premises and the momentum conservation equation of fluid components berg et al 2003 deduced that swi oxygen fluxes could be calculated by the covariance of vertical flow velocities and do concentrations this could be written as 1 f w c where w is the fluctuation of vertical velocities cm s 1 and c is the fluctuation of do concentrations mg l 1 the eddy measurement system fig 1 used in this study consists of an acoustic doppler velometer adv vector 300 m nortek norway a fast responding do sensor aro ec jfe advantech japan data transmitting equipment dtu nortek norway and other auxiliary facilities such as a tripod battery groups cables and floating platforms the adv could measure water temperatures water depths and the rapid change of three dimensional flow turbulences with a high resolution and precision its turbulence measurement area is a cylindrical sampling volume with a diameter of 15 mm and a height of 18 mm located 15 cm below the signal transmitter chanson et al 2008 the aro ec which is derived from the fluorescence life time method berg et al 2016 is employed to acquire do concentrations in a way that is less sensitive to the environment and less lossy of the signal amplitude this aro ec sensor does not consume do compared with conventional clark type microelectrodes berg et al 2003 lorrai et al 2010 thus it makes the eddy measurement system robust and enables a long term swi oxygen fluxes measurement furthermore the dtu module transmits measured data and controlling commands remotely in real time resolving the data storage issue and realizing a long term online measurement of fluxes when the system was installed fig 1 the adv and the aro ec were placed above the swi using a tripod and the aro ec outputted signals through two analog channels provided by the adv ensuring a simultaneous recording of velocities and do concentrations the dtu module with battery groups was fixed on the anchored floating platform which received measured data while supplied power by waterproof communication cables matlab programs based on sohfea v2 0 http sohfea dfmcginnis com were used to calculate the swi oxygen fluxes whose workflow is shown in fig s1 of the appendix its main work includes data cleaning coordinate rotation time shift correction running averaging of fluctuations and eddy frequency screening it is notable that both a high frequency noise and a low frequency advection lead to a distortion of flux results which are processed by the high frequency correction and the time segmentation respectively moreover several bbl environmental factors like friction velocity batchelor scale and diffusion boundary layer dbl thickness were calculated by formulas in table s1 of the appendix as well 2 3 measurement plans we conducted three long term in situ eddy correlation measurements covering september to november 2019 when the reservoir stratification was weakening but the demand of water supplying was growing all measurements were carried out intermittently so the whole measurement time span was divided into successive intervals as fig s2 in the appendix shows each time interval consisted of a 15 min continuous data recording followed by a 5 or 15 min pause the 5 min pause was adopted on september 17 30th and october 13 24th while the 15 min pause was employed on november 9 30th in order to avoid signal interference the aro ec tip was placed at an equal height but 2 cm away from the sampling volume of the adv gao et al 2020 both of them sampled data at 32 hz we considered a vector of the adv sampling volume pointed to the aro ec tip as the default direction which should be as consistent with the current direction as possible the distance between the adv sample volume and the tripod bottom was adjusted to 65 cm considering that this study site had a gentle benthic flow and lots of deposited sediment moreover historical data that characterize this study site are shown in fig 2 the water flow volume was provided by the haihe river water conservancy commission http yingyong hwcc gov cn 8080 hwccapp lyysq init the temperature profile was measured by water quality instruments exo1 ysi the usa and the rwcs relative water column stability was calculated based on the water density it is defined that 2 rwcs œÅ h œÅ s œÅ 4 œÅ 5 where œÅ h is the density of the bottom water œÅ s is the density of the surface water and œÅ 4 œÅ 5 are the densities of pure water at 4 and 5 respectively padis√°k et al 2003 the rwcs is a dimensionless coefficient which reflects the relative stability of the reservoir zhu et al 2013 and could quantify the reservoir stratification during the measurement time of this study the rwcs decreased gradually and monotonously which had a large span and thus could reflect a characteristic periodic change of stratified reservoirs 3 results 3 1 bbl environmental factors and swi oxygen fluxes in september october and november 2019 respectively 452 523 and 848 eddy correlation intervals were measured then swi oxygen fluxes were calculated for which the positive direction is from water to sediment the processed fluxes are shown in fig 3 together with bbl environmental factors the water depth of the study site dropped at an average rate of 0 272 m d 1 from 22nd to 30th september while it was relatively stable in the rest of the measurement time with a maximum depth in november fig 3a in contrast the benthic temperature and the do concentration showed small variations in september and october while they changed remarkably after fluctuating twice in november fig 3 b c the horizontal velocity the vertical velocity and the friction velocity all showed an overall increasing trend throughout the whole measurement and they were significantly stronger in november than in the other two months fig 3 d f there was a good correlation between horizontal velocities and friction velocities especially in september and october thus the turbulence was partly generated by the shear of mean flows it is noteworthy that the vertical velocity was negative in most cases suggesting this study site had a vertical downward main flow but it occasionally reversed in november with a surge in the horizontal velocity and the friction velocity the swi oxygen flux generally increased from september to november with its daily mean direction being from water to sediment i e the sediment acted as an oxygen sink fig 3g although the daytime length gradually shortened as the measurements proceeded swi oxygen fluxes during the day increased fig s3 in the appendix furthermore there was no significant pattern for the diurnal variation of swi oxygen fluxes 3 2 reservoir stratification and its impact on bbl the rwcs coefficient of the daheiting reservoir which quantifies the water stratification varied from 0 to 90 and generally decreased over time during the measurement with the exception of an outlier rwcsout 2 11 fig 4 moreover different periods showed different stratification characteristics the rwcs was 40 90 in september and its maximum value rwcsmax 81 approached the annual peak fig 2 the reservoir remained highly stratified during this time when the rwcs declined slowly and even once rebounded in contrast the reservoir stratification was weakening in october when the rwcs equaled 5 40 and it was utterly mixed during november as the rwcs was 15 and fluctuated in a small range bbl environmental factors such as benthic temperatures do concentrations horizontal velocities and friction velocities were significantly influenced by the rwcs or the stratification the benthic temperature increased with the rwcs decline until the reservoir had mixed then it rapidly decreased as time went on and was no longer regulated by the rwcs fig 4a however the do concentrations horizontal velocities and friction velocities all increased monotonically with the decrease of rwcs among them however the horizontal velocity had a relative weak correlation with the rwcs fig 4 b d it is noteworthy that the outlier had much stronger hydrodynamic conditions than other points but no huge difference in temperatures and do concentrations 3 3 joint operation and its impact on bbl hydrodynamics the daheiting reservoir serves as the reverse regulation reservoir of the panjiakou reservoir which is located just 20 km away fig 1 therefore the inflow of daheiting depends on the discharge of panjiakou meaning that operations of both the panjiakou and the daheiting should be considered to be affecting the bbl environment of the study site 3 3 1 operation of the panjiakou reservoir according to the operation history of the panjiakou daheiting cascade reservoirs the 11 23rd and the 24 30th of september were identified as the high and the low discharging cases of the panjiakou reservoir respectively table 1 for the daheiting reservoir the mean inflow difference between these two cases was nearly 70 times but other factors like the discharging volume the benthic temperature and the water depth were similar as a result there was no distinct difference in average velocity and average flow direction between the cases at the study site i e the discharge of the panjiakou reservoir had no significant effect on the bbl hydrodynamics in front of the daheiting dam under the operation and stratification conditions during the investigated time 3 3 2 operation of the daheiting reservoir in 2019 the spillway of the daheiting reservoir was not opened and all supplied water was discharged from the outlet fig 1 for a domestic or irrigation purpose the discharging rate was measured at 8 a m every day which represents the operation condition of the daheiting reservoir on that whole day it was denoted as the impounding condition when the discharge rate was zero otherwise it is marked as the discharging condition with a specific rate as a result the bbl flow direction and velocity rose maps of the study site in different conditions are shown in fig 5 when the reservoir was impounding water in october and november there was a distinct main flow along the natural channel arrow i fig 5 b c in contrast the discharging condition had different impacts at different times in september it just scattered the flow direction despite the discharging rate was 90 m3 s 1 fig 5a however this condition completely changed the main flow in november with a relatively low discharging rate fig 5d the new main direction in november did not keep with the line that connects the measurement station and the outlet arrow ii which could be attributed to the restraint of geography moreover it is noted that the fig 5c contains the feature of fig 5d due to the immature classification of operation conditions a further statistical result of fig 5 is shown in table 2 there was a significant positive correlation between the flow direction and the velocity under all operations in september and october when the reservoir was stratified however during the mixed time of the reservoir this correlation in an impounding condition was much larger than it in a discharging condition suggesting the water discharge in the mixed period disrupted the naturally statistical correlation between the benthic velocity and its direction to summarize this preliminary investigation indicates the daheiting reservoir s operation mainly affected the bbl hydrodynamic condition in the mixed time 4 discussion 4 1 response of benthic fluxes to temperatures as one of the bbl environmental variables the benthic temperature is a potential influencing factor of swi oxygen fluxes the measured benthic temperature showed an increasing trend followed by a decline with a peak lower than 11 therefore three data groups with similar do concentrations and hydrodynamics were selected during the rising september and october and declining november temperature segments respectively fig 6 a b because hargrave 1969 and mackenthun and stefan 1998 proposed that swi oxygen fluxes change linearly with temperature we interpreted them using a linear fitting the result of such fitting suggests that higher benthic temperatures were associated with greater swi oxygen fluxes in general but the relationship between them was quite weak e g the flux in the temperature declining segment was up to 5 10 times that in the rising segment under a similar benthic temperature 9 however this general rule may not hold true if the benthic temperature is relatively high based on the microelectrode method gu et al 2015 heated the water temperature from 25 to 35 in the laboratory and found that swi oxygen fluxes decreased dramatically by 40 60 when the do concentration remained practically unchanged except for the oxic group in which the do concentration increased by nearly 15 fig 6c these different fluxes temperatures variations in different environmental temperature ranges may be attributed to an optimal living temperature of benthic microorganisms for example the nitrification process has an optimum temperature of 20 30 and the nitrobacteria metabolism decreases significantly when the temperature is 15 zou et al 2001 wu et al 2013 although different microbial communities have differentiated optimal temperatures it could be concluded that the benthic temperature of the daheiting reservoir was lower than the optimal temperature range of its dominating benthic communities with respect to the mechanism the benthic temperature of reservoirs could directly affect swi oxygen fluxes by changing the do solubility the molecular thermal movement speed and the benthic biochemical reaction rate etc however this effect was not significant as far as the eddy correlation measurement result of the daheiting reservoir which originates from the bbl characteristics of medium sized reservoirs the stratification of deep water blocks the input of external energy such as solar radiation thus the benthic temperature varies only at a low rate and in a small range and therefore cannot stimulate the reproduction and metabolism of microorganisms the equation proposed by mackenthun and stefan 1998 to correct the temperature effect could support this result as well that is 3 f do t f do 20 c 1 2928 t 20 mmol m 2 d 1 where k 1 2928 the slope of the benthic oxygen flux with respect to temperature is close to the fitting results of this study in other words the direct impact of benthic temperatures on swi oxygen fluxes is limited for medium to large sized reservoirs at the same time benthic temperatures mainly affect the fluxes indirectly by participating in the reservoir stratification and then changing other bbl environmental factors such as do concentrations and hydrodynamics fig 4 nevertheless the benthic temperature still plays an important role in the material and energy cycle of reservoirs it is widely acknowledged that the temperature and pressure are two major factors affecting fresh water density the benthic temperature of the daheiting reservoir was occasionally lower than the surface temperature especially during the seasonal transition fig 2 but the benthic water density was rarely lower than that of the surface due to the limitation of pressure the outlier rwcsout 2 11 november 18th in fig 4 signifies that the density of the benthic water was smaller than that of the surface water suggesting that the reservoir had a trend of turning over furthermore this trend could be confirmed by fig 3e since the benthic vertical flow reversed and moved upward for a long time on november 18th the reservoir turnover brings accumulated pollutants in the bbl to the surface water promoting the material cycle but causing a deterioration of the reservoir water quality 4 2 response of benthic fluxes to do concentrations the do concentration which is restricted by the reservoir stratification also is a crucial bbl factor at present many models such as the thin film the film renewal the u and the lorke peeters models use the relationship 4 f k t Œ¥ c to relate fluxes f and concentration differences Œ¥c where kt refers to the transfer velocity bierlein et al 2017 however the concentration difference Œ¥c cswi cb is obtained by the microelectrode profiling method where cswi and cb are the solute concentration at the swi and the overlying water respectively therefore this Œ¥c is difficult to measure and has a weak spatial representation moreover o connor et al 2009 pointed out that the cswi increasingly approaches the cb as the velocity increases thus the flux result calculated by the above models approaches zero which disagrees with observations therefore the response of swi oxygen fluxes to benthic do concentration is explored in this research on the one hand the measured data of similar hydrodynamic conditions were screened in anoxic rwcs 15 and oxic rwcs 15 bbl environments respectively it can be seen from fig 7 a that the changes in swi oxygen fluxes with respect to benthic do concentrations were well represented by a power law under anoxic conditions such as f do 0 011cb 3 905 r 2 0 761 however the average flux remained almost unchanged with the increase of do concentrations and the correlation between the two variables was quite weak f do 0 027cb 5 528 r 2 2 10 5 when do was abundant fig 7b which conforms to the zero order reaction kinetics su et al 2018 therefore it can be inferred that the swi oxygen flux responded differently under different benthic do concentration environments on the other hand a new data group with similar hydrodynamic conditions under all do conditions was screened to test the aforementioned rules the two different response modes above were actually found to be applicable to this new group with a threshold of cb 2 7 mg l 1 between them fig 7c under the oxic condition the intercept value n of the equation f do n 0 027cb has no practical significance since its fitting goodness r 2 2 10 5 is quite small moreover this equation expresses a zero order mode indicating that the oxygen source is abundant and do concentrations do not limit swi oxygen fluxes as highlighted by the small slope k 0 027 to sum up the swi oxygen flux changed with the benthic do concentration following a power law in anoxic conditions cb 2 7 mg l 1 and thus do concentrations were the bottleneck of flux increase however the flux deviated from the growth rapidly with the increase of do concentration when fluxes were no longer controlled by do concentrations for further analysis each data record was matched with another that lies closest to its rwcs value and hydrodynamic condition if the differences in terms of normalized rwcs and normalized velocity between these two records were both less than Œª a similarity cut off they were regarded as a pair of similar conditions then the ratios of do concentrations and swi oxygen fluxes between the two records of each pair were calculated in this study n 214 pairs of similar conditions were calculated using the cut off Œª 0 003 fig 8 a which suggests higher benthic do concentrations can be associated to greater swi oxygen fluxes in general specifically the fluxes showed the following diploid response to do concentrations t f 0 904 t c 3 62 r 2 0 503 when c b varied within 0 2 7 mg l 1 0 956 t c 2 05 r 2 0 571 when c b varied from 0 2 7 mg l 1 to 2 7 10 mg l 1 where tf and tc are the ratio of swi oxygen fluxes and do concentrations respectively this empirical statistical equation provides a basis for judging the change of fluxes with do concentrations however the power fitting pattern makes the result sensitive to its index especially when the tc is large it is noteworthy that this formula does not apply to cases in which the do concentration varied within 2 7 10 mg l 1 which can be illustrated by fig 8b the value of Œª was increased to 0 005 0 010 0 050 and 0 100 respectively and the similar pairs n were recalculated accordingly this relaxation of the similarity cut off Œª caused an increase of similar condition pairs Œ¥n that were mostly around the tc 1 which suggests that the records of those new pairs had a small do concentration difference but a considerable random flux difference this result is mainly attributed to the relaxation of the hydrodynamic screening cut off Œª and is consistent with what shown in fig 7b i e it corresponds to a condition in which do concentrations no longer control the swi oxygen fluxes in other words the hydrodynamic variables such as velocities reynolds numbers and dbl thicknesses became the controlling factor of the swi oxygen flux in the oxic environment the response of the swi oxygen fluxes to benthic do concentrations is of significance for optimizing the aeration plans to improve water quality su et al 2018 the results above indicate that oxygenation measures such as aeration could indeed accelerate the benthic oxygen exchange rate but this benefit does not always increase significantly with an increase of power or input for example in the experiment of gu et al 2015 fig 6c a do concentration increment of 0 3 mg l 1 from the anoxic to the normal group led to a higher flux benefit than that of 2 mg l 1 from the normal to the oxic group 4 3 response of benthic fluxes to hydrodynamics the third important bbl environmental factor investigated in this study is the hydrodynamic condition which is constrained by reservoir stratification and operation on the other hand it affects swi fluxes by changing the dbl thickness wang et al 2016 lei et al 2018 gao et al 2020 the dbl is a several mm thick area above the swi where molecular diffusion is stronger than turbulent diffusion and thus it acts as a bottleneck for the swi fluxes the dbl thickness is mainly controlled by the mean flow in high energy systems with sizeable benthic velocities such as estuaries and shelf seas whereas it is regulated by the turbulence in low energy systems like lakes and medium to large sized reservoirs therefore for the daheiting reservoir we utilized the friction velocity u to quantify the turbulence and introduced the batchelor scale to calculate dbl thicknesses the equation is in table s1 of the appendix and the batchelor scale represents the minimum scale that the solute concentration fluctuation could maintain under the turbulent diffusion then the response of the swi oxygen fluxes to the dbl thicknesses was explored considering the dimensional balance the relation between dbl thicknesses and benthic velocities could be denoted as 5 Œ¥ dbl a d u b 1 b where Œ¥ dbl is the dbl thickness mm d is the molecular diffusion coefficient mm2 s 1 and ub is the resultant benthic velocity mm s 1 moreover the coefficient a in this equation expresses the variation feature of the dbl thickness at a low velocity while the coefficient b describes the stable level of dbl at a relatively high flow speed three groups of measured data with similar do concentrations were screened when rwcs 0 15 15 40 and 40 90 respectively it was found that the dbl thickness had a similar response to benthic velocities under different hydrodynamic conditions fig 9 a in general the smaller the rwcs value the smaller the dbl thickness and the coefficient b but the larger the coefficient a suggesting that the dbl was increasingly sensitive to the velocity as the reservoir stratification faded away this is because the external energy was transferred to the benthic water since the stratification had weakened thus the dbl was firstly controlled by the turbulence but then gradually transferred to the mean flow actually both turbulence and mean flow could affect the dbl thickness since the mean flow reduces the pressure and increases dbl thicknesses while the turbulence affects it by changing the minimum scale of do concentration fluctuation i e the batchelor scale and the stricter restrain of the two determines the actual dbl thickness besides the reservoir stratification human operations also promoted a more active benthic environment by intensifying the current exchange for example benthic hydrodynamics are affected by flood discharging through the bottom outlet or water supplying by the layered intake for cascade reservoirs like the panjiakou daheiting hypothermic water discharged by the upstream reservoir flows down and improves the bbl hydrodynamics of the downstream making the benthic environment more active the overall response of dbl thicknesses to benthic velocities Œ¥ dbl 1070 8dub 1 0 623 r 2 0 416 fig 9b was compared with the microelectrode experiment results of wang et al 2012 in the huichang bay and the bohai bay both sites were not stratified but the latter site had a stronger hydrodynamic condition it can be inferred that the more frequent water exchange i e the higher the ambient energy the larger the coefficient a while the smaller the coefficient b in the relationship between dbl thicknesses and benthic velocities a relationship between fluxes and dbl thicknesses of 6 f do cŒ¥ dbl 1 was hypothesized in this study referring to the thin film model that 7 f d Œ¥ dbl Œ¥ c in this hypothetic formula the coefficient c d Œ¥c uniquely describes the environmental feature of fluxes changing with dbl thicknesses and its magnitude is theoretically estimated be to around 100 mmol mm 1 d 1 as the process described above three measured data groups with similar do concentrations were screened and used for fitting under rwcs 0 15 15 40 and 40 90 then the fitting coefficients c h 2 6922 c m 1 2493 and c l 0 3688 were obtained in high medium and low do environments respectively fig 10 a it can be concluded that the higher the benthic do concentrations the larger are the coefficient c and the swi oxygen fluxes under the same dbl thickness however this increase was nonlinear which is consistent with the discussion in 4 2 the overall response of swi oxygen fluxes to dbl thicknesses can be described as f do 1 856Œ¥ dbl 1 r 2 0 410 fig 10b where the magnitude of this fitting coefficient c 1 856 meets its theoretical prediction to further compare this coefficient a series of experimental data on dbl thickness and oxygen fluxes was collected and divided into two groups according to their proximity as fig 10b shows the coefficient c 1 856 for the daheiting reservoir is close to the integrated experiment result c 2 633 of n√∏hr glud et al 1994 epping and helder 1997 and gao et al 2020 but is different from the other integrated result c 4 929 of bryant et al 2010 wang et al 2012 bierlein et al 2017 and schwefel et al 2017 therefore the fitting coefficient c which has a dimension of m l 1 t 1 the change rate of vertical linear density and describes a space time distribution of bbl solutes is regarded as an environmental parameter that quantifies the response characteristics of swi fluxes to dbl thicknesses in other words the benthic do field determined the coefficient c in the response of swi oxygen fluxes to dbl thicknesses 5 conclusion a noninvasive long term in situ eddy correlation measurement was conducted in the daheiting reservoir a thermal stratified and human operated water environment the results suggested that swi oxygen fluxes generally increased from september to november without a distinct diurnal variation rule benthic temperatures do concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions increased as the stratification weakened but the temperature deviated from this trend and decreased when the reservoir was mixed moreover during the mixed period the flow direction and its correlation to velocity was prominently regulated by the reservoir operation swi oxygen fluxes showed different responses to various bbl environmental factors the bbl temperature had no significant direct impact on the fluxes since benthic temperatures of deep water varied only in a limited range at a low rate however the bbl temperature still matters since it participated in the stratification and then changed do concentrations and hydrodynamics both of which determined swi oxygen fluxes in a coupled way the flux growth was inhibited by the do shortage following the power law under an anoxic environment while it was controlled by the hydrodynamics in an oxic condition with a threshold of 2 7 mg l 1 the hydrodynamic conditions affected swi oxygen fluxes by changing dbl thicknesses in the relation Œ¥ dbl adub 1 b where a higher ambient energy led to a larger a coefficient and corresponded to a more significant effect of hydrodynamics however this effect was regulated by do concentrations in the relation f do cŒ¥ dbl 1 where the coefficient c was determined by the do field and a higher benthic do concentration led to a greater c coefficient in general the long term measurement of swi oxygen fluxes and a detailed understanding of its responses allows us to forecast water quality disasters and provides a basis for optimizing operation plans this is of considerable significance to water security especially in the present era when cascaded development is prevalent and water transfer projects are rising if the water quality of drinking reservoirs deteriorates the whole water supply chain will be struck in the future the eddy correlation method could be combined with sediment sampling microbial community analysis and multiple fluxes measurements such as h2s and greenhouse gases to provide a further basis for ensuring the reservoir water security credit authorship contribution

4782,benthic oxygen fluxes at the sediment water interface swi regulate the process and even direction of biochemical interfacial reactions thus they are crucial to the water quality however many medium and large sized reservoirs suffer from thermal stratification and human operations lead to a significant impact on swi oxygen exchanges a 3 month long noninvasive measurement of swi oxygen fluxes was conducted in the daheiting reservoir using the eddy correlation method its result shows that reservoir stratification markedly affects the benthic boundary layer environment factors such as temperature dissolved oxygen do concentration and hydrodynamics in contrast reservoir operations determine the benthic flow directions and its correlation to velocities in the mixed stage a further discussion suggests that benthic temperatures mainly participate in the thermal structure rather than directly affecting the benthic fluxes conversely it is do concentrations coupled with hydrodynamics that control swi oxygen fluxes the flux is inhibited by do shortage in anoxic conditions but it is mainly controlled by hydrodynamics with redundant do likewise the hydrodynamics affects the fluxes by changing the diffusive boundary layer thickness but this effect is also restrained by the do field these results indicate that a long term and in situ measurement of swi oxygen fluxes in drinking reservoirs is of considerable significance to forecast water quality disasters optimize operation plans and ensure water security keywords reservoir thermal stratification human operations benthic oxygen fluxes sediment water interface eddy correlation method 1 introduction approximately 2 8 million dams with reservoir areas over 103 m2 have been built worldwide grill et al 2019 to generate power supply water etc however the increased water depth leads to a seasonal stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen do thus a long term anoxic area occurs at the bottom of reservoirs greatly threatening the water ecology bosch and allan 2008 furthermore differently from natural deep lakes and rivers the reservoir flow is regulated by human operations li et al 2010 which exert a considerable impact on the benthic boundary layer bbl environment as well lorke and peeters 2006 allison and pratt 2017 sediment is a primary sink for do in the bbl schwefel et al 2016 and oxygen consumption at the sediment water interface swi is closely associated with the respiration of benthic animals the degradation of organic matter and the oxidation of decay products the swi oxygen flux provides valuable information on these biochemical processes and is an important water quality parameter in studies of aquatic sediment berg et al 2003 for example a high swi oxygen flux inhibits the release of nutrients such as n and p in the sediment thouvenot et al 2007 banks et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 while a relatively low flux prevents the diffusion of heavy metals such as cu and cr and affects their occurrence state burgess and kester 2002 yan et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 therefore the magnitude of swi oxygen fluxes and their dependence on reservoir stratification and operation are essential for understanding the reservoir oxygen budget as well as ensuring the quality of supplied water measurements of swi oxygen fluxes are often restricted to invasive or ex situ methods such as micro profiling benthic chambers and core incubations these techniques however neglect the effect of natural flow and exchange of water bound constituents on swi fluxes perran et al 2007 reidenbach et al 2010 moreover they can only determine the fluxes for a small and enclosed area with do depletion as the measurement progresses tengberg et al 2005 for example a typical benthic chamber has an area of only 0 25 m2 wild et al 2009 therefore it cannot account for reservoir operations by comparison the eddy correlation technique is a relatively new alternative for measuring benthic oxygen fluxes as it derives fluxes at real in situ conditions by recording vertical flow velocities and do concentrations simultaneously berg et al 2003 this is a noninvasive approach with a high temporal resolution rheuban and berg 2013 which integrates over a large area of 10 100 m2 berg et al 2007 while resolving fluxes down to at least 1 mmol m 2 d 1 berg et al 2009 these distinctive characteristics make the eddy correlation technique applicable to study reservoirs where traditional methods are less feasible a number of studies most of which focusing on ecosystem metabolism and carbon budgets in shallow waters have adopted the eddy correlation technique to measure swi oxygen fluxes glud et al 2010 for instance quantified swi oxygen exchange rates in different substrates and revealed that hardbottom communities play an important role in coastal carbon cycling berg et al 2013 documented the control that current flow and light have on swi oxygen fluxes the authors also developed an applicative fitting model and found that net ecosystem metabolism varies substantially among days volaric et al 2019 measured benthic oxygen uptake at tidal flats to confirm that an invasive macroalgal enhances ecosystem productivity while attenuates flow and turbulence however few studies have reported the impact of thermal stratification and human operations on oxygen uptake by the eddy correlation technique and only one research analyzed the effect of ship locking on swi fluxes in impounded rivers lorke et al 2012 so far the majority of eddy correlation measurements have been conducted in rivers murniati et al 2015 lakes mcginnis et al 2008 brand et al 2008 shallow coastal areas koopmans and berg 2015 long et al 2019 rodil et al 2019 and deep ocean berg et al 2009 de froe et al 2019 on the other hand reservoirs whose benthic oxygen exchange rate is difficult to acquire but of great significance to the quality of supplied water is still poorly explored in this study we conducted eddy correlation measurements covering three months in the daheiting reservoir an important source of water supply in north china we aimed to analyze the benthic environment characteristic of this naturally stratified and artificially operated reservoir and then explore the response of swi oxygen fluxes to three benthic environmental factors benthic temperature do concentration and hydrodynamic conditions the leading factor controlling swi oxygen fluxes was distinguished under different conditions and a concentration threshold of do in a dominant position was proposed in this reservoir providing a reference to construct water quality models and plan water quality improvement measures 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the daheiting reservoir is located 30 km downstream of the panjiakou reservoir 5 km north of qianxi county in hebei province china this reservoir is shallower in upstream while deeper in downstream with an average depth of 13 84 m during normal operation but the water depth in front of the dam can reach 25 m at the same time it has a length of 22 km and a storage capacity of 337 million m3 thus it is a medium sized reservoir that participates in the cascaded development of the luanhe river in the past 30 years a total of nearly 35 9 billion m3 of water had been supplied to tianjin from the daheiting reservoir by the luanhe water diversion project and the vast farmland in its lower reaches was benefited as well however an extensive cage fish farming was carried out in this reservoir from the 1990 s to 2017 and large amounts of organic pesticides entered the reservoir with the runoff as a result numerous nutrients organics and heavy metals have been deposited together with the sediment xu et al 2019 and the water quality of the daheiting reservoir has deteriorated thereby threatening the drinking water safety and the regional coordinated development the measurement station of swi oxygen fluxes was established upstream of the daheiting dam 40 12 7 07 n 118 18 43 49 e fig 1 this station has a flat underlying surface and a robust spatial representation with a depth varying from 18 m to 24 m in 2019 moreover the distance from the station and the spillway and the outlet are both less than 800 m therefore the measurements can adequately reflect the impact of reservoir operation on the bbl environment 2 2 methods the eddy correlation technique has been adopted to conduct a noninvasive long term and in situ measurement of swi oxygen fluxes in the daheiting reservoir this method fixes a measurement point in the logarithmic layer above the swi where i do diffuses steadily and ii its source or sink between the point and the swi are negligible it also requires the measurement point to have a long and flat underlying surface in the upstream so that iii the advection and horizontal gradient of do also can be neglected based on the above premises and the momentum conservation equation of fluid components berg et al 2003 deduced that swi oxygen fluxes could be calculated by the covariance of vertical flow velocities and do concentrations this could be written as 1 f w c where w is the fluctuation of vertical velocities cm s 1 and c is the fluctuation of do concentrations mg l 1 the eddy measurement system fig 1 used in this study consists of an acoustic doppler velometer adv vector 300 m nortek norway a fast responding do sensor aro ec jfe advantech japan data transmitting equipment dtu nortek norway and other auxiliary facilities such as a tripod battery groups cables and floating platforms the adv could measure water temperatures water depths and the rapid change of three dimensional flow turbulences with a high resolution and precision its turbulence measurement area is a cylindrical sampling volume with a diameter of 15 mm and a height of 18 mm located 15 cm below the signal transmitter chanson et al 2008 the aro ec which is derived from the fluorescence life time method berg et al 2016 is employed to acquire do concentrations in a way that is less sensitive to the environment and less lossy of the signal amplitude this aro ec sensor does not consume do compared with conventional clark type microelectrodes berg et al 2003 lorrai et al 2010 thus it makes the eddy measurement system robust and enables a long term swi oxygen fluxes measurement furthermore the dtu module transmits measured data and controlling commands remotely in real time resolving the data storage issue and realizing a long term online measurement of fluxes when the system was installed fig 1 the adv and the aro ec were placed above the swi using a tripod and the aro ec outputted signals through two analog channels provided by the adv ensuring a simultaneous recording of velocities and do concentrations the dtu module with battery groups was fixed on the anchored floating platform which received measured data while supplied power by waterproof communication cables matlab programs based on sohfea v2 0 http sohfea dfmcginnis com were used to calculate the swi oxygen fluxes whose workflow is shown in fig s1 of the appendix its main work includes data cleaning coordinate rotation time shift correction running averaging of fluctuations and eddy frequency screening it is notable that both a high frequency noise and a low frequency advection lead to a distortion of flux results which are processed by the high frequency correction and the time segmentation respectively moreover several bbl environmental factors like friction velocity batchelor scale and diffusion boundary layer dbl thickness were calculated by formulas in table s1 of the appendix as well 2 3 measurement plans we conducted three long term in situ eddy correlation measurements covering september to november 2019 when the reservoir stratification was weakening but the demand of water supplying was growing all measurements were carried out intermittently so the whole measurement time span was divided into successive intervals as fig s2 in the appendix shows each time interval consisted of a 15 min continuous data recording followed by a 5 or 15 min pause the 5 min pause was adopted on september 17 30th and october 13 24th while the 15 min pause was employed on november 9 30th in order to avoid signal interference the aro ec tip was placed at an equal height but 2 cm away from the sampling volume of the adv gao et al 2020 both of them sampled data at 32 hz we considered a vector of the adv sampling volume pointed to the aro ec tip as the default direction which should be as consistent with the current direction as possible the distance between the adv sample volume and the tripod bottom was adjusted to 65 cm considering that this study site had a gentle benthic flow and lots of deposited sediment moreover historical data that characterize this study site are shown in fig 2 the water flow volume was provided by the haihe river water conservancy commission http yingyong hwcc gov cn 8080 hwccapp lyysq init the temperature profile was measured by water quality instruments exo1 ysi the usa and the rwcs relative water column stability was calculated based on the water density it is defined that 2 rwcs œÅ h œÅ s œÅ 4 œÅ 5 where œÅ h is the density of the bottom water œÅ s is the density of the surface water and œÅ 4 œÅ 5 are the densities of pure water at 4 and 5 respectively padis√°k et al 2003 the rwcs is a dimensionless coefficient which reflects the relative stability of the reservoir zhu et al 2013 and could quantify the reservoir stratification during the measurement time of this study the rwcs decreased gradually and monotonously which had a large span and thus could reflect a characteristic periodic change of stratified reservoirs 3 results 3 1 bbl environmental factors and swi oxygen fluxes in september october and november 2019 respectively 452 523 and 848 eddy correlation intervals were measured then swi oxygen fluxes were calculated for which the positive direction is from water to sediment the processed fluxes are shown in fig 3 together with bbl environmental factors the water depth of the study site dropped at an average rate of 0 272 m d 1 from 22nd to 30th september while it was relatively stable in the rest of the measurement time with a maximum depth in november fig 3a in contrast the benthic temperature and the do concentration showed small variations in september and october while they changed remarkably after fluctuating twice in november fig 3 b c the horizontal velocity the vertical velocity and the friction velocity all showed an overall increasing trend throughout the whole measurement and they were significantly stronger in november than in the other two months fig 3 d f there was a good correlation between horizontal velocities and friction velocities especially in september and october thus the turbulence was partly generated by the shear of mean flows it is noteworthy that the vertical velocity was negative in most cases suggesting this study site had a vertical downward main flow but it occasionally reversed in november with a surge in the horizontal velocity and the friction velocity the swi oxygen flux generally increased from september to november with its daily mean direction being from water to sediment i e the sediment acted as an oxygen sink fig 3g although the daytime length gradually shortened as the measurements proceeded swi oxygen fluxes during the day increased fig s3 in the appendix furthermore there was no significant pattern for the diurnal variation of swi oxygen fluxes 3 2 reservoir stratification and its impact on bbl the rwcs coefficient of the daheiting reservoir which quantifies the water stratification varied from 0 to 90 and generally decreased over time during the measurement with the exception of an outlier rwcsout 2 11 fig 4 moreover different periods showed different stratification characteristics the rwcs was 40 90 in september and its maximum value rwcsmax 81 approached the annual peak fig 2 the reservoir remained highly stratified during this time when the rwcs declined slowly and even once rebounded in contrast the reservoir stratification was weakening in october when the rwcs equaled 5 40 and it was utterly mixed during november as the rwcs was 15 and fluctuated in a small range bbl environmental factors such as benthic temperatures do concentrations horizontal velocities and friction velocities were significantly influenced by the rwcs or the stratification the benthic temperature increased with the rwcs decline until the reservoir had mixed then it rapidly decreased as time went on and was no longer regulated by the rwcs fig 4a however the do concentrations horizontal velocities and friction velocities all increased monotonically with the decrease of rwcs among them however the horizontal velocity had a relative weak correlation with the rwcs fig 4 b d it is noteworthy that the outlier had much stronger hydrodynamic conditions than other points but no huge difference in temperatures and do concentrations 3 3 joint operation and its impact on bbl hydrodynamics the daheiting reservoir serves as the reverse regulation reservoir of the panjiakou reservoir which is located just 20 km away fig 1 therefore the inflow of daheiting depends on the discharge of panjiakou meaning that operations of both the panjiakou and the daheiting should be considered to be affecting the bbl environment of the study site 3 3 1 operation of the panjiakou reservoir according to the operation history of the panjiakou daheiting cascade reservoirs the 11 23rd and the 24 30th of september were identified as the high and the low discharging cases of the panjiakou reservoir respectively table 1 for the daheiting reservoir the mean inflow difference between these two cases was nearly 70 times but other factors like the discharging volume the benthic temperature and the water depth were similar as a result there was no distinct difference in average velocity and average flow direction between the cases at the study site i e the discharge of the panjiakou reservoir had no significant effect on the bbl hydrodynamics in front of the daheiting dam under the operation and stratification conditions during the investigated time 3 3 2 operation of the daheiting reservoir in 2019 the spillway of the daheiting reservoir was not opened and all supplied water was discharged from the outlet fig 1 for a domestic or irrigation purpose the discharging rate was measured at 8 a m every day which represents the operation condition of the daheiting reservoir on that whole day it was denoted as the impounding condition when the discharge rate was zero otherwise it is marked as the discharging condition with a specific rate as a result the bbl flow direction and velocity rose maps of the study site in different conditions are shown in fig 5 when the reservoir was impounding water in october and november there was a distinct main flow along the natural channel arrow i fig 5 b c in contrast the discharging condition had different impacts at different times in september it just scattered the flow direction despite the discharging rate was 90 m3 s 1 fig 5a however this condition completely changed the main flow in november with a relatively low discharging rate fig 5d the new main direction in november did not keep with the line that connects the measurement station and the outlet arrow ii which could be attributed to the restraint of geography moreover it is noted that the fig 5c contains the feature of fig 5d due to the immature classification of operation conditions a further statistical result of fig 5 is shown in table 2 there was a significant positive correlation between the flow direction and the velocity under all operations in september and october when the reservoir was stratified however during the mixed time of the reservoir this correlation in an impounding condition was much larger than it in a discharging condition suggesting the water discharge in the mixed period disrupted the naturally statistical correlation between the benthic velocity and its direction to summarize this preliminary investigation indicates the daheiting reservoir s operation mainly affected the bbl hydrodynamic condition in the mixed time 4 discussion 4 1 response of benthic fluxes to temperatures as one of the bbl environmental variables the benthic temperature is a potential influencing factor of swi oxygen fluxes the measured benthic temperature showed an increasing trend followed by a decline with a peak lower than 11 therefore three data groups with similar do concentrations and hydrodynamics were selected during the rising september and october and declining november temperature segments respectively fig 6 a b because hargrave 1969 and mackenthun and stefan 1998 proposed that swi oxygen fluxes change linearly with temperature we interpreted them using a linear fitting the result of such fitting suggests that higher benthic temperatures were associated with greater swi oxygen fluxes in general but the relationship between them was quite weak e g the flux in the temperature declining segment was up to 5 10 times that in the rising segment under a similar benthic temperature 9 however this general rule may not hold true if the benthic temperature is relatively high based on the microelectrode method gu et al 2015 heated the water temperature from 25 to 35 in the laboratory and found that swi oxygen fluxes decreased dramatically by 40 60 when the do concentration remained practically unchanged except for the oxic group in which the do concentration increased by nearly 15 fig 6c these different fluxes temperatures variations in different environmental temperature ranges may be attributed to an optimal living temperature of benthic microorganisms for example the nitrification process has an optimum temperature of 20 30 and the nitrobacteria metabolism decreases significantly when the temperature is 15 zou et al 2001 wu et al 2013 although different microbial communities have differentiated optimal temperatures it could be concluded that the benthic temperature of the daheiting reservoir was lower than the optimal temperature range of its dominating benthic communities with respect to the mechanism the benthic temperature of reservoirs could directly affect swi oxygen fluxes by changing the do solubility the molecular thermal movement speed and the benthic biochemical reaction rate etc however this effect was not significant as far as the eddy correlation measurement result of the daheiting reservoir which originates from the bbl characteristics of medium sized reservoirs the stratification of deep water blocks the input of external energy such as solar radiation thus the benthic temperature varies only at a low rate and in a small range and therefore cannot stimulate the reproduction and metabolism of microorganisms the equation proposed by mackenthun and stefan 1998 to correct the temperature effect could support this result as well that is 3 f do t f do 20 c 1 2928 t 20 mmol m 2 d 1 where k 1 2928 the slope of the benthic oxygen flux with respect to temperature is close to the fitting results of this study in other words the direct impact of benthic temperatures on swi oxygen fluxes is limited for medium to large sized reservoirs at the same time benthic temperatures mainly affect the fluxes indirectly by participating in the reservoir stratification and then changing other bbl environmental factors such as do concentrations and hydrodynamics fig 4 nevertheless the benthic temperature still plays an important role in the material and energy cycle of reservoirs it is widely acknowledged that the temperature and pressure are two major factors affecting fresh water density the benthic temperature of the daheiting reservoir was occasionally lower than the surface temperature especially during the seasonal transition fig 2 but the benthic water density was rarely lower than that of the surface due to the limitation of pressure the outlier rwcsout 2 11 november 18th in fig 4 signifies that the density of the benthic water was smaller than that of the surface water suggesting that the reservoir had a trend of turning over furthermore this trend could be confirmed by fig 3e since the benthic vertical flow reversed and moved upward for a long time on november 18th the reservoir turnover brings accumulated pollutants in the bbl to the surface water promoting the material cycle but causing a deterioration of the reservoir water quality 4 2 response of benthic fluxes to do concentrations the do concentration which is restricted by the reservoir stratification also is a crucial bbl factor at present many models such as the thin film the film renewal the u and the lorke peeters models use the relationship 4 f k t Œ¥ c to relate fluxes f and concentration differences Œ¥c where kt refers to the transfer velocity bierlein et al 2017 however the concentration difference Œ¥c cswi cb is obtained by the microelectrode profiling method where cswi and cb are the solute concentration at the swi and the overlying water respectively therefore this Œ¥c is difficult to measure and has a weak spatial representation moreover o connor et al 2009 pointed out that the cswi increasingly approaches the cb as the velocity increases thus the flux result calculated by the above models approaches zero which disagrees with observations therefore the response of swi oxygen fluxes to benthic do concentration is explored in this research on the one hand the measured data of similar hydrodynamic conditions were screened in anoxic rwcs 15 and oxic rwcs 15 bbl environments respectively it can be seen from fig 7 a that the changes in swi oxygen fluxes with respect to benthic do concentrations were well represented by a power law under anoxic conditions such as f do 0 011cb 3 905 r 2 0 761 however the average flux remained almost unchanged with the increase of do concentrations and the correlation between the two variables was quite weak f do 0 027cb 5 528 r 2 2 10 5 when do was abundant fig 7b which conforms to the zero order reaction kinetics su et al 2018 therefore it can be inferred that the swi oxygen flux responded differently under different benthic do concentration environments on the other hand a new data group with similar hydrodynamic conditions under all do conditions was screened to test the aforementioned rules the two different response modes above were actually found to be applicable to this new group with a threshold of cb 2 7 mg l 1 between them fig 7c under the oxic condition the intercept value n of the equation f do n 0 027cb has no practical significance since its fitting goodness r 2 2 10 5 is quite small moreover this equation expresses a zero order mode indicating that the oxygen source is abundant and do concentrations do not limit swi oxygen fluxes as highlighted by the small slope k 0 027 to sum up the swi oxygen flux changed with the benthic do concentration following a power law in anoxic conditions cb 2 7 mg l 1 and thus do concentrations were the bottleneck of flux increase however the flux deviated from the growth rapidly with the increase of do concentration when fluxes were no longer controlled by do concentrations for further analysis each data record was matched with another that lies closest to its rwcs value and hydrodynamic condition if the differences in terms of normalized rwcs and normalized velocity between these two records were both less than Œª a similarity cut off they were regarded as a pair of similar conditions then the ratios of do concentrations and swi oxygen fluxes between the two records of each pair were calculated in this study n 214 pairs of similar conditions were calculated using the cut off Œª 0 003 fig 8 a which suggests higher benthic do concentrations can be associated to greater swi oxygen fluxes in general specifically the fluxes showed the following diploid response to do concentrations t f 0 904 t c 3 62 r 2 0 503 when c b varied within 0 2 7 mg l 1 0 956 t c 2 05 r 2 0 571 when c b varied from 0 2 7 mg l 1 to 2 7 10 mg l 1 where tf and tc are the ratio of swi oxygen fluxes and do concentrations respectively this empirical statistical equation provides a basis for judging the change of fluxes with do concentrations however the power fitting pattern makes the result sensitive to its index especially when the tc is large it is noteworthy that this formula does not apply to cases in which the do concentration varied within 2 7 10 mg l 1 which can be illustrated by fig 8b the value of Œª was increased to 0 005 0 010 0 050 and 0 100 respectively and the similar pairs n were recalculated accordingly this relaxation of the similarity cut off Œª caused an increase of similar condition pairs Œ¥n that were mostly around the tc 1 which suggests that the records of those new pairs had a small do concentration difference but a considerable random flux difference this result is mainly attributed to the relaxation of the hydrodynamic screening cut off Œª and is consistent with what shown in fig 7b i e it corresponds to a condition in which do concentrations no longer control the swi oxygen fluxes in other words the hydrodynamic variables such as velocities reynolds numbers and dbl thicknesses became the controlling factor of the swi oxygen flux in the oxic environment the response of the swi oxygen fluxes to benthic do concentrations is of significance for optimizing the aeration plans to improve water quality su et al 2018 the results above indicate that oxygenation measures such as aeration could indeed accelerate the benthic oxygen exchange rate but this benefit does not always increase significantly with an increase of power or input for example in the experiment of gu et al 2015 fig 6c a do concentration increment of 0 3 mg l 1 from the anoxic to the normal group led to a higher flux benefit than that of 2 mg l 1 from the normal to the oxic group 4 3 response of benthic fluxes to hydrodynamics the third important bbl environmental factor investigated in this study is the hydrodynamic condition which is constrained by reservoir stratification and operation on the other hand it affects swi fluxes by changing the dbl thickness wang et al 2016 lei et al 2018 gao et al 2020 the dbl is a several mm thick area above the swi where molecular diffusion is stronger than turbulent diffusion and thus it acts as a bottleneck for the swi fluxes the dbl thickness is mainly controlled by the mean flow in high energy systems with sizeable benthic velocities such as estuaries and shelf seas whereas it is regulated by the turbulence in low energy systems like lakes and medium to large sized reservoirs therefore for the daheiting reservoir we utilized the friction velocity u to quantify the turbulence and introduced the batchelor scale to calculate dbl thicknesses the equation is in table s1 of the appendix and the batchelor scale represents the minimum scale that the solute concentration fluctuation could maintain under the turbulent diffusion then the response of the swi oxygen fluxes to the dbl thicknesses was explored considering the dimensional balance the relation between dbl thicknesses and benthic velocities could be denoted as 5 Œ¥ dbl a d u b 1 b where Œ¥ dbl is the dbl thickness mm d is the molecular diffusion coefficient mm2 s 1 and ub is the resultant benthic velocity mm s 1 moreover the coefficient a in this equation expresses the variation feature of the dbl thickness at a low velocity while the coefficient b describes the stable level of dbl at a relatively high flow speed three groups of measured data with similar do concentrations were screened when rwcs 0 15 15 40 and 40 90 respectively it was found that the dbl thickness had a similar response to benthic velocities under different hydrodynamic conditions fig 9 a in general the smaller the rwcs value the smaller the dbl thickness and the coefficient b but the larger the coefficient a suggesting that the dbl was increasingly sensitive to the velocity as the reservoir stratification faded away this is because the external energy was transferred to the benthic water since the stratification had weakened thus the dbl was firstly controlled by the turbulence but then gradually transferred to the mean flow actually both turbulence and mean flow could affect the dbl thickness since the mean flow reduces the pressure and increases dbl thicknesses while the turbulence affects it by changing the minimum scale of do concentration fluctuation i e the batchelor scale and the stricter restrain of the two determines the actual dbl thickness besides the reservoir stratification human operations also promoted a more active benthic environment by intensifying the current exchange for example benthic hydrodynamics are affected by flood discharging through the bottom outlet or water supplying by the layered intake for cascade reservoirs like the panjiakou daheiting hypothermic water discharged by the upstream reservoir flows down and improves the bbl hydrodynamics of the downstream making the benthic environment more active the overall response of dbl thicknesses to benthic velocities Œ¥ dbl 1070 8dub 1 0 623 r 2 0 416 fig 9b was compared with the microelectrode experiment results of wang et al 2012 in the huichang bay and the bohai bay both sites were not stratified but the latter site had a stronger hydrodynamic condition it can be inferred that the more frequent water exchange i e the higher the ambient energy the larger the coefficient a while the smaller the coefficient b in the relationship between dbl thicknesses and benthic velocities a relationship between fluxes and dbl thicknesses of 6 f do cŒ¥ dbl 1 was hypothesized in this study referring to the thin film model that 7 f d Œ¥ dbl Œ¥ c in this hypothetic formula the coefficient c d Œ¥c uniquely describes the environmental feature of fluxes changing with dbl thicknesses and its magnitude is theoretically estimated be to around 100 mmol mm 1 d 1 as the process described above three measured data groups with similar do concentrations were screened and used for fitting under rwcs 0 15 15 40 and 40 90 then the fitting coefficients c h 2 6922 c m 1 2493 and c l 0 3688 were obtained in high medium and low do environments respectively fig 10 a it can be concluded that the higher the benthic do concentrations the larger are the coefficient c and the swi oxygen fluxes under the same dbl thickness however this increase was nonlinear which is consistent with the discussion in 4 2 the overall response of swi oxygen fluxes to dbl thicknesses can be described as f do 1 856Œ¥ dbl 1 r 2 0 410 fig 10b where the magnitude of this fitting coefficient c 1 856 meets its theoretical prediction to further compare this coefficient a series of experimental data on dbl thickness and oxygen fluxes was collected and divided into two groups according to their proximity as fig 10b shows the coefficient c 1 856 for the daheiting reservoir is close to the integrated experiment result c 2 633 of n√∏hr glud et al 1994 epping and helder 1997 and gao et al 2020 but is different from the other integrated result c 4 929 of bryant et al 2010 wang et al 2012 bierlein et al 2017 and schwefel et al 2017 therefore the fitting coefficient c which has a dimension of m l 1 t 1 the change rate of vertical linear density and describes a space time distribution of bbl solutes is regarded as an environmental parameter that quantifies the response characteristics of swi fluxes to dbl thicknesses in other words the benthic do field determined the coefficient c in the response of swi oxygen fluxes to dbl thicknesses 5 conclusion a noninvasive long term in situ eddy correlation measurement was conducted in the daheiting reservoir a thermal stratified and human operated water environment the results suggested that swi oxygen fluxes generally increased from september to november without a distinct diurnal variation rule benthic temperatures do concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions increased as the stratification weakened but the temperature deviated from this trend and decreased when the reservoir was mixed moreover during the mixed period the flow direction and its correlation to velocity was prominently regulated by the reservoir operation swi oxygen fluxes showed different responses to various bbl environmental factors the bbl temperature had no significant direct impact on the fluxes since benthic temperatures of deep water varied only in a limited range at a low rate however the bbl temperature still matters since it participated in the stratification and then changed do concentrations and hydrodynamics both of which determined swi oxygen fluxes in a coupled way the flux growth was inhibited by the do shortage following the power law under an anoxic environment while it was controlled by the hydrodynamics in an oxic condition with a threshold of 2 7 mg l 1 the hydrodynamic conditions affected swi oxygen fluxes by changing dbl thicknesses in the relation Œ¥ dbl adub 1 b where a higher ambient energy led to a larger a coefficient and corresponded to a more significant effect of hydrodynamics however this effect was regulated by do concentrations in the relation f do cŒ¥ dbl 1 where the coefficient c was determined by the do field and a higher benthic do concentration led to a greater c coefficient in general the long term measurement of swi oxygen fluxes and a detailed understanding of its responses allows us to forecast water quality disasters and provides a basis for optimizing operation plans this is of considerable significance to water security especially in the present era when cascaded development is prevalent and water transfer projects are rising if the water quality of drinking reservoirs deteriorates the whole water supply chain will be struck in the future the eddy correlation method could be combined with sediment sampling microbial community analysis and multiple fluxes measurements such as h2s and greenhouse gases to provide a further basis for ensuring the reservoir water security credit authorship contribution

4783,organic and inorganic carbon reservoirs are investigated in surface and groundwater in the semi to hyper arid r√≠o loa basin in northern chile part of the study area is within the andean volcanic arc and volcanism is responsible for large inputs of 14c depleted co2 which hampers groundwater residence time estimations using dissolved inorganic carbon dic to better understand the area s carbon system we investigated 14c and Œ¥13c in dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater and surface water doc concentrations are low in all water samples analyzed 16 53 Œºm fluorescence and Œ¥13c measurements on doc indicate that dissolved organic matter dom entering groundwater has characteristics of humic compounds derived from terrestrial plants in the recharge area fluorescence is lost in groundwater in the lower part of the system due to microbial or abiotic degradation changes in 14cdoc and Œ¥13cdoc also indicate that microbial activity contributes to doc possibly from geogenic co2 while the range of 14cdic is very large 1 6 to 50 pmc that of 14cdoc is restricted between 53 and 72 pmc we estimated c residence times in the volcanic arc based on corrected 14cdoc are 3 200 years compared to 14cdic estimates that range from 2 000 to 15 000 years while uncertainties in the estimate due to sources and sinks of doc within the different aquifers exist the range in age is somewhat restricted despite the large distances that separate different sampling points and the different types of aquifers sampled this leads us to conclude that wetter climate conditions in the past increased recharge and storage of the aquifers and doc inputs to recharging water was enhanced by more widespread plant growth during those past wet climates keywords central andes dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon Œ¥13c and 14c recharge arid region 1 introduction the concentration of 14c in groundwater samples collected from springs and wells is in most cases the result of a mixture of waters with a wide range of residence times in the ground the fraction of 14c in dissolved inorganic carbon dic is an established method for estimating groundwater residence time through model applications from a single sample ingerson and pearson 1964 mook 1972 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 eichinger 1983 in the most idealized case 14c active co2 derived from microbial respiration in soil dissolves into the water entering the groundwater system ensuing decay yields information about the amount of time the water has been isolated from further 14c inputs from the atmosphere however additional dic sources carbon sinks mixing and exchange processes complicate the interpretation of groundwater 14cdic in non dispersive and no mixing conditions for a confined aquifer in which recharge only occurs in a localized area the piston flow model with similar flow paths is fair this model is considered when radiocarbon age is equated to transit times of groundwater however piston flow does not represent the real behavior of groundwater in many circumstances like distributed recharge over a large area sophisticated isotopic mass balance models which aim to quantify the effects of these reactions on 14cdic do so with varying degrees of accuracy wigley et al 1978 parkhurst and appelo 1999 plummer and glynn 2013 han et al 2012 han and plummer 2013 2016 these models specifically address carbon sources within the aquifer such as the addition of geogenic 14c depleted dic from carbonate minerals volcanic and metamorphic co2 plus release and oxidation of c from ancient sedimentary organic material however keller and bacon 1998 found that the oxidation of ancient organic matter within the recharge area s unsaturated zone could contribute more 14c depleted co2 than modern 14c active co2 sources in arid environments isotope mass balance models are further challenged by hydrological responses to infrequent recharge events mixing between water of very different ages and carbonate precipitation dissolution cycles at a fluctuating water table that accelerate isotopic exchange and introduce 14c depleted dic to infiltrating water walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 han and plummer 2016 meredith et al 2016 this complexity increases in arid areas where diffuse recharge can be almost nil except after occasional heavy rain storms that occur with a frequency of decades to centuries custodio et al 2018 consequently the success of these models in accurately executing the necessary corrections depends heavily upon the availability of chemical and isotopic data and a thorough understanding of the physical groundwater system and processes in the recharge zone as a complementary and independent method 14c of dissolved organic carbon doc was proposed as a dating tool three decades ago while early studies indicated that there was promise in this technique wassenaar et al 1991 aravena and wassenaar 1993 geyer et al 1993 it has never been widely used inevitably it was found that 14cdoc was not without its own issues due to sources of 14c depleted doc sinks of doc and processes affecting doc in the recharge zone whereas 14cdic migrating from the recharge zone could possess 14c greater than 100 pmc the time taken for organic c with contemporary 14c content to leach from organic matter as doc and enter the groundwater system often means that the initial concentration of 14cdoc is lower than the atmosphere with pmc between 75 and 95 geyer et al 1993 this range of initial values determined in a humid mid latitude area depends on parameters such as soil productivity turnover rate and retention of organic c which are influenced by ph and unsaturated zone thickness wassenaar et al 1991 furthermore studies have demonstrated that refractory om can persist in soils for thousands of years riley et al 2014 including those of the recharge zone and microbes can utilize 14c depleted organic matter om to synthesize new reactive compounds including doc which are consequently also 14c depleted gleixner 2013 these compounds plus microbial activity near the water table introduce small amounts of 14c depleted doc into groundwater wood et al 2014 in semi arid to arid environments doc production coincides with infrequent rain and flood events valett et al 2005 which recur on sub decadal to millennial timescales consequently doc and dic produced by microbial activity during recharge can have 14c well below 100 pmc wood et al 2014 meredith et al 2016 other processes that can adversely affect water residence time estimates include the release of doc that is devoid of 14c from geological sedimentary organic matter gsom in aquifer matrices producing dilution effects analogous to those of dic hershey et al 2016 adsorption of doc to mineral surfaces and aggregation reduce mobility and increases its resistance to degradation processes lehmann and kleber 2015 despite these complexities 14c activities in groundwater doc remain informative about carbon residence time wassenaar et al 1991 pettersson et al 1989 murphy et al 1989 hershey et al 2016 gleixner 2013 14cdoc has not been studied in groundwater in extremely arid regions this study focuses on the groundwater system of the middle and upper section of the loa basin in northern chile on the atacama desert s eastern edge fig 1 a demand for water in this region is high due to mining an expanding population and the local needs of agriculture and ecosystems in an environment where water is such a critical commodity any knowledge about groundwater residence time is extremely important for the good management of water resources studies using 14cdic were undertaken in the past but it was recognized that the effects of magmatic co2 isotope exchange and degassing in these waters make any age estimate inaccurate fritz et al 1978 aravena and suzuki 1990 groundwater recharging on the flanks of the western cordillera of the andes flows through volcanic and alluvial aquifers volcanic rocks themselves do not contain om but fracture and connected pore surfaces host diverse microbial populations chapelle and lovely 1995 these organisms can oxidize doc to co2 in aerobic environments ferment labile doc to co2 in anaerobic environments or use co2 to form corg east of the city of calama aquifers occur in sedimentary rocks houston 2004 jordan et al 2015 and gsom may be leached or microbially mobilized into groundwater from these rocks the change in rock type may affect doc since water flowing through limestone and volcanic rocks rely on fractures where surface production or adsorption of doc may be limited compared to matrix flow rock type may also influence in situ doc yield for example hershey et al 2016 found that volcanic rocks yielded more doc than limestone with the expectation that 14cdoc would be influenced by different processes to 14cdic in this area we investigated groundwater 14c and Œ¥13c distributions of both doc and dic to determine the nature of the aqueous c cycle and whether doc could provide a realistic estimate of groundwater residence time 1 1 background to the study area 1 1 1 area specific factors that affect carbon in addition to soil processes in the recharge zones groundwater in the upper loa drainage system has additional inorganic carbon sources and sinks wetlands in the basin floor are places of discharge but in some cases the water table is close to the surface and vegetation so that modern c can be added to groundwater however 14c depleted c sources are more plentiful within the drainage basin there are numerous young volcanoes and geothermal centers high co2 discharge in geothermal springs suggests that 14c inactve volcanic co2 is an important component of groundwater dic tassi et al 2010 godfrey et al 2019 taussi et al 2019 in the volcanic arc carbonate occurs as cements mineral coatings and spring mounds and in the calama basin as the extensive opache and chiuchiu formations any of these will dissolve in sufficiently acidic groundwater carbon sinks occur in the form of degassing and carbonate precipitation as groundwater equilibrates near the surface and co2 degasses this complex c cycle leads to large uncertainties in determining groundwater residence times using 14cdic fritz et al 1978 some springs have very low 14cdic contents and small but measurable 3h indicating mixing between groundwater of different ages houston 2007 to identify the volcanic arc s effect on the carbon system water was collected from the pampa del tamarugal aquifer and another within the volcanic arc near the summit of volcan tuyajto tuy the pampa del tamarugal is a forearc sedimentary basin in the central depression immediately north of the loa drainage basin fig 1a the recharge for this part of the pampa del tamarugal lies within the pica gap a 100 km long segment of the volcanic arc where volcanism younger than 3 myr is largely absent w√∂rner et al 1994 tuyajto is a plio pleistocene stratovolcano located 200 km to the southwest of calama in the volcanic arc a comparison between the pampa del tamarugal and the calama basin tuyajto groundwaters allows potential volcanic effects on chemical inputs to groundwater to be identified 1 1 2 hydrogeology the principal study area covers portions of the central and upper loa basin between the city of calama the volcanically active western cordillera of the andes and the precordillera mountains in the antofagasta region of chile fig 1a and b near zero rainfall occurs in the western edge of the basin increases to 50 mm yr at 3 500 m asl above sea level and reaches 250 mm year at 4 000 m asl in the western cordillera of the andes modern recharge is thought to occur over elevations of 4 000 m houston 2009 rare localized and intense rain events over lower terrain can also contribute water to aquifers within the recharge zone and wherever groundwater reaches the surface it can acquire c with chemical and isotopic signals of plants and soil bacteria from its headwaters the r√≠o loa flows directly south gaining water through the surface and associated subsurface flow from the san pedro and turi basins fig 1b the r√≠o loa can also lose water to adjacent aquifers herrera et al 2021 shortly after the confluence with the r√≠o salado it turns west to flow through the calama basin to the city of calama here it flows through a gap in the precordillera range reaching the central depression and eventually the pacific ocean the r√≠o san pedro and r√≠o salado drain the san pedro and turi sub basins fig 1b which run roughly orthogonal to the andes and are separated from one another by pleistocene and younger volcanoes water from rain or snow melting on the altiplano and volcanoes in the upper reaches of the rivers flows over bare rock or through aquifers in fractured basaltic andesite lava dacitic and rhyodacitic ignimbrite or unconsolidated ash and volcanic debris flows streamflow increases in the upper reaches of the rivers by water draining out of these small frequently perched aquifers the springs are located in the contact between different volcanic materials e g chela che ba√±os de turi bdt or where unconsolidated material at the volcano base meets low permeability units such as paniri pan water in aquifers on the volcanoes not captured by streams either reaches the floor of the turi or san pedro basins which are partly occupied by wetlands or the calama basin evaporation from these wetlands especially during wetter climates in the past has left deposits of silt mud and carbonate sulfate evaporites houston 2007 small volumes of water may drain from these wetland systems through incised rivers or if the water table reaches above some subsurface basement sill as groundwater flows through the volcanoes to reach the floor of the adjacent basin or to enter the rivers as baseflow it acquires additional c from volcanic co2 recognized in shallow groundwater tassi et al 2010 or from ancient sedimentary units from organic matter or from carbonate in the calama basin stacked aquifers occur within palustrine lacustrine limestone and conglomerate gravels of the el loa formation houston 2007 jordan et al 2015 the upper aquifer is hosted by an upper miocene pliocene limestone unit the opache formation which is siliciclastic rich at the basin margins in contrast the lower aquifer consists of conglomerates and sandstone from different formations deposited during and after the oligocene tomlinson et al 2018 the aquifers are largely separated by a partly welded ignimbrite in the eastern part of the basin and everywhere else by the clay rich jalquinche mudstone jordan et al 2015 the flow of water is to the southwest but local complexities exist due to discontinuous strata folds or faults jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 between the r√≠o loa s confluence with the r√≠o san pedro channel and the r√≠o salado fig 1b it incises the valley floor by about 60 m and is in hydraulic contact with the lasana formation which hosts the confined aquifer here the river is an important point of recharge to this aquifer fig 1c south of the milagro fault the lower aquifer rocks are part of the calama formation and a change in the water s chemical composition is recorded herrera et al 2021 piezometric surfaces suggest that the phreatic aquifer may be recharged from a partially confined aquifer around pampa cere where the aquitard is sufficiently permeable or laterally by runoff from the precordillera jordan et al 2015 just downstream from the confluence with the r√≠o salado the upper aquifer is in hydraulic connection with the r√≠o loa and it provides additional water to the aquifer herrera et al 2021 the recharge of the calama basin aquifers by the river significantly affects the c isotope composition of the groundwater compared to the groundwater within the volcanic arc although the calama basin aquifers are more distant from the regional recharge area on the high volcanic peaks than the springs on the volcanoes themselves the fraction of 14c may be higher because they are recharged from the river where water was in contact with the atmosphere fig 1c 1 1 3 paleoclimate the paleoclimate history of the loa catchment area since the late pleistocene is defined by the central andean pluvial events cape 1 and cape 2 between 17 600 and 9 700 cal yr bp and by short duration and or weaker pluvial events recorded 5 000 to 3 500 cal yr bp 2 300 to 1 900 cal yr bp and 1 500 to 870 cal yr bp rech et al 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 the cape events caused high lake levels in small basins of the chilean altiplano most of which declined and disappeared around 8 400 years ago geyh et al 1999 and expanded wetlands and riparian habitats rech et al 2002 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 the wetlands and lakes could be a source of doc except that these systems most of which are now dry form at discharge points wetlands that formed along channel margins are now well above the present stream levels and are also dry since these wetlands are now above the water table and it rains extremely infrequently they should no longer contribute doc to groundwater or the river since the calama basin aquifers are partly recharged from the r√≠o loa jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 the 14c connection to paleoclimate through biological productivity is not as strong because 14c can be reset by modern primary productivity in the streams 2 materials and methods water samples used in this study were selected from wells in the calama basin mostly from the confined to semi confined lower aquifer fig 1b areas that might be affected by an industrial settling pond near calama were deliberately avoided samples from the upper parts of the water basin were collected at or very close to springs at the foot of paniri and chela volcanoes and close to where the r√≠o silala emerges above ground a sample was also collected on tuyajto volcano at the contact between the altered and eroded cone and lava flows about 800 m above salar tuyajto 4 040 masl two samples were collected from wells which extract water from the large phreatic aquifer in the pampa del tamarugal water samples were collected from wells using submersible pumps and from springs with peristaltic pumps except for artesian wells ca12 and ca13 teflon lined polypropylene hose was used with a submersible pump water at ca12 and ca13 was collected with silicone tubing and a peristaltic pump the teflon lined hose was used new in the field and cleaned using sample water the submersible pump was positioned in the center of the screened section of the wells which were flushed for the equivalent of three well bore volumes or a minimum of 20 minutes prior to a capsule filter being attached to the end of the hose after which water was pumped for a further 10 minutes the much shorter length of silicone tubing was flushed with sample water for at least 10 minutes with a further 10 minutes of flushing after attachment of the filter silicone tubing and capsule filters were pre cleaned in the laboratory with water from a de ionization unit fitted with a doc removal cartridge once the hose tubing and filter had been flushed with water a water sample was drawn for immediate measurements of ph electrical conductivity and temperature using hanna instruments hi 9126 with a ross electrode typical emc deviation 0 02 ph 0 4 c of temperature and a conductivity meter hanna instruments hi 9033 typical emc deviation 1 samples for later analysis were collected in the following order for 1 major cations and anions 2 dic concentration 3 Œ¥13cdic and 14cdic or 3 3 d fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy and finally 4 Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc samples used for doc analyses were also used for dic all samples collected for c analyses had the pump s flow adjusted to minimize turbulence the full suite of samples was not collected at every location but the order of sampling was maintained so that the samples most sensitive to blanks were sampled last giving the maximum flushing time of the sampling equipment the samples for major cation and anions were collected into pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and were not acidified water samples for all carbon analyses were collected in glass bottles and water was allowed to overflow minimizing headspace and ensuring it was bubble free these bottles were covered with aluminum foil before being capped the bottles used to collect samples for dic doc isotopes as well as spectroscopic characterization were first soaked in 10 hcl and then combusted at 500 c for 4 hours aluminum foil was also combusted at 500 c for 4 hours and wrapped in pre combusted foil packets the samples were kept refrigerated until they were express shipped to the laboratory 5 days in polystyrene boxes with ice packs for samples of spring water and not reported by herrera et al 2021 cation compositions were determined by a varian vista pro icp oes using external synthetic standards and a cs internal standard at rutgers university and anions by ion chromatography using a dionex system at cornell university accuracy was assessed with either certified standards of river slrs 5 and diluted seawater precision and accuracy were better than 5 dic was determined by acid titration normalized 0 1 n hcl the day of collection using samples that had been stored in glass alkalinity determined by the inflection point method using the web based usgs alkalinity calculator https or water usgs gov alk the partial pressure of co2 in equilibrium with the water was calculated using the geochemists workbench bethke 2008 the samples for dic and doc isotope analyses were sent to the ams facility at the university of arizona where they were stored in a refrigerator until processing once a sample bottle was opened it was placed under a high vacuum 10 5 torr and co2 from dic was extracted by acidification doc was then extracted from the same sample under vacuum using a wet oxidation technique leonard et al 2013 the laboratory blank for the doc method estimated from six salicylic acid procedural laboratory blanks was 1 fraction modern carbon f and the reproducibility of the method was 0 3 doc concentration was calculated from the volume of co2 liberated during the process the Œ¥13c value of each co2 gas sample derived from dic or doc was measured relative to the pee dee belemnite standard using a finnigan delta e dual inlet stable isotope mass spectrometer following measurement the gas was cryogenically recovered and converted to graphite using zinc as a reductant and iron as a catalyst burr and jull 2010 the graphite produced for each sample was pressed into an ams target holder and measured on the arizona 3 mv ams instrument national electrostatics corporation model 9sdh accelerator all sources of uncertainty including blank uncertainty and machine uncertainty were propagated into the final result burr et al 2007 dissolved organic matter dom was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy eem which displays the characteristic excitation and emission peaks of different doc functional groups the samples were sent to the university of colorado where they were analyzed for uv vis and excitation emission using a hitachi f 3010 multiwavelength fluorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon lamp following the methods described in mcknight et al 2001 3 results data for field measurement of ph chemical and isotope data are listed in table 1 and shown in the piper diagram of fig 2 groundwater ph varies between 6 6 and 8 5 and dic between 0 9 and 10 1 mmol l with the exception of tuyajto where low ph 3 results in low dic of 0 01 mmol l major ion data distinguish upland spring samples from river and groundwater most notably by their high proportion of mg and low na k sulfate accounts for more than 25 of the anions in samples from the upper reaches of the loa tuy and the pampa del tamarugal bicarbonate accounts for more than 30 of the anions at pan rsi and osp the loa river upstream of l5 at lasana and groundwater in the northeast part of the calama basin the composition of water in the pampa del tamarugal aquifer at p7 is similar to the r√≠o loa s water at p9 which is located near one of the main quebradas which brings water to the aquifer from the andes has a composition like that at chela volcano water in the north east part of the calama basin or close to faults which cross it has a lower proportion of cl than the other wells which are parallel the loa data in fig 2 but with more cl so4 and na k calculated equilibrium pco2 ranges between atmospheric levels and 10 1 1 atm table 1 high pco2 is found in the calama basin especially at ca12 but for springs in the turi and san pedro basins it is only a little lower groundwater at chela and tuyajto have pco2 slightly higher than atmosphere also true of some of the surface waters high Œ¥13cdic above 0 occurs in the r√≠o loa and r√≠o salado and many of the springs in the turi and san pedro basins chela spring and the silala stream have the lowest Œ¥13cdic values in the loa study area but they are lower in groundwater in the pampa del tamarugal groundwater samples from the calama basin have intermediate Œ¥13cdic trends between Œ¥13cdic and dic fig 3 a radiate from a point on the plot which has a high concentration of dic and high Œ¥13cdic probably above 5 which suggests that most samples have some fraction of their dic represented by this endmember 14cdic in streams varies between 11 and 57 pmc whereas groundwaters except for chela have 14cdic contents 6 pmc groundwater affected by irrigation such as the pampa del tamarugal or a spring west of calama city have higher 14cdic correlations are also found between dic and 14cdic fig 3b the end member identified by high Œ¥13cdic and a high concentration of dic has very low 14c from that endmember there are two prominent arrays towards increasing 14c defined by 1 decreasing dic and is comprised of samples of the r√≠o loa above lequena pampa del tamarugal samples and most of the volcanic springs and 2 the r√≠o loa below lequena and cupo spring where there is a slight increase in dic groundwater in the calama basin cb cluster around the common low 14c endmember the doc concentration of the water samples analyzed is 0 06 mmol l spring samples have slightly higher doc than samples collected from wells the Œ¥13cdoc compositions are between 28 and 22 and 14cdoc between 50 and 71 pmc table 1 in general calama basin groundwater has lower doc than groundwater in the arc trends between doc concentration and Œ¥13cdoc are unclear fig 4 a but can be addressed from plots that include 14cdoc fig 4b and c as doc concentrations increase the percent modern 14cdoc falls for both calama basin groundwater and groundwater draining the volcanic arc fig 4b at high doc at the y axis intercept the correlation suggests that 14cdoc would be between 20 pmc and 50 pmc indicating that doc concentrations are not simply increased by leaching c from ancient organic matter using this information and maintain this sample grouping the Œ¥13cdoc data is interpreted as two trends between low doc high Œ¥13cdoc and high doc low Œ¥13cdoc fig 4a the high Œ¥13cdoc component is similar to Œ¥13c of plant samples in the catchment areas table 3 we have not measured any material with Œ¥13cdoc consistently below 29 which leaves the low Œ¥13cdoc component unconstrained but it is likely it lower than 28 if there is only one component with low Œ¥13cdoc it is slightly 14c active fig 4c more likely it is a mixture the results of uv visible absorption spectra on three samples springs chela and paniri well tb05 fig 5 a are given in table 2 changes in doc concentration of these three samples are matched by those of absorption at 254 nm spectral slope s275 295 slope ratio s275 295 to s350 400 sr and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 the eem spectra of these three samples are shown in fig 5 b which includes a representative spectrum of colored dom cdom in natural surface water coble 2007 the two springs have a peak at in the excitation emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 300 350 nm and emission wavelength of 400 500 nm which is absent in the sample of groundwater from the calama basin emission at Œªex below 275 nm occurs at shorter wavelengths in the calama basin groundwater sample compared to the springs and its intensity of emission is 10 to 30 times lower 4 discussion 4 1 inorganic carbon in the central and upper loa catchments the highest dic concentrations occur in groundwater of the calama and turi basins closely followed by the r√≠o salado and the r√≠o loa below its intersection with a northwest extension of the san pedro linzor sp l line of volcanoes these samples generally have lower ph and higher pco2 there is no correlation with ca r2 0 003 suggesting caco3 is neither the dominant source of dic nor does it control the amount of dic present the upper range of pco2 10 1 5 in the turi basin and 10 1 1 in the calama basin is similar to that in mountain soils and arid central australia cerling and quade 1993 wood et al 2014 the Œ¥13cdic range for samples with high pco2 is restricted between 2 6 and 5 4 fig 3d a value inconsistent with an organic source carbon dioxide analyzed at nearby volcanic and hydrothermal systems has Œ¥13c between 12 1 and 4 7 tassi et al 2009 2010 2011 and open system equilibrium would imply Œ¥13cdic between 4 and 3 mook et al 1974 direct dissolution of limestone or carbonate cements is also consistent with an isotopically enriched source of c rech et al 2010 de wet et al 2015 but where limestone of the lasana and opache formations occur water is saturated with calcite and it is unlikely to dissolve table 1 several springs particularly in the turi basin which only dried up in the last few decades have carbonate rich aprons carbonate spring deposits and pavements are quite common in sections of the san pedro and turi basins and some have Œ¥13c between 5 and 9 godfrey unpubl data and we have no reason to exclude the possibility that carbonate cements equally enriched in 13c maybe present be in other parts of the drainage basin these springs are surface expressions of the co2 charged groundwater within these basins samples with lowest pco2 have a wide range in Œ¥13cdic fig 3d the low Œ¥13cdic of this range 11 9 suggests equilibrium with co2 which has an organic component but the high end 4 4 indicates a c source more enriched in 13c than the atmosphere the mantle 6 5 or co2 in hydrothermal systems of the area tassi et al 2010 since some of the highest Œ¥13cdic values occur in surface water it demonstrates that degassing and evasion of 12c enriched co2 occurs from streams fed by groundwater supersaturated in co2 as it re equilibrates with the atmosphere aravena and suzuki 1990 the river water sample with the highest pco2 was collected at taira upstream of the calama basin and closest to the sp l line of volcanos from this composition river water forms two trends to lower pco2 but with different Œ¥13c most of the river samples plot towards increasing Œ¥13cdic and consistent with rapid degassing while the other trend leads to low Œ¥13cdic and is defined by the headwaters of the r√≠o loa or stretches of the r√≠o loa where there is local agriculture and reflects c input from biological activity volcanic springs in the turi and san pedro basins generally plot near to the river waters that trended from high pco2 towards lower Œ¥13cdic indicating mixing with 12c enriched c the spring with the highest pco2 is cupo rcu and it also has very high Œ¥13cdic unlike the river where degassing lowers pco2 and increases Œ¥13c groundwater in the arc maintains high pco2 by hydrostatic pressure thus although groundwater probably degasses somewhat as pressure is relieved near the surface degassing is less likely to obscure Œ¥13cdic mixing trends with biological sources of c data from ba√±os de turi bdt does indicate some degassing occurred but that spring can only be accessed from within a manmade pool which is continuously recharged by spring inflow fig 3d the importance of 14c depleted geogenic c in the study area is clear from the number of spring samples with low 14cdic and high dic concentration fig 3b and c ba√±os de turi bdt a warm water spring in the turi basin close to l√©on volcano has the lowest 14cdic and high dic concentration possible c sources include magmatic co2 but other volcanic gases present can dissolve any carbonate cements or limestone that may underlie the volcanic arc and comprise a second possible c source for example marine carbonate in huaytiquina in argentina next to the chilean border has Œ¥13c up to 4 marquillas et al 2007 a value consistent with groundwater Œ¥13c compositions and its presence was also implied from other geochemical evidence godfrey et al 2019 the other volcanic springs within the arc have higher 14cdic than bdt table 1 consistent with mixing between deep c charged groundwater and shallower meteoric water that is influenced by biological activity tassi et al 2010 the river plots consistently to higher 14c due to biological activity and exchange with the atmosphere and this effect appears to have influenced the silala rsi groundwater in the calama basin has high dic concentrations and calculated pco2 and consistently low 14cdic it is speculated that water enters the calama basin aquifers from the r√≠o loa near the village of lasana where the lasana formation forms the river bed l6 fig 1b and c jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 the closest wells in the calama basin to this area of recharge are ua11 and ca1 in pampa cere and their chemical similarity to l6 reflects this fig 2 wells in the confined aquifer located near the loa fault ca12 and ca13 fig 1b are artesian and notably fresher than other groundwater it is possible that there is rapid flow along the fault and water rock interactions are less or possibly this water represents water within the lasana formation that bypassed the river as it flowed west the chemical composition of ca13 is more like water at cupo and ojo san pedro rcu and osp than l5 ca12 s anions are like those at paniri pan and its cations like cupo s rcu like all wells in the calama basin ca12 is saturated in dolomite but it is undersaturated with calcite table 1 but we observed calcite precipitating on the well head presumably as co2 degassed and ph increased if water reaching the calama basin aquifers is a partial mixture of water recharging the lasana formation east of the river channel flowing well ca12 suggests it is slightly calcite undersaturated dissolution of limestone accounts for the halving in 14cdic and doubling in dic concentration observed in ground water at pampa ceres relative to the river within the calama basin aquifers groundwater 14cdic and dic decrease further due to radioactive decay and carbonate precipitation herrera et al 2021 we note samples located in the northern part of the calama basin and near pleistocene holocene salt pans or do not have as low 14c as those wells located just north of the r√≠o loa these trends and values reveal that multiple sources and processes affect inorganic c in this region it is also critical to understand physical flows in order to accurately interpret the isotopic variations in terms of the concentration of dic and Œ¥13cdic the compositions of samples that represent places where c is added volcanic springs to those where c outputs dominate calama basin groundwater overlap fig 3a however despite the complexity of the inorganic c chemistry in ground and surface water it does not preclude the ability to determine groundwater residence times from 14cdic with sufficient characterization of flow and sampling density mass balance models plummer et al 1991 work satisfactorily in the calama basin once flow paths and reactions are constrained herrera et al 2021 primary recharge zones are in the most remote and difficult areas to access and the present dataset does not lend itself to models of this nature within the volcanic arc 4 2 dissolved organic carbon in the central and upper loa catchments 4 2 1 sources of dom based on spectroscopic techniques only three samples were collected and analyzed for spectroscopic characteristics of water draining two volcanoes in different parts of the arc and groundwater in the calama basin pan che and ca12 based on these data and acknowledging limitations due to sample numbers these samples exhibit the typical characteristics of groundwater which is a rapid reduction in optical density between 200 and 250 nm fig 5a and strongest emission when excitation is shorter than 350 nm fig 5b birdwell and engel 2010 low spectral slopes s275 295 and specific absorbance suva254 values are similar to published data for groundwater shen et al 2015 unremarkable doc spectral characteristics from eem spectra are recorded at chela che and paniri pan in these samples uva and uvc peaks for humic acid like dom labelled c and a respectively show doc that is derived from terrestrial plants but in stark contrast groundwater in the calama basin appears devoid of such compounds the paniri spring is accessed underground and chela at the point where water emerges at the toe of an ignimbrite so we tried to minimize the input of doc from actively growing plants at the site of discharge to the water before it was sampled and we propose that dom at those two volcanic springs retains characteristics of plant derived om where the groundwater recharged in contrast the absence of uva and uvc peaks only a very weak ex em signal at 275 300 340 characteristic of protein tyrosine like and tryptophan like peaks b and t as well as a lower value of plant derived suva254 indicates that terrestrial dom had become significantly degraded within the calama basin where it was sampled at ca12 coble 2007 shen et al 2015 microbial transformations create a continuum of change to soil dom as it is transported downwards by infiltrating groundwater large polymers are degraded and the resulting small polymers and monomers are adsorbed on to mineral surfaces which afford protection against further microbial degradation lehmann and kleber 2015 these processes continue within aquifers where adsorption becomes an increasingly important sink of dom mcdonough et al 2020 the differences in dom characteristics between the two volcanic springs and the groundwater in a sedimentary aquifer may be due to the nature of the aquifers the aquifers at chela and paniri are volcanic while the lower aquifer of the calama basin ca12 is gravel with a sand silt matrix jordan et al 2015 the greater availability of surfaces in the matrix dominated lower aquifer of the calama basin may have resulted in nearly quantitative adsorption of uv active dom compared to the volcanic fractured rock aquifers what causes this contrast is unknown the highest levels of total solar radiation occur over the desert and pre andean cordillera domeyko rather than the high volcanic peaks of the western cordillera rondanelli et al 2015 and reductions in dom molecular weight by uv radiation of surface waters have been reported in surface waters in southern australia mcdonough et al 2020 it is possible dom within the r√≠o loa was uv degraded before it recharged the calama basin aquifers or dom degraded in situ 4 2 2 Œ¥13c and 14c composition of doc compared to the other study of doc in a desert environment doc concentrations measured in this study between 14 and 50 Œºm are three to ten times lower than in the mojave jones 2002 samples with the highest doc concentration lowest 1 doc fig 4 are from the turi and san pedro basins which receive groundwater from the volcanoes and the western edge of the altiplano their Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc overlap with that of calama basin groundwater indicating similar sources of doc fig 4a and b variations in Œ¥13cdoc are caused by different c assimilation mechanisms used by plants and microbes in the recharge zone by microbial communities in aquifers and different forms of c autochthonous and allochthonous these isotopic signatures are passed on to doc our measured Œ¥13cdoc are below 22 a value characteristic of plants surveyed in quade et al 2007 where rubisco fixes c microbes such as sulfate reducers and methanogens which are only likely to be present deeper in recharge zone soils or methanotrophs in volcanic aquifers where thermogenic methane may be present produce corg and doc with lower Œ¥13c stevens and mckinley 1995 inorganic thermogenic methane is present in all geothermal sites in northern chile tassi et al 2010 2011 and available to methanotrophs utilization of these inorganic c sources can also produce a range in 14cdoc as well as Œ¥13cdoc since volcanic co2 and thermogenic ch4 are 14c depleted even though doc could have been recently formed analyses of sedimentary units like the jalquinche and opache formations also potential sources of doc are 14c depleted and have similar or lower Œ¥13c than groundwater table 3 de wet et al 2015 two clusters of data based on sample type as well as doc concentrations and Œ¥13cdoc were identified in fig 4a and both loosely show that input of doc with Œ¥13c below 28 increases doc concentrations from that which Œ¥13cdoc indicates as being derived from photosynthetic material in the recharge zone with Œ¥13c 22 quade et al 2007 this study the higher doc concentrations within the volcanic aquifers may indicate higher biological productivity in those recharge zones and aquifers or the losses of doc through adsorption are smaller than within the calama basin aquifers the Œ¥13cdoc of the c source that adds c to doc from the recharge zones is probably lower than 28 the relationship between doc concentration and 14cdoc shows that this c source also has low 14cdoc content fig 4b indicating it is derived from sedimentary rocks or microbial doc formed from geogenic 14c depleted c sources such as co2 or ch4 sources that are free of 14c and with appropriately low Œ¥13corg include the jalquinche formation doc acquired by assimilation of volcanic co2 with a Œ¥13c composition of 8 tassi et al 2010 by rubisco which has an isotopic discrimination around 22 for co2 to produce organic c with Œ¥13c of 30 or any biological utilization of geogenic ch4 studies of crater lake microbial communities on volcanoes close to the loa river basin have elucidated a diversity of metabolisms based on photosynthetic c and one c compounds like methane that reach these lakes from magmatic degassing or by anoxygenic photosynthesis plus methanogens demergasso et al 2010 a wide range in c isotope discrimination by these diverse microbial assemblages could contribute to low Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc and deserves further study the opache formation typically does not have as low Œ¥13corg and while two levels in the soil pit at site 1 does have low Œ¥13corg they may have some 14c activity this second c source likely represents more than one component the river is an important component of recharge to the aquifers in the calama basin s northeastern and eastern parts jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 we do not know the river water s doc characteristics but samples from pampa cere are the closest samples we have to water that recently entered the calama basin aquifers the Œ¥13cdoc composition of these samples is 24 8 and 24 5 similar to the range of 25 3 to 21 9 measured in andean rivers above 3 400 m in southern peru aufdenkampe et al 2007 mid to late holocene organic matter sampled from marshes south of chiuchiu and riverbank sediment east of calama have Œ¥13c of 24 0 6 and 20 2 4 0 respectively rech et al 2002 the Œ¥13c of doc which recharges the calama basin aquifers from the river is probably close to 24 while most samples in the calama basin have Œ¥13cdoc which fall in this range ca9 located furthest west has distinctly lower Œ¥13cdoc sample ca9 is downflow of an area where several salt pans are mapped tomlinson et al 2018 organic rich sediments often surround salt pans and when the water table was near the surface and they were wet could have formed organic matter with low Œ¥13cdoc from any methane produced although the jalquinche formation is another plausible source based on Œ¥13c sample ca9 s composition indicates that this source contains 14c or here a value of 30 for a geogenic source of doc is too high depending on the Œ¥13c value chosen for doc leaving the recharge zone the added c may not be free of 14c in some of the volcanic aquifers either 4 3 carbon sources and sinks and age relationships of doc and dic in an ideal situation using 14cdoc to get time information doc is only generated by plants and microbes in the recharge zone and only radioactive decay changes 14cdoc organic c production requires water and because today s vegetation in northern chile is strongly limited by available moisture it is reasonable to assume that during times of enhanced rainfall and therefore recharge there was also an expansion of vegetation the link with climate for groundwater in the calama basin aquifers is partly lost because recharge is strongly linked to the river which is always full of vegetation where it flows through narrow canyons unlike volcanic aquifers where rain expands or contracts vegetation on their slopes like inorganic c corrections have to be made to 14cdoc for organic carbon stored in the recharge zone produced earlier as well as doc leached from the aquifer or microbially formed using 14c depleted co2 or ch4 however doc in the volcanic aquifers is much more 14c active than dic fig 6 a and with no correction 14cdoc yields ages between 3 700 and 5 000 radiocarbon years compared to 6 000 to 35 000 years for 14cdic these uncorrected 14cdoc residence times provide a maximum water residence time since the water can only flow past doc sources after they were formed in a pure piston flow aquifer with no geochemical effects on radiocarbon content without mixing during sampling the residence time will vary according to the sampling point increasing its downward gradient value from the recharge zone along the flow path numerous models can be used to correct 14cdic for additions of geogenic c processes such as carbonate precipitation and mixing models such as netpath plummer et al 1991 quantify these reactions but obtaining reliable age data rests entirely on an accurate characterization of all the reactions that have occurred along all the different flow paths this typically requires a density of sampling which is usually not possible in remote areas especially when they are arid or semi arid mountainous areas where the access to groundwater is distinctly lacking the more simplistic approach using the 13c mixing model is applied here to both the dic and doc data sets we start by assuming that after c is added to groundwater in the recharge zone the largest additions of geogenic inorganic c is from volcanic co2 and carbonate and organic c is derived from a mixture of microbially formed doc from 14c depleted gases and organic c leached from the aquifer the Œ¥13c mixing model pearson 1965 provides a dilution factor q that changes 14c in addition to decay calculation of the dilution factor where q Œ¥13cmeas Œ¥13cgeog Œ¥13crechg Œ¥13cgeog requires estimates of Œ¥13c for geogenic c geog and inputs rechg plus the measured value of the sample we apply this model to dic and doc groundwater in the volcanic arc and pampa del tamarugal corrections for the 14cdoc model have Œ¥13 crechg set to 22 a value based on plant analyses table 3 and consistent with organic c sources measured in this study and also reported by quade et al 2007 for Œ¥13cgeog we use a value of 30 derived from the most depleted soil values table 3 and suggested from fig 4a though we recognize the limitations in setting this value 14c activity of doc from the recharge area is 97 pmc based on the most recent pluvial event rech et al 2002 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 we are aware that this overlooks any doc produced from vegetation that grew during earlier pluvial events or changes in soil 14c activities with depth corrections for 14cdic use a ph dependent isotope separation between co2 gas and dic its initial 14c activity is 97 pmc too for the volcanic arc springs a Œ¥13c value of soil co2 of 18 is used this value was determined empirically from the flanks of socompa a volcano located further to the south by fritz et al 1978 for Œ¥13cgeog a value of 2 was used for samples collected in the turi and san pedro basin to reflect volcanic co2 using data published for co2 at el tatio plus the isotope separation between co2 and hco3 tassi et al 2010 mook et al 1974 for three samples collected on the sp l volcanoes flanks this value of Œ¥13cgeog may be too low as negative values of dilution factor q are derived there is a greater dilution of recharging dic by geogenic c in the turi and san pedro basins than at che tuy or the pampa del tamarugal p7 and p9 unsurprising since co2 from magmatic degassing plus devolatilization of any buried limestone is known to impact groundwater here tassi et al 2010 godfrey et al 2019 taussi et al 2019 for doc the greater dilution of recharge zone doc in the turi san pedro basins could be due to more recent volcanic activity stimulating microbial activity but this requires further study the time that has elapsed since c in groundwater freely exchanged with the atmosphere in aquifers draining different parts of the arc based on doc measurements are generally similar despite their varying sizes a negative residence was calculated for pan although its 14c content was similar to other samples this could be due to the choice for the endmember Œ¥13c values or some modern c mixing in at the sampling site if there is an equal amount of organic c produced during the later holocene pluvial events tully et al 2019 and during the earlier cape events with a 14c content of 50 pmc which leaches into pan groundwater possibly near to the point of spring discharge a c residence time of 2 320 years is calculated in groundwater discharging at springs 14c reflects c residence time and depends on when recharge occurred and their size for aquifers that recharge continuously c residence time is proportionate to the distance between sites of recharge and discharge but if recharge is episodic on time scales that are similar to or exceed travel time it will reflect when recharge occurred between these two end member scenarios is a continuum of recharge history and travel time which may be further complicated by mixing between recently recharged water and much older groundwater while some recharge occurs today at high elevation the similar c residence times we find from 14cdoc suggest much of the water that currently discharges at springs was recharged during or since late holocene pluvial times dic residence times are typically longer and for pan it is similar to the first of the cape events quade et al 2008 this and negative q values suggest that at least for the turi and san pedro basins isotopic variations in the dic system remain insufficiently constrained probably due to co2 degassing the calama basin for the calama basin aquifers assigning values for recharge geogenic inputs is problematic the calama basin aquifers are partly recharged from the river but we do not know the mixing volumes of water recharging from the r√≠o loa channel and water which remained below the surface within the lasana formation furthermore we cannot constrain the composition of the groundwater in the lasana formation east of the r√≠o loa because here there are no springs or wells a problem that can be commonplace in other areas however to the west and north of the r√≠o loa in this aquifer there are a significant number of well built boreholes that make it possible to obtain representative samples of the isotopic composition of the water along the flow path in the aquifer within channel vegetation imply that rivers have higher concentrations of doc than groundwater assuming the r√≠o loa is similar to those on the altiplano in peru aufdenkampe et al 2007 as a first approach we use values for the 14cdoc correction model based on river deposits Œ¥13crechg of 24 for the river input to the calama basin is based on a Œ¥13corg average of 23 9 from the chiuchiu marshes rech et al 2002 and bank deposits reported by rech et al 2003 14c activity of doc infiltrating through from the river is 97 pmc based on the youngest organic c ages in the chiuchiu marshes rech et al 2002 for Œ¥13cgeog we use a value of 30 assigning values for dic s recharge 14c or Œ¥13c is difficult due to the intense degassing that the river exhibits a problem doc does not share while the section of the river that recharges these aquifers has a 14c content of 31 pmc and Œ¥13c of 0 7 l6 the river undergoes intense degassing while the component of water that enters the aquifers through the lasana formation has not furthermore only two of the wells have Œ¥13cdic values between 0 7 the river and 3 3 the opache limestone so most wells have no solution to the Œ¥13c mixing model if the composition of l6 is used for recharge to resolve this problem we looked at different mixing ratios of river water l6 and groundwater for the groundwater component since degassing at springs precludes measured Œ¥13cdic we used a Œ¥13cco2 of 18 fritz et al 1978 the bicarbonate and calcite that would precipitate from water in equilibrium with this co2 would have a Œ¥13c value of 10 which is the same as the lower value rech et al 2010 measured in the yalqui formation in a location immediately south of the turi basin for 14c we use a value of 5 pmc like groundwater in the turi and san pedro basins since the percentage increase in 14c due to degassing is less than the per mil changes in Œ¥13cdic a geogenic Œ¥13c value of 3 3 is used which is the average for the opache limestone in the eastern part of the calama basin de wet et al 2015 compared to that of recharge doc is diluted by geogenic organic c by no more than 58 and usually it is only by 10 table 4 the dilution effect increases as water flows further west and is low near the loa fault ca12 because the fault may significantly impact water here dilution of dic through dissolution of limestone as water first enters the calama basin aquifer is greater but does not change as much across the basin naturally the mixing ratio of river groundwater affects the dilution factors while table 4 present the results based on equal mixing volumes increasing the fraction of groundwater to 75 reduces all values of q by 0 1 to 0 2 decreasing the fraction of groundwater to 25 increases all values of q by 0 2 to 0 3 the difference in c transit times determine by 14cdoc compare well with 14cdic fig 6b and with elapsed times calculated using netpath herrera et al 2021 not only do the absolute c transit times based on 14cdic depend upon the mixing ratio with river and groundwater the 14c content of the groundwater before it mixes with river water defined by l6 and enters the calama basin is also critical increasing the groundwater component s 14c or decreasing its mixing ratio with river water increases c transit times within the calama basin by a uniform amount the longest dic transit times are recorded by ua10 and ca12 when the same mixing ratio between river and groundwater is used throughout if the proportion of groundwater relative to river water is increased from 1 1 to 1 3 which could reflect water flowing through the fault these transit times reduce by more than 5 000 years and approach those of other samples a negative transit time for corrected 14cdoc was calculated for ca9 which plots above the mixing line although its 14c content was similar to other samples this sample s Œ¥13cdoc is lower than other samples in the calama basin and it is possible that Œ¥13cgeog for this samples should have been lower than 30 if geogenic doc were devoid of 14c its Œ¥13cgeog would need to be less than 35 an alternative explanation is doc added to the groundwater here is not devoid of 14c well ca9 is located furthest to the west in a hydrologically complicated location due to the proximity to the western fissure it is also down gradient of several desiccated salt pans which if they became wet during the past pluvial periods could be a source of geogenic doc the difference between measured 14c at ca9 and a simple two component mixing line with geogenic doc with Œ¥13c less than 30 and or containing 14c could represent several thousand years fig 4c the 2 420 year age calculated and shown in fig 6b assumes this additional source of doc has a 14c content of 50 pmc which was also applied to sample pan it is notable that this does not appear to affect dic transit time estimates for ca9 and may be related to greater retardation of doc compared to dic within the calama basin transit times based on dic and doc in the confined aquifer are similar in this case it is possible to consider the applicability of the piston flow model according to geological and hydrogeological considerations established in the conceptual model of the aquifer herrera et al 2021 in the springs case that drain the volcanic highlands c residence times based on doc can be considerably shorter than those based on dic table 4 fig 6b these short doc based residence times are not surprising given the higher permeability of younger volcanic rocks and the shorter distance between recharge zones and discharge points at springs our dates based on doc table 4 are consistent with om formation and recharge during minor pluvial events of the late holocene rech et al 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2011 tully et al 2019 in contrast 14cdic yields longer times especially for the turi san pedro basins where groundwater dic is very high fig 6b this indicates there are c sources or sinks that are under represented in the dic correction model probably reflecting in part the role of degassing 5 conclusions the r√≠o loa catchment basin close to the western slope of the andes contains groundwater which is often supersaturated with co2 initial isotopic studies indicated that the most likely sources of this co2 are from degassing of a magmatic system and devolatilization of carbonate tassi et al 2010 taussi et al 2019 our data show that volcanic co2 fluxes are elevated around the san pedro linzor and palpana azufre inacaliri volcanic chains where they also influence the river in a region where organic rich sediments are lacking in the subsurface the doc approach to constraining the age when groundwater recharge occurred is appealing compared to the dic approach it is possible to obtain good first order data uncorrected 14cdoc residence times implied from the r√≠o loa and calama basin range between 2 5 and 6 kyrs ago while dic ages can exceed 20 kyrs corrections for doc using dilution by geogenic c sources shorten these residence time estimates to the range of the last two pluvial events of the holocene while previous estimates of recharge using dic had suggested the late pleistocene fritz et al 1978 furthermore the consistencies between 14cdoc and the paleoclimate history gives us confidence 14cdoc can be a useful tool in an area where the dic system is extremely complex however like 14cdic 14cdoc would benefit with more detailed knowledge of sources and processes occurring in the recharge area aquifer and river system to improve accuracy dic corrections that are required include co2 sources from magmatic degassing volcanic carbonate devolatilization and soil processes and sinks through intense degassing and limestone precipitation c residence times remain longer for dic than for doc in the springs but c transit times across the calama basin for dic and doc are similar considerations warranting future study of groundwater 14cdoc are retention of doc in recharge zones the introduction of 14c free carbon to the doc pool through activity of microbes consuming geogenic co2 and the different characteristics of organic and inorganic carbon as it released

4783,organic and inorganic carbon reservoirs are investigated in surface and groundwater in the semi to hyper arid r√≠o loa basin in northern chile part of the study area is within the andean volcanic arc and volcanism is responsible for large inputs of 14c depleted co2 which hampers groundwater residence time estimations using dissolved inorganic carbon dic to better understand the area s carbon system we investigated 14c and Œ¥13c in dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater and surface water doc concentrations are low in all water samples analyzed 16 53 Œºm fluorescence and Œ¥13c measurements on doc indicate that dissolved organic matter dom entering groundwater has characteristics of humic compounds derived from terrestrial plants in the recharge area fluorescence is lost in groundwater in the lower part of the system due to microbial or abiotic degradation changes in 14cdoc and Œ¥13cdoc also indicate that microbial activity contributes to doc possibly from geogenic co2 while the range of 14cdic is very large 1 6 to 50 pmc that of 14cdoc is restricted between 53 and 72 pmc we estimated c residence times in the volcanic arc based on corrected 14cdoc are 3 200 years compared to 14cdic estimates that range from 2 000 to 15 000 years while uncertainties in the estimate due to sources and sinks of doc within the different aquifers exist the range in age is somewhat restricted despite the large distances that separate different sampling points and the different types of aquifers sampled this leads us to conclude that wetter climate conditions in the past increased recharge and storage of the aquifers and doc inputs to recharging water was enhanced by more widespread plant growth during those past wet climates keywords central andes dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon Œ¥13c and 14c recharge arid region 1 introduction the concentration of 14c in groundwater samples collected from springs and wells is in most cases the result of a mixture of waters with a wide range of residence times in the ground the fraction of 14c in dissolved inorganic carbon dic is an established method for estimating groundwater residence time through model applications from a single sample ingerson and pearson 1964 mook 1972 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 eichinger 1983 in the most idealized case 14c active co2 derived from microbial respiration in soil dissolves into the water entering the groundwater system ensuing decay yields information about the amount of time the water has been isolated from further 14c inputs from the atmosphere however additional dic sources carbon sinks mixing and exchange processes complicate the interpretation of groundwater 14cdic in non dispersive and no mixing conditions for a confined aquifer in which recharge only occurs in a localized area the piston flow model with similar flow paths is fair this model is considered when radiocarbon age is equated to transit times of groundwater however piston flow does not represent the real behavior of groundwater in many circumstances like distributed recharge over a large area sophisticated isotopic mass balance models which aim to quantify the effects of these reactions on 14cdic do so with varying degrees of accuracy wigley et al 1978 parkhurst and appelo 1999 plummer and glynn 2013 han et al 2012 han and plummer 2013 2016 these models specifically address carbon sources within the aquifer such as the addition of geogenic 14c depleted dic from carbonate minerals volcanic and metamorphic co2 plus release and oxidation of c from ancient sedimentary organic material however keller and bacon 1998 found that the oxidation of ancient organic matter within the recharge area s unsaturated zone could contribute more 14c depleted co2 than modern 14c active co2 sources in arid environments isotope mass balance models are further challenged by hydrological responses to infrequent recharge events mixing between water of very different ages and carbonate precipitation dissolution cycles at a fluctuating water table that accelerate isotopic exchange and introduce 14c depleted dic to infiltrating water walvoord et al 2005 wood et al 2014 han and plummer 2016 meredith et al 2016 this complexity increases in arid areas where diffuse recharge can be almost nil except after occasional heavy rain storms that occur with a frequency of decades to centuries custodio et al 2018 consequently the success of these models in accurately executing the necessary corrections depends heavily upon the availability of chemical and isotopic data and a thorough understanding of the physical groundwater system and processes in the recharge zone as a complementary and independent method 14c of dissolved organic carbon doc was proposed as a dating tool three decades ago while early studies indicated that there was promise in this technique wassenaar et al 1991 aravena and wassenaar 1993 geyer et al 1993 it has never been widely used inevitably it was found that 14cdoc was not without its own issues due to sources of 14c depleted doc sinks of doc and processes affecting doc in the recharge zone whereas 14cdic migrating from the recharge zone could possess 14c greater than 100 pmc the time taken for organic c with contemporary 14c content to leach from organic matter as doc and enter the groundwater system often means that the initial concentration of 14cdoc is lower than the atmosphere with pmc between 75 and 95 geyer et al 1993 this range of initial values determined in a humid mid latitude area depends on parameters such as soil productivity turnover rate and retention of organic c which are influenced by ph and unsaturated zone thickness wassenaar et al 1991 furthermore studies have demonstrated that refractory om can persist in soils for thousands of years riley et al 2014 including those of the recharge zone and microbes can utilize 14c depleted organic matter om to synthesize new reactive compounds including doc which are consequently also 14c depleted gleixner 2013 these compounds plus microbial activity near the water table introduce small amounts of 14c depleted doc into groundwater wood et al 2014 in semi arid to arid environments doc production coincides with infrequent rain and flood events valett et al 2005 which recur on sub decadal to millennial timescales consequently doc and dic produced by microbial activity during recharge can have 14c well below 100 pmc wood et al 2014 meredith et al 2016 other processes that can adversely affect water residence time estimates include the release of doc that is devoid of 14c from geological sedimentary organic matter gsom in aquifer matrices producing dilution effects analogous to those of dic hershey et al 2016 adsorption of doc to mineral surfaces and aggregation reduce mobility and increases its resistance to degradation processes lehmann and kleber 2015 despite these complexities 14c activities in groundwater doc remain informative about carbon residence time wassenaar et al 1991 pettersson et al 1989 murphy et al 1989 hershey et al 2016 gleixner 2013 14cdoc has not been studied in groundwater in extremely arid regions this study focuses on the groundwater system of the middle and upper section of the loa basin in northern chile on the atacama desert s eastern edge fig 1 a demand for water in this region is high due to mining an expanding population and the local needs of agriculture and ecosystems in an environment where water is such a critical commodity any knowledge about groundwater residence time is extremely important for the good management of water resources studies using 14cdic were undertaken in the past but it was recognized that the effects of magmatic co2 isotope exchange and degassing in these waters make any age estimate inaccurate fritz et al 1978 aravena and suzuki 1990 groundwater recharging on the flanks of the western cordillera of the andes flows through volcanic and alluvial aquifers volcanic rocks themselves do not contain om but fracture and connected pore surfaces host diverse microbial populations chapelle and lovely 1995 these organisms can oxidize doc to co2 in aerobic environments ferment labile doc to co2 in anaerobic environments or use co2 to form corg east of the city of calama aquifers occur in sedimentary rocks houston 2004 jordan et al 2015 and gsom may be leached or microbially mobilized into groundwater from these rocks the change in rock type may affect doc since water flowing through limestone and volcanic rocks rely on fractures where surface production or adsorption of doc may be limited compared to matrix flow rock type may also influence in situ doc yield for example hershey et al 2016 found that volcanic rocks yielded more doc than limestone with the expectation that 14cdoc would be influenced by different processes to 14cdic in this area we investigated groundwater 14c and Œ¥13c distributions of both doc and dic to determine the nature of the aqueous c cycle and whether doc could provide a realistic estimate of groundwater residence time 1 1 background to the study area 1 1 1 area specific factors that affect carbon in addition to soil processes in the recharge zones groundwater in the upper loa drainage system has additional inorganic carbon sources and sinks wetlands in the basin floor are places of discharge but in some cases the water table is close to the surface and vegetation so that modern c can be added to groundwater however 14c depleted c sources are more plentiful within the drainage basin there are numerous young volcanoes and geothermal centers high co2 discharge in geothermal springs suggests that 14c inactve volcanic co2 is an important component of groundwater dic tassi et al 2010 godfrey et al 2019 taussi et al 2019 in the volcanic arc carbonate occurs as cements mineral coatings and spring mounds and in the calama basin as the extensive opache and chiuchiu formations any of these will dissolve in sufficiently acidic groundwater carbon sinks occur in the form of degassing and carbonate precipitation as groundwater equilibrates near the surface and co2 degasses this complex c cycle leads to large uncertainties in determining groundwater residence times using 14cdic fritz et al 1978 some springs have very low 14cdic contents and small but measurable 3h indicating mixing between groundwater of different ages houston 2007 to identify the volcanic arc s effect on the carbon system water was collected from the pampa del tamarugal aquifer and another within the volcanic arc near the summit of volcan tuyajto tuy the pampa del tamarugal is a forearc sedimentary basin in the central depression immediately north of the loa drainage basin fig 1a the recharge for this part of the pampa del tamarugal lies within the pica gap a 100 km long segment of the volcanic arc where volcanism younger than 3 myr is largely absent w√∂rner et al 1994 tuyajto is a plio pleistocene stratovolcano located 200 km to the southwest of calama in the volcanic arc a comparison between the pampa del tamarugal and the calama basin tuyajto groundwaters allows potential volcanic effects on chemical inputs to groundwater to be identified 1 1 2 hydrogeology the principal study area covers portions of the central and upper loa basin between the city of calama the volcanically active western cordillera of the andes and the precordillera mountains in the antofagasta region of chile fig 1a and b near zero rainfall occurs in the western edge of the basin increases to 50 mm yr at 3 500 m asl above sea level and reaches 250 mm year at 4 000 m asl in the western cordillera of the andes modern recharge is thought to occur over elevations of 4 000 m houston 2009 rare localized and intense rain events over lower terrain can also contribute water to aquifers within the recharge zone and wherever groundwater reaches the surface it can acquire c with chemical and isotopic signals of plants and soil bacteria from its headwaters the r√≠o loa flows directly south gaining water through the surface and associated subsurface flow from the san pedro and turi basins fig 1b the r√≠o loa can also lose water to adjacent aquifers herrera et al 2021 shortly after the confluence with the r√≠o salado it turns west to flow through the calama basin to the city of calama here it flows through a gap in the precordillera range reaching the central depression and eventually the pacific ocean the r√≠o san pedro and r√≠o salado drain the san pedro and turi sub basins fig 1b which run roughly orthogonal to the andes and are separated from one another by pleistocene and younger volcanoes water from rain or snow melting on the altiplano and volcanoes in the upper reaches of the rivers flows over bare rock or through aquifers in fractured basaltic andesite lava dacitic and rhyodacitic ignimbrite or unconsolidated ash and volcanic debris flows streamflow increases in the upper reaches of the rivers by water draining out of these small frequently perched aquifers the springs are located in the contact between different volcanic materials e g chela che ba√±os de turi bdt or where unconsolidated material at the volcano base meets low permeability units such as paniri pan water in aquifers on the volcanoes not captured by streams either reaches the floor of the turi or san pedro basins which are partly occupied by wetlands or the calama basin evaporation from these wetlands especially during wetter climates in the past has left deposits of silt mud and carbonate sulfate evaporites houston 2007 small volumes of water may drain from these wetland systems through incised rivers or if the water table reaches above some subsurface basement sill as groundwater flows through the volcanoes to reach the floor of the adjacent basin or to enter the rivers as baseflow it acquires additional c from volcanic co2 recognized in shallow groundwater tassi et al 2010 or from ancient sedimentary units from organic matter or from carbonate in the calama basin stacked aquifers occur within palustrine lacustrine limestone and conglomerate gravels of the el loa formation houston 2007 jordan et al 2015 the upper aquifer is hosted by an upper miocene pliocene limestone unit the opache formation which is siliciclastic rich at the basin margins in contrast the lower aquifer consists of conglomerates and sandstone from different formations deposited during and after the oligocene tomlinson et al 2018 the aquifers are largely separated by a partly welded ignimbrite in the eastern part of the basin and everywhere else by the clay rich jalquinche mudstone jordan et al 2015 the flow of water is to the southwest but local complexities exist due to discontinuous strata folds or faults jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 between the r√≠o loa s confluence with the r√≠o san pedro channel and the r√≠o salado fig 1b it incises the valley floor by about 60 m and is in hydraulic contact with the lasana formation which hosts the confined aquifer here the river is an important point of recharge to this aquifer fig 1c south of the milagro fault the lower aquifer rocks are part of the calama formation and a change in the water s chemical composition is recorded herrera et al 2021 piezometric surfaces suggest that the phreatic aquifer may be recharged from a partially confined aquifer around pampa cere where the aquitard is sufficiently permeable or laterally by runoff from the precordillera jordan et al 2015 just downstream from the confluence with the r√≠o salado the upper aquifer is in hydraulic connection with the r√≠o loa and it provides additional water to the aquifer herrera et al 2021 the recharge of the calama basin aquifers by the river significantly affects the c isotope composition of the groundwater compared to the groundwater within the volcanic arc although the calama basin aquifers are more distant from the regional recharge area on the high volcanic peaks than the springs on the volcanoes themselves the fraction of 14c may be higher because they are recharged from the river where water was in contact with the atmosphere fig 1c 1 1 3 paleoclimate the paleoclimate history of the loa catchment area since the late pleistocene is defined by the central andean pluvial events cape 1 and cape 2 between 17 600 and 9 700 cal yr bp and by short duration and or weaker pluvial events recorded 5 000 to 3 500 cal yr bp 2 300 to 1 900 cal yr bp and 1 500 to 870 cal yr bp rech et al 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 the cape events caused high lake levels in small basins of the chilean altiplano most of which declined and disappeared around 8 400 years ago geyh et al 1999 and expanded wetlands and riparian habitats rech et al 2002 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 the wetlands and lakes could be a source of doc except that these systems most of which are now dry form at discharge points wetlands that formed along channel margins are now well above the present stream levels and are also dry since these wetlands are now above the water table and it rains extremely infrequently they should no longer contribute doc to groundwater or the river since the calama basin aquifers are partly recharged from the r√≠o loa jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 the 14c connection to paleoclimate through biological productivity is not as strong because 14c can be reset by modern primary productivity in the streams 2 materials and methods water samples used in this study were selected from wells in the calama basin mostly from the confined to semi confined lower aquifer fig 1b areas that might be affected by an industrial settling pond near calama were deliberately avoided samples from the upper parts of the water basin were collected at or very close to springs at the foot of paniri and chela volcanoes and close to where the r√≠o silala emerges above ground a sample was also collected on tuyajto volcano at the contact between the altered and eroded cone and lava flows about 800 m above salar tuyajto 4 040 masl two samples were collected from wells which extract water from the large phreatic aquifer in the pampa del tamarugal water samples were collected from wells using submersible pumps and from springs with peristaltic pumps except for artesian wells ca12 and ca13 teflon lined polypropylene hose was used with a submersible pump water at ca12 and ca13 was collected with silicone tubing and a peristaltic pump the teflon lined hose was used new in the field and cleaned using sample water the submersible pump was positioned in the center of the screened section of the wells which were flushed for the equivalent of three well bore volumes or a minimum of 20 minutes prior to a capsule filter being attached to the end of the hose after which water was pumped for a further 10 minutes the much shorter length of silicone tubing was flushed with sample water for at least 10 minutes with a further 10 minutes of flushing after attachment of the filter silicone tubing and capsule filters were pre cleaned in the laboratory with water from a de ionization unit fitted with a doc removal cartridge once the hose tubing and filter had been flushed with water a water sample was drawn for immediate measurements of ph electrical conductivity and temperature using hanna instruments hi 9126 with a ross electrode typical emc deviation 0 02 ph 0 4 c of temperature and a conductivity meter hanna instruments hi 9033 typical emc deviation 1 samples for later analysis were collected in the following order for 1 major cations and anions 2 dic concentration 3 Œ¥13cdic and 14cdic or 3 3 d fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy and finally 4 Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc samples used for doc analyses were also used for dic all samples collected for c analyses had the pump s flow adjusted to minimize turbulence the full suite of samples was not collected at every location but the order of sampling was maintained so that the samples most sensitive to blanks were sampled last giving the maximum flushing time of the sampling equipment the samples for major cation and anions were collected into pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and were not acidified water samples for all carbon analyses were collected in glass bottles and water was allowed to overflow minimizing headspace and ensuring it was bubble free these bottles were covered with aluminum foil before being capped the bottles used to collect samples for dic doc isotopes as well as spectroscopic characterization were first soaked in 10 hcl and then combusted at 500 c for 4 hours aluminum foil was also combusted at 500 c for 4 hours and wrapped in pre combusted foil packets the samples were kept refrigerated until they were express shipped to the laboratory 5 days in polystyrene boxes with ice packs for samples of spring water and not reported by herrera et al 2021 cation compositions were determined by a varian vista pro icp oes using external synthetic standards and a cs internal standard at rutgers university and anions by ion chromatography using a dionex system at cornell university accuracy was assessed with either certified standards of river slrs 5 and diluted seawater precision and accuracy were better than 5 dic was determined by acid titration normalized 0 1 n hcl the day of collection using samples that had been stored in glass alkalinity determined by the inflection point method using the web based usgs alkalinity calculator https or water usgs gov alk the partial pressure of co2 in equilibrium with the water was calculated using the geochemists workbench bethke 2008 the samples for dic and doc isotope analyses were sent to the ams facility at the university of arizona where they were stored in a refrigerator until processing once a sample bottle was opened it was placed under a high vacuum 10 5 torr and co2 from dic was extracted by acidification doc was then extracted from the same sample under vacuum using a wet oxidation technique leonard et al 2013 the laboratory blank for the doc method estimated from six salicylic acid procedural laboratory blanks was 1 fraction modern carbon f and the reproducibility of the method was 0 3 doc concentration was calculated from the volume of co2 liberated during the process the Œ¥13c value of each co2 gas sample derived from dic or doc was measured relative to the pee dee belemnite standard using a finnigan delta e dual inlet stable isotope mass spectrometer following measurement the gas was cryogenically recovered and converted to graphite using zinc as a reductant and iron as a catalyst burr and jull 2010 the graphite produced for each sample was pressed into an ams target holder and measured on the arizona 3 mv ams instrument national electrostatics corporation model 9sdh accelerator all sources of uncertainty including blank uncertainty and machine uncertainty were propagated into the final result burr et al 2007 dissolved organic matter dom was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy eem which displays the characteristic excitation and emission peaks of different doc functional groups the samples were sent to the university of colorado where they were analyzed for uv vis and excitation emission using a hitachi f 3010 multiwavelength fluorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon lamp following the methods described in mcknight et al 2001 3 results data for field measurement of ph chemical and isotope data are listed in table 1 and shown in the piper diagram of fig 2 groundwater ph varies between 6 6 and 8 5 and dic between 0 9 and 10 1 mmol l with the exception of tuyajto where low ph 3 results in low dic of 0 01 mmol l major ion data distinguish upland spring samples from river and groundwater most notably by their high proportion of mg and low na k sulfate accounts for more than 25 of the anions in samples from the upper reaches of the loa tuy and the pampa del tamarugal bicarbonate accounts for more than 30 of the anions at pan rsi and osp the loa river upstream of l5 at lasana and groundwater in the northeast part of the calama basin the composition of water in the pampa del tamarugal aquifer at p7 is similar to the r√≠o loa s water at p9 which is located near one of the main quebradas which brings water to the aquifer from the andes has a composition like that at chela volcano water in the north east part of the calama basin or close to faults which cross it has a lower proportion of cl than the other wells which are parallel the loa data in fig 2 but with more cl so4 and na k calculated equilibrium pco2 ranges between atmospheric levels and 10 1 1 atm table 1 high pco2 is found in the calama basin especially at ca12 but for springs in the turi and san pedro basins it is only a little lower groundwater at chela and tuyajto have pco2 slightly higher than atmosphere also true of some of the surface waters high Œ¥13cdic above 0 occurs in the r√≠o loa and r√≠o salado and many of the springs in the turi and san pedro basins chela spring and the silala stream have the lowest Œ¥13cdic values in the loa study area but they are lower in groundwater in the pampa del tamarugal groundwater samples from the calama basin have intermediate Œ¥13cdic trends between Œ¥13cdic and dic fig 3 a radiate from a point on the plot which has a high concentration of dic and high Œ¥13cdic probably above 5 which suggests that most samples have some fraction of their dic represented by this endmember 14cdic in streams varies between 11 and 57 pmc whereas groundwaters except for chela have 14cdic contents 6 pmc groundwater affected by irrigation such as the pampa del tamarugal or a spring west of calama city have higher 14cdic correlations are also found between dic and 14cdic fig 3b the end member identified by high Œ¥13cdic and a high concentration of dic has very low 14c from that endmember there are two prominent arrays towards increasing 14c defined by 1 decreasing dic and is comprised of samples of the r√≠o loa above lequena pampa del tamarugal samples and most of the volcanic springs and 2 the r√≠o loa below lequena and cupo spring where there is a slight increase in dic groundwater in the calama basin cb cluster around the common low 14c endmember the doc concentration of the water samples analyzed is 0 06 mmol l spring samples have slightly higher doc than samples collected from wells the Œ¥13cdoc compositions are between 28 and 22 and 14cdoc between 50 and 71 pmc table 1 in general calama basin groundwater has lower doc than groundwater in the arc trends between doc concentration and Œ¥13cdoc are unclear fig 4 a but can be addressed from plots that include 14cdoc fig 4b and c as doc concentrations increase the percent modern 14cdoc falls for both calama basin groundwater and groundwater draining the volcanic arc fig 4b at high doc at the y axis intercept the correlation suggests that 14cdoc would be between 20 pmc and 50 pmc indicating that doc concentrations are not simply increased by leaching c from ancient organic matter using this information and maintain this sample grouping the Œ¥13cdoc data is interpreted as two trends between low doc high Œ¥13cdoc and high doc low Œ¥13cdoc fig 4a the high Œ¥13cdoc component is similar to Œ¥13c of plant samples in the catchment areas table 3 we have not measured any material with Œ¥13cdoc consistently below 29 which leaves the low Œ¥13cdoc component unconstrained but it is likely it lower than 28 if there is only one component with low Œ¥13cdoc it is slightly 14c active fig 4c more likely it is a mixture the results of uv visible absorption spectra on three samples springs chela and paniri well tb05 fig 5 a are given in table 2 changes in doc concentration of these three samples are matched by those of absorption at 254 nm spectral slope s275 295 slope ratio s275 295 to s350 400 sr and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 the eem spectra of these three samples are shown in fig 5 b which includes a representative spectrum of colored dom cdom in natural surface water coble 2007 the two springs have a peak at in the excitation emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 300 350 nm and emission wavelength of 400 500 nm which is absent in the sample of groundwater from the calama basin emission at Œªex below 275 nm occurs at shorter wavelengths in the calama basin groundwater sample compared to the springs and its intensity of emission is 10 to 30 times lower 4 discussion 4 1 inorganic carbon in the central and upper loa catchments the highest dic concentrations occur in groundwater of the calama and turi basins closely followed by the r√≠o salado and the r√≠o loa below its intersection with a northwest extension of the san pedro linzor sp l line of volcanoes these samples generally have lower ph and higher pco2 there is no correlation with ca r2 0 003 suggesting caco3 is neither the dominant source of dic nor does it control the amount of dic present the upper range of pco2 10 1 5 in the turi basin and 10 1 1 in the calama basin is similar to that in mountain soils and arid central australia cerling and quade 1993 wood et al 2014 the Œ¥13cdic range for samples with high pco2 is restricted between 2 6 and 5 4 fig 3d a value inconsistent with an organic source carbon dioxide analyzed at nearby volcanic and hydrothermal systems has Œ¥13c between 12 1 and 4 7 tassi et al 2009 2010 2011 and open system equilibrium would imply Œ¥13cdic between 4 and 3 mook et al 1974 direct dissolution of limestone or carbonate cements is also consistent with an isotopically enriched source of c rech et al 2010 de wet et al 2015 but where limestone of the lasana and opache formations occur water is saturated with calcite and it is unlikely to dissolve table 1 several springs particularly in the turi basin which only dried up in the last few decades have carbonate rich aprons carbonate spring deposits and pavements are quite common in sections of the san pedro and turi basins and some have Œ¥13c between 5 and 9 godfrey unpubl data and we have no reason to exclude the possibility that carbonate cements equally enriched in 13c maybe present be in other parts of the drainage basin these springs are surface expressions of the co2 charged groundwater within these basins samples with lowest pco2 have a wide range in Œ¥13cdic fig 3d the low Œ¥13cdic of this range 11 9 suggests equilibrium with co2 which has an organic component but the high end 4 4 indicates a c source more enriched in 13c than the atmosphere the mantle 6 5 or co2 in hydrothermal systems of the area tassi et al 2010 since some of the highest Œ¥13cdic values occur in surface water it demonstrates that degassing and evasion of 12c enriched co2 occurs from streams fed by groundwater supersaturated in co2 as it re equilibrates with the atmosphere aravena and suzuki 1990 the river water sample with the highest pco2 was collected at taira upstream of the calama basin and closest to the sp l line of volcanos from this composition river water forms two trends to lower pco2 but with different Œ¥13c most of the river samples plot towards increasing Œ¥13cdic and consistent with rapid degassing while the other trend leads to low Œ¥13cdic and is defined by the headwaters of the r√≠o loa or stretches of the r√≠o loa where there is local agriculture and reflects c input from biological activity volcanic springs in the turi and san pedro basins generally plot near to the river waters that trended from high pco2 towards lower Œ¥13cdic indicating mixing with 12c enriched c the spring with the highest pco2 is cupo rcu and it also has very high Œ¥13cdic unlike the river where degassing lowers pco2 and increases Œ¥13c groundwater in the arc maintains high pco2 by hydrostatic pressure thus although groundwater probably degasses somewhat as pressure is relieved near the surface degassing is less likely to obscure Œ¥13cdic mixing trends with biological sources of c data from ba√±os de turi bdt does indicate some degassing occurred but that spring can only be accessed from within a manmade pool which is continuously recharged by spring inflow fig 3d the importance of 14c depleted geogenic c in the study area is clear from the number of spring samples with low 14cdic and high dic concentration fig 3b and c ba√±os de turi bdt a warm water spring in the turi basin close to l√©on volcano has the lowest 14cdic and high dic concentration possible c sources include magmatic co2 but other volcanic gases present can dissolve any carbonate cements or limestone that may underlie the volcanic arc and comprise a second possible c source for example marine carbonate in huaytiquina in argentina next to the chilean border has Œ¥13c up to 4 marquillas et al 2007 a value consistent with groundwater Œ¥13c compositions and its presence was also implied from other geochemical evidence godfrey et al 2019 the other volcanic springs within the arc have higher 14cdic than bdt table 1 consistent with mixing between deep c charged groundwater and shallower meteoric water that is influenced by biological activity tassi et al 2010 the river plots consistently to higher 14c due to biological activity and exchange with the atmosphere and this effect appears to have influenced the silala rsi groundwater in the calama basin has high dic concentrations and calculated pco2 and consistently low 14cdic it is speculated that water enters the calama basin aquifers from the r√≠o loa near the village of lasana where the lasana formation forms the river bed l6 fig 1b and c jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 the closest wells in the calama basin to this area of recharge are ua11 and ca1 in pampa cere and their chemical similarity to l6 reflects this fig 2 wells in the confined aquifer located near the loa fault ca12 and ca13 fig 1b are artesian and notably fresher than other groundwater it is possible that there is rapid flow along the fault and water rock interactions are less or possibly this water represents water within the lasana formation that bypassed the river as it flowed west the chemical composition of ca13 is more like water at cupo and ojo san pedro rcu and osp than l5 ca12 s anions are like those at paniri pan and its cations like cupo s rcu like all wells in the calama basin ca12 is saturated in dolomite but it is undersaturated with calcite table 1 but we observed calcite precipitating on the well head presumably as co2 degassed and ph increased if water reaching the calama basin aquifers is a partial mixture of water recharging the lasana formation east of the river channel flowing well ca12 suggests it is slightly calcite undersaturated dissolution of limestone accounts for the halving in 14cdic and doubling in dic concentration observed in ground water at pampa ceres relative to the river within the calama basin aquifers groundwater 14cdic and dic decrease further due to radioactive decay and carbonate precipitation herrera et al 2021 we note samples located in the northern part of the calama basin and near pleistocene holocene salt pans or do not have as low 14c as those wells located just north of the r√≠o loa these trends and values reveal that multiple sources and processes affect inorganic c in this region it is also critical to understand physical flows in order to accurately interpret the isotopic variations in terms of the concentration of dic and Œ¥13cdic the compositions of samples that represent places where c is added volcanic springs to those where c outputs dominate calama basin groundwater overlap fig 3a however despite the complexity of the inorganic c chemistry in ground and surface water it does not preclude the ability to determine groundwater residence times from 14cdic with sufficient characterization of flow and sampling density mass balance models plummer et al 1991 work satisfactorily in the calama basin once flow paths and reactions are constrained herrera et al 2021 primary recharge zones are in the most remote and difficult areas to access and the present dataset does not lend itself to models of this nature within the volcanic arc 4 2 dissolved organic carbon in the central and upper loa catchments 4 2 1 sources of dom based on spectroscopic techniques only three samples were collected and analyzed for spectroscopic characteristics of water draining two volcanoes in different parts of the arc and groundwater in the calama basin pan che and ca12 based on these data and acknowledging limitations due to sample numbers these samples exhibit the typical characteristics of groundwater which is a rapid reduction in optical density between 200 and 250 nm fig 5a and strongest emission when excitation is shorter than 350 nm fig 5b birdwell and engel 2010 low spectral slopes s275 295 and specific absorbance suva254 values are similar to published data for groundwater shen et al 2015 unremarkable doc spectral characteristics from eem spectra are recorded at chela che and paniri pan in these samples uva and uvc peaks for humic acid like dom labelled c and a respectively show doc that is derived from terrestrial plants but in stark contrast groundwater in the calama basin appears devoid of such compounds the paniri spring is accessed underground and chela at the point where water emerges at the toe of an ignimbrite so we tried to minimize the input of doc from actively growing plants at the site of discharge to the water before it was sampled and we propose that dom at those two volcanic springs retains characteristics of plant derived om where the groundwater recharged in contrast the absence of uva and uvc peaks only a very weak ex em signal at 275 300 340 characteristic of protein tyrosine like and tryptophan like peaks b and t as well as a lower value of plant derived suva254 indicates that terrestrial dom had become significantly degraded within the calama basin where it was sampled at ca12 coble 2007 shen et al 2015 microbial transformations create a continuum of change to soil dom as it is transported downwards by infiltrating groundwater large polymers are degraded and the resulting small polymers and monomers are adsorbed on to mineral surfaces which afford protection against further microbial degradation lehmann and kleber 2015 these processes continue within aquifers where adsorption becomes an increasingly important sink of dom mcdonough et al 2020 the differences in dom characteristics between the two volcanic springs and the groundwater in a sedimentary aquifer may be due to the nature of the aquifers the aquifers at chela and paniri are volcanic while the lower aquifer of the calama basin ca12 is gravel with a sand silt matrix jordan et al 2015 the greater availability of surfaces in the matrix dominated lower aquifer of the calama basin may have resulted in nearly quantitative adsorption of uv active dom compared to the volcanic fractured rock aquifers what causes this contrast is unknown the highest levels of total solar radiation occur over the desert and pre andean cordillera domeyko rather than the high volcanic peaks of the western cordillera rondanelli et al 2015 and reductions in dom molecular weight by uv radiation of surface waters have been reported in surface waters in southern australia mcdonough et al 2020 it is possible dom within the r√≠o loa was uv degraded before it recharged the calama basin aquifers or dom degraded in situ 4 2 2 Œ¥13c and 14c composition of doc compared to the other study of doc in a desert environment doc concentrations measured in this study between 14 and 50 Œºm are three to ten times lower than in the mojave jones 2002 samples with the highest doc concentration lowest 1 doc fig 4 are from the turi and san pedro basins which receive groundwater from the volcanoes and the western edge of the altiplano their Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc overlap with that of calama basin groundwater indicating similar sources of doc fig 4a and b variations in Œ¥13cdoc are caused by different c assimilation mechanisms used by plants and microbes in the recharge zone by microbial communities in aquifers and different forms of c autochthonous and allochthonous these isotopic signatures are passed on to doc our measured Œ¥13cdoc are below 22 a value characteristic of plants surveyed in quade et al 2007 where rubisco fixes c microbes such as sulfate reducers and methanogens which are only likely to be present deeper in recharge zone soils or methanotrophs in volcanic aquifers where thermogenic methane may be present produce corg and doc with lower Œ¥13c stevens and mckinley 1995 inorganic thermogenic methane is present in all geothermal sites in northern chile tassi et al 2010 2011 and available to methanotrophs utilization of these inorganic c sources can also produce a range in 14cdoc as well as Œ¥13cdoc since volcanic co2 and thermogenic ch4 are 14c depleted even though doc could have been recently formed analyses of sedimentary units like the jalquinche and opache formations also potential sources of doc are 14c depleted and have similar or lower Œ¥13c than groundwater table 3 de wet et al 2015 two clusters of data based on sample type as well as doc concentrations and Œ¥13cdoc were identified in fig 4a and both loosely show that input of doc with Œ¥13c below 28 increases doc concentrations from that which Œ¥13cdoc indicates as being derived from photosynthetic material in the recharge zone with Œ¥13c 22 quade et al 2007 this study the higher doc concentrations within the volcanic aquifers may indicate higher biological productivity in those recharge zones and aquifers or the losses of doc through adsorption are smaller than within the calama basin aquifers the Œ¥13cdoc of the c source that adds c to doc from the recharge zones is probably lower than 28 the relationship between doc concentration and 14cdoc shows that this c source also has low 14cdoc content fig 4b indicating it is derived from sedimentary rocks or microbial doc formed from geogenic 14c depleted c sources such as co2 or ch4 sources that are free of 14c and with appropriately low Œ¥13corg include the jalquinche formation doc acquired by assimilation of volcanic co2 with a Œ¥13c composition of 8 tassi et al 2010 by rubisco which has an isotopic discrimination around 22 for co2 to produce organic c with Œ¥13c of 30 or any biological utilization of geogenic ch4 studies of crater lake microbial communities on volcanoes close to the loa river basin have elucidated a diversity of metabolisms based on photosynthetic c and one c compounds like methane that reach these lakes from magmatic degassing or by anoxygenic photosynthesis plus methanogens demergasso et al 2010 a wide range in c isotope discrimination by these diverse microbial assemblages could contribute to low Œ¥13cdoc and 14cdoc and deserves further study the opache formation typically does not have as low Œ¥13corg and while two levels in the soil pit at site 1 does have low Œ¥13corg they may have some 14c activity this second c source likely represents more than one component the river is an important component of recharge to the aquifers in the calama basin s northeastern and eastern parts jordan et al 2015 herrera et al 2021 we do not know the river water s doc characteristics but samples from pampa cere are the closest samples we have to water that recently entered the calama basin aquifers the Œ¥13cdoc composition of these samples is 24 8 and 24 5 similar to the range of 25 3 to 21 9 measured in andean rivers above 3 400 m in southern peru aufdenkampe et al 2007 mid to late holocene organic matter sampled from marshes south of chiuchiu and riverbank sediment east of calama have Œ¥13c of 24 0 6 and 20 2 4 0 respectively rech et al 2002 the Œ¥13c of doc which recharges the calama basin aquifers from the river is probably close to 24 while most samples in the calama basin have Œ¥13cdoc which fall in this range ca9 located furthest west has distinctly lower Œ¥13cdoc sample ca9 is downflow of an area where several salt pans are mapped tomlinson et al 2018 organic rich sediments often surround salt pans and when the water table was near the surface and they were wet could have formed organic matter with low Œ¥13cdoc from any methane produced although the jalquinche formation is another plausible source based on Œ¥13c sample ca9 s composition indicates that this source contains 14c or here a value of 30 for a geogenic source of doc is too high depending on the Œ¥13c value chosen for doc leaving the recharge zone the added c may not be free of 14c in some of the volcanic aquifers either 4 3 carbon sources and sinks and age relationships of doc and dic in an ideal situation using 14cdoc to get time information doc is only generated by plants and microbes in the recharge zone and only radioactive decay changes 14cdoc organic c production requires water and because today s vegetation in northern chile is strongly limited by available moisture it is reasonable to assume that during times of enhanced rainfall and therefore recharge there was also an expansion of vegetation the link with climate for groundwater in the calama basin aquifers is partly lost because recharge is strongly linked to the river which is always full of vegetation where it flows through narrow canyons unlike volcanic aquifers where rain expands or contracts vegetation on their slopes like inorganic c corrections have to be made to 14cdoc for organic carbon stored in the recharge zone produced earlier as well as doc leached from the aquifer or microbially formed using 14c depleted co2 or ch4 however doc in the volcanic aquifers is much more 14c active than dic fig 6 a and with no correction 14cdoc yields ages between 3 700 and 5 000 radiocarbon years compared to 6 000 to 35 000 years for 14cdic these uncorrected 14cdoc residence times provide a maximum water residence time since the water can only flow past doc sources after they were formed in a pure piston flow aquifer with no geochemical effects on radiocarbon content without mixing during sampling the residence time will vary according to the sampling point increasing its downward gradient value from the recharge zone along the flow path numerous models can be used to correct 14cdic for additions of geogenic c processes such as carbonate precipitation and mixing models such as netpath plummer et al 1991 quantify these reactions but obtaining reliable age data rests entirely on an accurate characterization of all the reactions that have occurred along all the different flow paths this typically requires a density of sampling which is usually not possible in remote areas especially when they are arid or semi arid mountainous areas where the access to groundwater is distinctly lacking the more simplistic approach using the 13c mixing model is applied here to both the dic and doc data sets we start by assuming that after c is added to groundwater in the recharge zone the largest additions of geogenic inorganic c is from volcanic co2 and carbonate and organic c is derived from a mixture of microbially formed doc from 14c depleted gases and organic c leached from the aquifer the Œ¥13c mixing model pearson 1965 provides a dilution factor q that changes 14c in addition to decay calculation of the dilution factor where q Œ¥13cmeas Œ¥13cgeog Œ¥13crechg Œ¥13cgeog requires estimates of Œ¥13c for geogenic c geog and inputs rechg plus the measured value of the sample we apply this model to dic and doc groundwater in the volcanic arc and pampa del tamarugal corrections for the 14cdoc model have Œ¥13 crechg set to 22 a value based on plant analyses table 3 and consistent with organic c sources measured in this study and also reported by quade et al 2007 for Œ¥13cgeog we use a value of 30 derived from the most depleted soil values table 3 and suggested from fig 4a though we recognize the limitations in setting this value 14c activity of doc from the recharge area is 97 pmc based on the most recent pluvial event rech et al 2002 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2012 tully et al 2019 we are aware that this overlooks any doc produced from vegetation that grew during earlier pluvial events or changes in soil 14c activities with depth corrections for 14cdic use a ph dependent isotope separation between co2 gas and dic its initial 14c activity is 97 pmc too for the volcanic arc springs a Œ¥13c value of soil co2 of 18 is used this value was determined empirically from the flanks of socompa a volcano located further to the south by fritz et al 1978 for Œ¥13cgeog a value of 2 was used for samples collected in the turi and san pedro basin to reflect volcanic co2 using data published for co2 at el tatio plus the isotope separation between co2 and hco3 tassi et al 2010 mook et al 1974 for three samples collected on the sp l volcanoes flanks this value of Œ¥13cgeog may be too low as negative values of dilution factor q are derived there is a greater dilution of recharging dic by geogenic c in the turi and san pedro basins than at che tuy or the pampa del tamarugal p7 and p9 unsurprising since co2 from magmatic degassing plus devolatilization of any buried limestone is known to impact groundwater here tassi et al 2010 godfrey et al 2019 taussi et al 2019 for doc the greater dilution of recharge zone doc in the turi san pedro basins could be due to more recent volcanic activity stimulating microbial activity but this requires further study the time that has elapsed since c in groundwater freely exchanged with the atmosphere in aquifers draining different parts of the arc based on doc measurements are generally similar despite their varying sizes a negative residence was calculated for pan although its 14c content was similar to other samples this could be due to the choice for the endmember Œ¥13c values or some modern c mixing in at the sampling site if there is an equal amount of organic c produced during the later holocene pluvial events tully et al 2019 and during the earlier cape events with a 14c content of 50 pmc which leaches into pan groundwater possibly near to the point of spring discharge a c residence time of 2 320 years is calculated in groundwater discharging at springs 14c reflects c residence time and depends on when recharge occurred and their size for aquifers that recharge continuously c residence time is proportionate to the distance between sites of recharge and discharge but if recharge is episodic on time scales that are similar to or exceed travel time it will reflect when recharge occurred between these two end member scenarios is a continuum of recharge history and travel time which may be further complicated by mixing between recently recharged water and much older groundwater while some recharge occurs today at high elevation the similar c residence times we find from 14cdoc suggest much of the water that currently discharges at springs was recharged during or since late holocene pluvial times dic residence times are typically longer and for pan it is similar to the first of the cape events quade et al 2008 this and negative q values suggest that at least for the turi and san pedro basins isotopic variations in the dic system remain insufficiently constrained probably due to co2 degassing the calama basin for the calama basin aquifers assigning values for recharge geogenic inputs is problematic the calama basin aquifers are partly recharged from the river but we do not know the mixing volumes of water recharging from the r√≠o loa channel and water which remained below the surface within the lasana formation furthermore we cannot constrain the composition of the groundwater in the lasana formation east of the r√≠o loa because here there are no springs or wells a problem that can be commonplace in other areas however to the west and north of the r√≠o loa in this aquifer there are a significant number of well built boreholes that make it possible to obtain representative samples of the isotopic composition of the water along the flow path in the aquifer within channel vegetation imply that rivers have higher concentrations of doc than groundwater assuming the r√≠o loa is similar to those on the altiplano in peru aufdenkampe et al 2007 as a first approach we use values for the 14cdoc correction model based on river deposits Œ¥13crechg of 24 for the river input to the calama basin is based on a Œ¥13corg average of 23 9 from the chiuchiu marshes rech et al 2002 and bank deposits reported by rech et al 2003 14c activity of doc infiltrating through from the river is 97 pmc based on the youngest organic c ages in the chiuchiu marshes rech et al 2002 for Œ¥13cgeog we use a value of 30 assigning values for dic s recharge 14c or Œ¥13c is difficult due to the intense degassing that the river exhibits a problem doc does not share while the section of the river that recharges these aquifers has a 14c content of 31 pmc and Œ¥13c of 0 7 l6 the river undergoes intense degassing while the component of water that enters the aquifers through the lasana formation has not furthermore only two of the wells have Œ¥13cdic values between 0 7 the river and 3 3 the opache limestone so most wells have no solution to the Œ¥13c mixing model if the composition of l6 is used for recharge to resolve this problem we looked at different mixing ratios of river water l6 and groundwater for the groundwater component since degassing at springs precludes measured Œ¥13cdic we used a Œ¥13cco2 of 18 fritz et al 1978 the bicarbonate and calcite that would precipitate from water in equilibrium with this co2 would have a Œ¥13c value of 10 which is the same as the lower value rech et al 2010 measured in the yalqui formation in a location immediately south of the turi basin for 14c we use a value of 5 pmc like groundwater in the turi and san pedro basins since the percentage increase in 14c due to degassing is less than the per mil changes in Œ¥13cdic a geogenic Œ¥13c value of 3 3 is used which is the average for the opache limestone in the eastern part of the calama basin de wet et al 2015 compared to that of recharge doc is diluted by geogenic organic c by no more than 58 and usually it is only by 10 table 4 the dilution effect increases as water flows further west and is low near the loa fault ca12 because the fault may significantly impact water here dilution of dic through dissolution of limestone as water first enters the calama basin aquifer is greater but does not change as much across the basin naturally the mixing ratio of river groundwater affects the dilution factors while table 4 present the results based on equal mixing volumes increasing the fraction of groundwater to 75 reduces all values of q by 0 1 to 0 2 decreasing the fraction of groundwater to 25 increases all values of q by 0 2 to 0 3 the difference in c transit times determine by 14cdoc compare well with 14cdic fig 6b and with elapsed times calculated using netpath herrera et al 2021 not only do the absolute c transit times based on 14cdic depend upon the mixing ratio with river and groundwater the 14c content of the groundwater before it mixes with river water defined by l6 and enters the calama basin is also critical increasing the groundwater component s 14c or decreasing its mixing ratio with river water increases c transit times within the calama basin by a uniform amount the longest dic transit times are recorded by ua10 and ca12 when the same mixing ratio between river and groundwater is used throughout if the proportion of groundwater relative to river water is increased from 1 1 to 1 3 which could reflect water flowing through the fault these transit times reduce by more than 5 000 years and approach those of other samples a negative transit time for corrected 14cdoc was calculated for ca9 which plots above the mixing line although its 14c content was similar to other samples this sample s Œ¥13cdoc is lower than other samples in the calama basin and it is possible that Œ¥13cgeog for this samples should have been lower than 30 if geogenic doc were devoid of 14c its Œ¥13cgeog would need to be less than 35 an alternative explanation is doc added to the groundwater here is not devoid of 14c well ca9 is located furthest to the west in a hydrologically complicated location due to the proximity to the western fissure it is also down gradient of several desiccated salt pans which if they became wet during the past pluvial periods could be a source of geogenic doc the difference between measured 14c at ca9 and a simple two component mixing line with geogenic doc with Œ¥13c less than 30 and or containing 14c could represent several thousand years fig 4c the 2 420 year age calculated and shown in fig 6b assumes this additional source of doc has a 14c content of 50 pmc which was also applied to sample pan it is notable that this does not appear to affect dic transit time estimates for ca9 and may be related to greater retardation of doc compared to dic within the calama basin transit times based on dic and doc in the confined aquifer are similar in this case it is possible to consider the applicability of the piston flow model according to geological and hydrogeological considerations established in the conceptual model of the aquifer herrera et al 2021 in the springs case that drain the volcanic highlands c residence times based on doc can be considerably shorter than those based on dic table 4 fig 6b these short doc based residence times are not surprising given the higher permeability of younger volcanic rocks and the shorter distance between recharge zones and discharge points at springs our dates based on doc table 4 are consistent with om formation and recharge during minor pluvial events of the late holocene rech et al 2003 latorre et al 2006 gay√≥ et al 2011 tully et al 2019 in contrast 14cdic yields longer times especially for the turi san pedro basins where groundwater dic is very high fig 6b this indicates there are c sources or sinks that are under represented in the dic correction model probably reflecting in part the role of degassing 5 conclusions the r√≠o loa catchment basin close to the western slope of the andes contains groundwater which is often supersaturated with co2 initial isotopic studies indicated that the most likely sources of this co2 are from degassing of a magmatic system and devolatilization of carbonate tassi et al 2010 taussi et al 2019 our data show that volcanic co2 fluxes are elevated around the san pedro linzor and palpana azufre inacaliri volcanic chains where they also influence the river in a region where organic rich sediments are lacking in the subsurface the doc approach to constraining the age when groundwater recharge occurred is appealing compared to the dic approach it is possible to obtain good first order data uncorrected 14cdoc residence times implied from the r√≠o loa and calama basin range between 2 5 and 6 kyrs ago while dic ages can exceed 20 kyrs corrections for doc using dilution by geogenic c sources shorten these residence time estimates to the range of the last two pluvial events of the holocene while previous estimates of recharge using dic had suggested the late pleistocene fritz et al 1978 furthermore the consistencies between 14cdoc and the paleoclimate history gives us confidence 14cdoc can be a useful tool in an area where the dic system is extremely complex however like 14cdic 14cdoc would benefit with more detailed knowledge of sources and processes occurring in the recharge area aquifer and river system to improve accuracy dic corrections that are required include co2 sources from magmatic degassing volcanic carbonate devolatilization and soil processes and sinks through intense degassing and limestone precipitation c residence times remain longer for dic than for doc in the springs but c transit times across the calama basin for dic and doc are similar considerations warranting future study of groundwater 14cdoc are retention of doc in recharge zones the introduction of 14c free carbon to the doc pool through activity of microbes consuming geogenic co2 and the different characteristics of organic and inorganic carbon as it released

4784,the increasing dependency on groundwater especially in irrigated regions has highlighted the notable place of groundwater resources within the water food energy nexus wfen this role is particularly relevant in the haihe river basin of china a globally representative area that is experiencing rapid aquifer depletion the winter wheat triticum aestivum l fallow strategy may have the potential to limit withdrawal in this region based on information from multiple sources this paper proposed six kinds of fallow schemes under the same triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat

assessment tool swat model then the water balance components of the shallow aquifer and soil profile 2 m under different scenarios were analyzed to quantify the variations in hydrological processes caused by changes in cropping system and pumping intensity furthermore through 17 indices that could quantitatively describe the changes related to the wfen the effects of seasonal fallow schemes on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation grain yield reduction and energy consumption savings were evaluated based on these evaluation outcomes linear programming was used to optimize the fallow schemes at the subbasin scale as a result to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown as well as improving water and energy productivities the minimum reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 compared with the basic scenario while the summer maize yield would remain basically stable under the optimized fallow scheme pattern 66 of the well irrigated cropland should adopt the ww sm f sm system with two irrigation applications for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize additionally 24 of the well irrigated cropland should adopt the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation application for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize and the recommended fallow schemes for the other 10 of well irrigated cropland varied spatially compared to the basic scenario the optimized fallow scheme pattern could decrease shallow groundwater exploitation by 36 5 108 m3 a 1 i e to realize shallow groundwater equilibrium reduce the diesel consumption of agricultural machines and electricity consumption of pumping wells by 32 and 90 respectively and save energy costs by approximately 873 yuan ha 1 these results could provide a

unsustainable groundwater pumping signs of substantial groundwater level declines have emerged wada et al 2010 2012 d√∂ll et al 2012 de graaf et al 2019 among the aquifer depletion hotspots around the world the haihe river basin of china is a notable and typical well irrigated region that is facing a dilemma between groundwater over extraction and crop production demand ren et al 2007 feng et al 2013 sun and ren 2013 2014 dalin et al 2017 to curb and reverse the trend of overusing groundwater in this basin the chinese government has proposed many measures to limit withdrawal such as limiting irrigation frequency and changing cropping systems the people s government of hebei province 2014 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2017 the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2018 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china et al 2019 for the limited irrigation strategy zhang et al 2018 conducted detailed simulations in the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province which is the region in the basin with the most severe shallow groundwater overexploitation it is worth noting that the seasonal fallow strategy i e a kind of changing cropping system would be an alternative regulation that could be imposed to reduce groundwater use in this well irrigated plain moreover the fallow strategy may have the potential to save energy costs by decreasing the diesel consumption of agricultural machinery and the electricity consumption of pumping wells in this context quantitatively assessing the effects of different fallow schemes on the wfen will be important in terms of meeting the current groundwater management demand in this region as well as for providing a reference for similar areas worldwide in which

the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 in particular a pilot project of winter wheat triticum aestivum l fallow policy which aims to mitigate aquifer depletion has been carried out in groundwater funnel areas of the haihe plain since 2016 the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 despite some research on farmers responses ecological compensation and protective mechanisms related to this policy little is known about how the agricultural hydrological cycle may change and the extent to which shallow groundwater depletion may be reduced under fallow conditions due to the unquestionable link between quantitative prediction and scientific policy making it is important to evaluate different fallow schemes based on scenario modeling using a distributed hydrological model we noted that there is a lack of regional analysis to find alternative fallow schemes towards groundwater sustainability in this overexploited area especially with an integrated perspective of simulation and optimization in a wfen framework in this context the purpose of this study is to explore the seasonal fallow strategy as a measure to limit shallow groundwater withdrawal in a well irrigated plain of the haihe river basin of china via 1 simulating the shallow groundwater variation soil water balance and crop yield changes under the designed fallow scenarios using a distributed hydrological model 2 evaluating the effects of different fallow schemes on shallow groundwater conservation crop production and energy consumption through quantitative indices with regard to the wfen perspective and 3 optimizing the fallow scheme pattern in the study area that can simultaneously achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium minimize crop yield reduction and improve water and energy use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study area see fig 1 is consistent with that use in our previously related research zhang et al 2016 2018 and it is located at the piedmont plain of mount taihang in the haihe river basin this plain covers an area of 22 753 km2 and involves 48 counties in hebei province the cropland area accounts for approximately 80 of the total land fig 1 and a winter wheat summer maize zea mays l ww sm double cropping system is the most predominant planting pattern hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 wang 2010 the study area is an essential agricultural region of hebei province and is thus a critically important area for the regional safety of food wang 2010 national agricultural technology extension service center 2015 in recent years more than 90 of the winter wheat planting area in this region was machine harvested which represents a high level of agricultural mechanization hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 however the substantial demand for irrigation water which mainly comes from the aquifer during the winter wheat growing season has led to a rapid decline in the shallow groundwater level and has caused ecological concerns in this region collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 chen 1999 liu 2002 duan et al 2004 zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 zhang et al 2016 hence this well irrigated plain should be a representative region characterized by an intersection of water food and energy issues the climate in the study area is monsoonal semiarid and semi humid based on the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from the related weather stations see zhang et al 2016 the precipitation exceedance probability pep was calculated using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 the number of winter wheat seasons during the simulation period 1993 2012 with pep 25 wet season 25 pep 75 normal season 75 pep 95 dry season and pep 95 extremely dry season was 4 12 3 and 1 respectively the number of summer maize seasons that were wet normal dry and extremely dry was 5 9 5 and 1 respectively it should be noted that similar to our previous studies sun and ren 2013 2014 zhang et al 2016 2018 the simulated results of wet seasons were merged with those of normal seasons with regard to the statistics and analysis in this paper to maintain coherence with farmers historical irrigation schedules in the study area see hebei irrigation center experiment station 1988 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 2 2 simulation scenario settings we established and calibrated a groundwater module enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model in a previous study zhang et al 2016 this model was used to simulate agricultural hydrological processes under different scenarios in this research the simulated results were analyzed at the 22 subbasins fig 1 in two hydrological regions i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp see zhang et al 2016 to provide a convenient reference for water management the simulation period for the analysis in this study was set as 1993 2012 in order to compare its findings with our previous work zhang et al 2016 2018 as previously mentioned since 2016 the winter wheat fallow policy pilot project has been proposed by the chinese government to reduce groundwater exploitation in the haihe plain the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 specifically this pilot project refers to implementing fallow during the period of the winter wheat growing season in successive years i e replacing the conventional wheat maize double cropping with maize single cropping and conducting rain fed during the maize growing season the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 2018 the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and the ministry of finance of the people s republic of china 2019 this pilot project has already been carried out in the east central plain of hebei province i e the heilonggang region to save the overexploited deep groundwater the department of agriculture of hebei province and the department of finance of hebei province 2017 2018 it is worth mentioning that the winter wheat fallow policy will also very likely be implemented in the piedmont plain of hebei province i e the study area of this paper as the shallow aquifer in this region may be depleted within around 80 years if the pumping amounts are not limited zhang et al 2016 however unlike the heilonggang region which overexploits fossil groundwater i e groundwater in the deep aquifer the irrigation source of our study area i e groundwater in the shallow aquifer is relatively renewable chen 1999 ren et al 2007 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 in this regard the pilot project that refers to conducting winter wheat fallow in successive years i e single planting maize may be unsuitable for our study area as the trade off between water and food has not been well considered more specifically if the conventional ww sm double cropping system i e two crops annually changes to the maize monocropping system i e one crop annually the productive output of winter wheat an important grain ration in this region would be sacrificed completely considering that this scheme has already been implemented in pilot projects in the heilonggang region the local ministries would be very prudent to copy and extend the use of this approach in the piedmont plain of hebei province because the grain yield is critically crucial in china gao 2018 to this end we noted that a cropping system with three crops in two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and spring maize had been a kind of historical cropping system used in the study area before the 1990s hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences 1983 committee of agricultural division in hebei province 1985 liu and chen 2005 wang 2010 in general although spring maize has the advantage of fuller use of solar thermal resources than summer maize meng et al 2012 gao et al 2018 the evapotranspiration i e water consumption of spring maize is also more than that of summer maize collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 thus in comparison to summer maize spring maize places more pressure on groundwater pumping for irrigation demand in this well irrigated region that experiences water shortages in view of the current groundwater crisis and historical cropping system we consider that a triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and summer maize in two years ww sm f sm is likely to be a viable alternative cropping pattern for the study area compared to the scheme of conducting fallow during the winter wheat growing season year by year the ww sm f sm system i e conducting fallow during the winter wheat growing season every other year could make full use of the renewability of the shallow aquifer as well as reserve a certain amount of the winter wheat yield therefore the ww sm f sm system was set as the planting scheme for the simulation scenarios in this paper to set the irrigation scheme in different scenarios we considered the following two aspects 1 in the year that the winter wheat is planted should the irrigation scheme for this crop be the current i e historically used by farmers irrigation schedule or the limited irrigation scheme 2 as per the winter wheat fallow policy pilot project proposed by the government see above what kind of variations might appear in the hydrological cycle and crop yields if the current irrigation schedule for summer maize is changed to a rain fed scheme in this context scenarios 1 3 were designed with the irrigation schedule for summer maize remaining consistent with the current irrigation schedule for the irrigation schemes in the winter wheat growing season the following adjustments were made in scenario 1 the scheme remained consistent with the current irrigation schedule in scenario 2 the scheme was set as the limited irrigation scheme by applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages and in scenario 3 the scheme was set as the limited irrigation scheme by applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage these two limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat were cited from the results of modeling experiments that reasonably considered the trade off between shallow groundwater conservation and crop production see zhang et al 2018 and the irrigation norm for each irrigation frequency was set to 75 mm in scenarios 4 5 and 6 the irrigation schemes set for winter wheat corresponded to those in scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively while the irrigation treatments for summer maize under scenarios 4 5 and 6 were changed to a rain fed scheme here the current cropping system i e the conventional ww sm system and current irrigation schedule see sun and ren 2014 were set as the basic scenario to reproduce the farmers historical situations during the simulation period the detailed planting and irrigation schemes for each simulation scenario are shown in fig 2 2 3 evaluation index of the water food energy nexus the index based approach associated with the wfen has been proven helpful in providing quantitative assessments of the sustainability relative to irrigated agriculture moioli et al 2016 willis et al 2016 de vito et al 2017 in reference to the related studies de vito et al 2017 as well as the governance target of the comprehensive management of overexploited groundwater in the study area the people s government of hebei province 2014 the department of agriculture of hebei province and the department of finance of hebei province 2017 we adopted 17 indices see table 1 to evaluate the wfen with regard to the effects of different fallow schemes on shallow groundwater conservation crop production energy consumption and improvements in water and energy use efficiency it is worth noting that as the quantitative information for a single perspective of water food or energy will be very valuable for enhancing our understanding of resource sustainability as well as improving policy making by related ministries e g ministry of water resources ministry of agriculture and national energy administration the 13 indices related to the water perspective food perspective and energy perspective in table 1 should be broader concerning the wfen assessment in the specific contexts of this study in addition the other four indices in table 1 were designed regarding the water food perspective and energy food perspective under the concept of producing more with less which is an important guiding principle for the wfen framework hoff 2011 the specific information is as follows in terms of the water perspective the effects on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation of different fallow schemes should be the most primary concern in this well irrigated plain therefore four indices see table 1 that could be used to quantify the decrease in shallow groundwater exploitation and the decrease in shallow groundwater overexploitation were adopted to evaluate the water saving effects from the food perspective for this breadbasket in china a decline in crop yield is crucially important considering the specific contexts four indices see table 1 related to the annual average yield of winter wheat over the simulated 20 years i e halving the value of average winter wheat yield during the 10 non fallow seasons and the annual average summer maize yield over the simulated 20 years were adopted to evaluate the variations in crop production under different fallow schemes in terms of the energy perspective the energy saving effects of the fallow schemes in this study include two aspects 1 the diesel consumption of agricultural machines that could be saved during the fallow period and 2 the reduced electricity consumption of pumping wells associated with the decrease in irrigation amount and the recovery of the shallow groundwater level in this context five indices see table 1 that could be used to quantify the reduction in diesel consumption and electricity consumption as well as the cost savings related to these two aspects were adopted in the evaluation based on the information about the seeding machine harvesting machine and tilling machine that were frequently used in the study area hu personal communication 2018 and the available statistical data hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the average amounts of diesel consumption for one growing season of winter wheat and summer maize were estimated to be 150 kg ha 1 and 84 kg ha 1 respectively and the average price of diesel was estimated to be 8 9 yuan per kilogram we calculated the electricity consumption for well irrigation on the basis of the pumping amount and pump head through the conversion equation see china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 de vito et al 2017 bai personal communication 2018 listed in table 1 it should be noted that in reference to the relevant work tyson et al 2012 de vito et al 2017 we ignored the head loss in the estimation of the pump head and assumed the estimated value was the shallow groundwater table depth simulated by the swat model in this study as the head loss in the pipes existed in both the basic scenario and the fallow scenarios this approximation should be reasonable because the variation in electricity consumption between the basic scenario and fallow scenarios was the focus of our analysis the pump efficiency Œ∑ of the well irrigation system in the study area was estimated as 0 6 according to related studies china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 bai personal communication 2018 the electricity charge of the well irrigation in the study area assumed from the literature values wang et al 2005 china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 was equal to 0 6 yuan kwh 1 the wfen approach highlights the adoption of a more integrated holistic index to help manage water and energy resources in agriculture one guiding principle is the concept of more crop per drop and more crop per kilowatt payen et al 2015 de vito et al 2017 el gafy et al 2017 avell√°n et al 2018 water productivity wp is defined as the crop yield relative to the water consumption i e eta droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 van dam et al 2006 and it is an important index for quantitatively analyzing water use efficiency in this study the wps of winter wheat and summer maize were evaluated separately see table 1 similarly energy productivity ep is defined here as the crop yield annual total output of wheat and maize per unit of energy utilized including the ep of diesel consumption and the ep of electricity consumption see table 1 2 4 optimization of the fallow scheme pattern shallow groundwater is usually regarded as a renewable and recoverable resource because it can be recharged directly by sources such as precipitation surface water and irrigation maidment 1993 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 consequently achieving shallow groundwater equilibrium has been the primary governance objective in the study area chen 1999 zhang 2003 the people s government of hebei province 2014 the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and the ministry of finance of the people s republic of china 2019 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china et al 2019 additionally since this region plays an irreplaceable role in grain production in hebei province the reduction in winter wheat yield must be an important consideration during decision making in this context based on the wfen perspective and watershed management demand we aimed to work out an optimized fallow scheme pattern in the study area that could realize shallow groundwater equilibrium and improve water and energy productivities with the goal of obtaining a maximum crop yield i e minimize crop yield reduction similar to the work by zhang et al 2018 it was assumed that if the cumulative decline in the shallow groundwater table during the 20 year period was less than 1 m or if the shallow groundwater table presented a recovery trend the shallow groundwater drawdown had stopped i e shallow groundwater equilibrium was achieved the 0 1 integer linear programming ilp a classical and robust approach was applied to conduct the optimization specifically the ilp model was solved for each of the 22 subbasins in turn see fig 3 which resulted in the distribution of the recommended fallow scheme i e the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area details about the objective function and constraints of the ilp model are as follows 1 objective f u n c t i o n max z j 1 6 y ww j x

winter wheat yield during the simulation period under scenario j kg ha 1 xj is the decision variable that can only be one or zero where a value of one indicates that scenario j was selected and a value of zero indicates the opposite hj is the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenario j m a 1 wpww j wpsm j epdiesel j and epelectric j represent the average wp of winter wheat kg m 3 the average wp of summer maize kg m 3 the average ep of diesel consumption kg kg 1 and the average ep of electricity consumption kg kwh 1 under scenario j respectively and wpww b wpsm b epdiesel b and epelectric b represent the average wp of winter wheat kg m 3 the average wp of summer maize kg m 3 the average ep of diesel consumption kg kg 1 and the average ep of electricity consumption kg kwh 1 under the basic scenario respectively a detailed description and equations of these variables are listed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario analysis 3 1 1 variations in shallow aquifer storage and shallow groundwater table the simulated results showed that if the irrigation scheme for winter wheat under the ww sm f sm system was consistent with the basic scenario the average rates of shallow aquifer storage change in the study area would be 70 mm a 1 and 40 mm a 1 under scenarios 1 and 4 respectively which still indicated an overexploitation trend fig 4 to stop the decline in shallow aquifer storage in the study area on a regional level on the condition that the irrigation scheme for summer maize is kept consistent with the basic scenario the irrigation scheme for winter wheat needs to be limited to one irrigation i e applying scenario 3 on the condition of conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize the irrigation scheme for winter wheat should be limited to two irrigations i e applying scenario 5 fig 4 to reverse the depletion trend of the shallow aquifer in the study area the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation scheme for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 6 should be adopted under this scenario the regional shallow aquifer storage displayed a recovery trend with an average rate of 30 mm a 1 fig 4 at the subbasin scale we found that the spatial distribution of the variation in the shallow groundwater table under scenario 2 was very similar to the corresponding result under scenario 4 fig 5 this result implied there was a comparable effect on the mitigation of shallow groundwater drawdown under these two fallow schemes it should be noted however that the shallow groundwater table still presented a declining trend with average rates of 0 21 m a 1 and 0 28 m a 1 under scenarios 2 and 4 respectively if the irrigation amount for winter wheat was further reduced e g applying scenarios 3 and 5 the shallow groundwater table in the northern part of dxp and the southern part of zyhp would present a recovery trend while in certain areas located in the mid eastern part of the study area it would still exhibit a declining trend fig 5 this spatial difference can be explained by the lower precipitation and limited lateral recharge in the mid eastern region it is worth noting that the spatial distributions of shallow groundwater variations under scenarios 3 and 5 were also very similar fig 5 as was seen with the comparison between scenarios 2 and 4 under the scenario with the lowest irrigation amount in this study i e scenario 6 all subbasins except zy2 and zy7 presented a shallow groundwater table recovery trend with an average rate of 0 23 m a 1 fig 5 which indicated a conservation effect of raising the shallow groundwater table by approximately 5 m over a 20 year period the simulated results of the shallow groundwater table under the six fallow scenarios in this study were almost within the groundwater table fluctuation zone over the 20 year period under the basic scenario of zhang et al 2016 and the limited irrigation scenarios of zhang et al 2018 consequently it could be inferred that the impacts of adopting the calibrated parameters of zhang et al 2016 on the shallow groundwater simulations in this study should be similar to the uncertainty analysis results of zhang et al 2018 implying that the simulated shallow groundwater variations we presented above are reasonable and reliable at the spatiotemporal scale analyzed in this study 3 1 2 soil water balance in this study area analyzing the changes in the water balance of the soil profile 2 m deep under different conditions is important for understanding the interactions between hydrological processes and crop growth we found that during the fallow periods of the six simulation scenarios in this study almost all precipitation was transformed into soil surface evaporation while the percolation values were close to zero fig 6 a in other words during the fallow period of the ww sm f sm system little precipitation could be reserved in the soil reservoir and enhance groundwater recharge through percolation suggesting that the shallow groundwater conservation brought by the seasonal fallow schemes was primarily due to the decrease in irrigation pumping rather than the increase in groundwater recharge this simulated result implied that the straw mulching technique should be encouraged in the fallow period to help preserve soil moisture according to the simulated results of soil water balance during the 10 winter wheat growing seasons under the ww sm f sm system in scenarios 1 and 4 i e the irrigation scheme for winter wheat was consistent with the basic scenario the crop transpiration and change in soil water storage could be increased by 14 mm and 10 mm on average respectively compared to the results that corresponded to these 10 winter wheat growing seasons under the basic scenario in contrast the percolation would be decreased on average by 24 mm fig 6b similarly compared to the corresponding results under the ww sm system with a limited irrigation scheme for winter wheat zhang et al 2018 the variations in crop transpiration percolation and soil water storage change during the 10 winter wheat growing seasons under scenarios 2 and 5 compared to the ww sm system with two irrigations for winter wheat as well as those under scenarios 3 and 6 compared to the ww sm system with one irrigation for winter wheat presented the same trend as that described above these variations in soil water balance components indicated that under the ww sm f sm system the beneficial use of water could be increased and the nonbeneficial use of water could be reduced during the winter wheat growth period and this information should be particularly important for this basin that experiences water shortages under the scenarios in which the irrigation scheme for summer maize was consistent with the farmers historical irrigation schedule i e scenarios 1 2 and 3 the components of evapotranspiration changed little compared to the basic scenario fig 6c and d if the rain fed scheme is conducted for summer maize under the ww sm f sm system i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 the evaporation and transpiration during the summer maize growing season would decrease by an average of 17 mm and 3 mm respectively compared to the values observed in the basic scenario fig 6c and d this simulated result indicated that the evaporation of soil moisture was the main component affecting the decrease in evapotranspiration when the summer maize was rain fed under these three scenarios therefore at the regional scale implementing the rain fed scheme for summer maize under the ww sm f sm system could be beneficial for further reducing groundwater pumping and maintaining the crop transpiration amount to be similar to that under the current irrigation schedule based on fig s1 in the supplementary material we noted that the yearly changes in the soil water storage were close to zero in the six scenarios which indicated that there would be no risk of observing a drying trend in the soil profile this result implied that the seasonal fallow schemes presented in this paper could be practicable and stable in the long term i e 20 years for this study area 3 1 3 crop yield despite the losses in grain yield in the fallow period the changes in the cropping pattern from the ww sm system to the ww sm f sm system did influence the soil water balance and thus could affect the summer maize yield and the subsequent wheat yield see fig 7 the average winter wheat yield of the 10 non fallow seasons under the ww sm f sm system with the irrigation schemes that were the same as those of the current irrigation schedule i e scenarios 1 and 4 the use of two irrigations i e scenarios 2 and 5 and the use of one irrigation i e scenarios 3 and 6 was 5934 kg ha 1 5307 kg ha 1 and 4539 kg ha 1 respectively table s1 in the supplementary material these simulated results were greater than the average winter wheat yield of those 10 growing seasons under the ww sm system with the corresponding irrigation scheme by 4 8 and 11 respectively table s1 in the supplementary material this finding indicated that the fallow period of the ww sm f sm system could contribute to the winter wheat yield in the non fallow seasons especially under the scenarios that applied limited irrigation schemes for this crop in other words the increases in winter wheat yield during the non fallow seasons under the ww sm f sm system could help offset the losses associated with the fallow period to a certain extent averaged across the whole simulation period i e 20 years the annual mean of winter wheat yield under the ww sm f sm system would decrease by 47 61 relative to the values observed under the basic scenario the spatial distribution of the average winter wheat yield of the 10 non fallow seasons under the six fallow schemes are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material for reference the simulated results show that either the summer maize yield following the fallow period or following winter wheat under the six fallow scenarios changed little in comparison with the values in the basic scenario table s2 and fig s3 in the supplementary material this result indicated that through a regional lens conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize in place of the current irrigation schedule under the ww sm f sm system would not cause a large loss in the grain yield of this crop over the simulated 20 years and it could be explained by the variations in crop transpiration and soil water evaporation provided in fig 6 it should be noted however that the study area is characterized by spatiotemporally variable precipitation which could affect the summer maize yield in different years and places we found that for an extremely dry season the summer maize would be reduced by 24 37 compared to that in the basic scenario if the rain fed scheme was implemented i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 fig 7 fig s4 in the supplementary material indicated the subbasins with larger reduction in maize yield were produced by the rain fed scheme compared to the current irrigation schedule this finding agreed with the distribution of places prone to agricultural drought in the summer season as reported in wang 2010 and liu 2012 this result suggests that in these areas the rain fed scheme for summer maize should be applied prudently or management efforts should consider adding supplementary irrigation during the extremely dry season according to the weather forecast it should be noted that at present little application of rain fed schemes for summer maize has been promoted at the regional scale which is associated with farmers traditional irrigation schedule to some extent the above results quantified the effects of rain fed summer maize on groundwater conservation as well as on crop yields these findings could provide valuable reference for promoting the alternative cropping practices this study proposed 3 2 evaluated results of the water food energy nexus under the fallow schemes through a scenario to scenario comparison under the same irrigation scheme for winter wheat but different irrigation schemes for summer maize i e scenario 1 vs scenario 4 scenario 2 vs scenario 5 and scenario 3 vs scenario 6 we found that the changes in summer maize yield between the current irrigation schedule and the rain fed scheme over 20 years were only 3 4 table 2 however conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize could obviously improve the shallow groundwater conservation effects compared to the effects of maintaining the current irrigation schedule for instance the degree of reduction in shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation i e rdgwe and rdgwo could improve by 11 and 18 fig 8 respectively highlighting a significant effect on the protection of the depleted shallow aquifer in addition the degree of reduction in electricity consumption i e rdeelectric would increase by 8 if the irrigation for summer maize was canceled fig 8 overall under the ww sm f sm system applying the rain fed scheme for summer maize could have a better effect on saving groundwater and energy resources table 2 maintaining a basically stable grain yield table 2 and improving the water productivity of this crop fig s5 in the supplementary material and fig 8 in other words under the wfen evaluation framework scenario 4 should have comprehensive advantages over scenario 1 similar results would be expected between scenario 5 and scenario 2 and between scenario 6 and scenario 3 for these three preferable fallow schemes i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 the evaluated results showed that if the current irrigation schedule is applied for winter wheat i e implementing scenario 4 shallow groundwater exploitation could be reduced by approximately 55 compared to the value of the basic scenario fig 8 nevertheless as the pumping amount was still greater than the recharge all subbasins except dx1 and zy1 presented an overexploitation trend in the shallow groundwater i e the rdgwo index was less than 100 under this scenario figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material to reverse the depletion of the shallow aquifer to a recovery trend under the condition of conducting rain fed scheme for summer maize the limited irrigation scheme with only one round should be applied for winter wheat i e implementing scenario 6 according to the evaluated results of the rdgwo index shown in figs s6 and s7 of the supplementary material however under this scenario the annual average winter wheat yield over 20 years would be cut down to 2234 kg ha 1 table 2 which was only 39 of the value observed in the basic scenario indicating this approach might inflict heavy losses on grain production in the study area compared to these two scenarios the fallow scheme with two irrigations for winter wheat i e scenario 5 was a type of compromise plan that could balance the trade off between groundwater depletion and crop yield reduction under this scenario the shallow groundwater overexploitation could be reduced by an average of 103 in comparison with the basic scenario fig 8 indicating that the decline in the groundwater table would be stopped at the regional level in addition if the fallow scheme of scenario 5 was applied the reduction in winter wheat yield would be 7 lower than that under scenario 6 fig 8 and table 2 and the water productivity of winter wheat would be increased by 5 compared to that under scenario 4 fig s5 in the supplementary material and fig 8 while this scenario should be an appropriate scheme we found that a shallow groundwater equilibrium could not be achieved in each subbasin due to the variability in weather and underlying surface figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material therefore an optimized fallow scheme pattern that could stop the decline in the shallow groundwater table and improve the water and energy productivities with the goal of maximum crop yield in all subbasins is presented in the next section through the application of 17 indices that were based on modeling and calculating results the index based evaluation with regard to the wfen perspective proved to be a capable tool for comparing different fallow schemes moreover the analysis of these indices specifically focused on individual aspects of the nexus helped to better quantify the effects on groundwater conservation crop production and energy consumption thus providing also an applicable approach for assessing the sustainability associated to well irrigated agriculture several of these indices also constituted the main constraints of the integer linear programming used in the next section which integrated the simulation and optimization within the wfen framework 3 3 optimized fallow scheme pattern fig 9 shows the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area using the 0 1 ilp model previously described section 2 4 the dominant fallow scheme after optimization was the ww sm f sm system with two irrigation applications for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 5 that occupied 66 of the well irrigated cropland in the study area and related to 12 subbasins the second most prevalent scheme was the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation application for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 6 which occupied 24 of the well irrigated cropland in the study area and related to 6 subbasins it should be noted that in the zy7 subbasin the shallow groundwater table presented a declining trend with a rate of 0 08 m a 1 under scenario 6 which did not satisfy the constraints listed in the ilp model equation however it was close to the threshold value of 0 05 m a 1 and we assumed that the declining trend was stopped thus scenario 6 was determined to be the recommended scheme in this subbasin fig 9 for the other four subbasins i e dx1 dx3 dx7 and zy1 due to the relatively higher groundwater recharge in these areas the fallow schemes with higher pumping intensities e g scenarios 1 2 and 4 were selected as the optimized result to achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium fig 9 based on the simulated and calculated results by a distributed hydrological model the optimized fallow schemes for different areas presented a better alternative than applying a single policy over the whole domain which could serve as specific references for decision making by water management authorities according to the evaluated indices related to the wfen under the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area the reductions in shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation compared to the basic scenario would be 36 5 108 m3 a 1 and 18 5 108 m3 a 1 respectively the annual average winter wheat yield over 20 years would decrease by 55 in comparison with that in the basic scenario fig 9 while the water productivity of this crop could increase by an average of approximately 7 for summer maize under the optimized fallow scheme pattern a basically stable yield and a 7 increase in water productivity were realized during the 20 years at the same time the decreases in diesel consumption by agricultural machines and in electricity consumption by pumping wells would be 75 kg ha 1 and 342 kwh ha 1 respectively indicating reductions of 32 and 90 compared to the basic scenario fig 9 respectively the energy productivity of diesel consumption could be increased by 10 and the energy productivity of electricity consumption could be increased by several times under the optimized fallow scheme pattern the cost savings related to these two aspects were estimated to be approximately 873 yuan ha 1 which could help lessen the impact on farmers incomes produced by the fallow strategy these evaluated results involved an integration of simulation and optimization in a wfen framework which provides an alternative solution considering more comprehensive indicators e g groundwater sustainability food production water productivities and energy productivities for this region as well as an applicable approach for other similar areas in our previous study zhang et al 2018 an optimized irrigation schedule for winter wheat under the conventional ww sm system was explored using the 0 1 ilp model as well both this optimized irrigation schedule under the ww sm system and the optimized fallow scheme pattern under the ww sm f sm system in this study could satisfy the constraint of stopping the drawdown of shallow groundwater however we found that the minimal reductions in winter wheat yield compared to the basic scenario under the optimized results in zhang et al 2018 and the results in this paper were 2404 kg ha 1 and 3148 kg ha 1 respectively this difference indicated that the optimized fallow scheme pattern under the ww sm f sm system would result in crop loss that was 744 kg ha 1 greater than that in the optimized irrigation schedule under the ww sm system however the ww sm f sm system would have an advantage in terms of energy consumption since the cropland could be lying fallow during the winter wheat season once every two years whereas the plowings never stop under the conventional ww sm system based on the equations listed in table 1 the electricity consumption by pumping wells under these two strategies was similar while the annual diesel consumption by agricultural machines under the optimized fallow scheme pattern with the two year three crop system was 75 kg ha 1 lower than that under the optimized irrigation schedule with the one year two crop system this result was equivalent to a cost savings of 667 5 yuan ha 1 75 kg ha 1 8 9 yuan kg 1 for farmers using an estimated grain price of 2 4 yuan kg 1 for wheat hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the farmers could purchase approximately 278 kg of wheat for 667 5 yuan with good market availability nevertheless this value was less than the wheat yield gap of 744 kg per hectare that the optimized irrigation schedule superior to the optimized fallow schemes pattern this estimation implied that the eco compensation criterion of the fallow strategy should be higher than that of the limited irrigation strategy as a result farmers could expect similar benefits to offset the loss in earnings it should be mentioned that during the fallow period under the ww sm f sm system farmers would also have an opportunity to serve as migrant workers which might increase their incomes to some extent however this issue involves a more complex analysis of hydrological economics quantitative estimations are needed in further studies 3 4 limitations of this study the scenario simulations in this study should be a predictive estimation of the potential fallow strategies at the regional scale the confirmation of which is limited in reality because these planning schemes lack observed data to compare against detailed validation needs to be further performed to provide a more in depth discussion on the rationality of the simulation which should be supported by more collectible data if the related fallow schemes were implemented in the study area the error propagation associated with the transformations of spatial and temporal scale in the modeling processes were difficult to quantify the estimations calculated in this study should be applicable within the meteorological conditions of simulated 20 years uncertainties such as that under climate change scenarios is one of areas that demand further analysis we applied 17 indices to evaluate the wfen under different fallow schemes in this study specifically for the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield the simulated results of swat could be used directly however the evaluation of electricity consumption for well irrigation had to be based on a conversion equation due to the limitations of the collected data the estimation of the pump head and pump efficiency related to this equation may influence the accuracy of this variable with regards to the evaluation of diesel consumption the diversity in the types of seeding machines harvesting machines and tilling machines have not yet been considered hence one improvement would be to collect more detailed data about the pumping electricity and agricultural machine energy consumption in the study area to create improved assessments in the future 4 conclusions the fallow strategy should be an alternative plan to limit withdrawal in areas with groundwater depletion here a shallow groundwater fed plain in china was taken as a representative area to explore the effects of the fallow strategy on groundwater variation crop production and energy consumption under a simulation evaluation optimization framework several conclusions were drawn as follows the triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and summer maize in two years ww sm f sm should be a viable fallow scheme that could balance the trade off between shallow groundwater conservation and crop production in this region during the fallow period under the ww sm f sm system nearly all precipitation would transform into soil surface evaporation while very little would contribute to groundwater recharge however compared to the conventional winter wheat summer maize ww sm double cropping system the variations in soil water balance components under the ww sm f sm system could contribute to the wheat yield of the non fallow seasons which would offset the crop loss caused by the fallow period to some extent if the rain fed scheme for summer maize is conducted under this two year three crop system the average summer maize yield could be stable as that under the current irrigation schedule with the exception of the precipitation condition in extremely dry seasons to realize shallow groundwater equilibrium and improve water and energy productivities the optimized fallow scheme for 90 of the well irrigated cropland should be the ww sm f sm system with a limited irrigation scheme two irrigations or one irrigation for winter and a rain fed scheme for summer maize for the other 10 of well irrigated cropland the optimized results were spatially different under this optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area the minimal reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 relative to the basic scenario while an average of 36 5 108 m3 a 1 in shallow groundwater exploitation 18 5 108 m3 a 1 in shallow groundwater overexploitation 75 kg ha 1 in diesel consumption by agricultural machines and 342 kwh ha 1 in electricity consumption by pumping wells could be decreased simultaneously these quantitative results may serve as sound support for developing management practices to sustain groundwater resources in this well irrigated plain in addition the assessment process with regard to the wfen perspective in this study can serve as a reference for similar areas experiencing shallow groundwater

4784,the increasing dependency on groundwater especially in irrigated regions has highlighted the notable place of groundwater resources within the water food energy nexus wfen this role is particularly relevant in the haihe river basin of china a globally representative area that is experiencing rapid aquifer depletion the winter wheat triticum aestivum l fallow strategy may have the potential to limit withdrawal in this region based on information from multiple sources this paper proposed six kinds of fallow schemes under the same triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize zea mays l followed by fallow and summer maize in two years ww sm f sm but with different irrigation schemes as scenarios to conduct detailed simulation by a modified soil and water assessment tool swat model then the water balance components of the shallow aquifer and soil profile 2 m under different scenarios were analyzed to quantify the variations in hydrological processes caused by changes in cropping system and pumping intensity furthermore through 17 indices that could quantitatively describe the changes related to the wfen the effects of seasonal fallow schemes on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation grain yield reduction and energy consumption savings were evaluated based on these evaluation outcomes linear programming was used to optimize the fallow schemes at the subbasin scale as a result to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown as well as improving water and energy productivities the minimum reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 compared with the basic scenario while the summer maize yield would remain basically stable under the optimized fallow scheme pattern 66 of the well irrigated cropland should adopt the ww sm f sm system with two irrigation applications for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize additionally 24 of the well irrigated cropland should adopt the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation application for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize and the recommended fallow schemes for the other 10 of well irrigated cropland varied spatially compared to the basic scenario the optimized fallow scheme pattern could decrease shallow groundwater exploitation by 36 5 108 m3 a 1 i e to realize shallow groundwater equilibrium reduce the diesel consumption of agricultural machines and electricity consumption of pumping wells by 32 and 90 respectively and save energy costs by approximately 873 yuan ha 1 these results could provide a quantitative reference for policy making in this watershed and serve as a typical case for similar areas that wish to implement fallow strategies to achieve groundwater sustainability keywords water

2017 el gafy et al 2017 scanlon et al 2017 de vito et al 2017 avell√°n et al 2018 jalilov et al 2018 over recent decades in a considerable number of intensively irrigated regions worldwide due to unsustainable groundwater pumping signs of substantial groundwater level declines have emerged wada et al 2010 2012 d√∂ll et al 2012 de graaf et al 2019 among the aquifer depletion hotspots around the world the haihe river basin of china is a notable and typical well irrigated region that is facing a dilemma between groundwater over extraction and crop production demand ren et al 2007 feng et al 2013 sun and ren 2013 2014 dalin et al 2017 to curb and reverse the trend of overusing groundwater in this basin the chinese government has proposed many measures to limit withdrawal such as limiting irrigation frequency and changing cropping systems the people s government of hebei province 2014 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2017 the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2018 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china et al 2019 for the limited irrigation strategy zhang et al 2018 conducted detailed simulations in the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province which is the region in the basin with the most severe shallow groundwater overexploitation it is worth noting that the seasonal fallow strategy i e a kind of changing cropping system would be an alternative regulation that could be imposed to reduce groundwater use in this well irrigated plain moreover the fallow strategy may have the potential to save energy costs by decreasing the diesel consumption of agricultural machinery and the electricity consumption of pumping wells in this context quantitatively assessing the effects of different fallow schemes on the wfen will be important in terms of meeting the current groundwater management demand in this region as well as for providing a reference for similar areas worldwide in which shallow groundwater is overexploited e g the u s high plains longuevergne et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 the upper ganges and indus basins kerr 2009 rodell et al 2009 the arabian peninsula siebert et al 2010 richey et al 2015 and northern africa wang et al 2018 additionally this research should be instrumental in terms of exploring the wfen framework which has gained attention in interdisciplinary hydrology by simulating and assessing the multidimensional implications of alternative groundwater use practices the fallow strategy has been implemented in some countries and regions e g the usa eu japan and australia for many years related studies show that with effective management it could offer several benefits including reduced soil erosion improved water quality and biodiversity maintenance ribaudo et al 2001 fraser and stevens 2008 baylis et al 2008 toivonen et al 2013 yamashita 2013 since 2014 the chinese government has been working to explore scientific crop rotation and fallow systems to disincentivize the unsustainable uses of water and land resources the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2014 the people s government of hebei province 2014 the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 in particular a pilot project of winter wheat triticum aestivum l fallow policy which aims to mitigate aquifer depletion has been carried out in groundwater funnel areas of the haihe plain since 2016 the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 despite some research on farmers responses ecological compensation and protective mechanisms related to this policy little is known about how the agricultural hydrological cycle may change and the extent to which shallow groundwater depletion may be reduced under fallow conditions due to the unquestionable link between quantitative prediction and scientific policy making it is important to evaluate different fallow schemes based on scenario modeling using a distributed hydrological model we noted that there is a lack of regional analysis to find alternative fallow schemes towards groundwater sustainability in this overexploited area especially with an integrated perspective of simulation and optimization in a wfen framework in this context the purpose of this study is to explore the seasonal fallow strategy as a measure to limit shallow groundwater withdrawal in a well irrigated plain of the haihe river basin of china via 1 simulating the shallow groundwater variation soil water balance and crop yield changes under the designed fallow scenarios using a distributed hydrological model 2 evaluating the effects of different fallow schemes on shallow groundwater conservation crop production and energy consumption through quantitative indices with regard to the wfen perspective and 3 optimizing the fallow scheme pattern in the study area that can simultaneously achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium minimize crop yield reduction and improve water and energy use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study area see fig 1 is consistent with that use in our previously related research zhang et al 2016 2018 and it is located at the piedmont plain of mount taihang in the haihe river basin this plain covers an area of 22 753 km2 and involves 48 counties in hebei province the cropland area accounts for approximately 80 of the total land fig 1 and a winter wheat summer maize zea mays l ww sm double cropping system is the most predominant planting pattern hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 wang 2010 the study area is an essential agricultural region of hebei province and is thus a critically important area for the regional safety of food wang 2010 national agricultural technology extension service center 2015 in recent years more than 90 of the winter wheat planting area in this region was machine harvested which represents a high level of agricultural mechanization hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 however the substantial demand for irrigation water which mainly comes from the aquifer during the winter wheat growing season has led to a rapid decline in the shallow groundwater level and has caused ecological concerns in this region collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 chen 1999 liu 2002 duan et al 2004 zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 zhang et al 2016 hence this well irrigated plain should be a representative region characterized by an intersection of water food and energy issues the climate in the study area is monsoonal semiarid and semi humid based on the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from the related weather stations see zhang et al 2016 the precipitation exceedance probability pep was calculated using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 the number of winter wheat seasons during the simulation period 1993 2012 with pep 25 wet season 25 pep 75 normal season 75 pep 95 dry season and pep 95 extremely dry season was 4 12 3 and 1 respectively the number of summer maize seasons that were wet normal dry and extremely dry was 5 9 5 and 1 respectively it should be noted that similar to our previous studies sun and ren 2013 2014 zhang et al 2016 2018 the simulated results of wet seasons were merged with those of normal seasons with regard to the statistics and analysis in this paper to maintain coherence with farmers historical irrigation schedules in the study area see hebei irrigation center experiment station 1988 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 2 2 simulation scenario settings we established and calibrated a groundwater module enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model in a previous study zhang et al 2016 this model was used to simulate agricultural hydrological processes under different scenarios in this research the simulated results were analyzed at the 22 subbasins fig 1 in two hydrological regions i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp see zhang et al 2016 to provide a convenient reference for water management the simulation period for the analysis in this study was set as 1993 2012 in order to compare its findings with our previous work zhang et al 2016 2018 as previously mentioned since 2016 the winter wheat fallow policy pilot project has been proposed by the chinese government to reduce groundwater exploitation in the haihe plain the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 specifically this pilot project refers to implementing fallow during the period of the winter wheat growing season in successive years i e replacing the conventional wheat maize double cropping with maize single cropping and conducting rain fed during the maize growing season the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2016 2018 the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and the ministry of finance of the people s republic of china 2019 this pilot project has already been carried out in the east central plain of hebei province i e the heilonggang region to save the overexploited deep groundwater the department of agriculture of hebei province and the department of finance of hebei province 2017 2018 it is worth mentioning that the winter wheat fallow policy will also very likely be implemented in the piedmont plain of hebei province i e the study area of this paper as the shallow aquifer in this region may be depleted within around 80 years if the pumping amounts are not limited zhang et al 2016 however unlike the heilonggang region which overexploits fossil groundwater i e groundwater in the deep aquifer the irrigation source of our study area i e groundwater in the shallow aquifer is relatively renewable chen 1999 ren et al 2007 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 in this regard the pilot project that refers to conducting winter wheat fallow in successive years i e single planting maize may be unsuitable for our study area as the trade off between water and food has not been well considered more specifically if the conventional ww sm double cropping system i e two crops annually changes to the maize monocropping system i e one crop annually the productive output of winter wheat an important grain ration in this region would be sacrificed completely considering that this scheme has already been implemented in pilot projects in the heilonggang region the local ministries would be very prudent to copy and extend the use of this approach in the piedmont plain of hebei province because the grain yield is critically crucial in china gao 2018 to this end we noted that a cropping system with three crops in two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and spring maize had been a kind of historical cropping system used in the study area before the 1990s hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences 1983 committee of agricultural division in hebei province 1985 liu and chen 2005 wang 2010 in general although spring maize has the advantage of fuller use of solar thermal resources than summer maize meng et al 2012 gao et al 2018 the evapotranspiration i e water consumption of spring maize is also more than that of summer maize collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 thus in comparison to summer maize spring maize places more pressure on groundwater pumping for irrigation demand in this well irrigated region that experiences water shortages in view of the current groundwater crisis and historical cropping system we consider that a triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and summer maize in two years ww sm f sm is likely to be a viable alternative cropping pattern for the study area compared to the scheme of conducting fallow during the winter wheat growing season year by year the ww sm f sm system i e conducting fallow during the winter wheat growing season every other year could make full use of the renewability of the shallow aquifer as well as reserve a certain amount of the winter wheat yield therefore the ww sm f sm system was set as the planting scheme for the simulation scenarios in this paper to set the irrigation scheme in different scenarios we considered the following two aspects 1 in the year that the winter wheat is planted should the irrigation scheme for this crop be the current i e historically used by farmers irrigation schedule or the limited irrigation scheme 2 as per the winter wheat fallow policy pilot project proposed by the government see above what kind of variations might appear in the hydrological cycle and crop yields if the current irrigation schedule for summer maize is changed to a rain fed scheme in this context scenarios 1 3 were designed with the irrigation schedule for summer maize remaining consistent with the current irrigation schedule for the irrigation schemes in the winter wheat growing season the following adjustments were made in scenario 1 the scheme remained consistent with the current irrigation schedule in scenario 2 the scheme was set as the limited irrigation scheme by applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages and in scenario 3 the scheme was set as the limited irrigation scheme by applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage these two limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat were cited from the results of modeling experiments that reasonably considered the trade off between shallow groundwater conservation and crop production see zhang et al 2018 and the irrigation norm for each irrigation frequency was set to 75 mm in scenarios 4 5 and 6 the irrigation schemes set for winter wheat corresponded to those in scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively while the irrigation treatments for summer maize under scenarios 4 5 and 6 were changed to a rain fed scheme here the current cropping system i e the conventional ww sm system and current irrigation schedule see sun and ren 2014 were set as the basic scenario to reproduce the farmers historical situations during the simulation period the detailed planting and irrigation schemes for each simulation scenario are shown in fig 2 2 3 evaluation index of the water food energy nexus the index based approach associated with the wfen has been proven helpful in providing quantitative assessments of the sustainability relative to irrigated agriculture moioli et al 2016 willis et al 2016 de vito et al 2017 in reference to the related studies de vito et al 2017 as well as the governance target of the comprehensive management of overexploited groundwater in the study area the people s government of hebei province 2014 the department of agriculture of hebei province and the department of finance of hebei province 2017 we adopted 17 indices see table 1 to evaluate the wfen with regard to the effects of different fallow schemes on shallow groundwater conservation crop production energy consumption and improvements in water and energy use efficiency it is worth noting that as the quantitative information for a single perspective of water food or energy will be very valuable for enhancing our understanding of resource sustainability as well as improving policy making by related ministries e g ministry of water resources ministry of agriculture and national energy administration the 13 indices related to the water perspective food perspective and energy perspective in table 1 should be broader concerning the wfen assessment in the specific contexts of this study in addition the other four indices in table 1 were designed regarding the water food perspective and energy food perspective under the concept of producing more with less which is an important guiding principle for the wfen framework hoff 2011 the specific information is as follows in terms of the water perspective the effects on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation of different fallow schemes should be the most primary concern in this well irrigated plain therefore four indices see table 1 that could be used to quantify the decrease in shallow groundwater exploitation and the decrease in shallow groundwater overexploitation were adopted to evaluate the water saving effects from the food perspective for this breadbasket in china a decline in crop yield is crucially important considering the specific contexts four indices see table 1 related to the annual average yield of winter wheat over the simulated 20 years i e halving the value of average winter wheat yield during the 10 non fallow seasons and the annual average summer maize yield over the simulated 20 years were adopted to evaluate the variations in crop production under different fallow schemes in terms of the energy perspective the energy saving effects of the fallow schemes in this study include two aspects 1 the diesel consumption of agricultural machines that could be saved during the fallow period and 2 the reduced electricity consumption of pumping wells associated with the decrease in irrigation amount and the recovery of the shallow groundwater level in this context five indices see table 1 that could be used to quantify the reduction in diesel consumption and electricity consumption as well as the cost savings related to these two aspects were adopted in the evaluation based on the information about the seeding machine harvesting machine and tilling machine that were frequently used in the study area hu personal communication 2018 and the available statistical data hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the average amounts of diesel consumption for one growing season of winter wheat and summer maize were estimated to be 150 kg ha 1 and 84 kg ha 1 respectively and the average price of diesel was estimated to be 8 9 yuan per kilogram we calculated the electricity consumption for well irrigation on the basis of the pumping amount and pump head through the conversion equation see china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 de vito et al 2017 bai personal communication 2018 listed in table 1 it should be noted that in reference to the relevant work tyson et al 2012 de vito et al 2017 we ignored the head loss in the estimation of the pump head and assumed the estimated value was the shallow groundwater table depth simulated by the swat model in this study as the head loss in the pipes existed in both the basic scenario and the fallow scenarios this approximation should be reasonable because the variation in electricity consumption between the basic scenario and fallow scenarios was the focus of our analysis the pump efficiency Œ∑ of the well irrigation system in the study area was estimated as 0 6 according to related studies china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 bai personal communication 2018 the electricity charge of the well irrigation in the study area assumed from the literature values wang et al 2005 china institute of water resources and hydropower research 2015 was equal to 0 6 yuan kwh 1 the wfen approach highlights the adoption of a more integrated holistic index to help manage water and energy resources in agriculture one guiding principle is the concept of more crop per drop and more crop per kilowatt payen et al 2015 de vito et al 2017 el gafy et al 2017 avell√°n et al 2018 water productivity wp is defined as the crop yield relative to the water consumption i e eta droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 van dam et al 2006 and it is an important index for quantitatively analyzing water use efficiency in this study the wps of winter wheat and summer maize were evaluated separately see table 1 similarly energy productivity ep is defined here as the crop yield annual total output of wheat and maize per unit of energy utilized including the ep of diesel consumption and the ep of electricity consumption see table 1 2 4 optimization of the fallow scheme pattern shallow groundwater is usually regarded as a renewable and recoverable resource because it can be recharged directly by sources such as precipitation surface water and irrigation maidment 1993 china geological survey 2009 zheng 2009 consequently achieving shallow groundwater equilibrium has been the primary governance objective in the study area chen 1999 zhang 2003 the people s government of hebei province 2014 the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china and the ministry of finance of the people s republic of china 2019 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china et al 2019 additionally since this region plays an irreplaceable role in grain production in hebei province the reduction in winter wheat yield must be an important consideration during decision making in this context based on the wfen perspective and watershed management demand we aimed to work out an optimized fallow scheme pattern in the study area that could realize shallow groundwater equilibrium and improve water and energy productivities with the goal of obtaining a maximum crop yield i e minimize crop yield reduction similar to the work by zhang et al 2018 it was assumed that if the cumulative decline in the shallow groundwater table during the 20 year period was less than 1 m or if the shallow groundwater table presented a recovery trend the shallow groundwater drawdown had stopped i e shallow groundwater equilibrium was achieved the 0 1 integer linear programming ilp a classical and robust approach was applied to conduct the optimization specifically the ilp model was solved for each of the 22 subbasins in turn see fig 3 which resulted in the distribution of the recommended fallow scheme i e the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area details about the objective function and constraints of the ilp model are as follows 1 objective f u n c t i o n max z j 1 6 y ww j x

winter wheat yield during the simulation period under scenario j kg ha 1 xj is the decision variable that can only be one or zero where a value of one indicates that scenario j was selected and a value of zero indicates the opposite hj is the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenario j m a 1 wpww j wpsm j epdiesel j and epelectric j represent the average wp of winter wheat kg m 3 the average wp of summer maize kg m 3 the average ep of diesel consumption kg kg 1 and the average ep of electricity consumption kg kwh 1 under scenario j respectively and wpww b wpsm b epdiesel b and epelectric b represent the average wp of winter wheat kg m 3 the average wp of summer maize kg m 3 the average ep of diesel consumption kg kg 1 and the average ep of electricity consumption kg kwh 1 under the basic scenario respectively a detailed description and equations of these variables are listed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario analysis 3 1 1 variations in shallow aquifer storage and shallow groundwater table the simulated results showed that if the irrigation scheme for winter wheat under the ww sm f sm system was consistent with the basic scenario the average rates of shallow aquifer storage change in the study area would be 70 mm a 1 and 40 mm a 1 under scenarios 1 and 4 respectively which still indicated an overexploitation trend fig 4 to stop the decline in shallow aquifer storage in the study area on a regional level on the condition that the irrigation scheme for summer maize is kept consistent with the basic scenario the irrigation scheme for winter wheat needs to be limited to one irrigation i e applying scenario 3 on the condition of conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize the irrigation scheme for winter wheat should be limited to two irrigations i e applying scenario 5 fig 4 to reverse the depletion trend of the shallow aquifer in the study area the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation scheme for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 6 should be adopted under this scenario the regional shallow aquifer storage displayed a recovery trend with an average rate of 30 mm a 1 fig 4 at the subbasin scale we found that the spatial distribution of the variation in the shallow groundwater table under scenario 2 was very similar to the corresponding result under scenario 4 fig 5 this result implied there was a comparable effect on the mitigation of shallow groundwater drawdown under these two fallow schemes it should be noted however that the shallow groundwater table still presented a declining trend with average rates of 0 21 m a 1 and 0 28 m a 1 under scenarios 2 and 4 respectively if the irrigation amount for winter wheat was further reduced e g applying scenarios 3 and 5 the shallow groundwater table in the northern part of dxp and the southern part of zyhp would present a recovery trend while in certain areas located in the mid eastern part of the study area it would still exhibit a declining trend fig 5 this spatial difference can be explained by the lower precipitation and limited lateral recharge in the mid eastern region it is worth noting that the spatial distributions of shallow groundwater variations under scenarios 3 and 5 were also very similar fig 5 as was seen with the comparison between scenarios 2 and 4 under the scenario with the lowest irrigation amount in this study i e scenario 6 all subbasins except zy2 and zy7 presented a shallow groundwater table recovery trend with an average rate of 0 23 m a 1 fig 5 which indicated a conservation effect of raising the shallow groundwater table by approximately 5 m over a 20 year period the simulated results of the shallow groundwater table under the six fallow scenarios in this study were almost within the groundwater table fluctuation zone over the 20 year period under the basic scenario of zhang et al 2016 and the limited irrigation scenarios of zhang et al 2018 consequently it could be inferred that the impacts of adopting the calibrated parameters of zhang et al 2016 on the shallow groundwater simulations in this study should be similar to the uncertainty analysis results of zhang et al 2018 implying that the simulated shallow groundwater variations we presented above are reasonable and reliable at the spatiotemporal scale analyzed in this study 3 1 2 soil water balance in this study area analyzing the changes in the water balance of the soil profile 2 m deep under different conditions is important for understanding the interactions between hydrological processes and crop growth we found that during the fallow periods of the six simulation scenarios in this study almost all precipitation was transformed into soil surface evaporation while the percolation values were close to zero fig 6 a in other words during the fallow period of the ww sm f sm system little precipitation could be reserved in the soil reservoir and enhance groundwater recharge through percolation suggesting that the shallow groundwater conservation brought by the seasonal fallow schemes was primarily due to the decrease in irrigation pumping rather than the increase in groundwater recharge this simulated result implied that the straw mulching technique should be encouraged in the fallow period to help preserve soil moisture according to the simulated results of soil water balance during the 10 winter wheat growing seasons under the ww sm f sm system in scenarios 1 and 4 i e the irrigation scheme for winter wheat was consistent with the basic scenario the crop transpiration and change in soil water storage could be increased by 14 mm and 10 mm on average respectively compared to the results that corresponded to these 10 winter wheat growing seasons under the basic scenario in contrast the percolation would be decreased on average by 24 mm fig 6b similarly compared to the corresponding results under the ww sm system with a limited irrigation scheme for winter wheat zhang et al 2018 the variations in crop transpiration percolation and soil water storage change during the 10 winter wheat growing seasons under scenarios 2 and 5 compared to the ww sm system with two irrigations for winter wheat as well as those under scenarios 3 and 6 compared to the ww sm system with one irrigation for winter wheat presented the same trend as that described above these variations in soil water balance components indicated that under the ww sm f sm system the beneficial use of water could be increased and the nonbeneficial use of water could be reduced during the winter wheat growth period and this information should be particularly important for this basin that experiences water shortages under the scenarios in which the irrigation scheme for summer maize was consistent with the farmers historical irrigation schedule i e scenarios 1 2 and 3 the components of evapotranspiration changed little compared to the basic scenario fig 6c and d if the rain fed scheme is conducted for summer maize under the ww sm f sm system i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 the evaporation and transpiration during the summer maize growing season would decrease by an average of 17 mm and 3 mm respectively compared to the values observed in the basic scenario fig 6c and d this simulated result indicated that the evaporation of soil moisture was the main component affecting the decrease in evapotranspiration when the summer maize was rain fed under these three scenarios therefore at the regional scale implementing the rain fed scheme for summer maize under the ww sm f sm system could be beneficial for further reducing groundwater pumping and maintaining the crop transpiration amount to be similar to that under the current irrigation schedule based on fig s1 in the supplementary material we noted that the yearly changes in the soil water storage were close to zero in the six scenarios which indicated that there would be no risk of observing a drying trend in the soil profile this result implied that the seasonal fallow schemes presented in this paper could be practicable and stable in the long term i e 20 years for this study area 3 1 3 crop yield despite the losses in grain yield in the fallow period the changes in the cropping pattern from the ww sm system to the ww sm f sm system did influence the soil water balance and thus could affect the summer maize yield and the subsequent wheat yield see fig 7 the average winter wheat yield of the 10 non fallow seasons under the ww sm f sm system with the irrigation schemes that were the same as those of the current irrigation schedule i e scenarios 1 and 4 the use of two irrigations i e scenarios 2 and 5 and the use of one irrigation i e scenarios 3 and 6 was 5934 kg ha 1 5307 kg ha 1 and 4539 kg ha 1 respectively table s1 in the supplementary material these simulated results were greater than the average winter wheat yield of those 10 growing seasons under the ww sm system with the corresponding irrigation scheme by 4 8 and 11 respectively table s1 in the supplementary material this finding indicated that the fallow period of the ww sm f sm system could contribute to the winter wheat yield in the non fallow seasons especially under the scenarios that applied limited irrigation schemes for this crop in other words the increases in winter wheat yield during the non fallow seasons under the ww sm f sm system could help offset the losses associated with the fallow period to a certain extent averaged across the whole simulation period i e 20 years the annual mean of winter wheat yield under the ww sm f sm system would decrease by 47 61 relative to the values observed under the basic scenario the spatial distribution of the average winter wheat yield of the 10 non fallow seasons under the six fallow schemes are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material for reference the simulated results show that either the summer maize yield following the fallow period or following winter wheat under the six fallow scenarios changed little in comparison with the values in the basic scenario table s2 and fig s3 in the supplementary material this result indicated that through a regional lens conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize in place of the current irrigation schedule under the ww sm f sm system would not cause a large loss in the grain yield of this crop over the simulated 20 years and it could be explained by the variations in crop transpiration and soil water evaporation provided in fig 6 it should be noted however that the study area is characterized by spatiotemporally variable precipitation which could affect the summer maize yield in different years and places we found that for an extremely dry season the summer maize would be reduced by 24 37 compared to that in the basic scenario if the rain fed scheme was implemented i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 fig 7 fig s4 in the supplementary material indicated the subbasins with larger reduction in maize yield were produced by the rain fed scheme compared to the current irrigation schedule this finding agreed with the distribution of places prone to agricultural drought in the summer season as reported in wang 2010 and liu 2012 this result suggests that in these areas the rain fed scheme for summer maize should be applied prudently or management efforts should consider adding supplementary irrigation during the extremely dry season according to the weather forecast it should be noted that at present little application of rain fed schemes for summer maize has been promoted at the regional scale which is associated with farmers traditional irrigation schedule to some extent the above results quantified the effects of rain fed summer maize on groundwater conservation as well as on crop yields these findings could provide valuable reference for promoting the alternative cropping practices this study proposed 3 2 evaluated results of the water food energy nexus under the fallow schemes through a scenario to scenario comparison under the same irrigation scheme for winter wheat but different irrigation schemes for summer maize i e scenario 1 vs scenario 4 scenario 2 vs scenario 5 and scenario 3 vs scenario 6 we found that the changes in summer maize yield between the current irrigation schedule and the rain fed scheme over 20 years were only 3 4 table 2 however conducting a rain fed scheme for summer maize could obviously improve the shallow groundwater conservation effects compared to the effects of maintaining the current irrigation schedule for instance the degree of reduction in shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation i e rdgwe and rdgwo could improve by 11 and 18 fig 8 respectively highlighting a significant effect on the protection of the depleted shallow aquifer in addition the degree of reduction in electricity consumption i e rdeelectric would increase by 8 if the irrigation for summer maize was canceled fig 8 overall under the ww sm f sm system applying the rain fed scheme for summer maize could have a better effect on saving groundwater and energy resources table 2 maintaining a basically stable grain yield table 2 and improving the water productivity of this crop fig s5 in the supplementary material and fig 8 in other words under the wfen evaluation framework scenario 4 should have comprehensive advantages over scenario 1 similar results would be expected between scenario 5 and scenario 2 and between scenario 6 and scenario 3 for these three preferable fallow schemes i e scenarios 4 5 and 6 the evaluated results showed that if the current irrigation schedule is applied for winter wheat i e implementing scenario 4 shallow groundwater exploitation could be reduced by approximately 55 compared to the value of the basic scenario fig 8 nevertheless as the pumping amount was still greater than the recharge all subbasins except dx1 and zy1 presented an overexploitation trend in the shallow groundwater i e the rdgwo index was less than 100 under this scenario figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material to reverse the depletion of the shallow aquifer to a recovery trend under the condition of conducting rain fed scheme for summer maize the limited irrigation scheme with only one round should be applied for winter wheat i e implementing scenario 6 according to the evaluated results of the rdgwo index shown in figs s6 and s7 of the supplementary material however under this scenario the annual average winter wheat yield over 20 years would be cut down to 2234 kg ha 1 table 2 which was only 39 of the value observed in the basic scenario indicating this approach might inflict heavy losses on grain production in the study area compared to these two scenarios the fallow scheme with two irrigations for winter wheat i e scenario 5 was a type of compromise plan that could balance the trade off between groundwater depletion and crop yield reduction under this scenario the shallow groundwater overexploitation could be reduced by an average of 103 in comparison with the basic scenario fig 8 indicating that the decline in the groundwater table would be stopped at the regional level in addition if the fallow scheme of scenario 5 was applied the reduction in winter wheat yield would be 7 lower than that under scenario 6 fig 8 and table 2 and the water productivity of winter wheat would be increased by 5 compared to that under scenario 4 fig s5 in the supplementary material and fig 8 while this scenario should be an appropriate scheme we found that a shallow groundwater equilibrium could not be achieved in each subbasin due to the variability in weather and underlying surface figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material therefore an optimized fallow scheme pattern that could stop the decline in the shallow groundwater table and improve the water and energy productivities with the goal of maximum crop yield in all subbasins is presented in the next section through the application of 17 indices that were based on modeling and calculating results the index based evaluation with regard to the wfen perspective proved to be a capable tool for comparing different fallow schemes moreover the analysis of these indices specifically focused on individual aspects of the nexus helped to better quantify the effects on groundwater conservation crop production and energy consumption thus providing also an applicable approach for assessing the sustainability associated to well irrigated agriculture several of these indices also constituted the main constraints of the integer linear programming used in the next section which integrated the simulation and optimization within the wfen framework 3 3 optimized fallow scheme pattern fig 9 shows the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area using the 0 1 ilp model previously described section 2 4 the dominant fallow scheme after optimization was the ww sm f sm system with two irrigation applications for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 5 that occupied 66 of the well irrigated cropland in the study area and related to 12 subbasins the second most prevalent scheme was the ww sm f sm system with one irrigation application for winter wheat and a rain fed scheme for summer maize i e scenario 6 which occupied 24 of the well irrigated cropland in the study area and related to 6 subbasins it should be noted that in the zy7 subbasin the shallow groundwater table presented a declining trend with a rate of 0 08 m a 1 under scenario 6 which did not satisfy the constraints listed in the ilp model equation however it was close to the threshold value of 0 05 m a 1 and we assumed that the declining trend was stopped thus scenario 6 was determined to be the recommended scheme in this subbasin fig 9 for the other four subbasins i e dx1 dx3 dx7 and zy1 due to the relatively higher groundwater recharge in these areas the fallow schemes with higher pumping intensities e g scenarios 1 2 and 4 were selected as the optimized result to achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium fig 9 based on the simulated and calculated results by a distributed hydrological model the optimized fallow schemes for different areas presented a better alternative than applying a single policy over the whole domain which could serve as specific references for decision making by water management authorities according to the evaluated indices related to the wfen under the optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area the reductions in shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation compared to the basic scenario would be 36 5 108 m3 a 1 and 18 5 108 m3 a 1 respectively the annual average winter wheat yield over 20 years would decrease by 55 in comparison with that in the basic scenario fig 9 while the water productivity of this crop could increase by an average of approximately 7 for summer maize under the optimized fallow scheme pattern a basically stable yield and a 7 increase in water productivity were realized during the 20 years at the same time the decreases in diesel consumption by agricultural machines and in electricity consumption by pumping wells would be 75 kg ha 1 and 342 kwh ha 1 respectively indicating reductions of 32 and 90 compared to the basic scenario fig 9 respectively the energy productivity of diesel consumption could be increased by 10 and the energy productivity of electricity consumption could be increased by several times under the optimized fallow scheme pattern the cost savings related to these two aspects were estimated to be approximately 873 yuan ha 1 which could help lessen the impact on farmers incomes produced by the fallow strategy these evaluated results involved an integration of simulation and optimization in a wfen framework which provides an alternative solution considering more comprehensive indicators e g groundwater sustainability food production water productivities and energy productivities for this region as well as an applicable approach for other similar areas in our previous study zhang et al 2018 an optimized irrigation schedule for winter wheat under the conventional ww sm system was explored using the 0 1 ilp model as well both this optimized irrigation schedule under the ww sm system and the optimized fallow scheme pattern under the ww sm f sm system in this study could satisfy the constraint of stopping the drawdown of shallow groundwater however we found that the minimal reductions in winter wheat yield compared to the basic scenario under the optimized results in zhang et al 2018 and the results in this paper were 2404 kg ha 1 and 3148 kg ha 1 respectively this difference indicated that the optimized fallow scheme pattern under the ww sm f sm system would result in crop loss that was 744 kg ha 1 greater than that in the optimized irrigation schedule under the ww sm system however the ww sm f sm system would have an advantage in terms of energy consumption since the cropland could be lying fallow during the winter wheat season once every two years whereas the plowings never stop under the conventional ww sm system based on the equations listed in table 1 the electricity consumption by pumping wells under these two strategies was similar while the annual diesel consumption by agricultural machines under the optimized fallow scheme pattern with the two year three crop system was 75 kg ha 1 lower than that under the optimized irrigation schedule with the one year two crop system this result was equivalent to a cost savings of 667 5 yuan ha 1 75 kg ha 1 8 9 yuan kg 1 for farmers using an estimated grain price of 2 4 yuan kg 1 for wheat hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the farmers could purchase approximately 278 kg of wheat for 667 5 yuan with good market availability nevertheless this value was less than the wheat yield gap of 744 kg per hectare that the optimized irrigation schedule superior to the optimized fallow schemes pattern this estimation implied that the eco compensation criterion of the fallow strategy should be higher than that of the limited irrigation strategy as a result farmers could expect similar benefits to offset the loss in earnings it should be mentioned that during the fallow period under the ww sm f sm system farmers would also have an opportunity to serve as migrant workers which might increase their incomes to some extent however this issue involves a more complex analysis of hydrological economics quantitative estimations are needed in further studies 3 4 limitations of this study the scenario simulations in this study should be a predictive estimation of the potential fallow strategies at the regional scale the confirmation of which is limited in reality because these planning schemes lack observed data to compare against detailed validation needs to be further performed to provide a more in depth discussion on the rationality of the simulation which should be supported by more collectible data if the related fallow schemes were implemented in the study area the error propagation associated with the transformations of spatial and temporal scale in the modeling processes were difficult to quantify the estimations calculated in this study should be applicable within the meteorological conditions of simulated 20 years uncertainties such as that under climate change scenarios is one of areas that demand further analysis we applied 17 indices to evaluate the wfen under different fallow schemes in this study specifically for the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield the simulated results of swat could be used directly however the evaluation of electricity consumption for well irrigation had to be based on a conversion equation due to the limitations of the collected data the estimation of the pump head and pump efficiency related to this equation may influence the accuracy of this variable with regards to the evaluation of diesel consumption the diversity in the types of seeding machines harvesting machines and tilling machines have not yet been considered hence one improvement would be to collect more detailed data about the pumping electricity and agricultural machine energy consumption in the study area to create improved assessments in the future 4 conclusions the fallow strategy should be an alternative plan to limit withdrawal in areas with groundwater depletion here a shallow groundwater fed plain in china was taken as a representative area to explore the effects of the fallow strategy on groundwater variation crop production and energy consumption under a simulation evaluation optimization framework several conclusions were drawn as follows the triple cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and summer maize in two years ww sm f sm should be a viable fallow scheme that could balance the trade off between shallow groundwater conservation and crop production in this region during the fallow period under the ww sm f sm system nearly all precipitation would transform into soil surface evaporation while very little would contribute to groundwater recharge however compared to the conventional winter wheat summer maize ww sm double cropping system the variations in soil water balance components under the ww sm f sm system could contribute to the wheat yield of the non fallow seasons which would offset the crop loss caused by the fallow period to some extent if the rain fed scheme for summer maize is conducted under this two year three crop system the average summer maize yield could be stable as that under the current irrigation schedule with the exception of the precipitation condition in extremely dry seasons to realize shallow groundwater equilibrium and improve water and energy productivities the optimized fallow scheme for 90 of the well irrigated cropland should be the ww sm f sm system with a limited irrigation scheme two irrigations or one irrigation for winter and a rain fed scheme for summer maize for the other 10 of well irrigated cropland the optimized results were spatially different under this optimized fallow scheme pattern for the study area the minimal reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 relative to the basic scenario while an average of 36 5 108 m3 a 1 in shallow groundwater exploitation 18 5 108 m3 a 1 in shallow groundwater overexploitation 75 kg ha 1 in diesel consumption by agricultural machines and 342 kwh ha 1 in electricity consumption by pumping wells could be decreased simultaneously these quantitative results may serve as sound support for developing management practices to sustain groundwater resources in this well irrigated plain in addition the assessment process with regard to the wfen perspective in this study can serve as a reference for similar areas experiencing shallow groundwater
