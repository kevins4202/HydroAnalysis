24925,efficient management of agricultural management should consider multiple services and stakeholders yet it remains unclear how to guarantee ecosystem services for multiple stakeholders demands especially considering the observed biodiversity decline following reductions in semi natural habitat snh and global change here we use an ecosystem service model of intensively managed agricultural landscapes to derive the best landscape compositions for different stakeholders demands and how they vary with stochasticity and the degree of pollination dependence of crops we analyse three groups of stakeholders assumed to value different ecosystem services most individual farmers crop yield per area agricultural unions landscape production and conservationists biodiversity additionally we consider a social average scenario that aims at maximizing multifunctionality trade offs among stakeholders demands strongly depend on the degree of pollination dependence of crops the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity and the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder intermediate amounts of snh deliver relatively high levels of the three services social average our analysis further suggests that the current levels of snh protection lie below these intermediate amounts of snh in intensively managed agricultural landscapes given the worldwide trends in agriculture and global change current policies should start to consider factors such as crop type and stochasticity as they can strongly influence best landscape compositions for different stakeholders our results suggest ways of managing landscapes to reconcile several actors demands and ensure for biodiversity conservation and food production keywords landscape composition crop pollination biodiversity trade offs stakeholder demands agroecology 1 introduction natural ecosystems provide a wide range of benefits to mankind the concept of ecosystem services ehrlich and ehrlich 1981 was originally proposed to draw attention to these benefits and raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity and its conservation ecosystem services are products of the functioning of ecosystems that are of value to humans such as pollination pest control food production and water catchment services montoya et al 2012 more recently the ecosystem service metaphor has incorporated two additional elements first ecosystems provide multiple services simultaneously to humans provisioning supporting regulating and cultural a situation called multifunctionality winston 2007 lovell and johnston 2009 manning et al 2018 this has led to a growing consensus that landscape design and management should target a range of functions wilson 2007 shellhorn et al 2008 birkhofer et al 2015 landis 2017 second the ecosystem service concept is a complex construct that comprises both supply ecosystems and demand stakeholders components burkhard et al 2012 palacios agundez et al 2015 yahdjian et al 2015 human use of ecosystem services thus depends on the capacity of ecosystems to supply these services as well as on the social demand for them agricultural landscapes involve a great variety of ecosystem services and stakeholders and they globally represent about 40 of the total terrestrial surface of our planet foley et al 2011 as such agricultural landscapes are among the most interesting systems to analyze the balance between the supply and demand of various ecosystem services the particularity of most modern agricultural landscapes is that the provision of a single service i e crop production is intensified by means of land conversion mechanical work and the use of agrochemicals pesticides fertilizers but this generates negative indirect effects as land use favors crop production at the cost of other services that in turn influence crop production nelson et al 2009 allan et al 2015 sutter and albrecht 2016 the need to incorporate various ecosystem services into management decisions is thus essential especially considering that agricultural intensification and increased pesticide levels are no longer enhancing the yields of many major crops worldwide ray et al 2012 gaba et al 2016 lechenet et al 2017 this has been acknowledged by the 2017 un sustainable development goals which assert that the future of intensive farming systems requires management strategies that achieve food security and sustainable agriculture united nations sustainable development goals 2017 the supply and demand components of ecosystem services in agricultural systems are multifaceted because of the multiple ecological processes involved on the supply side and the multiple stakeholders that benefit from them on the demand side on the supply side trade offs between ecosystem services seem to be common bennett et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 allan et al 2015 intensive agricultural management for example may lead to high crop yields but intensively managed fields often have simplified communities and hence low levels of other ecosystem services such as biological control by natural enemies and pollination médiène et al 2011 dainese et al 2019 such trade offs depend on various factors including landscape composition crop land vs semi natural land and the degree of pollination dependence of crops aizen et al 2009 garibaldi et al 2014 2011a b deguines et al 2014 montoya et al 2019 together landscape composition crop type and their associated service trade offs lead to scenarios where either different ecosystem services can be reconciled or conversely the provision of several ecosystem services is incompatible evaluating landscape performance when multiple interacting factors act simultaneously is thus a challenge especially considering questions such as which combination of drivers is able to reconcile crop production and biodiversity conservation human demand is the other side of the ecosystem service equation and comprises different agents or stakeholders these stakeholders vary in both their demand for and valuation of different ecosystems services and have specific perspectives about how to efficiently manage agricultural landscapes for example agricultural unions or cooperatives often aim at maximizing crop production at the regional level i e landscape production for food security purposes farmers on the other hand may have different perceptions of ecosystem services teixeira et al 2018 yet they are mainly interested in maximizing crop yield per area of their cultivated land as this is mostly related to their profitability conservationists ngo s wildlife friendly organizations defend that the preservation of the remaining biodiversity within the agricultural landscape should be one main goal of agricultural policies the existence of ecosystem service trade offs on the supply side implies that any stakeholder s demand does not necessarily maximize multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes because each stakeholder may prioritize one ecosystem service or set of services over others considering various stakeholders is thus required to identify potential trade offs and balance multiple often conflicting demands for ecosystems services baró et al 2017 turkelboom et al 2018 to complicate things further recent studies show that global change factors can act interactively with land use modifications and influence both ecosystem service supply and demand components shoyama and yamagata 2014 ding et al 2016 martinez harms et al 2017 in this context it is increasingly important for ecologists to be able to generate predictions of the effects of global change on the long term provision of crop production in agricultural landscapes however food stability is considered to be one of the major challenges of food security that is missing in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need for studies that explicit consider both the mean and the variability of crop production and other ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes and that investigate their expected changes following global change predictions here we use a model of biodiversity and crop production in intensively managed agricultural landscapes to derive landscape management solutions for different stakeholders demands we analyze three main groups of stakeholders individual farmers agricultural unions and conservationists and identify three ecosystem services they value most crop yield per unit of agricultural area crop production at the landscape scale and biodiversity respectively using information given by ecosystem service trade offs we determine the best landscape composition defined as the fraction of semi natural habitat within the agricultural landscape that corresponds to each stakeholder s demand and how this affects the provision of the other ecosystem services we define conditions under which stakeholder demands are compatible or not e g when food production and biodiversity conservation are positively correlated we also investigate how changes in stochasticity expected under global change predictions and the degree of pollination dependence of crops may affect the best landscape composition for each stakeholder fig 1 specifically our work has three objectives i to determine the best landscape compositions that correspond to different stakeholders demands ii to investigate the effects of a given stakeholder s demand on other ecosystem services and iii to establish the best landscape composition for ecosystem multifunctionality i e a social average scenario that targets the highest provision of the three ecosystem services beyond any single stakeholder s demand finally we confront the model outputs with current policies and discuss their efficiency to promote multifunctional agricultural landscapes our approach is unique in its attempt to achieve some balance and or maximize the provision of ecosystem services and stakeholder demands for different crop types pollination dependence of crops and environmental and demographic stochasticity scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description we extend a model of biodiversity and crop production in a spatially heterogeneous agricultural landscape that incorporates environmental and demographic stochasticity montoya et al 2019 food stability is one of the major challenges of food security that is missing in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 and our model explicitly includes it through the consideration of environmental and demographic stochasticity appendix a the model represents intensively managed agricultural landscapes where crop land does not harbour significant levels of biodiversity note that although some levels of biodiversity can be observed in crop land areas e g pascher et al 2011 for vascular plants grasshoppers and butterflies we focus on wild central place pollinators i e all types of wild bees including bumble bees and solitary bees whose presence and abundance directly depend on the amount of seminatural habitat which provides shelter and habitat for these insects spatial heterogeneity is defined by two types of patches i crop land which is used to grow annual crops with varying degrees of dependence on animal pollination and ii semi natural habitat which shelters biodiversity including wild plants and pollinators topography and soil conditions are considered to be homogeneous crop land and semi natural habitat are linked by pollinators foraging movement and pollinators are assumed to be generalist central place foragers that feed on both wild plants and crops kleijn et al 2015 the model focuses on wild pollinators as they directly depend on semi natural habitat for nesting foraging and refuge space is implicitly considered so that pollinators can potentially feed on all crops and wild plants present in the agricultural landscape irrespective of the spatial configuration of the landscape i e fragmentation effects are not considered the model can apply to any spatial extent provided that the pollinators and hence the fragments of semi natural habitat that host them are distributed in such a way that pollinators have access to the whole landscape or that pollinators are not spatially restricted in their foraging patterns therefore the spatial extent can vary from roughly 5 10 ha typical arable field in europe to any larger scale provided pollinators are not aggregated in a small part of the landscape the model studies three ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes crop yield per unit of agricultural area crop production at the landscape scale and biodiversity and describes mechanistically the trade offs between these ecosystem services in intensive agricultural landscapes montoya et al 2019 this model is a useful first approximation to studying the crop production in agroecosystems as it successfully reproduces empirical observations on the stability of pollination dependent crop yield garibaldi et al 2011a deguines et al 2014 and it provides rigorous theoretical foundations for previously hypothesized functional relationships between the magnitude of ecosystem services and landscape composition braat and ten brink 2008 model dynamics are governed by two key parameters the degree of pollination dependence of crops which we vary to represent different crop types see appendix a and environmental and demographic stochasticity here we analyse the effects of these parameters on the best landscape composition associated with each stakeholder s demand a complete description of the model the model equations and the estimation of model parameters is provided in appendix a 2 2 stakeholders and management scenarios we use our model to investigate how different stakeholders demands determine the best landscape compositions in agricultural landscapes beneficiaries or stakeholders for ecosystem services include individuals cooperatives corporations non governmental organisations and the public sector to illustrate our approach we analysed three main groups of stakeholders individual farmers agricultural unions and conservationists and identify three ecosystem services valued by those stakeholders most crop yield per area of their cultivated land crop production at the landscape scale landscape production and biodiversity scenarios 1 3 we use this example as a case study to determine the best landscape compositions for each different stakeholder demands and how they affect the magnitude of the various ecosystems services best landscape composition is defined as the range of fraction of semi natural habitat within which the targeted level of a given ecosystem service is achieved additionally we define a fourth scenario where no single ecosystem service is prioritized this scenario targets the highest possible provision of the three ecosystem services described above i e multifunctionality scenario 4 and it can be viewed as a social average scenario beyond the specific demands of the individual stakeholders the social average scenario follows the idea that a challenge for the future is to design landscapes that are beneficial for a range of functions shellhorn et al 2008 stakeholders may demand a minimum amount of ecosystem service provision e g protecting 75 of biodiversity or producing 80 of crop biomass this is accounted for in our model by incorporating function thresholds a function threshold is defined as the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder i e how much of the maximum possible value of that ecosystem service given by model simulations a given stakeholder is willing to accept the best landscape compositions within the agricultural landscape are likely to change if stakeholders assume higher or lower thresholds of their demanded ecosystem service thus considering function thresholds is useful for identifying potential trade offs and for balancing various demands for services 2 3 analytical protocol we follow a four step process summarized in fig 2 first for each fraction of semi natural habitat we run model simulations to obtain the frequency distribution for each ecosystem service after 1000 time steps landscape production is used as an example fig 2a this is performed for the whole range of semi natural habitat 0 100 to obtain the frequency distribution of landscape production as a function of semi natural habitat fig 2b the strength of this approach lies in its ability to explore the full probability distribution of ecosystem service values as well as the possibility of setting thresholds values for services see carnus et al 2014 for the justification of this approach absolute thresholds for ecosystem services are generally lacking so we look at the best landscape compositions that provide a given proportion of the maximum ecosystem service value along the range of semi natural habitat appendix b provides an alternative application of the approach using absolute ecosystem service values using the median values of the frequency distributions we calculate the best landscape composition where median landscape production is above a certain of its maximum value i e function threshold this is performed for all levels of crop pollination dependence i e for a wide range of crop types to show the best landscape composition as a function of crop pollination dependence fig 2c we use median values because they are the most frequent values besides median values are robust to non gaussian distributions which are increasingly typical when stochasticity is high using any other quantile yields qualitatively similar results appendix b next we address the effects of each stakeholder s demand on the other ecosystem services for each stakeholder scenarios 1 3 we set the function threshold of the ecosystem service they demand to 95 i e agricultural unions demand 95 of landscape production the demand established by the function threshold is satisfied within a certain range of semi natural habitat fig 2d which is used to determine the corresponding provision of the other ecosystem services fig 2d for the social average scenario scenario 4 we apply a maximin approach a common method of performing multi objective optimization solteiro pires et al 2005 for general multi criteria decision analysis see also huang et al 2011 mendoza and martins 2006 this method selects the best landscape composition that maximises within the set of three ecosystem services the provision of the least provisioned one in sum this protocol produces the best landscape compositions for different stakeholders demands scenarios 1 4 crop types degrees of pollination dependence of crops and function thresholds and explores the effects of such demands on other ecosystem services finally we compare the best landscape compositions obtained by our model with current management of agricultural landscapes our search for actual policies targeting specific fractions of semi natural habitat within agricultural landscapes yielded only one result the european union green policy which aims at preserving 5 of semi natural elements at the farm level pe er et al 2014 additionally we assessed two conservation policies focused on terrestrial ecosystems the 2020 aichi biodiversity targets abt global biodiversity outlook 2014 and the brazilian forest code bfc soares filho et al 2014 analyses were performed in r software r version 3 6 0 r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 best landscape compositions for each stakeholder the best landscape composition depends on stakeholders demands and thus on which ecosystem service is prioritized in general the best landscape compositions for individual farmers and conservationists were associated with higher fractions of semi natural habitat whereas agricultural unions demands were achieved at lower fractions of semi natural habitat for intermediate levels of crop pollination dependence and median values of stochasticity prioritizing individual farmers demands yields intermediate to high fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3 a while this favors biodiversity conservation landscape production is highly variable 1 69 figs 3a and 4 b whereas total production at landscape scale depends on both yields i e related to semi natural habitat and crop land the trade off between crop yields per area and total production at the landscape scale is explained because yields per unit area increase with more pollinator supply which in turn increases with semi natural land agricultural unions goal to maximize landscape production occurs at low intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3b this leads to relatively high levels of individual farmers demands but conservationists goals may not be fulfilled as biodiversity would remain at intermediate levels figs 3b and 4 b more biodiversity remains at higher fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3c and it is positively correlated with high levels of crop yield per area reconciling conservationists demands and farmers profitability figs 3c and 4 b conversely landscape production would be low 0 24 revealing a trade off between conservationists and agricultural unions demands finally the social average scenario corresponds to intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat 39 fig 3d yielding 79 of the function threshold for all three ecosystem services which can be considered as indicative of a highly multifunctional agricultural landscape 3 2 effects of crop type stochasticity and function thresholds on landscape composition the best landscape compositions and the trade offs and synergies between stakeholders demands strongly depend on three factors crop pollination dependence the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity and the function threshold of ecosystem services i e the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder 3 2 1 crop pollination dependence higher pollination dependence of crops shifts the best landscape compositions to higher fractions of semi natural habitat for individual farmers and agricultural unions fig 5 intermediate stochasticity for increasing levels of pollination dependence crop yield per area and total landscape production require more pollinators and hence semi natural habitat thus compatibility between conservationists and individual farmers demands increases with the level of pollination dependence of crops compatibility of union and conservationist demands improves as well given their ranges move closer yet they do not overlap conservationists and agricultural unions goals cannot however be reconciled for any type of crop if both stakeholders target 95 of their most valued ecosystem service only at low levels of crop pollination dependence can agricultural unions and individual farmers coincide in their best landscape composition but this leads to low biodiversity levels fig 4 a for the social average scenario the fraction of semi natural habitat increases with crop pollination dependence this mainly driven by the dependency of landscape production and crop yield per area on wild pollination 3 2 2 stochasticity a higher stochasticity increases the fraction of semi natural habitat that meets individual farmers demands but it decreases the best fraction of semi natural habitat for agricultural unions especially for animal pollinated crops fig 5b c revealing a trade off between the two stakeholders in general a high stochasticity only slightly reduces the compatibility between farmers and conservationists but it completely decouples demands of individual farmers and agricultural unions the latter is due to a large reduction in the fraction of semi natural habitat to meet agricultural unions demands when stochasticity is high together with an increment of the fraction of semi natural habitat for farmers goals the social average scenario is met at intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat 30 5 39 and 45 for different crop types but high stochasticity reduces that fraction to lower values 28 5 29 5 and 31 because of changes in agricultural unions demands we found a greater effect of environmental compared to demographic stochasticity of crops and wild pollinators in determining changes in the best landscape compositions appendix c fig c 1 3 2 3 function threshold compatibility among stakeholders demands increases with diminishing function thresholds i e the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder fig e1 lower function thresholds expand the range of semi natural habitat associated with the best landscape composition of each stakeholder this increases the overlap in the best landscape composition of different stakeholders compatibility of stakeholders demands with varying function thresholds is higher for intermediate and high levels of crop pollination dependence 4 discussion an efficient sustainable design of agricultural systems is a major challenge of our time and the integration of various services and stakeholders is crucial to meet that challenge our model is a useful first approximation to studying the crop production in agroecosystems as it has been shown to successfully reproduce empirical observations on the stability of pollination dependent crop yield garibaldi et al 2011a deguines et al 2014 and it provides rigorous theoretical foundations for previously hypothesized functional relationships between the magnitude of ecosystem services and landscape composition braat and ten brink 2008 this study adds to the large body of literature on how to make management decisions involving multiple objectives including multi criteria decision analyses based on multiple valued outcomes e g see reviews by huang et al 2011 mendoza and martins 2006 and studies addressing the role of ecosystem trade offs and the role of demand of multiple stakeholders landis 2017 cavender bares et al 2015 palacios agundez et al 2015 yahdjian et al 2015 burkhard et al 2012 and highlights the importance of considering the multifaceted nature in the supply of and demand for ecosystem services further our model assesses the potential effects of global change on ecosystem services thus explicitly including food stability in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 our simple case study model of three ecosystem services and three groups of stakeholders contributes to develop a general understanding of the balance of biodiversity and crop production and of the various stakeholders in intensively managed agricultural systems based on landscape composition our results reveal trade offs and compatibilities between stakeholders demands that mirror those observed in the supply side indicating that prioritization of individual stakeholders demands has consequences on the other services and on ecosystem multifunctionality such trade offs strongly depend on factors seldom considered by management policies including the degree of pollination dependence of crops and the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity the best landscape compositions measured as the fraction of semi natural habitat within the agricultural landscape differ among stakeholders in general individual farmers and conservationists demands are associated with higher fractions of semi natural habitat whereas agricultural unions demands are achieved at lower fractions of semi natural habitat this trade off in the ecosystem service demand between agricultural unions on one hand and individual farmers and conservationists on the other hand implies that management focusing on single stakeholders will invariably reduce multifunctionality in agricultural systems at least for the three services considered in this study but the best landscape composition is not a static figure rather it depends on the same factors that determine trade offs in the provision of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes montoya et al 2019 crop type defined here as the degree to which a crop depends on animal pollination is a main driver of the best landscape composition for both individual farmers and agricultural unions although the three major crops in terms of biomass are independent of animal pollination wheat rice corn the cultivated area of pollination dependent crops is expanding faster than the area of pollinator independent crops aizen and harder 2009 breeze et al 2014 a higher pollination dependence of crops e g most fruit crops such as prunus spp malus spp watermelon cucurbita spp generally shifts the best landscape composition to larger fractions of semi natural habitat irrespective of the stakeholder considered yet to our knowledge this shift is not taken into account by actual policies for low levels of pollination dependence of crops and crops independent of animal pollination prioritizing agricultural unions demands increases landscape production but reduces farmers benefits and harms biodiversity significantly however with increasing dependence of crops on animal pollination the best landscape composition involves larger fractions of semi natural habitat which results in better biodiversity conservation combined with farmers profitability but does not satisfy agricultural unions demands because agriculture worldwide is becoming more pollinator dependent over time breeze et al 2014 aizen et al 2009 changes in the best landscape compositions driven by crop pollination dependence are highly relevant in the global context current global change enhances the inter annual variance of several climate variables i e environmental stochasticity giorgi et al 2001 li and xian 2003 saltz et al 2006 as shown by the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events such as floods heat waves and droughts fischer et al 2016 woodward et al 2016 craven et al 2016 these events may in turn increase environmental stochasticity of crops and wild pollinators and there is evidence that climate trends are partly responsible for observed increases in yield variability iizumi and ramankutty 2016 osborne and wheeler 2013 and influence the delivery of ecosystem services shoyama and yamagata 2014 ding et al 2016 martinez harms et al 2017 our results suggest that increasing stochasticity has contrasting effects on the best landscape composition for different stakeholders individual farmers demands are generally met at higher fractions of semi natural habitat when stochasticity is high whereas the opposite holds true for agricultural unions such differences are driven by the different effects of stochasticity on the provision of ecosystem services more specifically high stochasticity changes the relationship between ecosystem services and semi natural habitat on one hand the unimodal relationship of landscape production reported elsewhere braat and ten brink 2008 montoya et al 2019 becomes monotonically decreasing for high stochasticity appendix c fig c 1 and this shifts maximum landscape production to lower fractions of semi natural habitat on the other hand the saturating relationship of crop yield per area becomes flat when stochasticity is high appendix c fig c 2 thus constraining the range of semi natural habitat that maximizes farmers profitability agricultural management should thus consider global change predictions as changes in stochasticity directly influence the best landscape compositions that maximize stakeholders demands the demands of individual farmers and conservationists generally align at higher fractions of semi natural habitat therefore the farmers best interest is that despite how much farmed is their land the landscape around their cultivated land is not farmed this is consistent with empirical research in grassland ecosystems showing that higher levels of biodiversity are beneficial for landowners binder et al 2018 but contrasts with recent trends in modern agriculture where individual farmers tend to increase crop land at the expense of semi natural habitat and thus biodiversity we identify various reasons to explain the discrepancy between the individual farmers demand defined in our study and their actual demand first crops whose production does not depend on wild pollination do not require semi natural habitat in this case farmers tend to expand crop area second wild pollinators might suffer from the tragedy of the commons where wild pollinators are the commons and farmers deplete semi natural habitat through their collective action also farmers actions may reflect a not in my back yard nimby phenomenon finally the importance of wild pollinators inhabiting non crop areas for crop production pollination of crop plants might be underestimated our results suggest that a reduction in the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept i e function thresholds is a necessary condition to reconcile various stakeholders demands fig 3d fig e1 this is because lower function thresholds expand the range of semi natural habitat increasing the overlap in the best landscape composition for different stakeholders indeed this idea underpins the social average scenario which suggests that overall performance of agricultural landscapes can be improved by combining multiple demands for ecosystem services as opposed to a traditional focus constrained by provisioning services mainly total landscape production lovell and johnston 2009 jordan and warner 2010 our results suggest that prioritizing multifunctional landscapes achieves relatively high levels of the three ecosystem services analysed and satisfies stakeholders demands for intermediate amounts of semi natural habitat further the social average scenario is more robust to changes in crop type and stochasticity figs 4 and 5 and appendix c fig c 1 therefore management of agricultural systems for multifunctionality may better align with the increasing consensus supporting the need for agricultural landscapes to simultaneously provide ecosystem services that guarantee food security livelihood opportunities and biodiversity conservation i e ecosystem service multifunctionality manning et al 2018 our findings suggest that unless the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept is reduced the proportion of semi natural habitat that conservation policies aim to protect lies below the best landscape composition in intensively managed agricultural systems especially for high levels of crop pollination dependence the eu green policy succeeds in achieving high levels of landscape production agricultural unions demand of crops that do not depend much on animal pollination although this leads to low biodiversity levels figs 5 d1 e1 similar conclusions can be drawn for the aichi biodiversity targets now implemented in the eu biodiversity strategy and the brazilian forest code although they target higher fractions of semi natural habitat 17 and 20 respectively therefore the regional and global scale policies analyzed here satisfy agricultural unions demands in one scenario only that is when crops depend little or not at all on animal pollination although it leads to low biodiversity levels by and large preserving 5 20 of semi natural habitat lies below the best landscape composition for biodiversity and crop production in intensively managed agricultural systems for any other combination of stakeholders demands considered here crop type or stochasticity such policies also fail to meet the social average scenario under the current trends of increasing pollinator dependence of agriculture and global change such targets seem too low to either meet stakeholders demands or achieve adequate sustainable levels of multifunctionality in agricultural systems social average scenario designing more sustainable ways of food production is thus a challenge for the future of intensive farming systems in the context of global change 4 1 future research our model is a useful starting point for future research a future extension of our model would be to analyze other farming types e g organic and wildlife friendly farming where pollinator diversity may thrive to some extent within crop land and the best landscape compositions may not be necessarily similar to those of intensively managed agricultural systems clough et al 2011 also metrics other than landscape composition could be used complementarily e g agrochemical inputs to compare management scenarios in agricultural systems besides the spatial configuration of seminatural habitat is expected to determine ecosystem service flows between crop land and seminatural habitat garibaldi et al 2011b mitchell et al 2015 and this may affect the best landscape compositions of organisms with narrow foraging ranges we plan to include more realistic patterns of landscape fragmentation to assess the generality of the results presented here additionally we have illustrated our approach using three ecosystem services and three groups of stakeholders as a case study however agricultural landscapes include a greater variety of ecosystem services water quality pest control soil conditions nutrient cycling flood mitigation as well as recreational and aesthetic services and stakeholders whose demands may partially overlap e g farmers may not only favor crop yield per area but also a minimum amount of crop land a wider consideration of ecosystem services will likely reveal additional trade offs and synergies among services such as between different provisioning services timber vs crop yield rapidel et al 2015 and between provisioning and regulating services crop yield vs water quality crop yield vs development of fungal diseases long term soil fertility vs immediate crop production stosch et al 2017 rapidel et al 2015 see klapwijk et al 2014 and references therein such additional trade offs may affect the best landscape compositions future work will thus benefit from assessing a greater representation of ecosystem services determining the overall performance of agricultural landscapes and of stakeholders 4 2 conclusions the future of intensive farming systems in the context of global change is a key component of the 2017 un sustainable development goals our analysis of three ecosystem services related to biodiversity and crop production and three groups of stakeholders shows that the best landscape composition differs among stakeholders and that current policies should start to consider factors such as crop type stochasticity and the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept as they can strongly influence these best landscape compositions for different stakeholders management for social average or multifunctionality scenario may be a better option for food security livelihood opportunities and biodiversity conservation thus meeting various stakeholders demands these results are relevant given the worldwide trends in agriculture more pollinator dependent over time and global change associated with the strength of environmental and

24925,efficient management of agricultural management should consider multiple services and stakeholders yet it remains unclear how to guarantee ecosystem services for multiple stakeholders demands especially considering the observed biodiversity decline following reductions in semi natural habitat snh and global change here we use an ecosystem service model of intensively managed agricultural landscapes to derive the best landscape compositions for different stakeholders demands and how they vary with stochasticity and the degree of pollination dependence of crops we analyse three groups of stakeholders assumed to value different ecosystem services most individual farmers crop yield per area agricultural unions landscape production and conservationists biodiversity additionally we consider a social average scenario that aims at maximizing multifunctionality trade offs among stakeholders demands strongly depend on the degree of pollination dependence of crops the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity and the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder intermediate amounts of snh deliver relatively high levels of the three services social average our analysis further suggests that the current levels of snh protection lie below these intermediate amounts of snh in intensively managed agricultural landscapes given the worldwide trends in agriculture and global change current policies should start to consider factors such as crop type and stochasticity as they can strongly influence best landscape compositions for different stakeholders our results suggest ways of managing landscapes to reconcile several actors demands and ensure for biodiversity conservation and food production keywords landscape composition crop pollination biodiversity trade offs stakeholder demands agroecology 1 introduction natural ecosystems provide a wide range of benefits to mankind the concept of ecosystem services ehrlich and ehrlich 1981 was originally proposed to draw attention to these benefits and raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity and its conservation ecosystem services are products of the functioning of ecosystems that are of value to humans such as pollination pest control food production and water catchment services montoya et al 2012 more recently the ecosystem service metaphor has incorporated two additional elements first ecosystems provide multiple services simultaneously to humans provisioning supporting regulating and cultural a situation called multifunctionality winston 2007 lovell and johnston 2009 manning et al 2018 this has led to a growing consensus that landscape design and management should target a range of functions wilson 2007 shellhorn et al 2008 birkhofer et al 2015 landis 2017 second the ecosystem service concept is a complex construct that comprises both supply ecosystems and demand stakeholders components burkhard et al 2012 palacios agundez et al 2015 yahdjian et al 2015 human use of ecosystem services thus depends on the capacity of ecosystems to supply these services as well as on the social demand for them agricultural landscapes involve a great variety of ecosystem services and stakeholders and they globally represent about 40 of the total terrestrial surface of our planet foley et al 2011 as such agricultural landscapes are among the most interesting systems to analyze the balance between the supply and demand of various ecosystem services the particularity of most modern agricultural landscapes is that the provision of a single service i e crop production is intensified by means of land conversion mechanical work and the use of agrochemicals pesticides fertilizers but this generates negative indirect effects as land use favors crop production at the cost of other services that in turn influence crop production nelson et al 2009 allan et al 2015 sutter and albrecht 2016 the need to incorporate various ecosystem services into management decisions is thus essential especially considering that agricultural intensification and increased pesticide levels are no longer enhancing the yields of many major crops worldwide ray et al 2012 gaba et al 2016 lechenet et al 2017 this has been acknowledged by the 2017 un sustainable development goals which assert that the future of intensive farming systems requires management strategies that achieve food security and sustainable agriculture united nations sustainable development goals 2017 the supply and demand components of ecosystem services in agricultural systems are multifaceted because of the multiple ecological processes involved on the supply side and the multiple stakeholders that benefit from them on the demand side on the supply side trade offs between ecosystem services seem to be common bennett et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 allan et al 2015 intensive agricultural management for example may lead to high crop yields but intensively managed fields often have simplified communities and hence low levels of other ecosystem services such as biological control by natural enemies and pollination médiène et al 2011 dainese et al 2019 such trade offs depend on various factors including landscape composition crop land vs semi natural land and the degree of pollination dependence of crops aizen et al 2009 garibaldi et al 2014 2011a b deguines et al 2014 montoya et al 2019 together landscape composition crop type and their associated service trade offs lead to scenarios where either different ecosystem services can be reconciled or conversely the provision of several ecosystem services is incompatible evaluating landscape performance when multiple interacting factors act simultaneously is thus a challenge especially considering questions such as which combination of drivers is able to reconcile crop production and biodiversity conservation human demand is the other side of the ecosystem service equation and comprises different agents or stakeholders these stakeholders vary in both their demand for and valuation of different ecosystems services and have specific perspectives about how to efficiently manage agricultural landscapes for example agricultural unions or cooperatives often aim at maximizing crop production at the regional level i e landscape production for food security purposes farmers on the other hand may have different perceptions of ecosystem services teixeira et al 2018 yet they are mainly interested in maximizing crop yield per area of their cultivated land as this is mostly related to their profitability conservationists ngo s wildlife friendly organizations defend that the preservation of the remaining biodiversity within the agricultural landscape should be one main goal of agricultural policies the existence of ecosystem service trade offs on the supply side implies that any stakeholder s demand does not necessarily maximize multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes because each stakeholder may prioritize one ecosystem service or set of services over others considering various stakeholders is thus required to identify potential trade offs and balance multiple often conflicting demands for ecosystems services baró et al 2017 turkelboom et al 2018 to complicate things further recent studies show that global change factors can act interactively with land use modifications and influence both ecosystem service supply and demand components shoyama and yamagata 2014 ding et al 2016 martinez harms et al 2017 in this context it is increasingly important for ecologists to be able to generate predictions of the effects of global change on the long term provision of crop production in agricultural landscapes however food stability is considered to be one of the major challenges of food security that is missing in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need for studies that explicit consider both the mean and the variability of crop production and other ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes and that investigate their expected changes following global change predictions here we use a model of biodiversity and crop production in intensively managed agricultural landscapes to derive landscape management solutions for different stakeholders demands we analyze three main groups of stakeholders individual farmers agricultural unions and conservationists and identify three ecosystem services they value most crop yield per unit of agricultural area crop production at the landscape scale and biodiversity respectively using information given by ecosystem service trade offs we determine the best landscape composition defined as the fraction of semi natural habitat within the agricultural landscape that corresponds to each stakeholder s demand and how this affects the provision of the other ecosystem services we define conditions under which stakeholder demands are compatible or not e g when food production and biodiversity conservation are positively correlated we also investigate how changes in stochasticity expected under global change predictions and the degree of pollination dependence of crops may affect the best landscape composition for each stakeholder fig 1 specifically our work has three objectives i to determine the best landscape compositions that correspond to different stakeholders demands ii to investigate the effects of a given stakeholder s demand on other ecosystem services and iii to establish the best landscape composition for ecosystem multifunctionality i e a social average scenario that targets the highest provision of the three ecosystem services beyond any single stakeholder s demand finally we confront the model outputs with current policies and discuss their efficiency to promote multifunctional agricultural landscapes our approach is unique in its attempt to achieve some balance and or maximize the provision of ecosystem services and stakeholder demands for different crop types pollination dependence of crops and environmental and demographic stochasticity scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description we extend a model of biodiversity and crop production in a spatially heterogeneous agricultural landscape that incorporates environmental and demographic stochasticity montoya et al 2019 food stability is one of the major challenges of food security that is missing in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 and our model explicitly includes it through the consideration of environmental and demographic stochasticity appendix a the model represents intensively managed agricultural landscapes where crop land does not harbour significant levels of biodiversity note that although some levels of biodiversity can be observed in crop land areas e g pascher et al 2011 for vascular plants grasshoppers and butterflies we focus on wild central place pollinators i e all types of wild bees including bumble bees and solitary bees whose presence and abundance directly depend on the amount of seminatural habitat which provides shelter and habitat for these insects spatial heterogeneity is defined by two types of patches i crop land which is used to grow annual crops with varying degrees of dependence on animal pollination and ii semi natural habitat which shelters biodiversity including wild plants and pollinators topography and soil conditions are considered to be homogeneous crop land and semi natural habitat are linked by pollinators foraging movement and pollinators are assumed to be generalist central place foragers that feed on both wild plants and crops kleijn et al 2015 the model focuses on wild pollinators as they directly depend on semi natural habitat for nesting foraging and refuge space is implicitly considered so that pollinators can potentially feed on all crops and wild plants present in the agricultural landscape irrespective of the spatial configuration of the landscape i e fragmentation effects are not considered the model can apply to any spatial extent provided that the pollinators and hence the fragments of semi natural habitat that host them are distributed in such a way that pollinators have access to the whole landscape or that pollinators are not spatially restricted in their foraging patterns therefore the spatial extent can vary from roughly 5 10 ha typical arable field in europe to any larger scale provided pollinators are not aggregated in a small part of the landscape the model studies three ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes crop yield per unit of agricultural area crop production at the landscape scale and biodiversity and describes mechanistically the trade offs between these ecosystem services in intensive agricultural landscapes montoya et al 2019 this model is a useful first approximation to studying the crop production in agroecosystems as it successfully reproduces empirical observations on the stability of pollination dependent crop yield garibaldi et al 2011a deguines et al 2014 and it provides rigorous theoretical foundations for previously hypothesized functional relationships between the magnitude of ecosystem services and landscape composition braat and ten brink 2008 model dynamics are governed by two key parameters the degree of pollination dependence of crops which we vary to represent different crop types see appendix a and environmental and demographic stochasticity here we analyse the effects of these parameters on the best landscape composition associated with each stakeholder s demand a complete description of the model the model equations and the estimation of model parameters is provided in appendix a 2 2 stakeholders and management scenarios we use our model to investigate how different stakeholders demands determine the best landscape compositions in agricultural landscapes beneficiaries or stakeholders for ecosystem services include individuals cooperatives corporations non governmental organisations and the public sector to illustrate our approach we analysed three main groups of stakeholders individual farmers agricultural unions and conservationists and identify three ecosystem services valued by those stakeholders most crop yield per area of their cultivated land crop production at the landscape scale landscape production and biodiversity scenarios 1 3 we use this example as a case study to determine the best landscape compositions for each different stakeholder demands and how they affect the magnitude of the various ecosystems services best landscape composition is defined as the range of fraction of semi natural habitat within which the targeted level of a given ecosystem service is achieved additionally we define a fourth scenario where no single ecosystem service is prioritized this scenario targets the highest possible provision of the three ecosystem services described above i e multifunctionality scenario 4 and it can be viewed as a social average scenario beyond the specific demands of the individual stakeholders the social average scenario follows the idea that a challenge for the future is to design landscapes that are beneficial for a range of functions shellhorn et al 2008 stakeholders may demand a minimum amount of ecosystem service provision e g protecting 75 of biodiversity or producing 80 of crop biomass this is accounted for in our model by incorporating function thresholds a function threshold is defined as the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder i e how much of the maximum possible value of that ecosystem service given by model simulations a given stakeholder is willing to accept the best landscape compositions within the agricultural landscape are likely to change if stakeholders assume higher or lower thresholds of their demanded ecosystem service thus considering function thresholds is useful for identifying potential trade offs and for balancing various demands for services 2 3 analytical protocol we follow a four step process summarized in fig 2 first for each fraction of semi natural habitat we run model simulations to obtain the frequency distribution for each ecosystem service after 1000 time steps landscape production is used as an example fig 2a this is performed for the whole range of semi natural habitat 0 100 to obtain the frequency distribution of landscape production as a function of semi natural habitat fig 2b the strength of this approach lies in its ability to explore the full probability distribution of ecosystem service values as well as the possibility of setting thresholds values for services see carnus et al 2014 for the justification of this approach absolute thresholds for ecosystem services are generally lacking so we look at the best landscape compositions that provide a given proportion of the maximum ecosystem service value along the range of semi natural habitat appendix b provides an alternative application of the approach using absolute ecosystem service values using the median values of the frequency distributions we calculate the best landscape composition where median landscape production is above a certain of its maximum value i e function threshold this is performed for all levels of crop pollination dependence i e for a wide range of crop types to show the best landscape composition as a function of crop pollination dependence fig 2c we use median values because they are the most frequent values besides median values are robust to non gaussian distributions which are increasingly typical when stochasticity is high using any other quantile yields qualitatively similar results appendix b next we address the effects of each stakeholder s demand on the other ecosystem services for each stakeholder scenarios 1 3 we set the function threshold of the ecosystem service they demand to 95 i e agricultural unions demand 95 of landscape production the demand established by the function threshold is satisfied within a certain range of semi natural habitat fig 2d which is used to determine the corresponding provision of the other ecosystem services fig 2d for the social average scenario scenario 4 we apply a maximin approach a common method of performing multi objective optimization solteiro pires et al 2005 for general multi criteria decision analysis see also huang et al 2011 mendoza and martins 2006 this method selects the best landscape composition that maximises within the set of three ecosystem services the provision of the least provisioned one in sum this protocol produces the best landscape compositions for different stakeholders demands scenarios 1 4 crop types degrees of pollination dependence of crops and function thresholds and explores the effects of such demands on other ecosystem services finally we compare the best landscape compositions obtained by our model with current management of agricultural landscapes our search for actual policies targeting specific fractions of semi natural habitat within agricultural landscapes yielded only one result the european union green policy which aims at preserving 5 of semi natural elements at the farm level pe er et al 2014 additionally we assessed two conservation policies focused on terrestrial ecosystems the 2020 aichi biodiversity targets abt global biodiversity outlook 2014 and the brazilian forest code bfc soares filho et al 2014 analyses were performed in r software r version 3 6 0 r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 best landscape compositions for each stakeholder the best landscape composition depends on stakeholders demands and thus on which ecosystem service is prioritized in general the best landscape compositions for individual farmers and conservationists were associated with higher fractions of semi natural habitat whereas agricultural unions demands were achieved at lower fractions of semi natural habitat for intermediate levels of crop pollination dependence and median values of stochasticity prioritizing individual farmers demands yields intermediate to high fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3 a while this favors biodiversity conservation landscape production is highly variable 1 69 figs 3a and 4 b whereas total production at landscape scale depends on both yields i e related to semi natural habitat and crop land the trade off between crop yields per area and total production at the landscape scale is explained because yields per unit area increase with more pollinator supply which in turn increases with semi natural land agricultural unions goal to maximize landscape production occurs at low intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3b this leads to relatively high levels of individual farmers demands but conservationists goals may not be fulfilled as biodiversity would remain at intermediate levels figs 3b and 4 b more biodiversity remains at higher fractions of semi natural habitat fig 3c and it is positively correlated with high levels of crop yield per area reconciling conservationists demands and farmers profitability figs 3c and 4 b conversely landscape production would be low 0 24 revealing a trade off between conservationists and agricultural unions demands finally the social average scenario corresponds to intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat 39 fig 3d yielding 79 of the function threshold for all three ecosystem services which can be considered as indicative of a highly multifunctional agricultural landscape 3 2 effects of crop type stochasticity and function thresholds on landscape composition the best landscape compositions and the trade offs and synergies between stakeholders demands strongly depend on three factors crop pollination dependence the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity and the function threshold of ecosystem services i e the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder 3 2 1 crop pollination dependence higher pollination dependence of crops shifts the best landscape compositions to higher fractions of semi natural habitat for individual farmers and agricultural unions fig 5 intermediate stochasticity for increasing levels of pollination dependence crop yield per area and total landscape production require more pollinators and hence semi natural habitat thus compatibility between conservationists and individual farmers demands increases with the level of pollination dependence of crops compatibility of union and conservationist demands improves as well given their ranges move closer yet they do not overlap conservationists and agricultural unions goals cannot however be reconciled for any type of crop if both stakeholders target 95 of their most valued ecosystem service only at low levels of crop pollination dependence can agricultural unions and individual farmers coincide in their best landscape composition but this leads to low biodiversity levels fig 4 a for the social average scenario the fraction of semi natural habitat increases with crop pollination dependence this mainly driven by the dependency of landscape production and crop yield per area on wild pollination 3 2 2 stochasticity a higher stochasticity increases the fraction of semi natural habitat that meets individual farmers demands but it decreases the best fraction of semi natural habitat for agricultural unions especially for animal pollinated crops fig 5b c revealing a trade off between the two stakeholders in general a high stochasticity only slightly reduces the compatibility between farmers and conservationists but it completely decouples demands of individual farmers and agricultural unions the latter is due to a large reduction in the fraction of semi natural habitat to meet agricultural unions demands when stochasticity is high together with an increment of the fraction of semi natural habitat for farmers goals the social average scenario is met at intermediate fractions of semi natural habitat 30 5 39 and 45 for different crop types but high stochasticity reduces that fraction to lower values 28 5 29 5 and 31 because of changes in agricultural unions demands we found a greater effect of environmental compared to demographic stochasticity of crops and wild pollinators in determining changes in the best landscape compositions appendix c fig c 1 3 2 3 function threshold compatibility among stakeholders demands increases with diminishing function thresholds i e the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder fig e1 lower function thresholds expand the range of semi natural habitat associated with the best landscape composition of each stakeholder this increases the overlap in the best landscape composition of different stakeholders compatibility of stakeholders demands with varying function thresholds is higher for intermediate and high levels of crop pollination dependence 4 discussion an efficient sustainable design of agricultural systems is a major challenge of our time and the integration of various services and stakeholders is crucial to meet that challenge our model is a useful first approximation to studying the crop production in agroecosystems as it has been shown to successfully reproduce empirical observations on the stability of pollination dependent crop yield garibaldi et al 2011a deguines et al 2014 and it provides rigorous theoretical foundations for previously hypothesized functional relationships between the magnitude of ecosystem services and landscape composition braat and ten brink 2008 this study adds to the large body of literature on how to make management decisions involving multiple objectives including multi criteria decision analyses based on multiple valued outcomes e g see reviews by huang et al 2011 mendoza and martins 2006 and studies addressing the role of ecosystem trade offs and the role of demand of multiple stakeholders landis 2017 cavender bares et al 2015 palacios agundez et al 2015 yahdjian et al 2015 burkhard et al 2012 and highlights the importance of considering the multifaceted nature in the supply of and demand for ecosystem services further our model assesses the potential effects of global change on ecosystem services thus explicitly including food stability in ecosystem service research cruz garcia et al 2016 our simple case study model of three ecosystem services and three groups of stakeholders contributes to develop a general understanding of the balance of biodiversity and crop production and of the various stakeholders in intensively managed agricultural systems based on landscape composition our results reveal trade offs and compatibilities between stakeholders demands that mirror those observed in the supply side indicating that prioritization of individual stakeholders demands has consequences on the other services and on ecosystem multifunctionality such trade offs strongly depend on factors seldom considered by management policies including the degree of pollination dependence of crops and the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity the best landscape compositions measured as the fraction of semi natural habitat within the agricultural landscape differ among stakeholders in general individual farmers and conservationists demands are associated with higher fractions of semi natural habitat whereas agricultural unions demands are achieved at lower fractions of semi natural habitat this trade off in the ecosystem service demand between agricultural unions on one hand and individual farmers and conservationists on the other hand implies that management focusing on single stakeholders will invariably reduce multifunctionality in agricultural systems at least for the three services considered in this study but the best landscape composition is not a static figure rather it depends on the same factors that determine trade offs in the provision of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes montoya et al 2019 crop type defined here as the degree to which a crop depends on animal pollination is a main driver of the best landscape composition for both individual farmers and agricultural unions although the three major crops in terms of biomass are independent of animal pollination wheat rice corn the cultivated area of pollination dependent crops is expanding faster than the area of pollinator independent crops aizen and harder 2009 breeze et al 2014 a higher pollination dependence of crops e g most fruit crops such as prunus spp malus spp watermelon cucurbita spp generally shifts the best landscape composition to larger fractions of semi natural habitat irrespective of the stakeholder considered yet to our knowledge this shift is not taken into account by actual policies for low levels of pollination dependence of crops and crops independent of animal pollination prioritizing agricultural unions demands increases landscape production but reduces farmers benefits and harms biodiversity significantly however with increasing dependence of crops on animal pollination the best landscape composition involves larger fractions of semi natural habitat which results in better biodiversity conservation combined with farmers profitability but does not satisfy agricultural unions demands because agriculture worldwide is becoming more pollinator dependent over time breeze et al 2014 aizen et al 2009 changes in the best landscape compositions driven by crop pollination dependence are highly relevant in the global context current global change enhances the inter annual variance of several climate variables i e environmental stochasticity giorgi et al 2001 li and xian 2003 saltz et al 2006 as shown by the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events such as floods heat waves and droughts fischer et al 2016 woodward et al 2016 craven et al 2016 these events may in turn increase environmental stochasticity of crops and wild pollinators and there is evidence that climate trends are partly responsible for observed increases in yield variability iizumi and ramankutty 2016 osborne and wheeler 2013 and influence the delivery of ecosystem services shoyama and yamagata 2014 ding et al 2016 martinez harms et al 2017 our results suggest that increasing stochasticity has contrasting effects on the best landscape composition for different stakeholders individual farmers demands are generally met at higher fractions of semi natural habitat when stochasticity is high whereas the opposite holds true for agricultural unions such differences are driven by the different effects of stochasticity on the provision of ecosystem services more specifically high stochasticity changes the relationship between ecosystem services and semi natural habitat on one hand the unimodal relationship of landscape production reported elsewhere braat and ten brink 2008 montoya et al 2019 becomes monotonically decreasing for high stochasticity appendix c fig c 1 and this shifts maximum landscape production to lower fractions of semi natural habitat on the other hand the saturating relationship of crop yield per area becomes flat when stochasticity is high appendix c fig c 2 thus constraining the range of semi natural habitat that maximizes farmers profitability agricultural management should thus consider global change predictions as changes in stochasticity directly influence the best landscape compositions that maximize stakeholders demands the demands of individual farmers and conservationists generally align at higher fractions of semi natural habitat therefore the farmers best interest is that despite how much farmed is their land the landscape around their cultivated land is not farmed this is consistent with empirical research in grassland ecosystems showing that higher levels of biodiversity are beneficial for landowners binder et al 2018 but contrasts with recent trends in modern agriculture where individual farmers tend to increase crop land at the expense of semi natural habitat and thus biodiversity we identify various reasons to explain the discrepancy between the individual farmers demand defined in our study and their actual demand first crops whose production does not depend on wild pollination do not require semi natural habitat in this case farmers tend to expand crop area second wild pollinators might suffer from the tragedy of the commons where wild pollinators are the commons and farmers deplete semi natural habitat through their collective action also farmers actions may reflect a not in my back yard nimby phenomenon finally the importance of wild pollinators inhabiting non crop areas for crop production pollination of crop plants might be underestimated our results suggest that a reduction in the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept i e function thresholds is a necessary condition to reconcile various stakeholders demands fig 3d fig e1 this is because lower function thresholds expand the range of semi natural habitat increasing the overlap in the best landscape composition for different stakeholders indeed this idea underpins the social average scenario which suggests that overall performance of agricultural landscapes can be improved by combining multiple demands for ecosystem services as opposed to a traditional focus constrained by provisioning services mainly total landscape production lovell and johnston 2009 jordan and warner 2010 our results suggest that prioritizing multifunctional landscapes achieves relatively high levels of the three ecosystem services analysed and satisfies stakeholders demands for intermediate amounts of semi natural habitat further the social average scenario is more robust to changes in crop type and stochasticity figs 4 and 5 and appendix c fig c 1 therefore management of agricultural systems for multifunctionality may better align with the increasing consensus supporting the need for agricultural landscapes to simultaneously provide ecosystem services that guarantee food security livelihood opportunities and biodiversity conservation i e ecosystem service multifunctionality manning et al 2018 our findings suggest that unless the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept is reduced the proportion of semi natural habitat that conservation policies aim to protect lies below the best landscape composition in intensively managed agricultural systems especially for high levels of crop pollination dependence the eu green policy succeeds in achieving high levels of landscape production agricultural unions demand of crops that do not depend much on animal pollination although this leads to low biodiversity levels figs 5 d1 e1 similar conclusions can be drawn for the aichi biodiversity targets now implemented in the eu biodiversity strategy and the brazilian forest code although they target higher fractions of semi natural habitat 17 and 20 respectively therefore the regional and global scale policies analyzed here satisfy agricultural unions demands in one scenario only that is when crops depend little or not at all on animal pollination although it leads to low biodiversity levels by and large preserving 5 20 of semi natural habitat lies below the best landscape composition for biodiversity and crop production in intensively managed agricultural systems for any other combination of stakeholders demands considered here crop type or stochasticity such policies also fail to meet the social average scenario under the current trends of increasing pollinator dependence of agriculture and global change such targets seem too low to either meet stakeholders demands or achieve adequate sustainable levels of multifunctionality in agricultural systems social average scenario designing more sustainable ways of food production is thus a challenge for the future of intensive farming systems in the context of global change 4 1 future research our model is a useful starting point for future research a future extension of our model would be to analyze other farming types e g organic and wildlife friendly farming where pollinator diversity may thrive to some extent within crop land and the best landscape compositions may not be necessarily similar to those of intensively managed agricultural systems clough et al 2011 also metrics other than landscape composition could be used complementarily e g agrochemical inputs to compare management scenarios in agricultural systems besides the spatial configuration of seminatural habitat is expected to determine ecosystem service flows between crop land and seminatural habitat garibaldi et al 2011b mitchell et al 2015 and this may affect the best landscape compositions of organisms with narrow foraging ranges we plan to include more realistic patterns of landscape fragmentation to assess the generality of the results presented here additionally we have illustrated our approach using three ecosystem services and three groups of stakeholders as a case study however agricultural landscapes include a greater variety of ecosystem services water quality pest control soil conditions nutrient cycling flood mitigation as well as recreational and aesthetic services and stakeholders whose demands may partially overlap e g farmers may not only favor crop yield per area but also a minimum amount of crop land a wider consideration of ecosystem services will likely reveal additional trade offs and synergies among services such as between different provisioning services timber vs crop yield rapidel et al 2015 and between provisioning and regulating services crop yield vs water quality crop yield vs development of fungal diseases long term soil fertility vs immediate crop production stosch et al 2017 rapidel et al 2015 see klapwijk et al 2014 and references therein such additional trade offs may affect the best landscape compositions future work will thus benefit from assessing a greater representation of ecosystem services determining the overall performance of agricultural landscapes and of stakeholders 4 2 conclusions the future of intensive farming systems in the context of global change is a key component of the 2017 un sustainable development goals our analysis of three ecosystem services related to biodiversity and crop production and three groups of stakeholders shows that the best landscape composition differs among stakeholders and that current policies should start to consider factors such as crop type stochasticity and the amount of an ecosystem service that stakeholders are willing to accept as they can strongly influence these best landscape compositions for different stakeholders management for social average or multifunctionality scenario may be a better option for food security livelihood opportunities and biodiversity conservation thus meeting various stakeholders demands these results are relevant given the worldwide trends in agriculture more pollinator dependent over time and global change associated with the strength of environmental and

24926,the trojan y chromosome tyc strategy is a promising eradication method that attempts to manipulate the female to male ratio to promote the reduction of the population of an invasive species the manipulation stems from an introduction of sex reversed males called supermales into an ecosystem the offspring of the supermales is guaranteed to be male mathematical models have shown that the population can be driven to extinction with a continuous supply of supermales in this paper a new model of the tyc strategy is introduced and analyzed that includes two important modeling characteristics that are neglected in all previous models first the new model includes intraspecies competition for mates second a strong allee effect is included several conclusions about the strategy via optimal control are established these results have large scale implications for the biological control of invasive species keywords trojan y chromosome invasive species population dynamics optimal control allee effect 1 introduction the detrimental effects of aquatic invasive species is well documented arim et al 2006 averill and lou 2012 bampfylde and lewis 2007 clark et al 2001 lou and munther 2012 myers et al 2000 okubo et al 1989 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 van driesche and bellows 1996 subsequently a tremendous amount of effort by habitat controllers is devoted to designing effective eradication strategies such as chemical treatment local harvesting dewatering ichthyocides or a suitable combination schofield and loftus 2015 however these methods are known to negatively impact ecosystems which may be already stressed by the presence of an aquatic invasive species schofield and loftus 2015 the trojan y chromosome strategy tyc is a new eradication strategy which circumvents many of the known negative ecological impacts due to current practice gutierrez and teem 2006 schofield and loftus 2015 teem et al 2013 tyc strategy involves an introduction of a sex reversed male the off spring of the sex reversed male called a supermale with a wild type female is guaranteed to be male therefore subsequent generations become male dominant and this skews the sex ratio towards more males the goal is that through the gradual reduction in the female population extinction of the population may occur see fig 1 the supermale is not a genetically modified organism gmo and the tyc process is reversible that is if the introduction of supermales is stopped then the supermale population will die out schill et al 2017 the tyc strategy has seen tremendous experimental and theoretical interest cotton and wedekind 2007a 2007b 2009 gutierrez et al 2012 kennedy et al 2018 parshad 2011 parshad and gutierrez 2011 2010 parshad et al 2013 perrin 2009 schill et al 2016 teem et al 2013 wang et al 2016 2014 zhao et al 2012 the classical population model of the tyc strategy relates the populations of the wild type xx females f wild type xy males m and the yy supermale s populations over time a mathematical model was first proposed by gutierrez and teem 2006 teem et al 2013 1 f 1 2 β l fm δ f 2 m 1 2 β l fm β l fs δ m 3 s μ δ s where l 1 f m s k k is the carrying capacity β is the birth rate δ is the death rate and μ is the constant introduction rate the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative due to the nonlinearities it is not necessary to assume that β δ 0 to obtain a persistent invasive population it was shown in teem et al 2013 that there exists a μ such that for all μ μ 0 that f m 0 in infinite time in the current manuscript we seek to include two important and relevant modeling features first the influx of supermales leads to competition between wild males and supermales for female mates second if the female population is below a given threshold then the population loses fitness and extinction should occur drake and kramer 2011 kramer 2009 this latter phenomena is called the allee effect these two modeling features are introduced in section 2 a stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions is also included in section 2 in section 3 we then investigate the influence that intraspecies competition and the allee effect have on the optimal introduction rate that minimizes an objective function based on the total wild population and introduced super males a stochastic model is introduced to examine the influence of noise on the birth and death rates have on the objective function s value at the optimal introduction rate 2 modified tyc model with strong allee effect in this paper we investigate and propose a new model of the tyc strategy namely 4 f 1 2 β l f α 1 ρ 1 m s fm δ f 5 m 1 2 β l f α 1 ρ 1 m s fm β l f α 1 ρ 2 m s fs δ m 6 s μ δ s where l μ β and δ are as before again the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative and that β δ 0 that is the birth supercedes the death rate intraspecies competition between wild male and supermale populations for female mates is modeled through the nonnegative saturation term ρ 1 m s m m s ρ 2 m s s m s the saturation terms provide the percentage of the total male population that is either wild type or supermale clearly the range of the saturations term is 0 1 notice for a fixed wild type population as s then ρ 1 0 and ρ 2 1 in this situation the birth of females approaches zero while male offspring only occurs from female and supermale progeny likewise for a fixed supermale population as m then ρ 1 1 and ρ 2 0 subsequently male progeny only occurs from wild type male and female mating therefore ρ 1 and ρ 2 attempt to model the difficulty of wild type female finding suitable mates from either wild type or supermale populations the term f α 1 models a strong allee effect and represents a loss of fitness in the female population when below the allee threshold α this effect models the problem of undercrowding of a species and was first motivated by observations made by allee in 1927 allee 1927 1931 odum and allee 1954 since then numerous evidences of this effect have been established kramer 2009 stephens and sutherlan 1999 notice that when f α 1 0 then f 0 provided l 0 therefore the female population will decrease toward extinction subsequently a goal of the tyc strategy is to push via the introduction of supermales the female population below the allee threshold in the forthcoming analysis the equations are rescaled the populations are scaled by the carrying capacity while the t is scaled by the deathrate that is t t δ the rescaled equations are 7 f r l f a 1 m m s fm f 8 m r lf m s f a 1 m 2 2 s 2 m 9 s γ s where l 1 f m s r k β 2 δ 1 a α k 1 and γ μ k δ 2 1 equilibria and stability analysis a clear requirement of a valid intervention strategy is that in the absence of the strategy the invasive population would persist while if the intervention strategy was employed then control ideally extinction of the invasive species would be established therefore an effective tyc strategy is one that provides an introduction rate γ t and initial supermale population s 0 such that the wild population is driven to extinction while in the supermale free case the population would persist it is clear that the modified model exhibits the equilibrium solution 0 0 γ which is deemed the extinction state once f a the introduction rate of supermales γ should be set zero causing s 0 as a result a clear requirement of a successful tyc strategy is that there exists some time for which the female population is below the alee threshold that is f a in the forthcoming equilibrium analysis we are interested in equilibrium solutions in the situation where γ 0 obviously when γ 0 then in equilibrium s 0 therefore the intraspecies terms ρ 1 m 0 1 and ρ 2 m 0 0 in such case f r l f a 1 m 1 0 m r l f a 1 f 1 0 we seek to analyze the stability and presence of nontrivial equilibrium solutions noting that in equilibrium f a 1 0 then m f 1 rl f a 1 hence all equilibrium solutions fall on the line f m the nontrivial equilibrium solutions are roots to the third degree polynomial 10 g f 2 f 3 2 a 1 f 2 a f a r by descartes rule of signs there always exists a one negative real root which is neglected since this is not realistic in addition there are either two or zero positive real roots if there are zero positive real roots then the only equilibrium solution is the extinction state and is globally attracting in such case the tyc strategy is not necessary therefore we assume there are two real roots f 1 and f 2 where 0 f 1 f 2 the jacobian of our system of equations is j κ μ 1 κ c κ μ κ 1 c 0 0 1 where κ 1 2 f f 1 f a r f 2 1 f a r c 1 2 f f 1 f a r f 2 1 f a r μ 1 2 f f 2 r a clearly λ 3 1 is an eigenvalue which indicates exponentially decay in the supermale population the remaining two eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation of the submatrix j 33 namely λ 1 2 tr j 33 tr j 33 2 4 det j 33 2 1 2 κ μ 1 to investigate the sign of λ 2 we recall that f i is a root of eq 10 this fact is used to determine an expression for λ 2 as a function of f i λ 2 f i 3 2 f i r 2 1 a f i 2 r notice that this function is a concave down quadratic with a maximum location located at f 1 2 1 a 0 define f as the positive root of the quadratic function λ 2 f then λ 2 0 if f i f and λ 2 0 if f i f notice that λ 2 1 3 r a since a 1 implies that r a 1 then λ 2 1 0 subsequently we have 0 f 1 notice that g 0 g 1 0 now g f 0 provided that q r a r 2 16 a 3 a r 4 a 3 r a r 3 6 a a r 4 a 2 a r 3 6 a a r 2 3 6 a 2 a r a r a r 3 6 a a r 0 fig 2 shows the region where q r a 0 and q r a 0 while the allee threshold is difficult to know precisely for any biological system drake and kramer 2011 it is reasonable to expect values less than 5 of the carrying capacity drake and kramer 2011 odum and allee 1954 in such case g f 0 then by the intermediate value theorem we have f 1 f f 2 subsequently f 1 f 1 0 and f 2 f 2 0 are a saddle and a sink respectively we call f 2 f 2 0 the sustained state an effective tyc strategy will push populations away from the sustained state and toward the basin of attraction of the extinction state 3 optimal control analysis 3 1 optimal control analysis the goal of this section is to investigate the mechanisms in our tyc system of equations that if controlled could lead to optimal levels of both densities we assume that the scaled introduction rate γ is not known a priori and enter the system as a time dependent control such that 0 γ t consider the objective function j 0 γ 0 t f m 1 2 γ 2 dt subject to the governing eqs 7 9 and initial conditions optimal strategies are derived for the objective function where we minimize both female and male populations while also minimizing the introduction rate γ optimal controls are searched for within the set u 0 namely u 0 γ γ measurable 0 γ t 0 t t the goal is to seek an optimal γ t such that 11 j 0 γ max γ 0 t f m 1 2 γ 2 dt we use the pontryagin s maximum principle to derive the necessary conditions on the optimal control lenhart and workman 2007 the hamiltonian for j 0 is given by h 0 f m 1 2 γ 2 λ 1 f λ 2 m λ 3 s we use the hamiltonian to find a differential equation of the adjoint λ i i 1 2 3 namely λ 1 t λ 2 r m 2 2 s 2 m s f f a 1 2 f a 1 f m s 1 λ 1 m 2 r m s f f a 1 2 f a 1 f m s 1 1 1 λ 2 t f a 1 λ 1 fmr m s m 2 f m s 1 m f m s 1 m s λ 2 fr m 2 2 s 2 m s λ 2 fr f m s 1 m s 2 m m 2 2 s 2 m s 1 λ 3 t f a 1 fr m s λ 2 f m s 1 4 s m 2 2 s 2 m s m 2 2 s 2 λ 1 m 2 m 2 f m s 1 m s λ 3 with the transversality condition given by λ 1 t λ 2 t λ 3 t 0 in consideration of the optimality conditions the hamiltonian function is differentiated with respect to control variable γ resulting in h γ λ 3 γ a compact way of writing the optimal control γ is γ t max 0 λ 3 3 2 numerical simulations in this section we will numerically simulate the optimal control for the modified tyc model with strong allee effect the following unscaled parameters used for simulation are provided from a least squares approximation of population experiments of guppy fish in lyu et al 2019 namely β 0 0057 δ 0 0648 k 405 α 24 and time interval of 0 200 in scaled variables r 17 8125 a 06 0 t 12 96 in fig 3 the numerically determined optimal γ t is shown in conjunction with the scaled populations using the optimal control γ t this indicates that a gradual reduction in the introduction rate of the supermales is ideal with the highest introduction rate at the beginning of the intervention program as a basis of comparison the optimal μ in unscaled variables for the classical model was determined in lyu et al 2019 see fig 5 which is shown in fig 4 in scaled variables for convenience in such case a larger objective function value at the optimal introduction rate is discovered in the absence of intraspecies competition and a strong allee effect in particular the objective values in absolute value for the classical and modified models are 501 9203 and 315 1675 respectively the reduced value of the objective function in the modified model is clear by inspection of the plots of the integrands of the corresponding objective functions given in fig 5 therefore the inclusion of intraspecies competition and the allee effect greatly influence the overall cost of the tyc strategy and indicate the strategy is less costly than previously considered in lyu et al 2019 in the case of the tyc model that includes intraspecies competition for mates and does not consider the allee effect obtains an objective value of 381 3074 which is still considerably lower than the classical model likewise the model that includes the allee effect but no intraspecies competition obtains an objective value of 390 3713 however this suggests that intraspecies competition for mates has a greater influence on the choice of γ than the allee effect in fig 6 we examine the influence of increasing the value of the dimensionless variable r as r increases we see that optimal control is maintains the same overall shape in particular the initial introduction remains the same however the initial drop in the introduction rate is less severe in the case of higher reproductive rates 3 3 stochastic model sensitivity analysis there are numerous environmental influences that may cause perturbations to the birth and death rates of the invasive species here we assume that β and δ fluctuate around average values gray et al 2011 zhang and men 2018 therefore the birth and death rates may be treated as random variables such that β β σ β w β and δ δ σ δ w δ zhang and men 2018 namely 12 df β l f α 1 m m s fm δ f dt σ β f α 1 m m s fm dw β σ δ f dw δ 13 dm β lf m s f α 1 m 2 2 s 2 δ m dt σ β lf m s f α 1 m 2 2 s 2 dw β σ δ m dw δ 14 ds μ δ s dt σ δ s dw δ where w β and w δ are independent brownian motions with intensities σ β and σ δ respectively here we examine the influence of noise on the objective value in simulations with the optimal control given fig 5 the noise on the birth dβ and death dδ rates are taken from a normal distribution an euler maruyama method is employed to determine a numerical solution to the stochastic model in each simulation we determine the objective function value eq 11 and compare the percent difference between the objective function value determined in the case of no noise the results for increasing percent noise are shown in fig 7 a linear regression through the bounds of 95 confidence intervals at each noise level is shown as a reference notice that for large amount of noise in the death and birth rates that the objective function is no more than 8 away from the no noise situation the slopes of the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals are relatively small and subsequently means that the value of objective function is changed only slightly for perturbations in the birth and death rates this provides experimental evidence that the determined optimal introduction rate is fairly robust to noise or perturbations to the death and birth rates 4 conclusions and future work the mathematical analysis and improvement of models of the tyc eradication strategy are essential to understanding the efficacy of the strategy as a control this is especially important in light of recent field studies of reproductivity and survivability of introduced trojan supermale populations of brook trout salvelinus fontinalis in the big lost river basin in south central idaho kennedy et al 2018 in this paper a modification to the classical model of the tyc strategy is proposed that includes intraspecies competition between males and supermales for female mates and a strong allee effect in the female population it is shown that the dynamical system may exhibit an extinction and recovery equilibrium solutions for realistic parameter values of the carrying capacity and birth and death rates in such case the equilibrium solutions are shown to be asymptotically stable and hence the goal of an effective tyc strategy is to push the wild type populations toward the basin of attraction of the extinction state an optimal introduction rate of supermales is determined through optimal control theory and was chosen to minimize an objective function that measures the total amount of wild population and introduced supermales the optimal introduction rate for the classical model was given in lyu et al 2019 here we compare the influence of including the intraspecies competition for mates and the allee effect on the optimal introduction rate it is determined that the optimal introduction rate yields a significantly smaller objective function value as compared to the classical model this suggests that it is important to include intraspecies competition and the allee effect to appropriately determine the overall cost of the tyc eradication strategy in addition this indicates that the overall cost of the strategy is smaller than previously predicted lyu et al 2019 lastly a stochastic model is proposed to investigate the influence of noise in the birth and death rates on the objective function s value these results show the sensitivity in the objective function s value in light of perturbations to the birth and death rates numerical results indicate that the optimal introduction rate is indeed robust to noise in the birth and death rate hence the optimal introduction rate is not greatly influenced by noise or perturbations in death and birth rates conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest acknowledgements jl and rp

24926,the trojan y chromosome tyc strategy is a promising eradication method that attempts to manipulate the female to male ratio to promote the reduction of the population of an invasive species the manipulation stems from an introduction of sex reversed males called supermales into an ecosystem the offspring of the supermales is guaranteed to be male mathematical models have shown that the population can be driven to extinction with a continuous supply of supermales in this paper a new model of the tyc strategy is introduced and analyzed that includes two important modeling characteristics that are neglected in all previous models first the new model includes intraspecies competition for mates second a strong allee effect is included several conclusions about the strategy via optimal control are established these results have large scale implications for the biological control of invasive species keywords trojan y chromosome invasive species population dynamics optimal control allee effect 1 introduction the detrimental effects of aquatic invasive species is well documented arim et al 2006 averill and lou 2012 bampfylde and lewis 2007 clark et al 2001 lou and munther 2012 myers et al 2000 okubo et al 1989 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 van driesche and bellows 1996 subsequently a tremendous amount of effort by habitat controllers is devoted to designing effective eradication strategies such as chemical treatment local harvesting dewatering ichthyocides or a suitable combination schofield and loftus 2015 however these methods are known to negatively impact ecosystems which may be already stressed by the presence of an aquatic invasive species schofield and loftus 2015 the trojan y chromosome strategy tyc is a new eradication strategy which circumvents many of the known negative ecological impacts due to current practice gutierrez and teem 2006 schofield and loftus 2015 teem et al 2013 tyc strategy involves an introduction of a sex reversed male the off spring of the sex reversed male called a supermale with a wild type female is guaranteed to be male therefore subsequent generations become male dominant and this skews the sex ratio towards more males the goal is that through the gradual reduction in the female population extinction of the population may occur see fig 1 the supermale is not a genetically modified organism gmo and the tyc process is reversible that is if the introduction of supermales is stopped then the supermale population will die out schill et al 2017 the tyc strategy has seen tremendous experimental and theoretical interest cotton and wedekind 2007a 2007b 2009 gutierrez et al 2012 kennedy et al 2018 parshad 2011 parshad and gutierrez 2011 2010 parshad et al 2013 perrin 2009 schill et

supermale s populations over time a mathematical model was first proposed by gutierrez and teem 2006 teem et al 2013 1 f 1 2 β l fm δ f 2 m 1 2 β l fm β l fs δ m 3 s μ δ s where l 1 f m s k k is the carrying capacity β is the birth rate δ is the death rate and μ is the constant introduction rate the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative due to the nonlinearities it is not necessary to assume that β δ 0 to obtain a persistent invasive population it was shown in teem et al 2013 that there exists a μ such that for all μ μ 0 that f m 0 in infinite time in the current manuscript we seek to include two important and relevant modeling features first the influx of supermales leads to competition between wild males and supermales for female mates second if the female population is below a given threshold then the population loses fitness and extinction should occur drake and kramer 2011 kramer 2009 this latter phenomena is called the allee effect these two modeling features are introduced in section 2 a stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions is also included in section 2 in section 3 we then investigate the influence that intraspecies competition and the allee effect have on the optimal introduction rate that minimizes an objective function based on the total wild population and introduced super males a stochastic model is introduced to examine the influence of noise on the birth and death rates have on the objective function s value at the optimal introduction rate 2 modified tyc model with strong allee effect in this paper we investigate and propose a new model of the tyc strategy namely 4 f 1 2 β l f α 1 ρ 1 m s fm δ f 5 m 1 2 β l f α 1 ρ 1 m s fm β l f α 1 ρ 2 m s fs δ m 6 s μ δ s where l μ β and δ are as before again the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative and that β δ 0 that is the birth supercedes the death rate intraspecies competition between wild male and supermale populations for female mates is modeled through the nonnegative saturation term ρ 1 m s m m s ρ 2 m s s m s the saturation terms provide the percentage of the total male population that is either wild type or supermale clearly the range of the saturations term is 0 1 notice for a fixed wild type population as s then ρ 1 0 and ρ 2 1 in this situation the birth of females approaches zero while male offspring only occurs from female and supermale progeny likewise for a fixed supermale population as m then ρ 1 1 and ρ 2 0 subsequently male progeny only occurs from wild type male and female mating therefore ρ 1 and ρ 2 attempt to model the difficulty of wild type female finding suitable mates from either wild type or supermale populations the term f α 1 models a strong allee effect and represents a loss of fitness in the female population when below the allee threshold α this effect models the problem of undercrowding of a species and was first motivated by observations made by allee in 1927 allee 1927 1931 odum and allee 1954 since then numerous evidences of this effect have been established kramer 2009 stephens and sutherlan 1999 notice that when f α 1 0 then f 0 provided l 0 therefore the female population will decrease toward extinction subsequently a goal of the tyc strategy is to push via the introduction of supermales the female population below the allee threshold in the forthcoming analysis the equations are rescaled the populations are scaled by the carrying capacity while the t is scaled by the deathrate that is t t δ the rescaled equations are 7 f r l f a 1 m m s

absence of the strategy the invasive population would persist while if the intervention strategy was employed then control ideally extinction of the invasive species would be established therefore an effective tyc strategy is one that provides an introduction rate γ t and initial supermale population s 0 such that the wild population is driven to extinction while in the supermale free case the population would persist it is clear that the modified model exhibits the equilibrium solution 0 0 γ which is deemed the extinction state once f a the introduction rate of supermales γ should be set

equilibrium analysis we are interested in equilibrium solutions in the situation where γ 0 obviously when γ 0 then in equilibrium s 0 therefore the intraspecies terms ρ 1 m 0 1 and ρ 2 m 0 0 in such case f r l f a 1 m 1 0 m r l f a 1 f 1 0 we seek to analyze the stability and presence of nontrivial equilibrium solutions noting that in equilibrium f a 1 0 then m f 1 rl f a 1 hence all equilibrium

24927,harmful algal blooms habs are a growing concern in the west florida shelf wfs region an ecopath with ecosim ewe model of the wfs explicitly simulating habs was previously developed to illuminate the potential impacts of blooms of the dinoflagellate karenia brevis colloquially referred to as red tides on the wfs ecosystem however the diet matrix of the ecopath component of this ewe model referred to as wfs hab ecopath was based largely on sparse cursory information and not on local survey data here we revise the diet matrix of the wfs hab ecopath model using predictions of a robust statistical model that incorporates local survey data and employs the dirichlet distribution and maximum likelihood estimation the relative impacts of both the revised diet matrix and red tide mortality scenarios on model structure are explored by comparing four alternative wfs hab ecopath models i the base model ii a model employing the revised diet matrix iii a model with elevated red tide mortality and iv a model with both the revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality incorporating the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model had a relatively large impact on ecosystem structure i e trophic organization mortality rates trophic interaction strengths and omnivory elevated red tide mortality had virtually no impact on ecosystem structure aside from altering the contribution of fishing natural and red tide mortalities to the total mortality of functional groups however elevated red tide mortality might have meaningful implications in dynamic simulations which should be explored in future studies collectively results showed that incorporating the revised diet matrix into wfs hab ecopath which revealed a number of new predator prey linkages led to a more complex and interconnected food web specifically prey items were generally consumed by a broader variety of predators which contrasts with the base wfs hab ecopath model where many prey particularly juvenile fishes were subjected to exceedingly high predation mortality rates from specific predators the incorporation of the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model discussed herein is a fundamental step towards increasing the realism of trophic interactions in the model which is particularly important as these trophic interactions define starting conditions for dynamic simulations keywords diet matrix food web maximum likelihood estimation ecopath red tides harmful algal blooms 1 introduction the ecosystem services provided by the gulf of mexico are invaluable for

massive the lysis of k brevis cells results in the release of a neurotoxin called brevetoxin steidinger et al 1998 landsberg et al 2009 aerosolized brevetoxin can have strong negative impacts on local human communities via health issues kirkpatrick et al 2004 fleming et al 2005 moreover direct exposure to brevetoxin can alter the sodium potassium channels of aquatic vertebrates eventually leading to death kirkpatrick et al 2004 blooms of k brevis can also indirectly harm marine fauna by causing excessive hypoxia turbidity and shading okey et al 2004 landsberg et al 2009 klemas 2012 persistent blooms can result in widespread die offs of fish and other aquatic animals including protected species ultimately impacting the structure of local marine communities through trophic cascades okey et al 2004 dupont and coy 2008 landsberg et al 2009 flaherty and landsberg 2011 and reducing the catch rates of local fisheries landsberg et al 2009 driggers et al 2016 although hab events have been documented on the wfs as early as 1844 ingersoll 1881 rounsefell and nelson 1966 steidinger et al 1998 their ecosystem effects are still relatively unclear and robust strategies for coping with their economic implications remain to be established understanding habs is a top research priority in the gulf of mexico partly because there are concerns that blooms of k brevis are increasing in frequency and intensity over time brand and compton 2007 grüss et al 2017 harford et al 2018 therefore there is a need for tools designed specifically to evaluate the potential ecosystem impacts of habs to assist management and mitigation efforts heil and steidinger 2009 sophisticated ecosystem simulation models such as applications of the trophodynamic ecopath with ecosim ewe with ecospace walters et al 1999 2010 can explicitly consider a comprehensive suite of marine organisms their trophic interactions and the effects of the abiotic environment on species dynamics such models have been identified as key tools for exploring the potential ecosystem impacts of habs on the wfs grüss et al 2017 o farrell et al 2017 the ecopath component of ewe provides a static mass balance representation of a food web which serves as a starting point for dynamic modeling christensen and pauly 1992 christensen and walters 2004 the ecosim component of ewe allows one to simulate food web dynamics at monthly time steps by altering fishing mortality fishing effort and abiotic environmental forcing functions walters et al 1997 2000 finally the ecospace component of ewe allows one to simulate food web and fishing fleet dynamics and changes in the abiotic environment over time and space walters et al 2010 de mutsert et al 2016 an ewe model explicitly simulating red tides was previously developed to evaluate the ecosystem impacts of habs referred to here as wfs hab ewe okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 gray 2014 sagarese et al 2015 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 however the diet matrix of the basal component of wfs hab ewe wfs hab ecopath was developed based on reports from the florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri information provided by fishbase froese and pauly 2018 and sealifebase palomares and pauly 2018 and a variety of stomach content and feeding habit studies not necessarily specific to the wfs see okey and mahmoudi 2002 for details because much of this information was qualitative and based on expert knowledge there was a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model the diet matrix fed into sophisticated ecosystem models such as ewe with ecospace or the atlantis modeling platform fulton et al 2004 2011 has a substantial impact on the predictions of these models in particular even small changes in the biomass of prey consumed in ecosim which is based on the diet matrix defined in ecopath can result in the severe depletion of some species particularly juvenile fishes walters et al 2008 2010 therefore it is important to build a robust diet matrix for the ecopath component of ewe with ecospace models grüss et al 2017 o farrell et al 2017 fortunately detailed quantitative diet data on the wfs are now plentiful due to monitoring efforts grüss et al 2018a moreover robust statistical modeling approaches using maximum likelihood are available to estimate diet proportions for informing ecosystem models ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 the objectives of this study were to i develop a revised diet matrix for the wfs using predictions of a robust statistical model that incorporates local survey data and ii evaluate the changes in ecosystem structure for wfs hab ecopath in response to modifications including the revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality because the static ecosystem structure provided by ecopath serves as a starting point for dynamic modeling with ecosim and spatio temporal modeling with ecospace the revised diet matrix would refine the representation of the spatio temporal dynamics of red tides within the wfs and impacts on vulnerable species groups for future simulations grüss et al 2018b first we reviewed the ecopath modeling approach and the development of the base wfs hab ecopath model considered in this study i e gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 second we developed a revised diet matrix for wfs hab ecopath based on predictions from a statistical model using the dirichlet distribution fitted to empirical diet data ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 we compared this revised diet matrix to the diet matrix described in the base wfs hab ecopath model to evaluate changes in predator prey linkages prey preferences and similarities third we developed four alternative versions of the wfs hab ecopath in a factorial design with the base and revised diet matrices and low versus elevated red tide mortalities finally we compared ecosystem structure across the four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath by exploring i prebal diagnostics link 2010 2016 ii basic estimates of ecopath e g trophic levels tl and mortality rates and iii trophic metrics including mixed trophic impact indices ulanowicz and puccia 1990 trophic interaction strengths and omnivory indices pauly et al 1993 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ecopath modeling approach and the wfs hab ecopath model 2 1 1 the ecopath modeling approach ecopath is a mass balance approach for describing the trophic structure of an aquatic ecosystem christensen and pauly 1992 pauly et al 2000 in ecopath a comprehensive suite of functional groups i e groups of species that have similar trophic life history and niche characteristics are explicitly considered typically including detritus groups primary producer groups and invertebrate fish turtle seabird and mammal groups pauly et al 2000 these functional groups are represented either as single biomass pools or as multi stanza functional groups that account for ontogenetic shifts in habitat and or diet walters et al 2008 ecopath relies on two master equations that i limit loss terms to no more than that group s available production eq 1 and ii define the group s productivity with respect to its consumption and maintenance needs eq 2 christensen and walters 2004 1 p i y i b i m 2 i e i b a i m 0

efficiency of group i which represents the production of group i explicitly considered within the modeled system qi is the consumption of group i ri is the respiration of group i and ui is the

per unit of biomass dcij is the element of the diet matrix fed into ecopath that describes the proportion of group i in the diet of group j and n is the total number of groups represented in the ecopath model for each group i an ecopath model requires at least three of the following four data inputs bi p b i q b i and eei if one of these four data inputs is not provided by the user the missing data input is estimated during the mass balance process during the mass balance process ecopath estimates several quantities that are useful to characterize the structure of the modeled system such as the tl of functional groups 2 1 2 the wfs hab ecopath model the conceptual model in fig 2 summarizes the evolution of the first wfs hab ecopath model okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 to the wfs hab ecopath model considered herein gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 first the ecopath model was updated to reflect the wfs ecosystem in 2014 by reparametrizing biomass landings and productivity second functional groups not present in the first wfs hab ecopath model okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 but considered vulnerable to habs were added based on literature steidinger et al 1973 and the fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife research institute 2015 the fwri fish kill database consists of publicly reported approximate numbers and species of dead fishes seen along the wfs coast during k brevis blooms in total wfs hab ecopath explicitly considers 81 functional groups including two marine mammal groups dolphins and manatees one seabird group one turtle group 49 fish groups of which 11 are multi stanza groups representing adults and juveniles 19 invertebrate groups of which one is a multi stanza group representing adults and juveniles and four are zooplankton groups one microbial heterotroph group five autotroph groups and three detritus groups appendix table a 1 third catch per unit effort cpue time series of biomass and landings were used to reparametrize wfs hab ecopath to 1980 values i e the historical model which serves as the starting point for future dynamic simulations the historical model allowed for simulations to investigate the model s ability to recreate observed time series gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 the fourth step for updating wfs hab ecopath was the integration of hab mortality fig 2 which was accomplished using a pseudo fishing fleet referred to as the hab fleet this fleet comes in addition to the ten fishing fleets explicitly considered in wfs hab ecopath trawl recreation headboats gill trammel net spear gig hook line purse seine haul seine long line and traps the hab fleet is a discard only fleet so the biomass caught by the hab fleet is immediately cycled into the detritus pools and consequently immediately available to detritivore functional groups gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 in essence the hab fleet acts as a mortality forcing function which differs from the forcing function routine within ewe christensen et al 2008 the fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife research institute 2015 was used to determine the functional groups vulnerable to red tides and to construct an index of vulnerability to red tides for each functional group based on their prevalence in the database gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 described in detail how an index of vulnerability to red tides was developed such that the functional groups that are more numerous in the fish kill database are more strongly affected by red tides in the wfs hab ecopath model of the functional groups in wfs hab ecopath 38 correspond to species vulnerable to red tide appendix table a 2 gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 applying the mortality effect to multiple functional groups allowed for the examination of interactions their method has been employed in other studies e g sagarese et al 2017 2 2 the development of alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath to evaluate the relative effects of improved diet information and elevated red tide mortality on the static snapshot in wfs hab ecopath we developed four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath i the base wfs hab ecopath model used in gray 2014 and gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 which is fed with a highly uncertain diet matrix and represents wfs habs of 1980 a year characterized by very weak red tide events hereafter we refer to this model as the base model gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 ii a model with a revised diet matrix referred to as the revised diet model iii a model with elevated red tide mortality referred to as the elevated hab mortality model and iv a model with both a revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality referred to as the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model the rationale behind the consideration of these four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath was to evaluate the impacts of using a revised diet matrix on the trophic structure in wfs hab ecopath in the presence of very weak or severe red tide events 2 2 1 construction of a revised diet matrix for wfs hab ecopath and attendant analyses we constructed a revised diet matrix by employing a statistical model using the dirichlet distribution and maximum likelihood estimation ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 this methodology allowed us to develop a diet matrix based on a large empirical diet dataset while i avoiding overestimation of the proportion of rarely consumed prey items in the diet of predators walters et al 2006 ainsworth et al 2010 and ii allowing the estimation of error ranges of diet proportion estimates fish diet data for the statistical model were obtained from i the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission fwc s fisheries independent monitoring fim database and ii the gulf of mexico species interactions gomexsi database simons et al 2013 http gomexsi tamucc edu samples in the fwc dataset consisted of individual stomach contents recorded in total volume of individual prey species while samples in the gomexsi dataset consisted of individual stomach contents recorded in volumetric proportions or weight g of individual prey species data for analyses were restricted to samples collected east of 88 0 w to reflect the wfs ecosystem a total of 14 989 samples across 43 predatory fish functional groups of the wfs hab ecopath model were identified with 14 643 samples obtained from fwc and 346 samples from 18 predatory fish functional groups obtained from the gomexsi database with no overlap between data sources prey diversity for each predatory fish group was measured using the shannon wiener diversity index spellerberg and fedor 2003 the diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath was revised using the most recent and updated information from fwc and gomexsi diet datasets first diet data was combined from fwc and gomexsi datasets by normalizing all data to reflect percent prey proportions per individual fish individual fish species were then aggregated into the appropriate wfs hab functional group and fed into the statistical analysis described in tarnecki et al 2016 briefly we arranged the data into an 82 82 matrix predator vs prey based on the wfs hab ecopath functional groups given that it would be rare for each predatory fish group to feed on all wfs hab prey groupings the most frequently observed diet proportion throughout the matrix was zero to correct for zero inflation pseudo predator stomachs representing time integrated diet compositions were created for each of the 43 predatory fish groups by randomly selecting 15 of the observed stomachs and averaging the diet proportions together using bootstrapping with replacement 10 000 pseudo predator stomachs were generated and the bootstrapped diet proportions were fitted to the dirichlet density function using maximum likelihood method the dirichlet function is the multivariate generalization of the beta function suitable for estimating diet proportions as it is defined on a 0 1 interval and can take a variety of shapes ainsworth et al 2010 the marginal beta distributions provided a mode corresponding to the diet proportion for a given predator prey interaction that was most frequently observed as well as confidence intervals around this mode tarnecki et al 2016 we employed the vglm function from the vgam r package yee and wild 1996 for the maximum likelihood fitting procedure a food web diagram illustrating predator prey connectivity on the wfs was created based on a hierarchical clustering analysis clarke et al 2008 masi et al 2014 this analysis groups statistically similar α 0 05 functional groups together based on similarity in the bray curtis measures of distance bray and curtis 1957 between diets tarnecki et al 2016 the bray curtis dissimilarity measure was computed between each pair of samples as 5 d j k i 1 n y i j y i k i 1 n y i j y i k where yij is the count of the ith species in the jth sample yik is the count of the ith species in the kth sample and n is the number of species a cluster analysis was performed on the dissimilarity measures by computing the cluster mode group averages as well as a similarity profile analysis clarke et al 2008 with 999 permutations to produce significant p 0 05 aggregations of predator groups as hierarchical clusters comparisons of the revised diet matrix and the diet matrix used in the base wfs hab ecopath model referred to herein as the base diet matrix were made using analyses presented in tarnecki et al 2016 first to determine differences in predator prey connectivity between the base and revised diet matrices we visually compared the presence absence of prey groups amongst predator groups then using similarity percentages simper clarke et al 2008 we compared volume and prey composition between the base and revised diet matrices to measure resemblance low percentages revealed high variability whereas high percentages revealed similar prey contributions and volumes between the base and revised diet matrices the simper analysis was streamlined by classifying predators into the following guilds elasmobranchs pelagic predatory fishes benthic demersal fishes structure associated fishes and planktivorous fishes finally we conducted a canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap anderson and willis 2003 using the primer statistical package v6 clarke and gorley 2006 to reveal guild similarities and dissimilarities between food webs and potential refinements to guild correlation the cap was performed on the bray curtis measures of distance bray and curtis 1957 resulting in cap plots where groups clustered together have greater similarity in diet composition than groups far apart 2 2 2 representation of elevated hab mortality both the base model and the revised diet model used the baseline hab mortality rates which represent wfs habs in 1980 a year characterized by very weak red tide events gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 to represent elevated hab mortality both the elevated hab mortality model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model were developed to represent wfs habs in 2005 when the wfs experienced some of the most severe red tide events of the past 40 years sagarese et al 2015 gray 2014 estimated that the effort of the hab fleet i e the severity of the red tide events in 2005 was around 256 higher than the hab fleet effort in 1980 therefore to capture elevated hab mortality we multiplied the baseline hab fleet mortality rates of the 38 functional groups vulnerable to habs by 2 56 the hab fleet mortality rates for all alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath are provided in appendix table a 2 2 3 evaluation of the mass balanced alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath following recommended best practices in ewe models ainsworth and walters 2015 heymans et al 2016 we employed prebal diagnostics to evaluate each of the mass balanced alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath link 2010 2016 first we examined trends in log scaled biomass b production p consumption c respiration r and vital rates i e p b c b and r b across functional groups and tls with the expectation of these metrics increasing with decreasing tl link 2010 in addition biomasses were expected to span five to seven orders of magnitude from the highest to lowest tl link 2010 next we examined whether the biomasses relative to primary production pp productions relative to pp and p b s relative to pp as well as the predator prey ratios of biomass and vital rates were below 1 link 2010 2016 lastly additional metrics were calculated for each functional group including i p c which should range between 0 1 and 0 3 ii the consumption of the group relative to its production which should remain below 1 iii the consumption by the group relative to its production which should be greater than 1 and iv total human removals i e fishing relative to the consumption of the group which should remain below 1 link 2010 2 4 analysis of the trophic structure amongst the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath to elucidate the impacts of the revised diet matrix and or elevated red tide mortalities on the ecosystem structure of the wfs we focused on three indices i mixed trophic impact mti indices ii overall impact indices ε which measure trophic interaction strengths and iii omnivory indices the mti analysis ulanowicz and puccia 1990 assesses direct and indirect interactions by quantifying the effect that group j has on group i by taking the difference between a term expressing how much group i contributes to the diet of group j and a term giving the proportion of the predation on i that is due to j computed in ecopath mti ji indices for functional groups are based on predator prey linkages whereas mti ji indices for fleets are based on fishing mortality rates mti ji indices range from 1 to 1 where a positive mti ji index indicates that group j has a positive impact on group i while a negative mti ji index indicates that group j has a negative impact on group i the closer the mti ji index is to the bounds 1 1 the stronger the impact with 1 indicative of top down control and 1 indicative of bottom up control we used the results from the mti analysis to compute the overall impact index for each functional group the overall impact from functional group j is the square root of the sum of squared mti ji indices excluding mti jj lastly the omnivory index was calculated for each functional group which reflects the variance of prey trophic levels for a consumer pauly et al 1993 christensen et al 2008 lower omnivory indices indicate specialized consumers feeding on few trophic levels whereas larger indices indicate consumers that feed on a variety of trophic levels omnivory indices were provided by ewe version 6 4 3 but all other indices were based on results from the network analysis module in ewe version 5 christensen and walters 2004 as initial attempts to use the network analysis module in ewe version 6 4 3 failed to converge due to the large number of trophic linkages in wfs hab ecopath 3 results 3 1 analyses of the revised food web the diet compositions estimated in this study varied greatly from one predator to another see appendix table a 3 for maximum likelihood diet estimates and 95 confidence intervals piscivorous adult gag mycteroperca microlepis preyed primarily 82 on fish functional groups including structure associated coastal omnivores structure associated coastal planktivores juvenile pinfish lagodon rhomboides structure associated coastal piscivores and the sardine herring scad complex coastal sharks had the most diverse diet overall appendix table a 4 consuming crabs fishes shrimps and small infaunal invertebrates hierarchical cluster analyses concentrated the 43 predatory fish groups into 21 clusters based on similarities in prey consumption appendix table a 5 in addition 9 non fish boxes were created to complete the wfs food web diagram fig 3 the cluster with the highest tl was that for large oceanic piscivores e g swordfish xiphias gladius spanish mackerel scomberomorus maculatus king mackerel s cavalla while the groups dead carcasses and sediment detritus had the lowest trophic levels fig 3 sediment detritus was the sole food source for juvenile and adult striped mullet mugil cephalus while the group other mesozooplankton was the sole food source for nearshore planktivores fig 3 adult shrimps were the main food source for demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders juvenile gray snapper lutjanus griseus and structure associated coastal planktivores fig 3 comparing the base and revised food webs we identified marked differences in predator prey connections fig 4 the revised food web incorporated 340 new prey linkages of the 43 predatory fish groups considered in the revised food web 28 had more than 10 prey groups added 44 had between 6 and 10 prey groups added 23 had between 1 and 5 prey groups added and 5 had no additional prey groups incorporated benthic coastal invertebrate feeders had the largest number of prey groups added 17 by contrast juvenile ladyfish elops saurus and nearshore planktivores showed no dissimilarity in prey groups between the base and revised food webs considering prey groups 37 experienced no change in the total number of predators with the revised food web 27 had between 1 and 5 new predators 25 had 6 to 10 new predators 5 had 11 to 15 new predators and 6 had 16 or more new predators the largest increase in predator groups was for bivalves 20 followed by meiofauna 19 the simper analysis suggests that diet similarities between the base and revised food webs vary greatly among functional groups fig 5 planktivorous functional groups have the most similar diets between the base and revised food webs median 78 25 whereas pelagic predatory fish functional groups have the most dissimilar diets median 47 5 the diet of nearshore planktivores e g anchovies was the most similar 88 4 between food webs largely because i zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods were the three main prey items of nearshore planktivores in the base food web and ii with respect to nearshore planktivores revising the wfs food web only resulted in an increase in the proportion of zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods in the diet of this predator by contrast the diet of demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders e g mullus auratus was the least similar 9 3 between food webs while the base food web indicated that zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods were the primary prey items of demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders the revised food web identified shrimps crabs as the main prey items regarding the cap similarity ranged between 0 2 and 0 4 along the x axis cap1 and between 0 30 and 0 25 along the y axis cap2 for the base food web fig 6 a a distinct cluster formed for planktivorous fishes while broader clusters formed for the remaining predator guilds particularly benthic demersal fishes and elasmobranchs the distribution of predator functional groups differed in the revised food web fig 6b for the revised food web similarity ranged between 0 4 and 0 2 along the x axis and between 0 3 and 0 3 along the y axis fig 6b a distinct cluster formed for pelagic predatory fishes while tighter clusters formed for all other predator guilds in addition results from the revised food web generated less overlap amongst predator guilds than results from the base food web especially for benthic demersal fishes and elasmobranchs figs 6b vs a 3 2 balance of the alternative wfs hab ecopath models and evaluation of the mass balanced models the alternative versions of the wfs hab ecopath model developed for the present study did not immediately balance for the elevated hab mortality model the ecotrophic efficiency ee of nearshore associated piscivores estimated by the base model 0 9 was ultimately used as input because the initial estimated ee exceeded 1 1 03 both the revised diet model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model did not immediately balance because i the estimated biomass for large oceanic planktivores was 0 t km 2 and ii the estimated ee for adult shrimps was over 1 13 52 we employed the biomass of large oceanic planktivores 0 073 t km 2 and the ee of adult shrimps 0 884 estimated by the base model as inputs in both the revised diet model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model these decisions allowed all models to balance while keeping them directly comparable to the base model a majority of the prebal diagnostics for the base model were met suggesting that the inputs and estimates of this model were biologically reasonable appendix figs b 1 b 4 although some prebal diagnostics were not met link 2010 and heymans et al 2016 both emphasize this is acceptable as long as departures from the proposed guidelines can be explained see appendix b for details in our case using elevated red tide mortality rates in wfs hab ecopath had no influence on prebal diagnostics by contrast incorporating the revised diet matrix into wfs hab ecopath had a small impact on prebal diagnostics largely due to the different tls estimated in ecopath appendix b 3 3 impacts of using the revised diet matrix or elevating red tide mortality on ecopath estimates basic estimates from ecopath consisted of the four data inputs required for initiating the mass balance process b p b q b and ee see subsection 2 1 1 and quantities for characterizing the structure of the modeled ecosystem e g the tl of functional groups overall using elevated red tide mortality rates had a negligible impact on ecopath basic estimates results not shown while employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath impacted only some of ecopath basic estimates table 1 revising the ecopath diet matrix had a large impact on the tls of functional groups table 1 tl estimates increased or decreased by more than 1 for around 57 of the functional groups represented in wfs hab ecopath most of these functional groups 89 experienced an increase in tl with the largest increase in tl observed for adult pinfish 34 3 a few functional groups experienced a minor decrease in tl adult and juvenile mullet experienced the largest reductions in tl 10 and 7 respectively of the 22 of functional groups that experienced no change in tl most belonged to the base of the food web e g detritus and plankton groups the changes in tl estimates caused by using the revised food web resulted in a re ordering and expansion of the system s trophic flow table 1 the base model had tls up to 4 58 with large oceanic piscivores occupying the top of the food web followed by coastal sharks tl 4 41 and pelagic coastal piscivores tl 4 34 employing the revised diet matrix resulted in a food web where adult spanish mackerel had the largest tl tl 4 91 followed by large oceanic piscivores tl 4 85 and benthic oceanic piscivores tl 4 83 total mortality rates equated to p b s section 2 1 1 were similar across the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath because they were defined before initiating the mass balance process and therefore were unchanged during the mass balance process however specifying elevated red tide mortality and or employing the revised diet matrix often had an impact on the relative importance of the different sources of mortality of a functional group fig 7 and appendix fig a 1 as expected specifying elevated red tide mortality increased the contribution of red tide mortality to the total mortality for all functional groups vulnerable to red tide because total mortality rate did not change for any functional group ecopath accommodated increased red tide mortality by reducing the contribution of natural mortality to the total natural mortality fig 7 this was particularly the case for adult gag demersal coastal invertebrate feeders and adult red grouper epinephelus morio specifying elevated red tide mortality slightly reduced the contribution of fishing mortality to the total mortality of nearshore planktivores and large groupers fig 7 by contrast using the revised diet matrix resulted in an increased contribution of fishing mortality to total mortality for some of the functional groups which was accomplished by a reduction of the contribution of natural mortality to total mortality the largest increases in fishing mortality occurred for large groupers and the other fishes group fig 7 moreover employing the revised diet caused the contribution of red tide mortality to total mortality to increase for nearshore planktivores and large groupers fig 7 results for the elevated hab mortality and revised diet model suggest that changes in mortality patterns are not influenced by the interaction between elevated red tide mortality and the revised diet matrix fig 7 and appendix fig a 1 3 4 trophic structure amongst the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath 3 4 1 mixed trophic impact mti analysis elevated red tide mortality rates had minor impacts on the outcomes of the mti analysis appendix figs c 1 c 4 whereas using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath greatly altered the mti outcomes appendix fig c 5 changes in mti indices were the most common amongst functional groups of macrofauna first using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath reduced or reversed some of the negative impacts amongst some fish groups appendix fig c 5 for instance in the base model large oceanic piscivores had some of the largest negative impacts on functional groups i e large oceanic piscivores 0 72 adult gray snapper 0 44 mackerels 0 33 whereas these impacts were reduced or reversed in the revised diet model e g 0 01 0 14 and 0 001 respectively second using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath resulted in the amplification or creation of positive impacts between fish groups appendix fig c 5 for instance in the base model nearshore planktivores had minor positive impacts on juvenile ladyfish 0 12 and adult ladyfish 0 03 whereas these positive impacts were amplified in the revised diet model 0 53 and 0 28 respectively third benthic groups primarily benefited teleosts in both the base and revised diet models yet the positive impacts of benthic groups on teleosts were stronger in the revised diet model appendix fig c 5 this was particularly notable for adult shrimps which generally had a very strong positive impact on teleosts when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath e g juvenile gray snapper 0 52 demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 50 juvenile lane snapper l synagris 0 47 adult lane snapper 0 45 fourth there were a few instances where substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath led to an amplification of negative impacts from biota appendix fig c 5 this was particularly notable for squids which had a very strong negative impact on many functional groups in the revised diet model e g pelagic oceanic jelly feeders 0 47 nearshore planktivores 0 35 demersal coastal piscivores 0 34 the mti analyses conducted for the base and revised diet wfs hab ecopath models indicated that biota positively influenced fishing fleets while fishing fleets negatively influenced biota appendix fig c 5 however employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath caused an intensification of some of the negative impacts that fishing fleets had on marine biota while having no influence on the positive impacts that biota had on fishing fleets appendix fig c 5 the intensification of the negative impacts of fishing fleets on biota were particularly notable for the trawl and recreational fleets in the base model the most deleterious impact from trawls was upon benthic oceanic piscivores 0 30 whereas in the revised diet model trawls had more prevalent intense deleterious impacts on biota e g benthic oceanic piscivores 0 71 demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 71 benthic oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 5 in the base model the most deleterious impact from the recreational fleet was upon adult gag 0 44 whereas in the revised diet model the recreational fleet had more intense and negative impacts on biota e g adult grey snapper 0 75 juvenile red grouper 0 50 adult gag 0 43 moreover employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath resulted in the longline fleet as the only fishing fleet with a notably positive impact on biota juvenile gag 0 87 this may be a result of the long line fleet reducing the seabird predation on juvenile gag given the strong negative impact the longline fleet has on seabirds 0 88 and the strong negative impact seabirds have on juvenile gag 0 97 mti indices from the red tide pseudo fleet were predominantly negative across impacted groups for all wfs hab ecopath models however red tide impacts were influenced by both specifying elevated red tide mortality and using the revised diet matrix fig 8 deleterious impacts from red tide were the least intense in the base model because the structure of the wfs ecosystem in the base model was characterized by a very weak red tide event gray 2014 employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath amplified the negative impacts of red tide on some functional groups and fishing fleets fig 8 including skates and rays 0 68 juvenile red drum sciaenops ocellatus 0 64 adult red grouper 0 18 the red grouper fleet 0 18 nearshore associated piscivores 0 15 adult gag 0 15 and sea turtles 0 13 there were some instances where using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath alleviated the negative mti indices associated with the red tide pseudo fleet e g demersal coastal invertebrate feeders or promoted positive mtis from the red tide pseudo fleet e g structure associated invertebrate feeders and juvenile blue crab callinectes sapidus as expected specifying elevated red tide mortality in wfs hab ecopath amplified the impacts from red tide appendix figs c 3 and c 4 3 4 2 overall impact ε indices substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath had an impact on ε indices fig 9 whereas elevating red tide mortality had no impact on ε indices appendix table c 1 overall the ε indices in the revised diet model differed from the base model with adult shrimps displaying the largest increase in the ε index with the revised diet matrix followed by seabirds fig 9 the increased overall impacts from seabirds as well as dolphins were particularly noteworthy as these groups are often underdeveloped in end to end models goedegebuure et al 2017 pelagic coastal piscivores had the second largest decrease in the ε index with the revised diet matrix following juvenile striped mullet fig 9 while the base model suggested that pelagic coastal piscivores had the largest impact on ecosystem structure ε 1 52 the revised diet model suggested that adult shrimps filled that role ε 1 35 pelagic coastal piscivores still had a relatively large impact in the revised diet model ε 0 92 but by contrast adult shrimps had no significant impact in the base model ε 0 38 third dolphins ε 1 18 squid ε 1 17 structure associated invertebrate feeders ε 1 15 and sardine herring ε 1 06 had relatively large impacts in the revised diet model while small mobile epifauna ε 1 26 and sardines herrings ε 1 21 had relatively large impacts in the base model lastly both the base and revised diet models resulted in manatees having the weakest influence on the structure of the wfs ecosystem ε 0 001 for both models 3 4 3 omnivory indices oi substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath impacted omnivory indices fig 10 while elevating red tide mortality had no impact on omnivory indices appendix table c 2 the majority of functional groups 53 had higher omnivory indices in the revised diet model indicating that groups had a tendency to be more omnivorous in this model the omnivory index increased the most for juvenile pinfish base oi 0 08 revised diet oi 0 69 and surface pelagics displayed the highest omnivory index in both models base oi 0 86 revised diet oi 1 01 about 30 of the functional groups became less omnivorous and more selective in the revised diet model the omnivory index decreased the most for juvenile striped mullet between models base oi 0 55 revised diet oi 0 19 the system omnivory index i e the average omnivory index of all consumers weighted by the logarithm of each consumers food intake christensen et al 2008 from the base model was 0 22 which is comparable to other models of the gulf of mexico okey et al 2004 sagarese et al 2017 the revised diet model exhibited a slightly less omnivorous system oi 0 20 because groups with higher weighted food intakes had a tendency to have reduced omnivory indices in the revised diet model appendix table c 2 4 discussion in the present study we estimated a revised diet matrix for an ecopath model describing the structure of the wfs ecosystem from a large empirical diet dataset the revised diet matrix had around 340 predator prey linkages that were not present in the diet matrix used in the base wfs hab ecopath model thus the revised diet matrix represented a more complex food web however there were some predator prey linkages in the base diet matrix that were not retained in the revised diet matrix because of the low frequency of those predator prey interactions in the diet dataset employed in the present study the more complex food web estimated for the wfs resulted in a reduction of the predation mortality rates of many of the prey groups represented in the wfs hab ecopath model including many prey groups that are directly affected by red tides e g adult gag juvenile red grouper adult red grouper a large reduction in predation mortality rates may be reasonable for adult fish groups but less so for juvenile fish groups such as juvenile red grouper as these juvenile fishes are generally reported to suffer high predation mortality rates in the wild sogard 1997 almany and webster 2006 to accurately estimate juvenile fish predation mortality rates additional collection of predatory fish stomachs in the wfs region will be needed particularly in coastal e g estuarine habitats where the bulk of juvenile fishes occur in addition dna barcoding for prey identification sakaguchi et al 2017 or a combination of dna barcoding and stable isotope analyses may further elucidate the energy flow of the wfs ecosystem carreon martinez and heath 2010 tarnecki and patterson 2015 nelson et al 2017 as well as help us to properly distinguish between short term and long term diet trends in the wfs region kroetz et al 2017 nelson et al 2017 substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model had a large impact on trophic level estimates but generally not on basic parameters estimated in balancing ecopath this was not surprising as many of the other basic parameters of ecopath were specified rather than estimated during the mass balance process and unchanged amongst the alternative models considered in this study adult pinfish had the largest increase in trophic level between the base model and the revised diet model 2 97 and 3 98 respectively findings from previous studies suggest that the trophic level for this group within the wfs should be above 3 hansen 1969 estimated that pinfish had a trophic level up to 3 4 in florida estuaries while motta et al 1995 found that pinfish had a trophic level of 3 2 in apalachee bay florida mullet groups mugil spp had the largest decrease in trophic levels between the base model and the revised diet model from 2 24 to 2 03 for adults and 2 32 to 2 17 for juveniles this resulted from sediment detritus being the primary food source for mullet groups in the revised diet matrix as indicated by the hierarchical cluster analyses the trophic level of mugilids can vary greatly from one species to another and from one region to another whitfield 2016 but reduced trophic levels obtained with the revised diet matrix are reasonable for the wfs collins 1981 found that mullets primarily fed on macrophytic detritus 40 and sand shell particles 56 off seahorse key florida and on sediment particles 53 and algae 32 in crystal river florida a majority of functional groups had larger trophic level estimates in wfs hab ecopath upon employing the revised diet matrix which expanded the ecosystem structure modeled in wfs hab ecopath this is a significant implication of revising the diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath as truncated marine food webs oversimplify the fish community masking higher trophic levels and their associated interactions which can bias ecosystem based fisheries management advice derived from ecopath outputs hussey et al 2014 pelagic coastal piscivores was the most impactful group in wfs hab ecopath when the base diet matrix was employed due to their strong negative impacts on several teleost functional groups similar observations were made with other ecosystem models of the gulf of mexico e g sagarese et al 2017 however many of the negative impacts of pelagic coastal piscivores were reduced when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath subsequently reducing their trophic interaction strength in fact several top predator groups had reduced trophic interaction strengths when the revised diet matrix was used in wfs hab ecopath including benthic oceanic piscivores coastal sharks and large oceanic piscivores it is likely that the base diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath was over representing top down pressures from some of the top predatory groups as it was based on sparse cursory information and that the revised diet matrix improves the representation of these pressures as it is based on wfs survey data it is worth noting that the revised diet matrix could be reflecting a reduction in top down pressures as there is nearly a 20 year difference between the original development of the base diet matrix okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 and the development of the revised diet matrix which was estimated from diet data collected mainly over the last ten years although highly debated in the literature the reduction of top down pressures due to changes in the populations of top predators e g loss of abundance shifts in habitats could have negative impacts on local ecosystems heithaus et al 2008 terborgh and estes 2010 boaden and kingsford 2015 including leading to more pronounced hab impacts walsh et al 2011 this study does not provide evidence of reduced top down pressures especially considering that some top predator groups had increased trophic interaction strengths when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath including seabirds dolphins and benthic coastal piscivores however future studies involving the wfs hab ecopath model such as exploring dynamic simulations using the revised diet matrix should bear in mind the ecosystem impacts from changing trophic pressures as they will likely have important implications for resource management efforts squids and adult shrimp were the most impactful groups when the revised diet matrix was fed into the wfs hab ecopath model by contrast squids and adult shrimp had no significant impact in wfs hab ecopath when the base diet matrix was employed when using the revised diet matrix squids had a strong negative impact on a variety of groups in wfs hab ecopath e g jellyfish eaters nearshore planktivores demersal piscivores pinfish and ladyfish squids have been identified as playing an essential role in the biological transfer of energy in a variety of marine ecosystems including the south brazil bight gasalla et al 2010 the eastern pacific nigmatullin et al 2001 shchetinnikov 1988 and the antarctic polar frontal zone rodhouse and white 1995 additionally coll et al 2013 found that the ecological role of squid occupying the neritic zone may be important as across a variety of ecopath models squid had strong top down control on their prey and were important prey for top predators thus it is plausible that squids play a critical role in the trophic structure of the wfs ecosystem and that the revised diet matrix better reflected this role in wfs hab ecopath when using the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model adult shrimp had a strong positive impact on a variety of the modeled groups including groups of snappers groupers and demersal coastal invertebrate feeders shrimps are known for strongly influencing benthic communities e g march et al 2002 and to be essential for the recycling of nutrients e g welsh 1975 additionally fujiwara et al 2016 found significant associations between shrimp abundance and the catch rates of fish in some regions of the gulf of mexico thus it is plausible that the role adult shrimp have in the trophic structure of the wfs ecosystem was previously underrepresented and that the revised diet matrix better reflects this role indeed any scenario entailing large changes in squid and or adult shrimp mortality rates tested with wfs hab ewe using the revised diet matrix will very likely result in major changes in the dynamics of the simulated wfs ecosystem sala and sugihara 2005 substituting the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model drove the minor differences in prebal diagnostics we observed appendix b although a majority of the prebal diagnostics for the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath were met suggesting that model inputs and estimates were biologically reasonable some were not met this may be acceptable link 2010 heymans et al 2016 yet we recommend future studies to complete an extended evaluation of the performance of wfs hab ecopath to ensure the information extracted from this model that is used to assist resource management efforts is as robust as possible heymans et al 2016 overall this study found that compared to the base diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath the revised diet matrix estimated in this study had higher connectivity amongst functional groups more generalist predators and more omnivorous groups these features are observed in a large number of marine food webs particularly highly diverse ecosystems like the wfs link 2002 dunne et al 2004 shurin et al 2006 thompson et al 2007 diet matrices generally represent a mere portion of the complexity of real ecosystems the increased connectivity and intricacy amongst functional groups provided by the revised diet matrix suggests an improved representation of an inherently complex and highly diverse marine ecosystem moreover as indicated earlier the wfs hab ecopath model using the revised diet matrix is less likely to predict unreasonably high predation mortality rates due to specific predators particularly for juvenile fishes as prey items are generally consumed by a broader diversity of predators in the model sagarese et al 2017 therefore we conclude that as a starting point to evaluate the dynamic and spatio temporal impacts of habs and other ecosystem perturbations using the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model is more reliable than using the diet matrix previously fed into wfs hab ecopath that being said food web complexity and omnivory are often used to assess ecosystem stability but no clear patterns between food web connectivity or omnivory and ecosystem stability have been established landi et al 2018 we did not evaluate the impacts of the revised diet matrix on ecosystem stability but future studies considering network approaches energy flow analyses and food web descriptors e g weighted connectance van altena et al 2016 could explore this issue landi et al 2018 negative impacts of the fleets i e red tides and fisheries intensified in wfs hab ecopath when the revised diet matrix was employed confirming the concerns expressed in gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 about the limitations of wfs hab ecopath due to the uncertainty of the base diet matrix this suggests that part of the vulnerability to habs is due to feeding dependencies as opposed to direct toxicological effects the negative impacts of the red tide pseudo fleet intensified for most of the functional groups vulnerable to red tides particularly for the skate ray complex and juvenile red drum the intensification of red tide impacts on juvenile red drum seems reasonable given that red drum recruitment declined markedly in 2005 and 2006 seemingly due to the severe hab event that took place in 2005 flaherty and landsberg 2011 moreover sagarese et al 2017 found the skate ray complex to be particularity vulnerable to red tides within the u s gulf of mexico using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath also intensified the negative impacts of the red tide pseudo fleet on gag and red grouper as well as the negative impacts of the recreational fleet on these two species thus the negative impacts of recreational fishing and red tides on gag and red grouper may have been underestimated in the previous versions of wfs hab ecopath that aimed to inform gag and red grouper assessments gray et al 2013 sagarese et al 2015 this may explain why the red grouper mortality rates predicted by sagarese et al 2015 did not reflect the large mortality rates suggested by field observations this work represents an important advancement in the progression of ecosystem modeling tools for assisting resource management efforts for the wfs the next step is to use the wfs hab ecopath model with the revised diet matrix to conduct dynamic simulations with the ecosim component of wfs hab ewe we demonstrated the strong influence diet has on the trophic structure estimated by the wfs hab ecopath model and the more complex structure estimated by wfs hab ecopath is likely to imply very different dynamics over time in ecosim thus the quantified uncertainty ranges in diet proportions we presented could be used to explore the impacts of diet uncertainty on advice for resource management based on dynamic simulations with ecosim koehn et al 2016 morzaria luna et al 2018 bentley et al 2019 although we found that elevated red tide mortalities had virtually no impact on the trophic structure of wfs hab ecopath they did impact specific functional groups and could have stronger impacts in dynamic simulations with ecosim future work should explore the impacts of uncertainty in the hab mortality driver of wfs hab ecopath which is based on anecdotal observations reported to the fwri fish kill database due to the lack of quantitative information on fish kills driggers et al 2016 sagarese et al 2017 finally red tide blooms in the wfs can vary significantly in space and over time steidinger and haddad 1981 steidinger and vargo 1988 and the catch potential of targeted and bycatch species may increase during red tide blooms due to denser spatial patterns craig et al 2005 craig 2012 therefore extending the wfs hab ewe model to an ecospace model in order to simulate the spatio temporal dynamics of red tides o farrell et al 2017 would allow for the estimation of red tide mortality rates based on the degree of spatial overlap between red tides and the functional groups that are vulnerable to them in conclusion we found that using a large empirical diet database to develop a more complex and more realistic diet matrix profoundly changed key ecological processes in wfs hab ecopath pertinent for exploring hab impacts and other important resource management questions in particular hab mortality rates with the revised diet matrix were higher and more consistent with field observations for gag and red grouper which are some of the species most effected by habs these findings show the importance of having accurate and up to date diet data when using ecosystem models to infer the impacts of ecosystem perturbations such as habs throughout the food web author contributions designed and analyzed the models

24927,harmful algal blooms habs are a growing concern in the west florida shelf wfs region an ecopath with ecosim ewe model of the wfs explicitly simulating habs was previously developed to illuminate the potential impacts of blooms of the dinoflagellate karenia brevis colloquially referred to as red tides on the wfs ecosystem however the diet matrix of the ecopath component of this ewe model referred to as wfs hab ecopath was based largely on sparse cursory information and not on local survey data here we revise the diet matrix of the wfs hab ecopath model using predictions of a robust statistical model that incorporates local survey data and employs the dirichlet distribution and maximum likelihood estimation the relative impacts of both the revised diet matrix and red tide mortality scenarios on model structure are explored by comparing four alternative wfs hab ecopath models i the base model ii a model employing the revised diet matrix iii a model with elevated red tide mortality and iv a model with both the revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality incorporating the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model had a relatively large impact on ecosystem structure i e trophic organization mortality rates trophic interaction strengths and omnivory elevated red tide mortality had virtually no impact on ecosystem structure aside from altering the contribution of fishing natural and red tide mortalities to the total mortality of functional groups however elevated red tide mortality might have meaningful implications in dynamic simulations which should be explored in future studies collectively results showed that incorporating the revised diet matrix into wfs hab ecopath which revealed a number of new predator prey linkages led to a more complex and interconnected food web specifically prey items were generally consumed by a broader variety of predators which contrasts with the base wfs hab ecopath model where many prey particularly juvenile fishes were subjected to exceedingly high predation mortality rates from specific predators the incorporation of the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model discussed herein is a fundamental step towards increasing the realism of trophic interactions in the model which is particularly important as these trophic interactions define starting conditions for dynamic simulations keywords diet matrix food web maximum likelihood estimation ecopath red tides harmful algal blooms 1 introduction the ecosystem services provided by the gulf of mexico are invaluable for the u s economy particularly those from the west florida shelf wfs fig 1 plantier santos et al 2012 chagaris 2013 karnauskas et al 2013 however the productivity of the wfs ecosystem may be greatly impacted by harmful algal blooms habs walsh et al 2011 the wfs regularly experiences blooms of the dinoflagellate karenia brevis colloquially referred to as red tides when blooms of k brevis become massive the lysis of k brevis cells results in the release of a neurotoxin called brevetoxin steidinger et al 1998 landsberg et al 2009 aerosolized brevetoxin can have strong negative impacts on local human communities via health issues kirkpatrick et al 2004 fleming et al 2005 moreover direct exposure to brevetoxin can alter the sodium potassium channels of aquatic vertebrates eventually leading to death kirkpatrick et al 2004 blooms of k brevis can also indirectly harm marine fauna by causing excessive hypoxia turbidity and shading okey et al 2004 landsberg et al 2009 klemas 2012 persistent blooms can result in widespread die offs of fish and other aquatic animals including protected species ultimately impacting the structure of local marine communities through trophic cascades okey et al 2004 dupont and coy 2008 landsberg et al 2009 flaherty and landsberg 2011 and reducing the catch rates of local fisheries landsberg et al 2009 driggers et al 2016 although hab events have been documented on the wfs as early as 1844 ingersoll 1881 rounsefell and nelson 1966 steidinger et al 1998 their ecosystem effects are still relatively unclear and robust strategies for coping with their economic implications remain to be established understanding habs is a top research priority in the gulf of mexico partly because there are concerns that blooms of k brevis are increasing in frequency and intensity over time brand and compton 2007 grüss et al 2017 harford et al 2018 therefore there is a need for tools designed specifically to evaluate the potential ecosystem impacts of habs to assist management and mitigation efforts heil and steidinger 2009 sophisticated ecosystem simulation models such as applications of the trophodynamic ecopath with ecosim ewe with ecospace walters et al 1999 2010 can explicitly consider a comprehensive suite of marine organisms their trophic interactions and the effects of the abiotic environment on species dynamics such models have been identified as key tools for exploring the potential ecosystem impacts of habs on the wfs grüss et al 2017 o farrell et al 2017 the ecopath component of ewe provides a static mass balance representation of a food web which serves as a starting point for dynamic modeling christensen and pauly 1992 christensen and walters 2004 the ecosim component of ewe allows one to simulate food web dynamics at monthly time steps by altering fishing mortality fishing effort and abiotic environmental forcing functions walters et al 1997 2000 finally the ecospace component of ewe allows one to simulate food web and fishing fleet dynamics and changes in the abiotic environment over time and space walters et al 2010 de mutsert et al 2016 an ewe model explicitly simulating red tides was previously developed to evaluate the ecosystem impacts of habs referred to here as wfs hab ewe okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 gray 2014 sagarese et al 2015 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 however the diet matrix of the basal component of wfs hab ewe wfs hab ecopath was developed based on reports from the florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri information provided by fishbase froese and pauly 2018 and sealifebase palomares and pauly 2018 and a variety of stomach content and feeding habit studies not necessarily specific to the wfs see okey and mahmoudi 2002 for details because much of this information was qualitative and based on expert knowledge there was a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model the diet matrix fed into sophisticated ecosystem models such as ewe with ecospace or the atlantis modeling platform fulton et al 2004 2011 has a substantial impact on the predictions of these models in particular even small changes in the biomass of prey consumed in ecosim which is based on the diet matrix defined in ecopath can result in the severe depletion of some species particularly juvenile fishes walters et al 2008 2010 therefore it is important to build a robust diet matrix for the ecopath component of ewe with ecospace models grüss et al 2017 o farrell et al 2017 fortunately detailed quantitative diet data on the wfs are now plentiful due to monitoring efforts grüss et al 2018a moreover robust statistical modeling approaches using maximum likelihood are available to estimate diet proportions for informing ecosystem models ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 the objectives of this study were to i develop a revised diet matrix for the wfs using predictions of a robust statistical model that incorporates local survey data and ii evaluate the changes in ecosystem structure for wfs hab ecopath in response to modifications including the revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality because the static ecosystem structure provided by ecopath serves as a starting point for dynamic modeling with ecosim and spatio temporal modeling with ecospace the revised diet matrix would refine the representation of the spatio temporal dynamics of red tides within the wfs and impacts on vulnerable species groups for future simulations grüss et al 2018b first we reviewed the ecopath modeling approach and the development of the base wfs hab ecopath model considered in this study i e gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 second we developed a revised diet matrix for wfs hab ecopath based on predictions from a statistical model using the dirichlet distribution fitted to empirical diet data ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 we compared this revised diet matrix to the diet matrix described in the base wfs hab ecopath model to evaluate changes in predator prey linkages prey preferences and similarities third we developed four alternative versions of the wfs hab ecopath in a factorial design with the base and revised diet matrices and low versus elevated red tide mortalities finally we compared ecosystem structure across the four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath by exploring i prebal diagnostics link 2010 2016 ii basic estimates of ecopath e g trophic levels tl and mortality rates and iii trophic metrics including mixed trophic impact indices ulanowicz and puccia 1990 trophic interaction strengths and omnivory indices pauly et al 1993 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ecopath modeling approach and the wfs hab ecopath model 2 1 1 the ecopath modeling approach ecopath is a mass balance approach for describing the trophic structure of an aquatic ecosystem christensen and pauly 1992 pauly et al 2000 in ecopath a comprehensive suite of functional groups i e groups of species that have similar trophic life history and niche characteristics are explicitly considered typically including detritus groups primary producer groups and invertebrate fish turtle seabird and mammal groups pauly et al 2000 these functional groups are represented either as single biomass pools or as multi stanza functional groups that account for ontogenetic shifts in habitat and or diet walters et al 2008 ecopath relies on two master equations that i limit loss terms to no more than that group s available production eq 1 and ii define the group s productivity with respect to its consumption and maintenance needs eq 2 christensen and walters 2004 1 p i y i b i m 2 i e i b a i m 0

missing data input is estimated during the mass balance process during the mass balance process ecopath estimates several quantities that are useful to characterize the structure of the modeled system such as the tl of functional groups 2 1 2 the wfs hab ecopath model the conceptual model in fig 2 summarizes the evolution of the first wfs hab ecopath model okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 to the wfs hab ecopath model considered herein gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 first the ecopath model was updated to reflect the wfs ecosystem in 2014 by reparametrizing biomass landings and productivity second functional groups not present in the first wfs hab ecopath model okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 but considered vulnerable to habs were added based on literature steidinger et al 1973 and the fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife research institute 2015 the fwri fish kill database consists of publicly reported approximate numbers and species of dead fishes seen along the wfs coast during k brevis blooms in total wfs hab ecopath explicitly considers 81 functional groups including two marine mammal groups dolphins and manatees one seabird group one turtle group 49 fish groups of which 11 are multi stanza groups representing adults and juveniles 19 invertebrate groups of which one is a multi stanza group representing adults and juveniles and four are zooplankton groups one microbial heterotroph group five autotroph groups and three detritus groups appendix table a 1 third catch per unit effort cpue time series of biomass and landings were used to reparametrize wfs hab ecopath to 1980 values i e the historical model which serves as the starting point for future dynamic simulations the historical model allowed for simulations to investigate the model s ability to recreate observed time series gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 the fourth step for updating wfs hab ecopath was the integration of hab mortality fig 2 which was accomplished using a pseudo fishing fleet referred to as the hab fleet this fleet comes in addition to the ten fishing fleets explicitly considered in wfs hab ecopath trawl recreation headboats gill trammel net spear gig hook line purse seine haul seine long line and traps the hab fleet is a discard only fleet so the biomass caught by the hab fleet is immediately cycled into the detritus pools and consequently immediately available to detritivore functional groups gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 in essence the hab fleet acts as a mortality forcing function which differs from the forcing function routine within ewe christensen et al 2008 the fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife research institute 2015 was used to determine the functional groups vulnerable to red tides and to construct an index of vulnerability to red tides for each functional group based on their prevalence in the database gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 described in detail how an index of vulnerability to red tides was developed such that the functional groups that are more numerous in the fish kill database are more strongly affected by red tides in the wfs hab ecopath model of the functional groups in wfs hab ecopath 38 correspond to species vulnerable to red tide appendix table a 2 gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 applying the mortality effect to multiple functional groups allowed for the examination of interactions their method has been employed in other studies e g sagarese et al 2017 2 2 the development of alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath to evaluate the relative effects of improved diet information and elevated red tide mortality on the static snapshot in wfs hab ecopath we developed four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath i the base wfs hab ecopath model used in gray 2014 and gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 which is fed with a highly uncertain diet matrix and represents wfs habs of 1980 a year characterized by very weak red tide events hereafter we refer to this model as the base model gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 ii a model with a revised diet matrix referred to as the revised diet model iii a model with elevated red tide mortality referred to as the elevated hab mortality model and iv a model with both a revised diet matrix and elevated red tide mortality referred to as the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model the rationale behind the consideration of these four alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath was to evaluate the impacts of using a revised diet matrix on the trophic structure in wfs hab ecopath in the presence of very weak or severe red tide events 2 2 1 construction of a revised diet matrix for wfs hab ecopath and attendant analyses we constructed a revised diet matrix by employing a statistical model using the dirichlet distribution and maximum likelihood estimation ainsworth et al 2010 masi et al 2014 tarnecki et al 2016 sagarese et al 2016 2017 this methodology allowed us to develop a diet matrix based on a large empirical diet dataset while i avoiding overestimation of the proportion of rarely consumed prey items in the diet of predators walters et al 2006 ainsworth et al 2010 and ii allowing the estimation of error ranges of diet proportion estimates fish diet data for the statistical model were obtained from i the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission fwc s fisheries independent monitoring fim database and ii the gulf of mexico species interactions gomexsi database simons et al 2013 http gomexsi tamucc edu samples in the fwc dataset consisted of individual stomach contents recorded in total volume of individual prey species while samples in the gomexsi dataset consisted of individual stomach contents recorded in volumetric proportions or weight g of individual prey species data for analyses were restricted to samples collected east of 88 0 w to reflect the wfs ecosystem a total of 14 989 samples across 43 predatory fish functional groups of the wfs hab ecopath model were identified with 14 643 samples obtained from fwc and 346 samples from 18 predatory fish functional groups obtained from the gomexsi database with no overlap between data sources prey diversity for each predatory fish group was measured using the shannon wiener diversity index spellerberg and fedor 2003 the diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath was revised using the most recent and updated information from fwc and gomexsi diet datasets first diet data was combined from fwc and gomexsi datasets by normalizing all data to reflect percent prey proportions per individual fish individual fish species were then aggregated into the appropriate wfs hab functional group and fed into the statistical analysis described in tarnecki et al 2016 briefly we arranged the data into an 82 82 matrix predator vs prey based on the wfs hab ecopath functional groups given that it would be rare for each predatory fish group to feed on all wfs hab prey groupings the most frequently observed diet proportion throughout the matrix was zero to correct for zero inflation pseudo predator stomachs representing time integrated diet compositions were created for each of the 43 predatory fish groups by randomly selecting 15 of the observed stomachs and averaging the diet proportions together using bootstrapping with replacement 10 000 pseudo predator stomachs were generated and the bootstrapped diet proportions were fitted to the dirichlet density function using maximum likelihood method the dirichlet function is the multivariate generalization of the beta function suitable for estimating diet proportions as it is defined on a 0 1 interval and can take a variety of shapes ainsworth et al 2010 the marginal beta distributions provided a mode corresponding to the diet proportion for a given predator prey interaction that was most frequently observed as well as confidence intervals around this mode tarnecki et al 2016 we employed the vglm function from the vgam r package yee and wild 1996 for the maximum likelihood fitting procedure a food web diagram illustrating predator prey connectivity on the wfs was created based on a hierarchical clustering analysis clarke et al 2008 masi et al 2014 this analysis groups statistically similar α 0 05 functional groups together based on similarity in the bray curtis measures of distance bray and curtis 1957 between diets tarnecki et al 2016 the bray curtis dissimilarity measure was computed between each pair of samples as 5 d j k i 1 n y i j y i k i 1 n y i j y i k where yij is the count of the ith species in the jth sample yik is the count of the ith species in the kth sample and n is the number of species a cluster analysis was performed on the dissimilarity measures by computing the cluster mode group averages as well as a similarity profile analysis clarke et al 2008 with 999 permutations to produce significant p 0 05 aggregations of predator groups as hierarchical clusters comparisons of the revised diet matrix and the diet matrix used in the base wfs hab ecopath model referred to herein as the base diet matrix were made using analyses presented in tarnecki et al 2016 first to determine differences in predator prey connectivity between the base and revised diet matrices we visually compared the presence absence of prey groups amongst predator groups then using similarity percentages simper clarke et al 2008 we compared volume and prey composition between the base and revised diet matrices to measure resemblance low percentages revealed high variability whereas high percentages revealed similar prey contributions and volumes between the base and revised diet matrices the simper analysis was streamlined by classifying predators into the following guilds elasmobranchs pelagic predatory fishes benthic demersal fishes structure associated fishes and planktivorous fishes finally we conducted a canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap anderson and willis 2003 using the primer statistical package v6 clarke and gorley 2006 to reveal guild similarities and dissimilarities between food webs and potential refinements to guild correlation the cap was performed on the bray curtis measures of distance bray and curtis 1957 resulting in cap plots where groups clustered together have greater similarity in diet composition than groups far apart 2 2 2 representation of elevated hab mortality both the base model and the revised diet model used the baseline hab mortality rates which represent wfs habs in 1980 a year characterized by very weak red tide events gray 2014 gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 to represent elevated hab mortality both the elevated hab mortality model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model were developed to represent wfs habs in 2005 when the wfs experienced some of the most severe red tide events of the past 40 years sagarese et al 2015 gray 2014 estimated that the effort of the hab fleet i e the severity of the red tide events in 2005 was around 256 higher than the hab fleet effort in 1980 therefore to capture elevated hab mortality we multiplied the baseline hab fleet mortality rates of the 38 functional groups vulnerable to habs by 2 56 the hab fleet mortality rates for all alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath are provided in appendix table a 2 2 3 evaluation of the mass balanced alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath following recommended best practices in ewe models ainsworth and walters 2015 heymans et al 2016 we employed prebal diagnostics to evaluate each of the mass balanced alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath link 2010 2016 first we examined trends in log scaled biomass b production p consumption c respiration r and vital rates i e p b c b and r b across functional groups and tls with the expectation of these metrics increasing with decreasing tl link 2010 in addition biomasses were expected to span five to seven orders of magnitude from the highest to lowest tl link 2010 next we examined whether the biomasses relative to primary production pp productions relative to pp and p b s relative to pp as well as the predator prey ratios of biomass and vital rates were below 1 link 2010 2016 lastly additional metrics were calculated for each functional group including i p c which should range between 0 1 and 0 3 ii the consumption of the group relative to its production which should remain below 1 iii the consumption by the group relative to its production which should be greater than 1 and iv total human removals i e fishing relative to the consumption of the group which should remain below 1 link 2010 2 4 analysis of the trophic structure amongst the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath to elucidate the impacts of the revised diet matrix and or elevated red tide mortalities on the ecosystem structure of the wfs we focused on three indices i mixed trophic impact mti indices ii overall impact indices ε which measure trophic interaction strengths and iii omnivory indices the mti analysis ulanowicz and puccia 1990 assesses direct and indirect interactions by quantifying the effect that group j has on group i by taking the difference between a term expressing how much group i contributes to the diet of group j and a term giving the proportion of the predation on i that is due to j computed in ecopath mti ji indices for functional groups are based on predator prey linkages whereas mti ji indices for fleets are based on fishing mortality rates mti ji indices range from 1 to 1 where a positive mti ji index indicates that group j has a positive impact on group i while a negative mti ji index indicates that group j has a negative impact on group i the closer the mti ji index is to the bounds 1 1 the stronger the impact with 1 indicative of top down control and 1 indicative of bottom up control we used the results from the mti analysis to compute the overall impact index for each functional group the overall impact from functional group j is the square root of the sum of squared mti ji indices excluding mti jj lastly the omnivory index was calculated for each functional group which reflects the variance of prey trophic levels for a consumer pauly et al 1993 christensen et al 2008 lower omnivory indices indicate specialized consumers feeding on few trophic levels whereas larger indices indicate consumers that feed on a variety of trophic levels omnivory indices were provided by ewe version 6 4 3 but all other indices were based on results from the network analysis module in ewe version 5 christensen and walters 2004 as initial attempts to use the network analysis module in ewe version 6 4 3 failed to converge due to the large number of trophic linkages in wfs hab ecopath 3 results 3 1 analyses of the revised food web the diet compositions estimated in this study varied greatly from one predator to another see appendix table a 3 for maximum likelihood diet estimates and 95 confidence intervals piscivorous adult gag mycteroperca microlepis preyed primarily 82 on fish functional groups including structure associated coastal omnivores structure associated coastal planktivores juvenile pinfish lagodon rhomboides structure associated coastal piscivores and the sardine herring scad complex coastal sharks had the most diverse diet overall appendix table a 4 consuming crabs fishes shrimps and small infaunal invertebrates hierarchical cluster analyses concentrated the 43 predatory fish groups into 21 clusters based on similarities in prey consumption appendix table a 5 in addition 9 non fish boxes were created to complete the wfs food web diagram fig 3 the cluster with the highest tl was that for large oceanic piscivores e g swordfish xiphias gladius spanish mackerel scomberomorus maculatus king mackerel s cavalla while the groups dead carcasses and sediment detritus had the lowest trophic levels fig 3 sediment detritus was the sole food source for juvenile and adult striped mullet mugil cephalus while the group other mesozooplankton was the sole food source for nearshore planktivores fig 3 adult shrimps were the main food source for demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders juvenile gray snapper lutjanus griseus and structure associated coastal planktivores fig 3 comparing the base and revised food webs we identified marked differences in predator prey connections fig 4 the revised food web incorporated 340 new prey linkages of the 43 predatory fish groups considered in the revised food web 28 had more than 10 prey groups added 44 had between 6 and 10 prey groups added 23 had between 1 and 5 prey groups added and 5 had no additional prey groups incorporated benthic coastal invertebrate feeders had the largest number of prey groups added 17 by contrast juvenile ladyfish elops saurus and nearshore planktivores showed no dissimilarity in prey groups between the base and revised food webs considering prey groups 37 experienced no change in the total number of predators with the revised food web 27 had between 1 and 5 new predators 25 had 6 to 10 new predators 5 had 11 to 15 new predators and 6 had 16 or more new predators the largest increase in predator groups was for bivalves 20 followed by meiofauna 19 the simper analysis suggests that diet similarities between the base and revised food webs vary greatly among functional groups fig 5 planktivorous functional groups have the most similar diets between the base and revised food webs median 78 25 whereas pelagic predatory fish functional groups have the most dissimilar diets median 47 5 the diet of nearshore planktivores e g anchovies was the most similar 88 4 between food webs largely because i zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods were the three main prey items of nearshore planktivores in the base food web and ii with respect to nearshore planktivores revising the wfs food web only resulted in an increase in the proportion of zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods in the diet of this predator by contrast the diet of demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders e g mullus auratus was the least similar 9 3 between food webs while the base food web indicated that zooplankton ichthyoplankton and copepods were the primary prey items of demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders the revised food web identified shrimps crabs as the main prey items regarding the cap similarity ranged between 0 2 and 0 4 along the x axis cap1 and between 0 30 and 0 25 along the y axis cap2 for the base food web fig 6 a a distinct cluster formed for planktivorous fishes while broader clusters formed for the remaining predator guilds particularly benthic demersal fishes and elasmobranchs the distribution of predator functional groups differed in the revised food web fig 6b for the revised food web similarity ranged between 0 4 and 0 2 along the x axis and between 0 3 and 0 3 along the y axis fig 6b a distinct cluster formed for pelagic predatory fishes while tighter clusters formed for all other predator guilds in addition results from the revised food web generated less overlap amongst predator guilds than results from the base food web especially for benthic demersal fishes and elasmobranchs figs 6b vs a 3 2 balance of the alternative wfs hab ecopath models and evaluation of the mass balanced models the alternative versions of the wfs hab ecopath model developed for the present study did not immediately balance for the elevated hab mortality model the ecotrophic efficiency ee of nearshore associated piscivores estimated by the base model 0 9 was ultimately used as input because the initial estimated ee exceeded 1 1 03 both the revised diet model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model did not immediately balance because i the estimated biomass for large oceanic planktivores was 0 t km 2 and ii the estimated ee for adult shrimps was over 1 13 52 we employed the biomass of large oceanic planktivores 0 073 t km 2 and the ee of adult shrimps 0 884 estimated by the base model as inputs in both the revised diet model and the revised diet and elevated hab mortality model these decisions allowed all models to balance while keeping them directly comparable to the base model a majority of the prebal diagnostics for the base model were met suggesting that the inputs and estimates of this model were biologically reasonable appendix figs b 1 b 4 although some prebal diagnostics were not met link 2010 and heymans et al 2016 both emphasize this is acceptable as long as departures from the proposed guidelines can be explained see appendix b for details in our case using elevated red tide mortality rates in wfs hab ecopath had no influence on prebal diagnostics by contrast incorporating the revised diet matrix into wfs hab ecopath had a small impact on prebal diagnostics largely due to the different tls estimated in ecopath appendix b 3 3 impacts of using the revised diet matrix or elevating red tide mortality on ecopath estimates basic estimates from ecopath consisted of the four data inputs required for initiating the mass balance process b p b q b and ee see subsection 2 1 1 and quantities for characterizing the structure of the modeled ecosystem e g the tl of functional groups overall using elevated red tide mortality rates had a negligible impact on ecopath basic estimates results not shown while employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath impacted only some of ecopath basic estimates table 1 revising the ecopath diet matrix had a large impact on the tls of functional groups table 1 tl estimates increased or decreased by more than 1 for around 57 of the functional groups represented in wfs hab ecopath most of these functional groups 89 experienced an increase in tl with the largest increase in tl observed for adult pinfish 34 3 a few functional groups experienced a minor decrease in tl adult and juvenile mullet experienced the largest reductions in tl 10 and 7 respectively of the 22 of functional groups that experienced no change in tl most belonged to the base of the food web e g detritus and plankton groups the changes in tl estimates caused by using the revised food web resulted in a re ordering and expansion of the system s trophic flow table 1 the base model had tls up to 4 58 with large oceanic piscivores occupying the top of the food web followed by coastal sharks tl 4 41 and pelagic coastal piscivores tl 4 34 employing the revised diet matrix resulted in a food web where adult spanish mackerel had the largest tl tl 4 91 followed by large oceanic piscivores tl 4 85 and benthic oceanic piscivores tl 4 83 total mortality rates equated to p b s section 2 1 1 were similar across the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath because they were defined before initiating the mass balance process and therefore were unchanged during the mass balance process however specifying elevated red tide mortality and or employing the revised diet matrix often had an impact on the relative importance of the different sources of mortality of a functional group fig 7 and appendix fig a 1 as expected specifying elevated red tide mortality increased the contribution of red tide mortality to the total mortality for all functional groups vulnerable to red tide because total mortality rate did not change for any functional group ecopath accommodated increased red tide mortality by reducing the contribution of natural mortality to the total natural mortality fig 7 this was particularly the case for adult gag demersal coastal invertebrate feeders and adult red grouper epinephelus morio specifying elevated red tide mortality slightly reduced the contribution of fishing mortality to the total mortality of nearshore planktivores and large groupers fig 7 by contrast using the revised diet matrix resulted in an increased contribution of fishing mortality to total mortality for some of the functional groups which was accomplished by a reduction of the contribution of natural mortality to total mortality the largest increases in fishing mortality occurred for large groupers and the other fishes group fig 7 moreover employing the revised diet caused the contribution of red tide mortality to total mortality to increase for nearshore planktivores and large groupers fig 7 results for the elevated hab mortality and revised diet model suggest that changes in mortality patterns are not influenced by the interaction between elevated red tide mortality and the revised diet matrix fig 7 and appendix fig a 1 3 4 trophic structure amongst the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath 3 4 1 mixed trophic impact mti analysis elevated red tide mortality rates had minor impacts on the outcomes of the mti analysis appendix figs c 1 c 4 whereas using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath greatly altered the mti outcomes appendix fig c 5 changes in mti indices were the most common amongst functional groups of macrofauna first using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath reduced or reversed some of the negative impacts amongst some fish groups appendix fig c 5 for instance in the base model large oceanic piscivores had some of the largest negative impacts on functional groups i e large oceanic piscivores 0 72 adult gray snapper 0 44 mackerels 0 33 whereas these impacts were reduced or reversed in the revised diet model e g 0 01 0 14 and 0 001 respectively second using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath resulted in the amplification or creation of positive impacts between fish groups appendix fig c 5 for instance in the base model nearshore planktivores had minor positive impacts on juvenile ladyfish 0 12 and adult ladyfish 0 03 whereas these positive impacts were amplified in the revised diet model 0 53 and 0 28 respectively third benthic groups primarily benefited teleosts in both the base and revised diet models yet the positive impacts of benthic groups on teleosts were stronger in the revised diet model appendix fig c 5 this was particularly notable for adult shrimps which generally had a very strong positive impact on teleosts when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath e g juvenile gray snapper 0 52 demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 50 juvenile lane snapper l synagris 0 47 adult lane snapper 0 45 fourth there were a few instances where substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath led to an amplification of negative impacts from biota appendix fig c 5 this was particularly notable for squids which had a very strong negative impact on many functional groups in the revised diet model e g pelagic oceanic jelly feeders 0 47 nearshore planktivores 0 35 demersal coastal piscivores 0 34 the mti analyses conducted for the base and revised diet wfs hab ecopath models indicated that biota positively influenced fishing fleets while fishing fleets negatively influenced biota appendix fig c 5 however employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath caused an intensification of some of the negative impacts that fishing fleets had on marine biota while having no influence on the positive impacts that biota had on fishing fleets appendix fig c 5 the intensification of the negative impacts of fishing fleets on biota were particularly notable for the trawl and recreational fleets in the base model the most deleterious impact from trawls was upon benthic oceanic piscivores 0 30 whereas in the revised diet model trawls had more prevalent intense deleterious impacts on biota e g benthic oceanic piscivores 0 71 demersal oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 71 benthic oceanic invertebrate feeders 0 5 in the base model the most deleterious impact from the recreational fleet was upon adult gag 0 44 whereas in the revised diet model the recreational fleet had more intense and negative impacts on biota e g adult grey snapper 0 75 juvenile red grouper 0 50 adult gag 0 43 moreover employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath resulted in the longline fleet as the only fishing fleet with a notably positive impact on biota juvenile gag 0 87 this may be a result of the long line fleet reducing the seabird predation on juvenile gag given the strong negative impact the longline fleet has on seabirds 0 88 and the strong negative impact seabirds have on juvenile gag 0 97 mti indices from the red tide pseudo fleet were predominantly negative across impacted groups for all wfs hab ecopath models however red tide impacts were influenced by both specifying elevated red tide mortality and using the revised diet matrix fig 8 deleterious impacts from red tide were the least intense in the base model because the structure of the wfs ecosystem in the base model was characterized by a very weak red tide event gray 2014 employing the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath amplified the negative impacts of red tide on some functional groups and fishing fleets fig 8 including skates and rays 0 68 juvenile red drum sciaenops ocellatus 0 64 adult red grouper 0 18 the red grouper fleet 0 18 nearshore associated piscivores 0 15 adult gag 0 15 and sea turtles 0 13 there were some instances where using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath alleviated the negative mti indices associated with the red tide pseudo fleet e g demersal coastal invertebrate feeders or promoted positive mtis from the red tide pseudo fleet e g structure associated invertebrate feeders and juvenile blue crab callinectes sapidus as expected specifying elevated red tide mortality in wfs hab ecopath amplified the impacts from red tide appendix figs c 3 and c 4 3 4 2 overall impact ε indices substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath had an impact on ε indices fig 9 whereas elevating red tide mortality had no impact on ε indices appendix table c 1 overall the ε indices in the revised diet model differed from the base model with adult shrimps displaying the largest increase in the ε index with the revised diet matrix followed by seabirds fig 9 the increased overall impacts from seabirds as well as dolphins were particularly noteworthy as these groups are often underdeveloped in end to end models goedegebuure et al 2017 pelagic coastal piscivores had the second largest decrease in the ε index with the revised diet matrix following juvenile striped mullet fig 9 while the base model suggested that pelagic coastal piscivores had the largest impact on ecosystem structure ε 1 52 the revised diet model suggested that adult shrimps filled that role ε 1 35 pelagic coastal piscivores still had a relatively large impact in the revised diet model ε 0 92 but by contrast adult shrimps had no significant impact in the base model ε 0 38 third dolphins ε 1 18 squid ε 1 17 structure associated invertebrate feeders ε 1 15 and sardine herring ε 1 06 had relatively large impacts in the revised diet model while small mobile epifauna ε 1 26 and sardines herrings ε 1 21 had relatively large impacts in the base model lastly both the base and revised diet models resulted in manatees having the weakest influence on the structure of the wfs ecosystem ε 0 001 for both models 3 4 3 omnivory indices oi substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath impacted omnivory indices fig 10 while elevating red tide mortality had no impact on omnivory indices appendix table c 2 the majority of functional groups 53 had higher omnivory indices in the revised diet model indicating that groups had a tendency to be more omnivorous in this model the omnivory index increased the most for juvenile pinfish base oi 0 08 revised diet oi 0 69 and surface pelagics displayed the highest omnivory index in both models base oi 0 86 revised diet oi 1 01 about 30 of the functional groups became less omnivorous and more selective in the revised diet model the omnivory index decreased the most for juvenile striped mullet between models base oi 0 55 revised diet oi 0 19 the system omnivory index i e the average omnivory index of all consumers weighted by the logarithm of each consumers food intake christensen et al 2008 from the base model was 0 22 which is comparable to other models of the gulf of mexico okey et al 2004 sagarese et al 2017 the revised diet model exhibited a slightly less omnivorous system oi 0 20 because groups with higher weighted food intakes had a tendency to have reduced omnivory indices in the revised diet model appendix table c 2 4 discussion in the present study we estimated a revised diet matrix for an ecopath model describing the structure of the wfs ecosystem from a large empirical diet dataset the revised diet matrix had around 340 predator prey linkages that were not present in the diet matrix used in the base wfs hab ecopath model thus the revised diet matrix represented a more complex food web however there were some predator prey linkages in the base diet matrix that were not retained in the revised diet matrix because of the low frequency of those predator prey interactions in the diet dataset employed in the present study the more complex food web estimated for the wfs resulted in a reduction of the predation mortality rates of many of the prey groups represented in the wfs hab ecopath model including many prey groups that are directly affected by red tides e g adult gag juvenile red grouper adult red grouper a large reduction in predation mortality rates may be reasonable for adult fish groups but less so for juvenile fish groups such as juvenile red grouper as these juvenile fishes are generally reported to suffer high predation mortality rates in the wild sogard 1997 almany and webster 2006 to accurately estimate juvenile fish predation mortality rates additional collection of predatory fish stomachs in the wfs region will be needed particularly in coastal e g estuarine habitats where the bulk of juvenile fishes occur in addition dna barcoding for prey identification sakaguchi et al 2017 or a combination of dna barcoding and stable isotope analyses may further elucidate the energy flow of the wfs ecosystem carreon martinez and heath 2010 tarnecki and patterson 2015 nelson et al 2017 as well as help us to properly distinguish between short term and long term diet trends in the wfs region kroetz et al 2017 nelson et al 2017 substituting the base diet matrix with the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model had a large impact on trophic level estimates but generally not on basic parameters estimated in balancing ecopath this was not surprising as many of the other basic parameters of ecopath were specified rather than estimated during the mass balance process and unchanged amongst the alternative models considered in this study adult pinfish had the largest increase in trophic level between the base model and the revised diet model 2 97 and 3 98 respectively findings from previous studies suggest that the trophic level for this group within the wfs should be above 3 hansen 1969 estimated that pinfish had a trophic level up to 3 4 in florida estuaries while motta et al 1995 found that pinfish had a trophic level of 3 2 in apalachee bay florida mullet groups mugil spp had the largest decrease in trophic levels between the base model and the revised diet model from 2 24 to 2 03 for adults and 2 32 to 2 17 for juveniles this resulted from sediment detritus being the primary food source for mullet groups in the revised diet matrix as indicated by the hierarchical cluster analyses the trophic level of mugilids can vary greatly from one species to another and from one region to another whitfield 2016 but reduced trophic levels obtained with the revised diet matrix are reasonable for the wfs collins 1981 found that mullets primarily fed on macrophytic detritus 40 and sand shell particles 56 off seahorse key florida and on sediment particles 53 and algae 32 in crystal river florida a majority of functional groups had larger trophic level estimates in wfs hab ecopath upon employing the revised diet matrix which expanded the ecosystem structure modeled in wfs hab ecopath this is a significant implication of revising the diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath as truncated marine food webs oversimplify the fish community masking higher trophic levels and their associated interactions which can bias ecosystem based fisheries management advice derived from ecopath outputs hussey et al 2014 pelagic coastal piscivores was the most impactful group in wfs hab ecopath when the base diet matrix was employed due to their strong negative impacts on several teleost functional groups similar observations were made with other ecosystem models of the gulf of mexico e g sagarese et al 2017 however many of the negative impacts of pelagic coastal piscivores were reduced when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath subsequently reducing their trophic interaction strength in fact several top predator groups had reduced trophic interaction strengths when the revised diet matrix was used in wfs hab ecopath including benthic oceanic piscivores coastal sharks and large oceanic piscivores it is likely that the base diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath was over representing top down pressures from some of the top predatory groups as it was based on sparse cursory information and that the revised diet matrix improves the representation of these pressures as it is based on wfs survey data it is worth noting that the revised diet matrix could be reflecting a reduction in top down pressures as there is nearly a 20 year difference between the original development of the base diet matrix okey and mahmoudi 2002 okey et al 2004 and the development of the revised diet matrix which was estimated from diet data collected mainly over the last ten years although highly debated in the literature the reduction of top down pressures due to changes in the populations of top predators e g loss of abundance shifts in habitats could have negative impacts on local ecosystems heithaus et al 2008 terborgh and estes 2010 boaden and kingsford 2015 including leading to more pronounced hab impacts walsh et al 2011 this study does not provide evidence of reduced top down pressures especially considering that some top predator groups had increased trophic interaction strengths when the revised diet matrix was employed in wfs hab ecopath including seabirds dolphins and benthic coastal piscivores however future studies involving the wfs hab ecopath model such as exploring dynamic simulations using the revised diet matrix should bear in mind the ecosystem impacts from changing trophic pressures as they will likely have important implications for resource management efforts squids and adult shrimp were the most impactful groups when the revised diet matrix was fed into the wfs hab ecopath model by contrast squids and adult shrimp had no significant impact in wfs hab ecopath when the base diet matrix was employed when using the revised diet matrix squids had a strong negative impact on a variety of groups in wfs hab ecopath e g jellyfish eaters nearshore planktivores demersal piscivores pinfish and ladyfish squids have been identified as playing an essential role in the biological transfer of energy in a variety of marine ecosystems including the south brazil bight gasalla et al 2010 the eastern pacific nigmatullin et al 2001 shchetinnikov 1988 and the antarctic polar frontal zone rodhouse and white 1995 additionally coll et al 2013 found that the ecological role of squid occupying the neritic zone may be important as across a variety of ecopath models squid had strong top down control on their prey and were important prey for top predators thus it is plausible that squids play a critical role in the trophic structure of the wfs ecosystem and that the revised diet matrix better reflected this role in wfs hab ecopath when using the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model adult shrimp had a strong positive impact on a variety of the modeled groups including groups of snappers groupers and demersal coastal invertebrate feeders shrimps are known for strongly influencing benthic communities e g march et al 2002 and to be essential for the recycling of nutrients e g welsh 1975 additionally fujiwara et al 2016 found significant associations between shrimp abundance and the catch rates of fish in some regions of the gulf of mexico thus it is plausible that the role adult shrimp have in the trophic structure of the wfs ecosystem was previously underrepresented and that the revised diet matrix better reflects this role indeed any scenario entailing large changes in squid and or adult shrimp mortality rates tested with wfs hab ewe using the revised diet matrix will very likely result in major changes in the dynamics of the simulated wfs ecosystem sala and sugihara 2005 substituting the revised diet matrix into the wfs hab ecopath model drove the minor differences in prebal diagnostics we observed appendix b although a majority of the prebal diagnostics for the alternative versions of wfs hab ecopath were met suggesting that model inputs and estimates were biologically reasonable some were not met this may be acceptable link 2010 heymans et al 2016 yet we recommend future studies to complete an extended evaluation of the performance of wfs hab ecopath to ensure the information extracted from this model that is used to assist resource management efforts is as robust as possible heymans et al 2016 overall this study found that compared to the base diet matrix of wfs hab ecopath the revised diet matrix estimated in this study had higher connectivity amongst functional groups more generalist predators and more omnivorous groups these features are observed in a large number of marine food webs particularly highly diverse ecosystems like the wfs link 2002 dunne et al 2004 shurin et al 2006 thompson et al 2007 diet matrices generally represent a mere portion of the complexity of real ecosystems the increased connectivity and intricacy amongst functional groups provided by the revised diet matrix suggests an improved representation of an inherently complex and highly diverse marine ecosystem moreover as indicated earlier the wfs hab ecopath model using the revised diet matrix is less likely to predict unreasonably high predation mortality rates due to specific predators particularly for juvenile fishes as prey items are generally consumed by a broader diversity of predators in the model sagarese et al 2017 therefore we conclude that as a starting point to evaluate the dynamic and spatio temporal impacts of habs and other ecosystem perturbations using the revised diet matrix in the wfs hab ecopath model is more reliable than using the diet matrix previously fed into wfs hab ecopath that being said food web complexity and omnivory are often used to assess ecosystem stability but no clear patterns between food web connectivity or omnivory and ecosystem stability have been established landi et al 2018 we did not evaluate the impacts of the revised diet matrix on ecosystem stability but future studies considering network approaches energy flow analyses and food web descriptors e g weighted connectance van altena et al 2016 could explore this issue landi et al 2018 negative impacts of the fleets i e red tides and fisheries intensified in wfs hab ecopath when the revised diet matrix was employed confirming the concerns expressed in gray dileone and ainsworth 2019 about the limitations of wfs hab ecopath due to the uncertainty of the base diet matrix this suggests that part of the vulnerability to habs is due to feeding dependencies as opposed to direct toxicological effects the negative impacts of the red tide pseudo fleet intensified for most of the functional groups vulnerable to red tides particularly for the skate ray complex and juvenile red drum the intensification of red tide impacts on juvenile red drum seems reasonable given that red drum recruitment declined markedly in 2005 and 2006 seemingly due to the severe hab event that took place in 2005 flaherty and landsberg 2011 moreover sagarese et al 2017 found the skate ray complex to be particularity vulnerable to red tides within the u s gulf of mexico using the revised diet matrix in wfs hab ecopath also intensified the negative impacts of the red tide pseudo fleet on gag and red grouper as well as the negative impacts of the recreational fleet on these two species thus the negative impacts of recreational fishing and red tides on gag and red grouper may have been underestimated in the previous versions of wfs hab ecopath that aimed to inform gag and red grouper assessments gray et al 2013 sagarese et al 2015 this may explain why the red grouper mortality rates predicted by sagarese et al 2015 did not reflect the large mortality rates suggested by field observations this work represents an important advancement in the progression of ecosystem modeling tools for assisting resource management efforts for the wfs the next step is to use the wfs hab ecopath model with the revised diet matrix to conduct dynamic simulations with the ecosim component of wfs hab ewe we demonstrated the strong influence diet has on the trophic structure estimated by the wfs hab ecopath model and the more complex structure estimated by wfs hab ecopath is likely to imply very different dynamics over time in ecosim thus the quantified uncertainty ranges in diet proportions we presented could be used to explore the impacts of diet uncertainty on advice for resource management based on dynamic simulations with ecosim koehn et al 2016 morzaria luna et al 2018 bentley et al 2019 although we found that elevated red tide mortalities had virtually no impact on the trophic structure of wfs hab ecopath they did impact specific functional groups and could have stronger impacts in dynamic simulations with ecosim future work should explore the impacts of uncertainty in the hab mortality driver of wfs hab ecopath which is based on anecdotal observations reported to the fwri fish kill database due to the lack of quantitative information on fish kills driggers et al 2016 sagarese et al 2017 finally red tide blooms in the wfs can vary significantly in space and over time steidinger and haddad 1981 steidinger and vargo 1988 and the catch potential of targeted and bycatch species may increase during red tide blooms due to denser spatial patterns craig et al 2005 craig 2012 therefore extending the wfs hab ewe model to an ecospace model in order to simulate the spatio temporal dynamics of red tides o farrell et al 2017 would allow for the estimation of red tide mortality rates based on the degree of spatial overlap between red tides and the functional groups that are vulnerable to them in conclusion we found that using a large empirical diet database to develop a more complex and more realistic diet matrix profoundly changed key ecological processes in wfs hab ecopath pertinent for exploring hab impacts and other important resource management questions in particular hab mortality rates with the revised diet matrix were higher and more consistent with field observations for gag and red grouper which are some of the species most effected by habs these findings show the importance of having accurate and up to date diet data when using ecosystem models to infer the impacts of ecosystem perturbations such as habs throughout the food web author contributions designed and analyzed the models

24928,climate change is expected to cause major changes in forest ecosystems during the 21st century and beyond to assess forest impacts from climate change the existing empirical information must be structured harmonised and assimilated into a form suitable to develop and test state of the art forest and ecosystem models the combination of empirical data collected at large spatial and long temporal scales with suitable modelling approaches is key to understand forest dynamics under climate change to facilitate data and model integration we identified major climate change impacts observed on european forest functioning and summarised the data available for monitoring and predicting such impacts our analysis of c 120 forest related databases including information from remote sensing vegetation inventories dendroecology palaeoecology eddy flux sites common garden experiments and genetic techniques and 50 databases of environmental drivers highlights a substantial degree of data availability and accessibility however some critical variables relevant to predicting european forest responses to climate change are only available at relatively short time frames up to 10 20 years including intra specific trait variability defoliation patterns tree mortality and recruitment moreover we identified data gaps or lack of data integration particularly in variables related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity dispersal capabilities and physiological responses overall we conclude that forest data availability across europe is improving but further efforts are needed to integrate harmonise and interpret this data i e making data useable for non experts continuation of existing monitoring and networks schemes together with the establishments of new networks to address data gaps is crucial to rigorously predict climate change impacts on european forests keywords climatic extremes data accessibility data integration drivers forest responses to climate change harmonisation open access 1 introduction changes in mean and extreme climatic conditions are affecting forest functioning worldwide frank et al 2015 eea 2017 seidl et al 2017 understanding and predicting these impacts is necessary for science based decisions but challenging because climate change interacts with other drivers of global change such as rising atmospheric co2 cramer et al 2001 atmospheric deposition de vries et al 2014 land use change linares et al 2009 garcía valdés et al 2015 pests and invasive species krumm vitková 2016 liu et al 2017 and management and legacy effects baudena et al 2015 motta et al 2015 morales molino et al 2017a ruiz benito et al 2017b moreover ecosystems react to climate change in complex ways for example through stabilizing processes lloret et al 2012 such as positive biotic interactions ruiz benito et al 2017a or local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity valladares et al 2014 benito garzón et al 2019 but also with destabilizing non linear responses and feedbacks that could trigger tipping points camarero et al 2015 reyer et al 2015 to support the crucial role of forests in maintaining key ecosystem services decision makers must adapt forests for the future messier et al 2013 ipcc 2014 to aid this process it is therefore critically important to rapidly increase our ability to predict forest responses and vulnerability to climate change urban et al 2016 the use of empirical data at large spatial and or long temporal extents in combination with suitable models is one of the most powerful tools for better understanding forest function predicting vulnerability to climate change and assessing options for mitigation and adaptation see e g mouquet et al 2015 during the last few decades there has been a steady development in modelling techniques franklin et al 2016 aimed at better understanding and or predicting species occurrence and abundance e g dormann et al 2012 or forests dynamics and functioning e g gap models or dynamic global vegetation models dgvms see e g bugmann et al 2001 cramer et al 2001 available models range from empirical to process based approaches and from modelling local processes and dynamics up to global vegetation and general ecosystem models fig 1 while there is a general agreement about the importance of assessing and predicting ecosystem responses to climate change ipcc 2014 there are multiple modelling approaches available to understand and predict climate change impacts quantitatively designed to answer specific questions at different scales and using different data fig 1 the mechanisms and processes limiting model predictions at large geographical scales are under particularly intense debate see e g mouquet et al 2015 franklin et al 2016 seidl 2017 furthermore forests are complex socio ecological systems and predictions can be theory limited because forest functioning depends on multiple spatial and temporal responses and scales that depend on species composition garcía valdés et al 2018 morin et al 2018 and may include thresholds or tipping points camarero et al 2015 reyer et al 2015 jump et al 2017 interactive effects scheffer et al 2001 phenological responses chuine régnière 2017 and adaptation or time dependent processes lloret et al 2012 a final challenge is the integration of models and data and in particular the ability to adequately parameterise and test models at large spatial scales hartig et al 2012 a key component to understand and predict forest responses to climate change is the extent resolution and quality of associated environmental data such as climate soils or nitrogen deposition for example environmental drivers are often themselves based on model outputs not only of future predictions but also of past levels uncertainty about the future trajectory of the climate system which largely depends on socio economic development can further impact prediction accuracy purves pacala 2008 garcía valdés et al 2018 moreover much of the available data on observed impacts is not yet integrated and understood in the wider context of whole ecosystem functioning for example climate change effects on shifting the time of flowering but see chuine et al 2016 ascoli et al 2017b tree mortality episodes greenwood et al 2017 or large wildfires pausas et al 2008 have been quantified but they are generally not included in many forest vulnerability assessments impacts of climate change across european forests are occurring at all biological levels of organisation at the tree level decreased water availability or temperature stress might induce functional adjustments in respiration water use efficiency hydraulic conductivity resource allocation reproductive efforts or phenology and root to shoot allocation patterns penuelas et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 which can ultimately influence reproduction growth and mortality lambers et al 2008 at the population level plant demography drives forest responses to climate change martínez vilalta lloret 2016 ruiz benito et al 2017b depending on local adaptation to climate pedlar mckenney 2017 fréjaville et al in review changes in tree growth and productivity are contingent on ecosystem type and water availability e g vayreda et al 2012 ruiz benito et al 2014 and individual responses to drought have been linked to long term species composition changes galiano et al 2013 martínez vilalta lloret 2016 at the ecosystem level heat waves have been shown to have an overall depressing effect on net primary productivity ciais et al 2005 reichstein et al 2013 the combination of increased atmospheric co2 nitrogen deposition pollution and climate change is also considered a key factor in tree decline and ecosystem level responses e g de vries et al 2014 furthermore several studies indicate altitudinal and latitudinal shifts in species distribution and functional types across europe see appendix a attributable in many cases not to climate change alone but with substantial interactions with herbivory release secondary succession or forest management peñuelas boada 2003 ruiz benito et al 2017b to adequately identify potential risks and to establish future research and management priorities the scientific community governments and other interested parties need well structured easily accessible and usable empirical data often at large temporal and spatial scales multiple types levels and sources of data are currently available which can be harmonised to make compatible and comparable databases gtos 1998 and prepare them to be suitable for model based analyses the aim of this paper is to support studies predicting forest responses and vulnerability to climate change by assessing the availability and accessibility of harmonised databases of forest functioning and underlying environmental drivers at the european scale firstly based on a literature review we identified the main types of forest response to climate change and the underlying interacting drivers then based on expert knowledge we researched the different data types available genetic eddy flux measurement experimental or observational field techniques tree ring palaeoecological and remote sensing techniques to assess their ability to inform about climate change impacts fig 2 additionally we highlight the main data gaps and biases to predict climate change impacts on forests across europe 2 availability of data indicating forest responses to climate change forest responses to climate change are measured with different survey techniques that cover a range of spatial and temporal scales see fig 3 and appendix b genetic data show local adaptation to climate over generations eddy flux measurements provide continuous data on local productivity at 0 5 1 hour resolution up to more than 20 years vegetation inventories from local to regional scales cover show one 10 year changes across decadal to 100 year time scale dendrochronological data at local scales show yearly growth data over up to 5000 years palaeoecological techniques at local scale cover long temporal scales millennial data and remote sensing data rs with high temporal and spatial resolution continental for space borne remote sensing regional for airborne remote sensing and local for ground based remote sensing table 1 over a few years to multiple decades the availability of these data varies from fully open access to restricted access i e where the data is completely available for users or it is only available under request or a licence for a particular project see table 1 2 1 genetic and phylogenetic diversity local adaptation and plasticity the capacity for genetic and phylogenetic tree diversity estimation is progressing rapidly thanks to ecological genomics holliday et al 2017 the increase in genomic data allow us to understand the association between allelic frequencies and environmental gradients fitzpatrick keller 2015 plant phylogenies are available for a large number of species see e g zanne et al 2014 appendix b and it is being used to further estimate phylogenetic diversity at the european scale van der plas et al 2018 in europe adaptive genetic responses to climate using snps data are only available for a few species jaramillo correa et al 2015 local adaptation and plasticity are the main sources of intraspecific variation and should be considered when evaluating species responses to climate change because within species ecological responses abundance biomass community composition are often greater than across species des roches et al 2018 and predictions of species responses due to climate change can differ when intra specific variability is taken into account moran et al 2016 sánchez salguero et al 2018 benito garzón et al 2019 phenotypic measurements of fitness related traits such as tree diameter height phenology growth and or survival from known genotypes at different locations can inform models about the amount of phenotypic trait variation attributable to local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity of populations moran et al 2016 phenotypic variation has been traditionally measured in common gardens i e genetic trials or provenance tests see appendix b and has been established for most commercial tree species it provides information about plasticity i e one provenance planted in several common gardens with different environments and local adaptation of populations i e several provenances planted in one common garden savolainen et al 2013 2 2 plant phenotype physiology traits and phenology physiological parameters have traditionally been measured either in experimentally controlled conditions or in observational studies where the physiological outputs are highly dependent on environmental conditions species interactions and adaptation mechanisms eddy flux measurements and new remote sensing products have the potential to further elucidate plant physiological responses the eddy covariance networks are particularly important for quantifying the spatial differences and temporal dynamics in co2 and water vapour exchange across large abiotic and biotic gradients estimates of water use efficiency at large spatial extents and gross primary productivity gpp e g lasslop et al 2012 wohlfahrt galvagno 2017 can both be derived from eddy flux data meanwhile in many flux observation sites other important biometric measurements such as soil respiration rates are reported as so called ancillary data these additional data allow for a more analytical view on the net fluxes and their partitioning into individual components of the forest carbon cycle enabling the portioning of ecosystem respiration into heterotrophic and autotrophic components see e g rodeghiero cescatti 2006 brændholt et al 2018 the availability of new space borne instruments enable measuring sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif which offers a more direct link to plant physiology dobrowski et al 2005 and a promising way to quantify gross primary production from space grace et al 2007 global phenology and model parameterisation have long been estimated through earth observation methods e g justice et al 1985 ahl et al 2006 hmimina et al 2013 white et al 2014 long term passive optical data from programmes such as avhrr landsat and modis nasa have been used to quantify decadal forest cover change on a near global scale e g hansen et al 2013 such data have also been combined with ground measurements to detect climate driven changes in temperate forest phenology over long time scales piao et al 2006 keenan et al 2014 and phenological changes associated with the spread of invasive species ramsey et al 2005 however data availability about phenological changes is scarce see appendix b and a good understanding or predictive models of phenological responses are critical to further understand climate change consequences delpierre et al 2019 2 3 forest demography and structure forest demography can be assessed using vegetation inventories tree ring data or remote sensing data regional national and continental inventories see appendix b are useful tools to estimate forest demographic processes such as tree growth mortality and recruitment at the individual tree kunstler et al 2016 neumann et al 2017 or plot level carnicer et al 2014 ruiz benito et al 2017a at regular intervals often each c 10 years recruitment data in systematic inventories have been successfully harmonised for saplings height between 30 and 130 cm across single censuses in europe ruiz benito et al 2017a van der plas et al 2018 but recruitment data contain differential information about tree seedlings in addition recruitment data rarely contain time series records dispersion information or individual tree information required to understand forest responses to climate change tree and site level radial growth at longer time spans and annual time steps can be obtained from tree ring and remote sensing data which allow retrospective and prospective characterisations of forest responses including forest resistance and resilience to short and long term climatic changes briffa et al 1998 anderegg et al 2015 gazol et al 2018 re surveyed plots from airborne remote sensing allow for monitoring of structural dynamics such as forest growth yu et al 2004 and large surveys can determine stand successional stage falkowski et al 2009 at stand level remote sensing allow also capturing long term canopy defoliation and tree mortality senf et al 2018 table 1 forest structure can be characterised by density basal area volume biomass or crown metrics at tree or plot level obtained from vegetation inventories or remote sensing data fig 3 table 1 systematic vegetation inventories generally measure tree level diameter height allowing a direct calculation of plot level basal area or tree density and indirect volume or biomass estimates through the application of species specific allometric equations montero et al 2005 zianis et al 2005 annighöfer et al 2016 some national forest inventories measure the position of each tree within a plot enabling the calculation of distance dependent competition indices and tree to tree interactions gómez aparicio et al 2011 kunstler et al 2016 although small plots can lead to biased predictions hynynen ojansuu 2003 tree height and diameter are common inventory variables that can also be obtained from airborne lidar and ground based remote sensing with higher accuracy than inventory based calculations zolkos et al 2013 lidar can provide sub metre accuracy of surface heights lefsky et al 2002 lee et al 2010 although accuracy can vary with canopy height and distribution hopkinson chasmer 2009 ground slope breidenbach et al 2008 and sampling intensity hyyppä

measurement lefsky et al 2002 mascaro et al 2011 simonson et al 2016 there is enormous potential to develop large spatial and temporal scale datasets when combining these different data types e g the spatially continuous height age biomass and carbon information derived from nfi and modis data mäkisara et al 2016 moreno et al 2017 biomass or wood volume can be estimated at the global scale from space borne remote sensing as passive microwave data liu et al 2015 passive optical data e g from landsat avitabile et al 2012 and sar data from l band mitchard et al 2011 and c band instruments santoro et al 2010 but the latter methods typically require calibration using ground data rodríguez veiga et al 2017 sar biomass estimates are calculated using backscatter coefficients related to wood volume scattering mechanisms and or allometry using height estimates derived through polarimetric interferometry polinsar mette et al 2004 le toan et al 2011 space borne lidar icesat glas has been used to quantify biomass at the global scale simard et al 2011 and popescu et al 2011 suggest close correlations to airborne equivalents the use of sar for forest monitoring is likely to increase with the missions expected over the next decade e g biomass nisar and saocom 1 space borne remote sensing data provide long term and large scale information about crown structure as the leaf area index lai

structure percentage canopy hits riaño et al 2004 and radiative transfer models tang et al 2012 this approach avoids the saturation issue inherent in passive optical estimates peduzzi et al 2012 and has been found to be more accurate than passive optical equivalents derived from modis data jensen et al 2011 and the globcarbon product zhao popescu 2009 airborne sar systems have the capacity to measure similar structural properties as lidar given their sensitivity to complex forest structure lausch et al 2017 both correlative balzter et al 2007 and physically based approaches ningthoujam et

branches as e g biomass or packing palace et al 2016 are not captured by traditional vegetation inventories terrestrial laser scanning tls offers an efficient and accurate alternative to measure fine scale forest attributes seidel et al 2015 srinivasan et al 2015 such as height srinivasan et al 2015 diameter kankare et al 2013 biomass yu et al 2013 calders et al 2015 canopy characteristics

srinivasan et al 2015 allowing upscaling airborne lidar measurements hancock et al 2017 however tls data is available locally because it requires specific fieldwork and the management of a high volume of data 2 4 species or functional occurrence abundance and diversity species or functional type occurrence and abundance data can be calculated from data generally available in vegetation inventories palaeoecological or remote sensing data data on actual species distribution in europe tends to come from individual field based observations e g the worldwide database gbif and current knowledge e g euforgen or european maps from jrc see a complete list in appendix b the systematic information from nfis gathered at regional or national level and international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests icp forests gathered at european level provides large scale and long term information about the state of forests appendix b systematic vegetation inventories provide detailed information on tree species occurrence and abundance generally through basal area or density measurements with a good spatial coverage within europe across biomes but over a relatively short time span see appendix b and mauri et al 2017 long term changes in species occurrence and abundance in response to environmental variability can be assessed through fossil pollen and plant macrofossils data morales molino et al 2017b despite the uneven spatial distribution and the relatively low taxonomic and spatial temporal resolution of palaoecological data the long time span they usually cover allows to assess ecosystem dynamics during past periods of abrupt climate change see table 1 like the younger dryas holocene transition rapid and marked warming dated c 11700 years ago or the 8 2 ka event abrupt cooling centered at c 8200 years ago for instance fossil pollen data have been successfully used to document changes in the distribution and abundance of the main plant genera of european vegetation over the last 15 000 years giesecke et al 2017 similarly plant macrofossils represent an interesting proxy to infer past distribution ranges as they often allow more precise plant identifications even to species level than pollen plant macrofossils are unequivocal indicators for past plant local presence due to their limited dispersal and are often directly dated therefore reducing uncertainty about their age birks birks 2000 when reliable age estimates based on radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils and robust age depth models are available palaeoecological data allow accurate assessments on the responses of forest species to past climate changes which can in turn be used to validate projected vegetation responses to future climate change diversity metrics can be calculated from systematic vegetation inventories including tree and shrub richness functional types or even functional or phylogenetic measurements when merged with trait phylogenetic data ruiz benito et al 2017a or specific field based trait measurements vilà cabrera et al 2015 plant trait information and plant phylogeny is available for a large number of plants see e g the try database try db org kattge et al 2011 or zanne et al 2014 appendix b and it is being used to further estimate functional or phylogenetic diversity paquette messier 2011 tree species diversity is not directly available from medium resolution open access earth observation data such as landsat or modis however several studies have demonstrated the potential for predicting species

link species composition with forest dynamics huesca et al 2015 other studies have used the spectral variation hypothesis which links spectral heterogeneity in the reflectance signal to environmental heterogeneity and therefore species diversity gould 2000 palmer et al 2002 rocchini et al 2007 rocchini et al 2016 fine spatial resolution imagery has been used to identify tree species within forest

al 2008 but such data are usually complex to analyse or costly to obtain limiting their use for mapping diversity at a regional or continental scale furthermore structural and topographical information derived from airborne lidar can also provide information on tree species richness simonson et al 2012 hernández stefanoni et al 2014 lopatin et al 2016 vaglio laurin et al 2016 3 availability and accessibility of harmonised data at the european level 3 1 forest responses harmonised data on forest conditions is available in multiple global and european scale databases see appendix b and a summary in table 3 and range from open to restricted access table 2 for open access databases citation and acknowledgment is usually mandatory for more restricted datasets the data managers or contributors can request authorship as a prerequisite for access e g some harmonised nfi databases common garden experiments table 2 harmonised data at the european extent is generally of high quality i e well structured and documented in some cases data use does not require a high degree of expertise e g processed or combined remote sensing products but it requires managing large volumes of data in others the use of data requires a medium high degree of expertise as e g when managing unprocessed inventory data tree ring or palaeoecological data table 2 the data products of individual observational or experimental studies are increasingly being published online thanks to research networks public repositories and more recently data papers gaining increasing attraction however whether scientific data should be freely accessible is under an intense debate gewin 2016 and often there is a low replicability even in journals with an established data policy stodden et al

techniques in input data such as plot size or sampling dates or sampling effects i e observation or measurement errors and over or under representation bias see table 2 genetic diversity e g allelic frequency data is not harmonised at the european level but see genbank database for specific queries of genes in plants table 2 appendix b and to our knowledge this type of data has not been used to study large scale forest responses to climate but see jaramillo correa et al 2015 however the improvements in the next generation of sequencing technologies is increasing the availability of open access databases neale kremer 2011 table 3 appendix b despite evidence that genotypes respond differently to climate change across the range of the species e g matías et al 2017 it can be difficult to measure genetic diversity and to incorporate it in predictive models of climate change effects kramer et al 2010 for example neutral diversity does not show direct effects of genetic variation on fitness and therefore it is not informative about the adaptative or evolutionary potential of the species holderegger et al 2006 however common gardens and provenance trials are an important source of knowledge on the effects of intra specific genetic and phenotypic variation on species response to different climates savolainen et al 2013 data harmonisation is not homogeneous for all data sources and the planting sites often do not include the entire distribution range of a given species but see compilations for pinus pinea l pinus pinaster ait pinus nigra arnold abies alba mill and fagus

european icos research infrastructures franz et al 2018 the availability and accessibility of vegetation inventories depend on the database owner varying from systematic vegetation inventories e g nfi or icp forests to specific databases from research network or data papers see appendix b several initiatives to harmonise nfis are being undertaken including cost actions tomppo et al 2010 european projects such as e g baccara http www baccara project eu fundiveurope http www fundiveurope eu baeten et al 2013 or diabolo http diabolo project eu and european networks such as enfin http www enfin info or global initiatives gfbi https www gfbinitiative org nfi data can be open or restricted access at country level but the data require error identification and harmonisation considerations e g minimum tree size or basal area management ratcliffe et al 2016 and harmonisation of heterogeneous databases as country level nfis should include standardisation steps to the final outputs harmonisation initiatives are resulting in the availability of nfi data at the european level such as species occurrence mauri et al 2017 or forest structure moreno et al 2017 icp plots include information about biodiversity and the health and vitality of forests for example canopy affectation by defoliation or and climate change interactions with other air pollutants de vries et al 2014 unece icp forests programme co ordinating centre 2016 the main data limitations are based on the temporal coverage of the data available since the 1980s and the importance of understanding the knowledge any sampling effects that might include the underrepresentation of large trees differential plot sizes and time intervals tree ring data are harmonised at global scale by noaa s international tree ring data bank itrdb table 2 and appendix b the itrdb provides long term growth information usually tree ring widths but also tree ring density data at tree stand and species levels that can be freely downloaded however most of the itrdb data refer to classical dendrochronological data i e cross dated tree ring series obtained from 10 20 dominant and climatically sensitive trees of the same species living in the same site stand or tree population often at climate sensitive sites usually authors analyse a chronology or mean series of the individual tree series from the same site certain considerations or data treatment is required to estimate climate impacts on the entire forest first the spatial and ecological extent of the chronologies is generally vague because the size of the site is rarely defined e g 0 5 1 ha second sampling is often biased towards dominant big trees of similar age classes from harsh sites where climate is the major constraint of radial growth which can lead to biased estimates of forest productivity and carbon uptake third there is an urgent requirement for better metadata for future tree ring series to be uploaded to the itrdb for instance tree size d b h and age are rarely reported and stand information as basal area or tree density is usually lacking but they are required to obtain useful estimates of radial growth e g basal area increment and carbon fixation from the tree ring data tree ring data from tropical forests are scarce at the itrdb partially due to the inherent difficulty of ring formation and cross dating in these tropical sites but itrdb data have been successfully used in global analyses e g anderegg et al 2015 palaeoecological data at the european level are harmonised in the neotoma paleoecology database neotoma and the european pollen database also accessible via neotoma see appendix b the main data limitations relate to the spatial coverage uneven distribution of sites across europe multisource and sampling effects i e time interval can differ between sampling sites neotoma and the epd are open access standardized databases of published palaecological records to foster broad scale global or continental scale vegetation and land use history studies williams et al 2018 pollen data can sometimes be difficult to use because 1 several plant species produce the same pollen type which limits the estimation of plant diversity or specific species presence but for woody taxa taxonomic resolution is usually high except for most european deciduous oaks that cannot be distinguished by their pollen 2 non uniform representativeness of pollen distribution for vegetation distribution due to species specific differences in pollen production dispersal deposition and preservation e g anemophilous tree species with high pollen production and dispersal ability as e g pinus sp are often overrepresented broström et al 2008 this bias can be corrected by using empirical species specific pollen productivity estimates ppes pearman et al 2008 3 pollen records mostly reflect vegetation structure and composition in an area whose size depends on the site and surface type usually lakes and mires sugita 1994 macrofossil records are less abundant than pollen sequences in europe especially in the mediterranean region similarly macrofossil data availability is still limited compared with pollen data see neotoma appendix b and most sequences are published as papers in specialised journals e g birks 2003 tinner kaltenrieder 2005 the availability of remote sensing information is vastly increasing thanks to recent technical advances kennedy et al 2014 but significant challenges remain to select process and interpret data provided in order to make them easily usable for forest assessment and management table 2 processed and combined products are now widely available and offer a great opportunity for use at european scale table 2 with the temporal coverage dependent on the specific platform and product appendix b there is an increasing amount of open access large scale airborne lidar data across europe generally at regional scale and the recently launched gedi mission will provide global coverage of spaceborne lidar though over a relative short duration appendix b tls has the potential to move forward forest inventory datasets by providing new structural measurements at fine spatial scales liang et al 2016 white et al 2016 as well as new means to determine uncertainty of forest properties quantified by spaceborne and airborne methods 3 2 environmental data climate databases at european or global levels differ in spatio temporal resolution and extent mean climatic conditions for the 20th century are often directly available at high spatial resolution and at global or european scales from databases such as worldclim e obs chelsa climatic research unit cru see table 3 and appendix b either for a certain period e g wordclim data provide mean values for 1970 2000 or even monthly values for each year e g e obs cru ts cru cl or cru sr appendix b temporal data on past temperature and precipitation i e daily monthly or yearly records are

fréjaville benito garzón 2018 and european climate data has been downscaled at 1 km2 for large temporal frameworks i e 1951 2012 see moreno hasenauer 2016 there is also an r packags available to

2017 and for europe at different spatial resolutions from the euro cordex https www hzg de ms euro cordex to cru database or wordclim see appendix b other environmental drivers include topographic information e g elevation slope and aspect soil classification and properties disturbance and management information atmospheric nitrogen or sulphur deposition and co2 concentrations etc topographic information can be easily obtained from digital elevation models at different resolutions e g from 2 m2 to 1 km2 table 3 the soil grid dataset https soilgrids org provides global information about site characteristics physical and chemical properties appendix b european soils data centre esdc and isric world soil information provide a wealth of soil science information and the fao a global soil organic carbon map which is mostly open access and directly downloadable at 1 km2 appendix b in addition to soil property and quality datasets the esdc hosts information on different soil functions and threats to soil functioning soil water content temperature and snowpack has been estimated from 1979 to 2010 in the era interim land at a resolution of 0 125 balsamo et al 2015 and soil organic carbon is mapped at 1 km2 resolution in the global soil organic carbon map appendix b however potential drivers of forest responses to climate change as soil fertility or water retention wardle et al 2008 is not easily accessible at detailed resolution for the european extent disturbances such as fires pests or pathogens are major drivers of forest vulnerability that can strongly interact with climate change e g pausas keeley 2009 palaeoecological records often include charcoal data to reconstruct changes in fire activity through long timescales which can be freely accessed and downloaded from the global charcoal database gcd power et al 2010 and neotoma williams et al 2018 the database of forest disturbances in europe dfde appendix b provides historical data on abiotic i e wind and snow damage and biotic pathogens and insects disturbance agents dfde has been used at the country scale to empirically parameterise landscape models to predict future disturbance levels under different climate change scenarios seidl et al 2014 european initiatives to record and disseminate forest disturbance information include the efi database european forest fire information system eu effis and the european storms catalogue appendix b however there is a considerable lack of geo referenced data on pest and alien species in european forests and they are poorly linked to other databases on forest health such as icp forests some initiatives involving citizen science are providing georeferenced data of forest pests at regional levels e g http www alertaforestal com es the european network of alien species easin provides access to records of alien species in europe via a mapping tool and a geo referenced database of published scientific reports easin lit appendix b although there are few records regarding forest ecosystems data availability on forest management practices across europe is limited because it is difficult to assign a management system to a forest stand based on signs of its recent management long term historical records are essential but they are largely missing across most of europe nfis are a valuable source of information on recent forest management but harmonising the descriptions across countries will remain challenging until a common classification system is used the scarce information about management in vegetation inventories has generally led to harmonisation as a binary indicator field managed or unmanaged which provides only minimal information to aid in the understanding of forest responses to management see e g vayreda et al 2012 the natura 2000 and nationally designated areas cdda see appendix b initiatives provide spatial information on the protected sites at the european level these datasets cannot be used to infer the development of a particular management activity but they could be used as an indication of different forest policy and management objectives given the limited availability of management information historical reconstruction maps e g mcgrath et al 2015 forest management simulators härkönen et al 2019 and the forest management map of european forests hengeveld et al 2012 assesses the suitability of different forest management practices based on biotic abiotic and socioeconomic factors which provide useful information for the development and assessment of management on forest resource models 3 2 1 considerations for harmonised data use in modelling forest responses to climate change harmonised and quality controlled data at the european scale are needed for robust assessments of forest responses to climate change serra diaz et al 2018 reyer et al 2019 we have demonstrated that data availability at the european extent has increased in the last few decades for a multitude of forest properties ranging from genetics to demography forest structure and occurrence abundance table 2 as well as for the potential interacting drivers of climate change table 3 we have also identified many open and semi restricted databases across europe which will facilitate future integrative research on forest responses to climate change using multiple data sources we found several limitations that should be considered when developing models and frameworks based on the databases presented here relating to spatial and temporal coverage and the effects of using multisource data and data with different sampling methodologies firstly for specific forest properties data are not publicly available at high resolution or for many european species particularly for intraspecific trait variability adaptation and phenotypic variation and physiological and dispersal responses secondly the temporal coverage of key responses to climate change such as defoliation mortality and recruitment is short e g the main sources are vegetation inventories which are only available since the 1980s in addition there are sampling issues such as the under representation of big trees no individual or harmonised data of tree recruitment and extreme responses might be under represented when permanent plots of forest inventories are used thirdly long term data are available for forest cover and tree growth but researchers should be aware of data limitations regarding spatial coverage i e generally localised data and sampling effects e g selection of sensitive species sites for study the main limitations regarding underlying drivers of forest responses to climate change that we identified are the availability of meaningful and detailed soil information long term data about disturbances and forest management and legacy effects on forest functioning finally most of the databases cannot deliver cause effect mechanisms except emerging ecosystem experiments see e g meta phenomics database appendix b and plant responses can differ in field conditions poorter et al 2016 the lack of data on key mechanisms of forest responses to climate change either at high spatial resolution or long temporal span at the european scale can strongly hamper modelling of forest tree responses to climate change table 4 local adaptation or physiological data at high spatial resolution is missing at large spatial scales and detailed resolution but several efforts are being made to integrate available data such as ecological genomics to climate change predictions fitzpatrick keller 2015 showing less alarming responses benito garzón et al 2019 process based models require a wide range of data to adequately parameterise and evaluate them ideally consisting of a mix of stand or ecosystem conditions e g stand structure species abundance and specific mechanisms or processes e g photosynthesis data required in dgvm models which ideally should come from controlled experiments see hartig et al 2012 in many cases process based models require large numbers of parameters of physiological responses to climate but these values are often known only for special cases mäkelä et al 2000 or processes formulated for one region cannot be extrapolated to other climates or larger extents morales et al 2005 detailed physiological structural and ecosystem data are being gathered but rarely on the same plot or at european extent table 2 the lack of accurate data about traits and ecophysiological responses for individual species in e g hydraulic resistance photosynthesis or respiration has led to the generalisation of the parameters for a given plant functional type as e g depending on their shade flooding or drought tolerance and nitrogen requirements bugmann 2001 detailed data on tree mortality or recruitment is available at large spatial scales but it is generally missing at long temporal scales which could bias long term predictions in fact there are diverging findings on tree mortality between observational data and model predictions allen et al 2015 steinkamp hickler 2015 and lack of tree recruitment data is likely to hamper model predictions evans moustakas 2016 furthermore modelling forest responses to climate change might be affected by sampling bias due to the under representation of large trees vieilledent et al 2009 or extreme responses fisher et al 2008 the short temporal span generally available in data is leading to predictions under constant conditions and the common use of space for time substitutions where temporal patterns are inferred from a set of different aged sites pickett 1989 recent studies suggest that space for time predictions provide similar results to time for time predictions blois et al 2013 rolo et al 2016 however further research of forest responses and predictions using space for time substitution should be a priority because species are likely to show different responses to climate change due to adaptation e g benito garzón et al 2011 or legacy effects johnson miyanishi 2008 4 conclusions towards harmonised and freely available quality data to analyse and model forest responses to climate change despite the advances made the main gap to better understanding and modelling of climate change impacts on european forests lies in the scarcity of high quality freely available data with high spatial and temporal resolution that cover the main biological processes that are affected by climate change e g dispersal physiology biotic interactions demography phenology and adaptation urban et al 2016 cabral et al 2017 open data exchange policies and research networks are leading to rapidly increasing accessibility of ecological and environmental data over large spatial extents data quality is often high but observational data biases exist due to sampling effects different time intervals and under representation of extreme conditions there are several examples of high quality data at national european or global extent that could serve as models for future data infrastructures at the national and continental level forest inventories and the icp databases are examples of systematically collected data that are widely used to asses forest vulnerability to climate e g icp database unece icp forests programme co ordinating centre 2016 at global scales gfbi itrbd fluxnet data aubinet et al 2012 and the try database kattge et al 2011 combine high quality data with established quality and assessment controls the increasing availability of data will further allow us to investigate complex mechanisms relevant for the assessment of forest impacts to climate change and to integrate them in a wide variety of forest models the main data priorities to improve our understanding and model forest impacts to climate change are i to maintain monitoring in existing data networks and start targeted new monitoring that addresses the identified gaps such as measuring climatic extremes and responses and to obtain long term high quality data on critical biological mechanisms driving forest responses to climate change such as adaptation capacity physiological responses dispersal and regeneration and mortality ii to promote the availability and provision of harmonised freely available databases and further develop the standardisation methods and quality assessment approaches iii to increase discussion and networking between those scientists primarily involved in data collection and those in modelling and data integration iv to encourage data integration methods from different sources because they have the potential to use the existing information in the data more effectively and provide detailed information at large spatial and long temporal scales that can be used in different modelling frameworks author contributions f h a l a m c p o r p r b g v r y m a z conceptualisation j c p r b

24928,climate change is expected to cause major changes in forest ecosystems during the 21st century and beyond to assess forest impacts from climate change the existing empirical information must be structured harmonised and assimilated into a form suitable to develop and test state of the art forest and ecosystem models the combination of empirical data collected at large spatial and long temporal scales with suitable modelling approaches is key to understand forest dynamics under climate change to facilitate data and model integration we identified major climate change impacts observed on european forest functioning and summarised the data available for monitoring and predicting such impacts our analysis of c 120 forest related databases including information from remote sensing vegetation inventories dendroecology palaeoecology eddy flux sites common garden experiments and genetic techniques and 50 databases of environmental drivers highlights a substantial degree of data availability and accessibility however some critical variables relevant to predicting european forest responses to climate change are only available at relatively short time frames up to 10 20 years including intra specific trait variability defoliation patterns tree mortality and recruitment moreover we identified data gaps or lack of data integration particularly in variables related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity dispersal capabilities and physiological responses overall we conclude that forest data availability across europe is improving but further efforts are needed to integrate harmonise and interpret this data i e making data useable for non experts continuation of existing monitoring and networks schemes together with the establishments of new networks to address data gaps is crucial to rigorously predict climate change impacts on european forests keywords climatic extremes data accessibility data integration drivers forest responses to climate change harmonisation open access 1 introduction changes in mean and extreme climatic conditions are affecting forest functioning worldwide frank et al 2015 eea 2017 seidl et al 2017 understanding and predicting these impacts is necessary for science based decisions but challenging because climate change interacts with other drivers of global change such as rising atmospheric co2 cramer et al 2001 atmospheric deposition de vries et al 2014 land use change linares et al 2009 garcía valdés et al 2015 pests and invasive species krumm vitková 2016 liu et al 2017 and management and legacy effects baudena et al 2015 motta et al 2015 morales molino et al 2017a ruiz benito et al 2017b moreover ecosystems react to climate change in complex ways for example through stabilizing processes lloret et al 2012 such as positive biotic interactions ruiz benito et al 2017a or local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity valladares et al 2014 benito garzón et al 2019 but also with destabilizing non linear responses and feedbacks that could trigger tipping points camarero et al 2015 reyer et al 2015 to support the crucial role of forests in maintaining key ecosystem services decision makers must adapt forests for the future messier et al 2013 ipcc 2014 to aid this process it is therefore critically important to rapidly increase our ability to predict forest responses and vulnerability to climate change urban et al 2016 the use of empirical data at large spatial and or long temporal extents in combination with suitable models is one of the most powerful tools for better understanding forest function predicting vulnerability to climate change and assessing options for mitigation and adaptation see e g mouquet et al 2015 during the last few decades there has been a steady development in modelling techniques franklin et al 2016 aimed at better understanding and or predicting species occurrence and abundance e g dormann et al 2012 or forests dynamics and functioning e g gap models or dynamic global vegetation models dgvms see e g bugmann et al 2001 cramer et al 2001 available models range from empirical to process based approaches and from modelling local processes and dynamics up to global vegetation and general ecosystem models fig 1 while there is a general agreement about the importance of assessing and predicting ecosystem responses to climate change ipcc 2014 there are multiple modelling approaches available to understand and predict climate change impacts quantitatively designed to answer specific questions at different scales and using different data fig 1 the mechanisms and processes limiting model predictions at large geographical scales are under particularly intense debate see e g mouquet et al 2015 franklin et al 2016 seidl 2017 furthermore forests are complex socio ecological systems and predictions can be theory limited because forest functioning depends on multiple spatial and temporal responses and scales that depend on species composition garcía valdés et al 2018 morin et al 2018 and may include thresholds or tipping points camarero et al 2015 reyer et al 2015 jump et al 2017 interactive effects scheffer et al 2001 phenological responses chuine régnière 2017 and adaptation or time dependent processes lloret et al 2012 a final challenge is the integration of models and data and in particular the ability to adequately parameterise and test models at large spatial scales hartig et al 2012 a key component to understand and predict forest responses to climate change is the extent resolution and quality of associated environmental data such as climate soils or nitrogen deposition for example environmental drivers are often themselves based on model outputs not only of future predictions but also of past levels uncertainty about the future trajectory of the climate system which largely depends on socio economic development can further impact prediction accuracy purves pacala 2008 garcía valdés et al 2018 moreover much of the available data on observed impacts is not yet integrated and understood in the wider context of whole ecosystem functioning for example climate change effects on shifting the time of flowering but see chuine et al 2016 ascoli et al 2017b tree mortality episodes greenwood et al 2017 or large wildfires pausas et al 2008 have been quantified but they are generally not included in many forest vulnerability assessments impacts of climate change across european forests are occurring at all biological levels of organisation at the tree level decreased water availability or temperature stress might induce functional adjustments in respiration water use efficiency hydraulic conductivity resource allocation reproductive efforts or phenology and root to shoot allocation patterns penuelas et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 which can ultimately influence reproduction growth and mortality lambers et al 2008 at the population level plant demography drives forest responses to climate change martínez vilalta lloret 2016 ruiz benito et al 2017b depending on local adaptation to climate pedlar mckenney 2017 fréjaville et al in review changes in tree growth and productivity are contingent on ecosystem type and water availability e g vayreda et al 2012 ruiz benito et al 2014 and individual responses to drought have been linked to long term species composition changes galiano et al 2013 martínez vilalta lloret 2016 at the ecosystem level heat waves have been shown to have an overall depressing effect on net primary productivity ciais et al 2005 reichstein et al 2013 the combination of increased atmospheric co2 nitrogen deposition pollution and climate change is also considered a key factor in tree decline and ecosystem level responses e g de vries et al 2014 furthermore several studies indicate altitudinal and latitudinal shifts in species distribution and functional types across europe see appendix a attributable in many cases not to climate change alone but with substantial interactions with herbivory release secondary succession or forest management peñuelas boada 2003 ruiz benito et al 2017b to adequately identify potential risks and to establish future research and management priorities the scientific community governments and other interested parties need well structured easily accessible and usable empirical data often at large temporal and spatial scales multiple types levels and sources of data are currently available which can be harmonised to make compatible and comparable databases gtos 1998 and prepare them to be suitable for model based analyses the aim of this paper is to support studies predicting forest responses and vulnerability to climate change by assessing the availability and accessibility of harmonised databases of forest functioning and underlying environmental drivers at the european scale firstly based on a literature review we identified the main types of forest response to climate change and the underlying interacting drivers then based on expert knowledge we researched the different data types available genetic eddy flux measurement experimental or observational field techniques tree ring palaeoecological and remote sensing techniques to assess their ability to inform about climate change impacts fig 2 additionally we highlight the main data gaps and biases to predict climate change impacts on forests across europe 2 availability of data indicating forest responses to climate change forest responses to climate change are measured with different survey techniques that cover a range of spatial and temporal scales see fig 3 and appendix b genetic data show local adaptation to climate over generations eddy flux measurements provide continuous data on local productivity at 0 5 1 hour resolution up to more than 20 years vegetation inventories from local to regional scales cover show one 10 year changes across decadal to 100 year time scale dendrochronological data at local scales show yearly growth data over up to 5000 years palaeoecological techniques at local scale cover long temporal scales millennial data and remote sensing data rs with high temporal and spatial resolution continental for space borne remote sensing regional for airborne remote sensing and local for ground based remote sensing table 1 over a few years to multiple decades the availability of these data varies from fully open access to restricted access i e where the data is completely available for users or it is only available under request or a licence for a particular project see table 1 2 1 genetic and phylogenetic diversity local adaptation and plasticity the capacity for genetic and phylogenetic tree diversity estimation is progressing rapidly thanks to ecological genomics holliday et al 2017 the increase in genomic data allow us to understand the association between allelic frequencies and environmental gradients fitzpatrick keller 2015 plant phylogenies are available for a large number of species see e g zanne et al 2014 appendix b and it is being used to further estimate phylogenetic diversity at the european scale van der plas et al 2018 in europe adaptive genetic responses to climate using snps data are only available for a few species jaramillo correa et al 2015 local adaptation and plasticity are the main sources of intraspecific variation and should be considered when evaluating species responses to climate change because within species ecological responses abundance biomass community composition are often greater than across species des roches et al 2018 and predictions of species responses due to climate change can differ when intra specific variability is taken into account moran et al 2016 sánchez salguero et al 2018 benito garzón et al 2019 phenotypic measurements of fitness related traits such as tree diameter height phenology growth and or survival from known genotypes at different locations can inform models about the amount of phenotypic trait variation attributable to local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity of populations moran et al 2016 phenotypic variation has been traditionally measured in common gardens i e genetic trials or provenance tests see appendix b and has been established for most commercial tree species it provides information about plasticity i e one provenance planted in several common gardens with different environments and local adaptation of populations i e several provenances planted in one common garden savolainen et al 2013 2 2 plant phenotype physiology traits and phenology physiological parameters have traditionally been measured either in experimentally controlled conditions or in observational studies where the physiological outputs are highly dependent on environmental conditions species interactions and adaptation mechanisms eddy flux measurements and new remote sensing products have the potential to further elucidate plant physiological responses the eddy covariance networks are particularly important for quantifying the spatial differences and temporal dynamics in co2 and water vapour exchange across large abiotic and biotic gradients estimates of water use efficiency at large spatial extents and gross primary productivity gpp e g lasslop et al 2012 wohlfahrt galvagno 2017 can both be derived from eddy flux data meanwhile in many flux observation sites other important biometric measurements such as soil respiration rates are reported as so called ancillary data these additional data allow for a more analytical view on the net fluxes and their partitioning into individual components of the forest carbon cycle enabling the portioning of ecosystem respiration into heterotrophic and autotrophic components see e g rodeghiero cescatti 2006 brændholt et al 2018 the availability of new space borne instruments enable measuring sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif which offers a more direct link to plant physiology dobrowski et al 2005 and a promising way to quantify gross primary production from space grace et al 2007 global phenology and model parameterisation have long been estimated through earth observation methods e g justice et al 1985 ahl et al 2006 hmimina et al 2013 white et al 2014 long term passive optical data from programmes such as avhrr landsat and modis nasa have been used to quantify decadal forest cover change on a near global scale e g hansen et al 2013 such data have also been combined with ground measurements to detect climate driven changes in temperate forest phenology over long time scales piao et al 2006 keenan et al 2014 and phenological changes associated with the spread of invasive species ramsey et al 2005 however data availability about phenological changes is scarce see appendix b and a good understanding or predictive models of phenological responses are critical to further understand climate change consequences delpierre et al 2019 2 3 forest demography and structure forest demography can be assessed using vegetation inventories tree ring data or remote sensing data regional national and continental inventories see appendix b are useful tools to estimate forest demographic processes such as tree growth mortality and recruitment at the individual tree kunstler et al 2016 neumann et al 2017 or plot level carnicer et al 2014 ruiz benito et al 2017a at regular intervals often each c 10 years recruitment data in systematic inventories have been successfully harmonised for saplings height between 30 and 130 cm across single censuses in europe ruiz benito et al 2017a van der plas et al 2018 but recruitment data contain differential information about tree seedlings in addition recruitment data rarely contain time series records dispersion information or individual tree information required to understand forest responses to climate change tree and site level radial growth at longer time spans and annual time steps can be obtained from tree ring and remote sensing data which allow retrospective and prospective characterisations of forest responses including forest resistance and resilience to short and long term climatic changes briffa et al 1998 anderegg et al 2015 gazol

area volume biomass or crown metrics at tree or plot level obtained from vegetation inventories or remote sensing data fig 3 table 1 systematic vegetation inventories generally measure tree level diameter height allowing a direct calculation of plot level basal area or tree density and indirect volume or biomass estimates through the application of species specific allometric equations montero et al 2005 zianis et al 2005 annighöfer et al 2016 some national forest inventories measure the position of each tree within a plot enabling the calculation of distance dependent competition indices and tree to tree interactions gómez aparicio et al 2011 kunstler et al 2016 although small plots can lead to biased predictions hynynen ojansuu 2003 tree height and diameter are common inventory variables that can also be obtained from airborne lidar and ground based remote sensing with higher accuracy than inventory based calculations zolkos et al 2013 lidar can provide sub metre accuracy of

santoro et al 2010 but the latter methods typically require calibration using ground data rodríguez veiga et al 2017 sar biomass estimates are calculated using backscatter coefficients related to wood

used to quantify biomass at the global scale simard et al 2011 and popescu et al 2011 suggest close correlations to airborne equivalents the use of sar for forest monitoring is likely to increase with

srinivasan et al 2015 allowing upscaling airborne lidar measurements hancock et al 2017 however tls data is available locally because it requires specific fieldwork and the management of a high volume of data 2 4 species or functional occurrence abundance and diversity species or functional type occurrence and abundance data can be calculated from data generally available in vegetation inventories palaeoecological or remote sensing data data on actual species distribution in europe tends to come from individual field based observations e g the worldwide database gbif and current knowledge e g euforgen or european maps from jrc see a complete list in appendix b the systematic information from nfis gathered at regional or national level and international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests icp forests gathered at european level provides large scale and long term information about the state of forests appendix b systematic vegetation inventories provide detailed information on tree species occurrence and abundance generally through basal area or density measurements with a good spatial coverage within europe across biomes but over a relatively short time span see appendix b and mauri et al 2017 long term changes in species occurrence and abundance in response to environmental variability can be assessed through fossil pollen and plant macrofossils data morales molino et al 2017b despite the uneven spatial distribution and the relatively low taxonomic and spatial temporal resolution of palaoecological data the long time span they usually cover allows to assess ecosystem dynamics during past periods of abrupt climate change see table 1 like the younger dryas holocene transition rapid and marked warming dated c 11700 years ago or the 8 2 ka event abrupt cooling centered at c 8200 years ago for instance fossil pollen data have been successfully used to document changes in the distribution and abundance of the main plant genera of european vegetation over the last 15 000 years giesecke et al 2017 similarly plant macrofossils represent an interesting proxy to infer past distribution ranges as they often allow more precise plant identifications even to species level than pollen plant macrofossils are unequivocal indicators for past plant local presence due to their limited dispersal and are often directly dated therefore reducing uncertainty about their age birks birks 2000 when reliable age estimates based on radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils and robust age depth models are available palaeoecological data allow accurate assessments on the responses of forest species to past climate changes which can in turn be used to validate projected vegetation responses to future climate change diversity metrics can be calculated from systematic vegetation inventories including tree and shrub richness functional types or even functional or phylogenetic measurements when merged with trait phylogenetic data ruiz benito et al 2017a or specific field based trait measurements vilà cabrera et al 2015 plant trait information and plant phylogeny is available for a large number of plants see e g the try database try db org kattge et al 2011 or zanne et al 2014 appendix b and it is being used to further estimate functional or phylogenetic diversity paquette messier 2011 tree species diversity is not directly available from medium resolution open access earth observation data such as landsat or modis however several studies have demonstrated the potential for predicting species richness and diversity from satellite derived land cover and landscape complexity e g honnay et al 2003 hernandez stefanoni ponce hernandez 2004 ma et al 2019 leaf traits moreno martínez et al 2018 or link species composition with forest dynamics huesca et al 2015 other studies have used the spectral variation hypothesis which links spectral heterogeneity in the reflectance signal to environmental heterogeneity and therefore species diversity gould 2000 palmer et al 2002 rocchini et al 2007 rocchini et al 2016 fine spatial resolution imagery has been used to identify tree species within forest ecosystems using classification approaches as e g combination of lidar with pleiades data e g blázquez casado et al 2019 ikonos carleer wolff 2004 dahdouh guebas et al 2004 or quickbird neukermans et al 2008 but such data are usually complex to analyse or costly to obtain limiting their use for mapping diversity at a regional or continental scale furthermore structural and topographical information derived from airborne lidar can also provide information on tree species richness simonson et al 2012 hernández stefanoni et al 2014 lopatin et al 2016 vaglio laurin et al 2016 3 availability and accessibility of harmonised data at the european level 3 1 forest responses harmonised data on forest conditions is available in multiple global and european scale databases see appendix b and a summary in table 3 and range from open to restricted access table 2 for open access databases citation and acknowledgment is usually mandatory for more restricted datasets the data managers or contributors can request authorship as a prerequisite for access e g some harmonised nfi databases common garden experiments table 2 harmonised data at the european extent is generally of high quality i e well structured and documented in some cases data use does not require a high degree of expertise e g processed or combined remote sensing products but it requires managing large volumes of data in others the use of data requires a medium high degree of expertise as e g when managing unprocessed inventory data tree ring or palaeoecological data table 2 the data products of individual observational or experimental studies are increasingly being published online thanks to research networks public repositories and more recently data papers gaining increasing attraction however whether scientific data should be freely accessible is under an intense debate gewin 2016 and often there is a low replicability even in journals with an established data policy stodden et al 2018 data available and accessible at european level in data repositories or specific harmonisation initiatives cover many different data types such as trait information e g try database kattge et al

forests programme co ordinating centre 2016 and long term experiments observational data in regions of europe including a large number of forest indicators see forestgeo deims or noltfox appendix b data harmonisation must include data standardisation protocols and specifically informing about data strengths and limitations see meyer et al 2016 for data of species occurrence franklin et al 2017 the main data strengths identified were taxonomic spatial and temporal coverage systematic data sampling and error identification and control table 2 the main data limitations were taxonomic spatial or temporal uncertainty i e ambiguous taxonomic data spatial location or time since data collection respectively taxonomic spatial or temporal coverage multisource effects i e different sampling techniques in input data such as plot size or sampling dates or sampling effects i e observation or measurement errors and over or under representation bias see table 2 genetic diversity e g allelic frequency data is not harmonised at the european level but see genbank database for specific queries of genes in plants table 2 appendix b and to our knowledge this type of data has not been used to study large scale forest responses to climate but see jaramillo correa et al 2015 however the improvements in the next generation of sequencing technologies is increasing the availability of open access databases neale kremer 2011 table 3 appendix b despite evidence that genotypes respond differently to climate change across the range of the species e g matías et al 2017 it can be difficult to measure genetic diversity and to incorporate it in predictive models of climate change effects kramer et al 2010 for example neutral diversity does not show direct effects of genetic variation on fitness and therefore it is not informative about the adaptative or evolutionary potential of the species holderegger et al 2006 however common gardens and provenance trials are an important source of knowledge on the effects of intra specific genetic and phenotypic variation on species response to different climates savolainen et al 2013 data harmonisation is not homogeneous for all data sources and the planting sites often do not include the entire distribution range of a given species but see compilations for pinus pinea l pinus pinaster ait pinus nigra arnold abies alba mill and fagus

european icos research infrastructures franz et al 2018 the availability and accessibility of vegetation inventories depend on the database owner varying from systematic vegetation inventories e g nfi or icp forests to specific databases from research network or data papers see appendix b several initiatives to harmonise nfis are being undertaken including cost actions tomppo et al 2010 european projects such as e g baccara http www baccara project eu fundiveurope http www fundiveurope eu baeten et al 2013 or diabolo http diabolo project eu and european networks such as enfin http www enfin info or global initiatives gfbi https www gfbinitiative org nfi data can be open or restricted access at country level but the data require error identification and harmonisation considerations e g minimum tree size or basal area management ratcliffe et al 2016 and harmonisation of heterogeneous databases as country level nfis should include standardisation steps to the final outputs harmonisation initiatives are resulting in the availability of nfi data at the european level such as species occurrence mauri et al 2017 or forest structure moreno et al 2017 icp plots include information about biodiversity and the health and vitality of forests for example canopy affectation by defoliation or and climate change interactions with other air pollutants de vries et al 2014 unece icp forests programme co ordinating centre 2016 the main data limitations are based on the temporal coverage of the data available since the 1980s and the importance of understanding the knowledge any sampling effects that might include the underrepresentation of large trees differential plot sizes and time intervals tree ring data are harmonised at global scale by noaa s international tree ring data bank itrdb table 2 and appendix b the itrdb provides long term growth information usually tree ring widths but also tree ring density data at tree stand and species levels that can be freely downloaded however most of the itrdb data refer to classical dendrochronological data i e cross dated tree ring series obtained from 10 20 dominant and climatically sensitive trees of the same species living in the same site stand or tree population often at climate sensitive sites usually authors analyse a chronology or mean series of the individual tree series from the same site certain considerations or data treatment is required to estimate climate impacts on the entire forest first the spatial and ecological extent of the chronologies is generally vague because the size of the site is rarely defined e g 0 5 1 ha second sampling is often biased towards dominant big trees of similar age classes from harsh sites where climate is the major constraint of radial growth which can lead to biased estimates of forest productivity and carbon uptake third there is an urgent requirement for better metadata for future tree ring series to be uploaded to the itrdb for instance tree size d b h and age are rarely reported and stand information as basal area or tree density is usually lacking but they are required to obtain useful estimates of radial growth e g basal area increment and carbon fixation from the tree ring data tree ring data from tropical forests are scarce at the itrdb partially due to the inherent difficulty of ring formation and cross dating in these tropical sites but itrdb data have been successfully used in global analyses e g anderegg et al 2015 palaeoecological data at the european level are harmonised in the neotoma paleoecology database neotoma and the european pollen database also accessible via neotoma see appendix b the main data limitations relate to the spatial coverage uneven distribution of sites across europe multisource and sampling effects i e time interval can differ between sampling sites neotoma and the epd are open access standardized databases of published palaecological records to foster broad scale global or continental scale vegetation and land use history studies williams et al 2018 pollen data can sometimes be difficult to use because 1 several plant species produce the same pollen type which limits the estimation of plant diversity or specific species presence but for woody taxa taxonomic resolution is usually high except for most european deciduous oaks that cannot be distinguished by their pollen 2 non uniform representativeness of pollen distribution for vegetation distribution due to species specific differences in pollen production dispersal deposition and preservation e g anemophilous tree species with high pollen production and dispersal ability as e g pinus sp are often overrepresented broström et al 2008 this bias can be corrected by using empirical species specific pollen productivity estimates ppes pearman et al 2008 3 pollen records mostly reflect vegetation structure and composition in an area whose size depends on the site and surface type usually lakes and mires sugita 1994 macrofossil records are less abundant than pollen sequences in europe especially in the mediterranean region similarly macrofossil data availability is still limited compared with pollen data see neotoma appendix b and most sequences are published as papers in specialised journals e g birks 2003 tinner kaltenrieder 2005 the availability of remote sensing information is vastly increasing thanks to recent technical advances kennedy et al 2014 but significant challenges remain to select process and interpret data provided in order to make them easily usable for forest assessment and management table 2 processed and combined products are now widely available and offer a great opportunity for use at european scale table 2 with the temporal coverage dependent on the specific platform and product appendix b there is an increasing amount of open access large scale airborne lidar data across europe generally at regional scale and the recently launched gedi mission will provide global coverage of spaceborne lidar though over a relative short duration appendix b tls has the potential to move forward forest inventory datasets by providing new structural measurements at fine spatial scales liang et al 2016 white et al 2016 as well as new means to determine uncertainty of forest properties quantified by spaceborne and airborne methods 3 2 environmental data climate databases at european or global levels differ in spatio temporal resolution and extent mean climatic conditions for the 20th century are often directly available at high spatial resolution and at global or european scales from databases such as worldclim e obs chelsa climatic research unit cru see table 3 and appendix b either for a certain period e g wordclim data provide mean values for 1970 2000 or even monthly values for each year e g e obs cru ts cru cl or cru sr appendix b temporal data on past temperature and precipitation i e daily monthly or yearly records are

fréjaville benito garzón 2018 and european climate data has been downscaled at 1 km2 for large temporal frameworks i e 1951 2012 see moreno hasenauer 2016 there is also an r packags available to

2017 and for europe at different spatial resolutions from the euro cordex https www hzg de ms euro cordex to cru database or wordclim see appendix b other environmental drivers include topographic information e g elevation slope and aspect soil classification and properties disturbance and management information atmospheric nitrogen or sulphur deposition and co2 concentrations etc topographic information can be easily obtained from digital elevation models at different resolutions e g from 2 m2 to 1 km2 table 3 the soil grid dataset https soilgrids org provides global information about site characteristics physical and chemical properties appendix b european soils data centre esdc and isric world soil information provide a wealth of soil science information and the fao a global soil organic carbon map which is mostly open access and directly downloadable at 1 km2 appendix b in addition to soil property and quality datasets the esdc hosts information on different soil functions and threats to soil functioning soil water content temperature and snowpack has been estimated from 1979 to 2010 in the era interim land at a resolution of 0 125 balsamo et al 2015 and soil organic carbon is mapped at 1 km2 resolution in the global soil organic carbon map appendix b however potential drivers of forest responses to climate change as soil fertility or water retention wardle et al 2008 is not easily accessible at detailed resolution for the european extent disturbances such as fires pests or pathogens are major drivers of forest vulnerability that can strongly interact with climate change e g pausas keeley 2009 palaeoecological records often include charcoal data to reconstruct changes in fire activity through long timescales which can be freely accessed and downloaded from the global charcoal database gcd power et al 2010 and neotoma williams et al 2018 the database of forest disturbances in europe dfde appendix b provides historical data on abiotic i e wind and snow damage and biotic pathogens and insects disturbance agents dfde has been used at the country scale to empirically parameterise landscape models to predict future disturbance levels under different climate change scenarios seidl et al 2014 european initiatives to record and disseminate forest disturbance information include the efi database european forest fire information system eu effis and the european storms catalogue appendix b however there is a considerable lack of geo referenced data on pest and alien species in european forests and they are poorly linked to other databases on forest health such as icp forests some initiatives involving citizen science are providing georeferenced data of forest pests at regional levels e g http www alertaforestal com es the european network of alien species easin provides access to records of alien species in europe via a mapping tool and a geo referenced database of published scientific reports easin lit appendix b although there are few records regarding forest ecosystems data availability on forest management practices across europe is limited because it is difficult to assign a management system to a forest stand based on signs of its recent management long term historical records are essential but they are largely missing across most of europe nfis are a valuable source of information on recent forest management but harmonising the descriptions across countries will remain challenging until a common classification system is used the scarce information about management in vegetation inventories has generally led to harmonisation as a binary indicator field managed or unmanaged which provides only minimal information to aid in the understanding of forest responses to management see e g vayreda et al 2012 the natura 2000 and nationally designated areas cdda see appendix b initiatives provide spatial information on the protected sites at the european level these datasets cannot be used to infer the development of a particular management activity but they could be used as an indication of different forest policy and management objectives given the limited availability of management information historical reconstruction maps e g mcgrath et al 2015 forest management simulators härkönen et al 2019 and the forest management map of european forests hengeveld et al 2012 assesses the suitability of different forest management practices based on biotic abiotic and socioeconomic factors which provide useful information for the development and assessment of management on forest resource models 3 2 1 considerations for harmonised data use in modelling forest responses to climate change harmonised and quality controlled data at the european scale are needed for robust assessments of forest responses to climate change serra diaz et al 2018 reyer et al 2019 we have demonstrated that data availability at the european extent has increased in the last few decades for a multitude of forest properties ranging from genetics to demography forest structure and occurrence abundance table 2 as well as for the potential interacting drivers of climate change table 3 we have also identified many open and semi restricted databases across europe which will facilitate future integrative research on forest responses to climate change using multiple data sources we found several limitations that should be considered when developing models and frameworks based on the databases presented here relating to spatial and temporal coverage and the effects of using multisource data and data with different sampling methodologies firstly for specific forest properties data are not publicly available at high resolution or for many european species particularly for intraspecific trait variability adaptation and phenotypic variation and physiological and dispersal responses secondly the temporal coverage of key responses to climate change such as defoliation mortality and recruitment is short e g the main sources are vegetation inventories which are only available since the 1980s in addition there are sampling issues such as the under representation of big trees no individual or harmonised data of tree recruitment and extreme responses might be under represented when permanent plots of forest inventories are used thirdly long term data are available for forest cover and tree growth but researchers should be aware of data limitations regarding spatial coverage i e generally localised data and sampling effects e g selection of sensitive species sites for study the main limitations regarding underlying drivers of forest responses to climate change that we identified are the availability of meaningful and detailed soil information long term data about disturbances and forest management and legacy effects on forest functioning finally most of the databases cannot deliver cause effect mechanisms except emerging ecosystem experiments see e g meta phenomics database appendix b and plant responses can differ in field conditions poorter et al 2016 the lack of data on key mechanisms of forest responses to climate change either at high spatial resolution or long temporal span at the european scale can strongly hamper modelling of forest tree responses to climate change table 4 local adaptation or physiological data at high spatial resolution is missing at large spatial scales and detailed resolution but several efforts are being made to integrate available data such as ecological genomics to climate change predictions fitzpatrick keller 2015 showing less alarming responses benito garzón et al 2019 process based models require a wide range of data to adequately parameterise and evaluate them ideally consisting of a mix of stand or ecosystem conditions e g stand structure species abundance and specific mechanisms or processes e g photosynthesis data required in dgvm models which ideally should come from controlled experiments see hartig et al 2012 in many cases process based models require large numbers of parameters of physiological responses to climate but these values are often known only for special cases mäkelä et al 2000 or processes formulated for one region cannot be extrapolated to other climates or larger extents morales et al 2005 detailed physiological structural and ecosystem data are being gathered but rarely on the same plot or at european extent table 2 the lack of accurate data about traits and ecophysiological responses for individual species in e g hydraulic resistance photosynthesis or respiration has led to the generalisation of the parameters for a given plant functional type as e g depending on their shade flooding or drought tolerance and nitrogen requirements bugmann 2001 detailed data on tree mortality or recruitment is available at large spatial scales but it is generally missing at long temporal scales which could bias long term predictions in fact there are diverging findings on tree mortality between observational data and model predictions allen et al 2015 steinkamp hickler 2015 and lack of tree recruitment data is likely to hamper model predictions evans moustakas 2016 furthermore modelling forest responses to climate change might be affected by sampling bias due to the under representation of large trees vieilledent et al 2009 or extreme responses fisher et al 2008 the short temporal span generally available in data is leading to predictions under constant conditions and the common use of space for time substitutions where temporal patterns are inferred from a set of different aged sites pickett 1989 recent studies suggest that space for time predictions provide similar results to time for time predictions blois et al 2013 rolo et al 2016 however further research of forest responses and predictions using space for time substitution should be a priority because species are likely to show different responses to climate change due to adaptation e g benito garzón et al 2011 or legacy effects johnson miyanishi 2008 4 conclusions towards harmonised and freely available quality data to analyse and model forest responses to climate change despite the advances made the main gap to better understanding and modelling of climate change impacts on european forests lies in the scarcity of high quality freely available data with high spatial and temporal resolution that cover the main biological processes that are affected by climate change e g dispersal physiology biotic interactions demography phenology and adaptation urban et al 2016 cabral et al 2017 open data exchange policies and research networks are leading to rapidly increasing accessibility of ecological and environmental data over large spatial extents data quality is often high but observational data biases exist due to sampling effects different time intervals and under representation of extreme conditions there are several examples of high quality data at national european or global extent that could serve as models for future data infrastructures at the national and continental level forest inventories and the icp databases are examples of systematically collected data that are widely used to asses forest vulnerability to climate e g icp database unece icp forests programme co ordinating centre 2016 at global scales gfbi itrbd fluxnet data aubinet et al 2012 and the try database kattge et al 2011 combine high quality data with established quality and assessment controls the increasing availability of data will further allow us to investigate complex mechanisms relevant for the assessment of forest impacts to climate change and to integrate them in a wide variety of forest models the main data priorities to improve our understanding and model forest impacts to climate change are i to maintain monitoring in existing data networks and start targeted new monitoring that addresses the identified gaps such as measuring climatic extremes and responses and to obtain long term high quality data on critical biological mechanisms driving forest responses to climate change such as adaptation capacity physiological responses dispersal and regeneration and mortality ii to promote the availability and provision of harmonised freely available databases and further develop the standardisation methods and quality assessment approaches iii to increase discussion and networking between those scientists primarily involved in data collection and those in modelling and data integration iv to encourage data integration methods from different sources because they have the potential to use the existing information in the data more effectively and provide detailed information at large spatial and long temporal scales that can be used in different modelling frameworks author contributions f h a l a m c p o r p r b g v r y m a z conceptualisation j c p r b

24929,wildfire affects landscape ecohydrologic processes through feedbacks between fire effects vegetation growth and water availability despite the links between these processes fire is rarely incorporated dynamically into ecohydrologic models which couple vegetation growth with water and nutrient fluxes this omission has the potential to produce inaccurate estimates of long term changes to carbon and water cycling in response to climate change and management in this study we describe a fire effects model that is coupled to a distributed ecohydrologic model rhessys and a fire spread model wmfire the fire effects model has intermediate structural complexity so as to be commensurate with the ecohydrologic model the fire effects model includes processes for litter and coarse woody debris consumption processes for fire associated vegetation mortality and consumption and takes into account canopy structure i e ladder fuels for propagation of fire effects into a forest canopy we evaluated the model in four western u s sites representing different vegetation climate and fire regimes the fire effects model was able to replicate patterns of expected fire effects across different ecosystems and stand ages without being tuned to produce them an emergent property of the model fire effects of shrubland and understory vegetation varied with surface fire intensity by design and fire effects in forest canopies were sensitive to parameters associated with the buildup of litter and understory ladder fuels these findings demonstrate that the fire effects model provides an effective tool for evaluating the post fire changes to physical and ecological processes future work will project future fire regimes and improve understanding of watershed dynamics under climate change and land management via the simulation of the fire effects model with fire spread and ecohydrology keywords fire effects ecohydrology mortality consumption rhessys western u s 1 introduction ecohydrologic models simulate interactions between landscape ecological and hydrological processes ecohydrologic models are widely used to assess how climate land use change and land management affect water resources vegetation health productivity growth and mortality carbon sequestration and their interactions available models vary widely in terms of the processes that are modeled and the level of physical realism with which processes are represented fatichi et al 2016 no known ecohydrologic models however explicitly account for disturbances such as wildfire or such disturbances are prescribed as an exogenous forcing despite the known strong interactions between wildfire and ecohydrology ecohydrologic processes both affect and are affected by wildfire wildfire intensity see fire related definitions in table 1 is a function of fuel loads and fuel moisture which are directly related to ecological processes such as vegetation growth and hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration et conversely wildfire is also a major control on vegetation affecting species composition and structural variables such as biomass and canopy cover this further affects et and water yield through modifications of vegetation bart 2016 roche et al 2018 given this bidirectional relationship between ecohydrology and wildfire the representation of fire effects on vegetation carbon in ecohydrologic models requires a fully coupled approach where wildfire and its effects co evolve with ecohydrologic processes harris et al 2016 predicting fire effects on vegetation is challenging because fire effects are often not only related to fire intensity but also to the characteristics and structure of vegetation wildfire commonly spreads via surface fuels such as litter and coarse woody debris rothermel 1972 for vegetation that lies in close proximity to the surface fuels e g grasses shrubs forest understories fire effects are related to vegetation properties and transient states such as moisture content in forested ecosystems propagation of fire to the upper forest canopy depends on the relation between understory flame lengths and the distance to the lower branches of the forest canopy as well as the presence of intermediate height vegetation i e ladder fuels to bridge the gap fire effects are also dynamic changing as vegetation structures evolve with stand age disturbance and management debano et al 1998 most ecohydrologic models treat wildfire as an exogenous forcing decisions on the magnitude of wildfire effects are often made subjectively tague et al 2009 although in some cases the decisions could be informed by remote sensing or land surveys lentile et al 2006 recent work has generated and spread wildfire dynamically in an ecohydrologic model kennedy et al 2017 but to complete the bidirectional coupling between wildfire and the ecohydrologic model the effect of fire on vegetation needs to be represented effectively the design of a fire effects model that links a fire spread model with an ecohydrologic model needs to be compatible with both the objectives of the modeling and the data constraints of the models canopy structure and ladder fuels are primary controls on fire behavior and corresponding canopy level effects in forested ecosystems in order to utilize ecohydrologic models to assess the effects of fuel treatments or climate on fire regimes the influence of canopy structure on fire effects must be accounted for however most established fire effect models that incorporate canopy structure require detailed knowledge about fire behavior fuel structure and or vegetation characteristics examples include stand level models with empirical estimates of fuel consumption consume prichard et al 2006 and fuel consumption and associated vegetation mortality fofem lutes et al 2012 these models require detailed accounting of the fuel bed commensurate with that required in semi empirical models of fire spread such as rothermel 1972 such detailed accounting is not accommodated by the existing structure of ecohydrologic models landscape scale models such as landis ii sturtevant et al 2009 and firebgc keane et al 2011 represent vegetation in more detail than ecohydrologic models including individual trees and age structures used to estimate fire occurrence and effects ecohydrologic models do not generally predict variables at the level of complexity necessary to be represented in existing fire effects models instead vegetation growth is modeled via ecosystem carbon cycling submodels that allow vegetation structure to respond to environmental variables and resource availability these models typically represent vegetation as a set of carbon stores leaves stems roots non structural carbohydrate but do not necessarily translate these carbon stores into structure attributes for example individual trees are not represented in the models but rather aggregated approaches are used as with so called big leaf models or models that have cohorts of stem size classes in these models detailed canopy structure variables such as bark thickness or spacing between individuals that would be used to calculate fire effects are rarely available furthermore spatially detailed information on weather variables such as wind that are important for fire behavior are not typically included the computational and parameter costs of including substantially more complexity in canopy structure and micrometeorology submodels in order to account for fire behavior would make ecohydrologic models infeasible for larger watersheds and scenario assessments hence we need a simpler way to represent canopy structure in fire effects models that are coupled with ecohydrologic models while retaining enough realism to replicate ecohydrologic processes effectively an effective watershed scale fire effects model for evaluating vegetation carbon change should be complex enough to respond to key drivers of fire effects variability such as stand age time since most recent fire and forest management such as fuel treatments but generalizable enough to operate in multiple ecosystem types including shrublands open canopy forests and closed canopy forests and across a range of scales from hillslopes to 3 4th order watersheds in this paper we document the development of a fire effects model for use with an ecohydrologic model that accounts for the structure of vegetation but does so in a manner that is consistent with the level of detail of the ecohydrologic model we then use sensitivity analysis to provide insight into model processes and on the ground dynamics and relationships finally we test whether the model can replicate expected patterns of vegetation mortality and consumption at different stand ages and in different ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 rhessys and wmfire the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys is a spatially distributed ecohydrologic model that is used to simulate daily water carbon and nutrient fluxes in watersheds see tague and band 2004 with more recent advances to model subroutines described in tague et al 2013 and garcia et al 2016 the model is organized hierarchically vertical vegetation layers are simulated in patches the finest spatial resolution patches can be of arbitrary size but often modeled at 30 m as with this study patches are nested within zones that define radiation and meteorological forcing zones are nested within hillslopes and watersheds that define lateral redistribution of water and materials each vegetation canopy in rhessys comprises fine root coarse root live and dead stem and leaf carbon stores along with associated nitrogen stores that vary with species specific organ stoichiometry vegetation height is a species specific function of stem carbon stores and rooting depth is a species specific function of root carbon stores vegetation canopies are assigned a cover and gap fraction incoming shortwave radiation is attenuated with each canopy layer based on leaf area index and canopy fraction vegetation photosynthesis is based on the farquhar model farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 and vegetation respiration is based on ryan 1991 and tjoelker et al 2001 assimilated carbon is allocated to leaves stems and roots according to landsberg and waring 1997 coarse woody debris and litter stores on the ground surface are generated when vegetation undergoes phenological changes or mortality coarse woody debris carbon stores are generated from branch and stem turnover litter is produced from leaf turnover and the breakdown of coarse woody debris stores litter consists of four carbon stores and decay to soil carbon at varying rates soil carbon in rhessys consists of four carbon stores with varying decay rates since the effects of wildfire on soil carbon is generally limited due to limited transfer of heat into the soil certini 2005 wildfire was assumed to only affect the shallowest and fastest decaying soil store precipitation in rhessys is partitioned to rainfall and snowfall based on air temperature snowpack is computed from a quasi energy budget snow model that accounts for the effects of canopy cover on sublimation and melt vertical water fluxes in rhessys include interception infiltration and drainage through the rooting and unsaturated zones to a water table surface litter and canopy evaporation as well as vegetation transpiration are separately calculated using the penman monteith method monteith 1965 rhessys is coupled to a fire spread model wmfire kennedy et al 2017 the fire spread model does not replicate specific occurrences or perimeters of historical fires but rather aggregates spatial patterns of individual fires along with the seasonality and return intervals characteristic of contrasting fire regimes this level of complexity is compatible with the time space scales and process representation in rhessys the approach is designed to strike a balance between complexity and the uncertainty of model structure input data and parameters kennedy and mckenzie 2016 we aim for a similar balance here in designing a coupled fire effects model that links the fire spread model with changes in ecosystem stores of carbon and nitrogen fire spread in wmfire is organized on a pixelated grid that overlays the watershed patch structure in rhessys each month the number of potential ignitions is drawn from a poisson distribution and these ignitions are located randomly in the watershed successful ignition depends on fuel load and fuel moisture deficit of the chosen pixel if an ignition is successful wmfire estimates the probability of subsequent pixel to pixel fire spread p s as an aggregate multiplier that combines empirical submodels of the contributions of fuel load p s l fuel moisture deficit p s d slope p s s and wind p s w 1 p s l d s w p s l p s d p s s p s w the multiplier for fuel load is based on rhessys patch litter carbon stores and increases with higher loads the multiplier for fuel moisture is based on the relative moisture deficit 1 actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration of vegetation making fire spread more likely with higher deficits the multiplier for slope is based on the direction of fire movement relative to topography with fire more likely to move upslope than downslope the multiplier for wind increases when fire spread is oriented in the direction of the wind and at higher speeds where a dominant wind speed and direction is selected randomly from a distribution estimated from historical weather data output from wmfire includes a map of pixels that have burned and the probability of spread for each burned pixel but provides no information on how fire alters vegetation structure as represented by rhessys carbon and nutrient stores associated with each vertical vegetation layer in a given patch the fire effects model developed in this study is intended to address this deficiency and complete the bidirectional coupling between fire regimes and ecohydrology 2 2 fire effects model fire effects are modeled as a function of surface fire intensity and canopy structure surface fire intensity is modeled classically as a function of the available fuel loading the heat content and the rate of spread byram 1959 wmfire provides a measure of the probability of spread for a given patch related to wind speed and direction relative moisture deficit fine fuel load and topography in our initial fire effects implementation we use the wmfire calculated probability of spread p s as a normalized index of surface fire intensity the fire intensity index fii the fire intensity index acts a proxy for surface fire intensity given that they are related to a similar set of variables and it increases monotonically with fire intensity consequently if a patch experiences a fire with a higher probability of spread for example upslope movement in the direction of wind with high litter loads and high fuel deficits we assume that the fire intensity index will also be higher we use this formulation of fire intensity index as a starting point for the fire effects model the general structure of the fire effects model is shown in fig 1 when fire enters a patch in the model fire effects are computed separately for surface understory and overstory carbon stores as noted previously we also alter nitrogen stores by using parameterized stoichiometric relationships in different plant organs or litter and soil organic material for the remainder of the paper we describe changes to carbon stores but note that nitrogen stores are also modified surface carbon for each of the four litter stores l1 c l2 c l3 c l4 c the top soil layer store s1 c and coarse woody debris cwd c are consumed at a fixed proportion based on formulas adapted from the consume model prichard et al 2017 2a l 1 c o n s 1 0 l 1 c 2b l 2 c o n s 1 0 l 1 c 2c l 3 c o n s 0 85 l 1 c 2d l 4 c o n s 0

fire effects model works with one or two canopy layers as rhessys is a multi layer gappy big leaf model each vegetation canopy within a patch is associated with a single top of canopy height the fire effects model includes two height thresholds that are used to determine the proportion of a given canopy that is classified as overstory or understory vegetation fig 1 vegetation canopies with a height above the upper threshold ho are classified as overstory vegetation vegetation canopies that have a height below the lower threshold hu are classified as understory vegetation vegetation canopies with heights between the thresholds are considered to represent overstory and understory proportionally based on the relative distance between the height thresholds a single vegetation canopy may be classified as an understory and an overstory at different times during its growth cycle depending on the canopies height relative to the height thresholds for locations with two vegetation canopies we refer to the dominant vegetation canopy e g forest as the primary canopy and the sub canopy e g shrubs as the secondary canopy recognizing that the secondary canopy may overtop the primary canopy under some conditions for locations with a single vegetation type e g shrublands the vegetation is referred to as the primary canopy canopy mortality in the fire effects model is defined as the vegetation carbon component that is killed by wildfire fig 1 a portion of the total mortality is then allocated either to carbon stores that are consumed by the fire and counted as a net carbon flux to the atmosphere or to residual plant material that falls to the ground as a carbon flux to surface carbon stores for a canopy classified as understory leaf material in a burned patch is assumed to undergo 100 mortality for all other canopy carbon stores classified as understory e g stem carbon root carbon the proportion of vegetation mortality v pmort is a function of fire intensity index in that patch 3 v p m o r t f i i k u m o r t 1 k u m o r t f i i 1 k u m o r t 1 k u m o r t 1 where ku mort is an canopy specific understory mortality parameter that may be calibrated to provide a species specific relation between fii and v pmort vegetation with high ku mort values is more resistant to fire whereas vegetation with low ku mort values is more sensitive to fire the total amount of vegetation carbon mortality in a canopy v mort is computed as 4 v m o r t v c v p m o r t where v c is defined as the pre fire carbon gc m2 for a given vegetation store for aboveground vegetation carbon stores in a given canopy e g leaves stem the proportion of mortality that is consumed by fire v pcons is 5 v p c o n s v p m o r t k c o n s 1 k c o n s v p m o r t 1 k c o n s 1 k c o n s 1 where kcons is a species specific consumption parameter specifying the relation between v pmort and v pcons fig 1 low values of kcons indicate that vegetation is easily consumed by fire while high values of kcons indicate that vegetation has a greater tendency to remain on the landscape as litter coarse woody debris or standing deadwood the total amount of aboveground vegetation carbon consumed

v p c o n s canopy mortality of vegetation classified as overstory is governed by a different relation from eq 3 instead it is a function of the combined biomass consumed from vegetation classified as an understory and litter fig 1 this relation takes a sigmoidal form 8 v p m o r t 1 1 e k o m o r t 1 v c o n s u l c o n s k o m o r t 2 where v cons u is the total amount of vegetation consumption i e v cons for canopies classified as understory in a patch l cons is the total amount of litter consumed i e l1 cons l2 cons l3 cons and l4 cons ko mort 1 is a parameter representing the slope of the sigmoidal relation and ko mort 2 is a scale parameter representing the combined amount of understory and litter consumption where v pmort is equal to 50 the relation represents the role of ladder fuels in propagating fire into the overstory with higher consumption in the understory or litter assumed to increase fire propagation differences in the value of the ko mort 2 parameter can be implicitly used to account for location and species specific differences in ladder fuel behavior 2 3 study sites the fire effects model was tested in four locations in the western u s a shrubland located in southern california open canopy mixed conifer forests in the southern sierra nevada and northern new mexico and a closed canopy conifer forest in oregon fig 2 these locations provide a diverse set of land cover types and fire regimes for evaluating the robustness of the fire effects model an illustration of the expected patterns of vegetation mortality for each of the four sites is provided in fig 3 and described in more detail below rattlesnake canyon is a predominately shrubland watershed on the south side of the santa ynez mountains near santa barbara california the elevation of the study site is 800 m and is composed of sclerophyllous evergreen shrubs including ceanothus ceanothus megacarpus chamise adenostoma fasciculatum and manzanita arctostaphylos spp mean annual precipitation for rattlesnake is 518 mm the mean annual maximum temperature is 21 6 c and the mean annual minimum temperature is 12 1 c many wildfires in this area are wind driven although fuel driven fires are also common chaparral shrublands are adapted for wildfire wildfires spread through the canopy as crown fires which can produce high mortality regardless of stand age during extreme conditions keeley and fotheringham 2003 as a result we would expect modeled shrubland mortality in rattlesnake to be more sensitive to surface fire intensity than canopy structure the p301 watershed site near shaver lake california in the southern sierra nevada is part of the southern sierra critical zone observatory and kings river experimental watersheds krew research networks the elevation of the site is 1950 m and the mean annual precipitation is 1308 mm the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature is 14 4 c and 3 2 c respectively and it is located within the rain snow transition zone the open canopy mixed conifer forest in p301 consists of ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa incense cedar calocedrus decurrens white fir abies concolor jeffery pine pinus jeffreyi and sugar pine pinus lambertiana the understory vegetation includes young conifer species and chaparral shrubland species such as greenleaf manzanita arctostaphylos patula and mountain whitehorn ceanothus cordulatus prior to fire suppression in the 1900s the mixed conifer forest in the sierra nevada had a low severity fire regime with frequent understory wildfire at 5 20 year return intervals and infrequent canopy fire due to sparse ladder fuels kilgore and taylor 1979 scholl and taylor 2010 without reoccurring fire in the landscape densities have increased in both the forest canopy and the understory over the past century mcintyre et al 2015 which has increased the likelihood of high severity canopy fire in p301 we would expect the fire effects model to replicate this behavior with the forest canopy resistant to fire except under extreme surface fire intensities or following a large buildup of surface and understory fuels the santa fe watershed site in new mexico is an open canopy forest situated at an elevation of 2760 m the site receives monsoon rainfall during the summer snowfall during the winter and has a mean annual precipitation of 633 mm the mean annual maximum temperature is 13 4 c and the mean annual minimum temperature is 0 5 c vegetation is mixed conifer forest consisting of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii engelmann spruce picea engelmannii ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa quaking aspen populus tremuloides white fir abies concolor and white pine pinus strobiformis margolis and balmat 2009 natural fire return intervals have been estimated to be between 10 and 28 years margolis and balmat 2009 similar to p301 fire suppression over the past century has increased ladder fuel loads in the understory increasing the risk of fire propagation into the forest canopy fuels management to reduce understory biomass is being conducted in the forest to decrease fire severity a useful fire effects model should be able to replicate these processes with increasing forest mortality following the accumulation of ladder fuels and decreased forest mortality following fuel treatments the h j andrews experimental forest site in oregon is situated at an elevation of 975 m the mean annual precipitation of 2266 mm is concentrated during the winter season with a mix of rain and snow the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature is 14 4 c and 4 5 c respectively the mixed conifer forest consists of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii western hemlock tsuga heterophylla western redcedar thuja plicata noble fir abies procera and pacific silver fir abies amabilis fire effects in h j andrews are closely related to stand development oliver 1981 following a stand replacing wildfire or other major disturbance the forest begins stand initiation during this period small stature trees are vulnerable to fire though in many cases surface fuels may be insufficient for fire spread as the forest canopy becomes taller and closed a stem exclusion phase begins where understory growth cannot establish and a lack of ladder fuels protects the forest canopy from crown fire after a period of time small disturbances and increased forest mortality create gaps in the forest canopy that allow understory vegetation and young trees to reinitiate this understory growth can act as a ladder fuel increasing the fire risk for the forest canopy we expect that the model should replicate fire effects at each phase of stand development in h j andrews with forest vulnerability to fire decreasing during the transition from the stand initiation phase to the stem exclusion phase and then increasing during the transition to the understory reinitiation phase assembled datasets for rattlesnake p301 santa fe and h j andrews are described in detail in shields and tague 2012 bart et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 and garcia et al 2013 respectively for rattlesnake daily precipitation data were obtained from santa barbara county flood control district gauge 228 located 4 km south of the study site and daily temperature data from a national climate data center ncdc monitoring station located 9 km south of the study site the combined precipitation and temperature dataset extends from water year 1989 to 2009 with the water year defined as october 1 of the previous year to september 30 of the present year daily precipitation and temperature data for p301 water years 1942 2005 were generated by extending the short record from a krew meteorological station located near the outlet of the p301 watershed hunsaker and safeeq 2018 with a longer record from the grant grove climate station located 40 km to the southeast daily precipitation was adjusted using a scaling factor and daily temperature was adjusted using a linear regression model son and tague 2019 santa fe daily precipitation and temperature data water years 1942 2008 were obtained from two national weather service cooperative network climate stations in the city of santa fe located approximately 14 km to the west of the study site daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature data for h j andrews water years 1958 2004 were taken from a climatic station at watershed 2 cs2met for all of the sites we repeated the observed climate sequences for simulations requiring time series that were longer than the observed records 2 4 analysis at each study site we tested the fire effects model at the patch scale using a three step approach first we simulated the ecohydrologic model in the absence of fire and selected a single set of soil and vegetation parameters that satisfactorily produced typical long term 100 150 year trajectories of vegetation growth including height and biomass of the primary and secondary canopies second we used a global sensitivity analysis to assess the performance of the model structure to improve understanding of potential fire watershed dynamics and to guide the selection of calibration parameters finally we applied the fire effects model to vegetation at various stand ages to evaluate whether the modeled fire effects occurring at different times in a stand growth trajectory conform to expected fire effect patterns for each of these analyses the fire effects model was evaluated decoupled from the fire spread model in this paper we focus on fire effects from individual fires of different intensities the evaluation of fire regimes using the fully coupled model will be addressed in subsequent papers the ecohydrologic model rhessys was used to simulate vegetation succession at each of the four sites to identify parameter combinations that were consistent with known patterns of vegetation succession comparisons were based on qualitative descriptions of stand development at each site qualitative calibration of the model was used due to a lack of century scale vegetation data to compare modeled vegetation dynamics simulations began with no vegetation reflecting conditions following a stand replacing wildfire vegetation in rattlesnake p301 and santa fe was simulated for 100 years without fire and vegetation conditions were evaluated at stand ages 5 12 20 30 40 60 and 80 years vegetation in h j andrews was simulated for 150 years without fire due to its longer growth cycle with vegetation conditions evaluated at stand ages 5 12 20 40 70 100 and 140 years two vegetation canopies were simulated for the three forested ecosystems with a primary canopy representing the trees and a secondary canopy representing smaller shade tolerant vegetation the secondary canopy at these sites was restricted to grow no higher than the understory height threshold hu the shrubland site rattlesnake was modeled with a single primary canopy simulations were conducted using a latin hypercube selection of 250 parameter sets across plausible ranges of a number subsurface and vegetation parameters that were expected to be important for growth garcia et al 2016 see table 2 for parameter list other vegetation and hydrologic parameters were chosen from rhessys parameter libraries the runs were evaluated visually to assure that most runs conformed to expected succession dynamics at each site however since the objective of the study was to evaluate the fire effects model and not succession dynamics a single parameter set that provided representative dynamics was selected from among all the simulations in order to reduce dimensionality of the subsequent sensitivity tests we selected the parameter set that produced most consistently the rank median height for each canopy and the rank median litter load across the selected stand ages at each site a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual components of the fire effects model and evaluate whether the model could be simplified or parameters in the model fixed song et al 2015 we used the variance based sobol approach which uses input parameter contributions to the modeled output variance as an estimate of parameter sensitivity pianosi et al 2016 the sobol approach has the advantage of working with non linear and non monotonic models it can also be used on models with interacting parameters and can estimate interaction effects song et al 2015 the sobol model produces two types of output first order and total order indices first order indices quantify the direct contribution of a parameter to the output variance total order indices quantify the combined direct contributions and the indirect contributions of a parameter on the output variance indirect contributions are generated from interactions with other parameters the sensitivity analysis was implemented using the sobol2007 function saltelli et al 2010 sobol et al 2007 in the r sensitivity package pujol et al 2017 the sensitivity of the fire effects model was tested separately for each of the seven stand ages inputs to the sensitivity model included the two parameters that define the height thresholds for each patch ho and hu and four parameters for each vegetation canopy ku mort kcons ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 table 3 we also included the fire intensity index in the sensitivity test although the fire intensity index is an input variable passed to the fire effects model rather than an adjustable parameter we were interested in understanding the relative contribution of the fire intensity index to model output variability compared to the other parameters as with all global sensitivity tests results using the sobol approach can vary depending on the variability space of the input parameters pianosi et al 2016 we selected broad parameter ranges that encompassed most of the plausible parameter space table 3 the sensitivity analysis was run with 1000 unique parameter sets for each stand age sensitivity output was evaluated for the relative post fire change in four model variables for each canopy v pmort v pcons v cons and v resid fire effects were evaluated separately for all combinations of the four study sites the seven stand ages and for ten levels of the fire intensity index to assess whether the fire effects model conformed to expected behavior fig 3 the levels of the fire intensity index ranged from 0 1 to 1 by 0 1 representing a range of very low intensity to very high intensity fire for each site stand age fire intensity index combination we simulated fire effects using a latin hypercube selection of 100 parameter sets based on the parameters that were previously identified to be sensitive in the sensitivity test see table 3 for a total of 28 000 fire effects simulations 3 results 3 1 vegetation simulation vegetation in the model was simulated in order to produce a representative example of vegetation growth at each site the simulated canopy heights and litter carbon stores for each of the 250 fire free runs are displayed in fig 4 along with the representative run that was used for the subsequent sensitivity test the parameter values corresponding to the representative run are displayed in table 2 for rattlesnake shrub height increased rapidly during the first 12 years and then began to level off peaking at a little over 2 5 m of height litter accumulation shows the cyclical signature of the looped 21 year climate sequence but overall litter accumulation was fairly steady over the growth cycle of the shrubs the two open canopy sites p301 and santa fe had similar behavior to one another in the absence of fire following an initial period of slow growth the primary canopy had a short period of rapid growth followed by a long period of slower but steady growth the height of the secondary canopy in p301 stabilized after about 40 years while the height of the secondary canopy in santa fe showed consistent growth throughout the 100 year simulation period litter carbon on the other hand showed consistent accumulation during the simulation period in p301 while litter carbon in santa fe was more variable and did not display a trend litter carbon accumulation in santa fe was lower than p301 reflecting the smaller forest size in santa fe due to drier conditions and potentially higher rates of decomposition with summer precipitation for the closed canopy forest at h j andrews strong primary canopy growth during the stem exclusion phase prevented the secondary canopy from becoming established however after 60 years understory initiation began when forest gaps in the primary canopy allowed the understory to become established litter carbon in h j andrews showed a steady increase with stand age when fire was excluded from the system 3 2 sensitivity test a global sobol sensitivity test was used to compare the relative influence of model parameters and the model input variable fire intensity index on fire effects the tests were performed separately for each site and stand age combination we found that the sensitivities first order indices of the shrublands at rattlesnake were very similar to the sensitivities of the secondary canopies at p301 santa fe and h j andrews we also observed that the first order indices of the two open canopy sites p301 and santa fe were similar accordingly we show only first order indices for the primary canopy in the three sites that showed distinct behavior rattlesnake p301 and h j andrews fig 5 first order indices for the primary canopy of santa fe and all secondary canopies are provided in supplemental material total order indices for all sites were not substantially different from first order indices indicating that interactions among the parameters and the fire intensity index were not a substantial contributor to the output variance these results are also available in supplemental material in rattlesnake the sensitivity results did not vary by stand age since the shrubs remained below the understory height threshold across all stand ages we note that this does not imply that fire intensity does not vary with stand age and associated fuel accumulation but rather that the effects of fire of a given intensity with a given parameter set do not change across stand ages fire effects in rattlesnake were sensitive to parameters ku mort and kcons as well as the fire intensity index fig 5a changes in the response variable for vegetation mortality v pmort and the response variables for consumption v pcons and v cons were most sensitive to the fire intensity index the parameter ku mort acted as a secondary control for these response variables and the parameter kcons as a tertiary control the response variable for the proportion of residual carbon that falls to the ground v resid had the kcons parameter as was the most sensitive parameter fire effects in rattlesnake were not sensitive to the two height threshold parameters or the two parameters that control the fire effects in the overstory ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 similar patterns of sensitivity were observed for the understory canopies at each of the forested sites see supplementary material the sensitivity of fire effects in the open canopy forest p301 varied across stand age fig 5b at stand age 5 sensitivity was similar to that of an understory since the height of the primary canopy was well below the understory height threshold fig 4c at stand age 12 primary canopy height was close to the understory height threshold hu and fire effects showed sensitivity to this parameter by stand age 20 primary canopy height was greater than the overstory height threshold and sensitivity in the model shifted sensitivity to parameters ku mort and kcons as well as the input variable fire intensity index was greatly diminished while the sensitivity to ko mort 2 which defines how much understory and litter biomass is needed to be consumed to generate 50 mortality in the overstory was greatly increased fire effects were generally much more sensitive to the parameter ko mort 2 than the parameter ko mort 1 except for the response variable v resid where both parameters were similarly sensitive fire effects sensitivity in h j andrews was similar to p301 shifting from understory sensitive parameters and the fire intensity index at stand age 5 to overstory sensitive parameters in older stands fig 5c in summary the sensitivity results indicate that for vegetation that is shorter than the understory height threshold fire effects are most sensitive to the ku mort and kcons parameters in addition we have shown that fire effects are also very sensitive to the fire intensity index for vegetation that is taller than the overstory height threshold fire effects are most sensitive to the ko mort 2 parameter for the simulation of fire effects in the following section we only allowed the parameters ku mort and kcons to vary for vegetation canopies that were a shrubland or an understory for forest canopies we allowed ku mort kcons ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 to vary since depending on stand age forest canopies may behave like both an understory and an overstory all other parameters were fixed including ho and hu since these parameters were not consistently sensitive across stand age or site the parameter ranges for the fire effect simulations are found in table 3 3 3 fire effects we evaluated the fire effects model to understand how well it could replicate the expected temporal dynamics of fire effect behavior at each of the four sites fig 3 fire effects at each site were simulated across 7 stand ages and 10 levels of fire intensity index a time series of the aboveground carbon stores primary canopy secondary canopy litter for each site is presented in the top panels of fig 6 and fig 7 the vertical lines indicate the stand ages that fire effects were investigated the remaining panels show the associated percentage change in mortality consumption and residual carbon for the primary canopy at each site the distribution of responses for each site stand age fire intensity index combination was generated using 100 parameter sets fire effects in rattlesnake were similar across all stand ages since the height of the vegetation never exceeded the understory height threshold mortality was roughly linear with the fire intensity index with some variability based on different parameter values of ku mort fig 6b canopy consumption increased non linearly with the fire intensity index with lower levels of consumption for a given level of the fire intensity index except when for the fire intensity index goes to 1 fig 6c the carbon that is killed but not consumed falls to the ground as residual litter carbon in rattlesnake residual carbon increased with the fire intensity index until peaking at intermediate levels of the fire intensity index at which time residual carbon began to decrease fig 6d the initial increase in residual carbon is a result of fractionally less canopy consumption for a given level of mortality at lower levels of mortality fig 1 this reverses at higher levels of mortality when consumption becomes a fractionally higher component of mortality and levels of residual carbon begin to decline the fire effect results for rattlesnake were similar to those of the secondary canopy at the forested sites for p301 at stand ages 5 and 12 the forest canopy remained below the understory height threshold of 4 m fig 4c consequently fire effects at these stand ages were similar to the shrubs in rattlesnake however beginning at stand age 20 the forest canopy grew beyond the overstory height threshold and the controls on mortality in the primary canopy shifted to being a function of the combined understory and litter consumption fig 6f for stand ages 20 and 30 understory and litter biomass consumption was insufficient to propagate fire into the primary canopy except at the highest levels of the fire intensity index however litter accumulation with stand age in the absence of fire increased the amount of fuels available to burn and by stand age 80 mortality in the primary canopy had increased for fires at lower levels of intensity changes in primary canopy consumption and residual carbon mirrored the patterns observed with rattlesnake with consumption in p301 increasing non linearly with mortality and residual carbon levels peaking at intermediate levels of the fire intensity index although the total amount of carbon that becomes litter is a smaller percentage for stand ages greater than 20 years fig 6g and h the controls on fire effects in santa fe were similar to p301 fig 7 at a young stand age the primary canopy behaved as an understory and fire effects were primarily a function of the fire intensity index fire effects were depressed initially after the primary canopy height exceeded the overstory height threshold but with time the primary canopy again became vulnerable to fire following a buildup of fuels in the secondary canopy fire effects in h j andrews followed the pattern of stand development fig 7 during the stand initiation phase stand age 5 the primary canopy was vulnerable to fire since its height was below the understory height threshold for stand ages 12 20 and 40 the forest grew into the stem exclusion phase and the closed primary canopy inhibited the secondary canopy from becoming established fire did not spread effectively into the primary canopy during this period making the forest primary canopy resistant to fire after stand age 60 the primary canopy in h j andrews entered the understory reinitiation phase and was parameterized to become an open canopy forest by decreasing the canopy cover fraction representing the expected gap dynamics that occur in maturing forests in this region spies et al 1990 during this phase the secondary canopy was able to reestablish and accumulate sufficient levels of biomass to act as ladder fuels to the primary canopy 4 discussion the fire effects model was specifically designed to be used with an established ecohydrologic model rhessys and to be compatible with carbon cycling and big leaf models in general due to constraints on the data and processes that can be incorporated into the model our objective was a parsimonious design that still included canopy structure as a key process controlling fire effects the results of this study demonstrated that the fire effects model containing two height parameters per patch and four additional parameters per canopy was able to replicate broad expected patterns of fire effect dynamics across different ecosystems fig 3 for shrubland ecosystems dominated by canopy fires such as california s chaparral the model produced fire effects that were independent of stand age which agrees with observed fire effects in the ecosystem moritz et al 2004 in the open canopy forests of p301 and santa fe that historically had a low severity fire regime the forest canopy showed little fire effects unless the stand age of the forest canopy was very young or a prolonged fire free period allowed litter and understory ladder fuels to build up to sufficient levels to allow fire to spread into the forest canopy this behavior conforms to observed fire effects in low severity fire regimes forests agee 1998 in the closed canopy forest at h j andrews fire during the stem exclusion phase had little effect on the forest canopy it was only during stand initiation and following understory reinitiation that the forest canopy showed noticeable fire effects the fire effects model captured the distinct patterns of vegetation growth and fire vulnerability at each of these sites without being designed explicitly to replicate these patterns this was an emergent property of the model 4 1 fire effects and shrubland understory vegetation fire effects in shrublands and forest understory were more responsive to variability in the fire intensity index than the model parameters regardless of watershed the fire intensity index is a proxy for surface fire intensity that in this modeling system is calculated by the fire spread model and is passed to the effects model this responsiveness was expected and emphasizes the importance of generating an adequate measure of fire intensity in order to correctly model fire effects in shrublands where the understory is the only canopy layer the sensitivity of fire effects to fire intensity can be interpreted as fire intensity distinguishing between low severity fire and stand replacing fire i e high severity fire regimes a high intensity fire in these systems will result in removal of live vegetation with potential second order consequences on slope stability soil erosion and hydrology shakesby and doerr 2006 a low intensity fire in contrast will result in more shrub survival and less carbon removed from the landscape fire effects in shrublands and forest understory were also sensitive though less so to the parameter that controls how fire intensity relates to mortality ku mort and the parameter that scales the proportion of mortality that is consumed kcons these parameters may be refined if vegetation species are known to be more or less susceptible to mortality or combustion which might vary by species average stem diameter or bark thickness 4 2 fire effects and forests for forested canopies the fire effects model was successfully able to replicate expected fire effects at multiple stand ages fig 3 in young forests fire effects were similar to those estimated for shrublands and understory vegetation with fire intensity being the primary control on fire effects at this stage of stand development forests function effectively as an understory and a high intensity fire early in stand development may represent a stand replacing event this may have implications for reburn potential thompson et al 2007 and type conversion boisramé et al 2017 that may be accommodated by the coupled modeling system prior ecohydrologic modeling with rhessys has shown that the local microclimatological conditions can have a strong impact on the rate of vegetation regeneration after disturbance tague and moritz 2019 we expect that the coupling of an ecohydrologic model with fire effects may be better able to predict such local microclimatological conditions e g water status for regeneration that are missing from non coupled models of future fire regimes in a changing climate in intermediate and late aged forests when the canopy exceeds the overstory height threshold fire effects were less responsive to the fire intensity index but were very responsive to the parameter that controls how much understory and litter consumption is necessary to produce overstory mortality ko mort 2 in this context the understory and litter biomass act as mediators between fire intensity and overstory fire effects a low value for the ko mort 2 parameter means that fire propagation to the overstory is such that even low understory and litter consumption results in high severity overstory fire this may be representative of forest species with low hanging branches or with thin non fire resistant bark a higher value requires larger amounts of understory and litter consumption for the same severity in the overstory we emphasize however that understory consumption captures many of the first order controls on fire propagation to the overstory including fuel moisture and understory biomass effects thus establishing general plant function type related ranges for this parameter might be feasible at the watershed scale implementation of the fire effects model will necessitate understanding how ko mort 2 varies for different forest types and under different conditions for example if the value of ko mort 2 is too low fire effects in the forest overstory may be predicted to be too severe in ecosystems with forest species that are relatively resistant to fire such as pinus ponderosa this may hinder the establishment of larger old growth open forests that are characteristic of many dry forests with frequent fire regimes in the western u s fulé et al 1997 in contrast if the value of ko mort 2 is too high the forest canopy may be invulnerable to fire regardless of how much understory and litter is consumed while this issue necessitates further investigation at the watershed scale with the fully coupled ecohydrologic model we note that our results in the two dry forest systems i e santa fe and p301 showed suitable behavior over a range of ko mort 2 parameter values table 3 thus we anticipate that the fire effects model is likely robust under many watershed conditions 4 3 fire effects and fire regimes in this study we simulated fire effects at different stand ages effectively variable fire return intervals or reburn intervals assuming that the vegetation was free of fire during the period prior to that stand age however in some forests particularly those with a historically low severity fire regime e g p301 and santa fe the understory could be subject to repeated fire under this scenario we expect the model will function well for example once a forest overstory is established in p301 a fire return interval of 5 20 years scholl and taylor 2010 would prevent a substantial build up of understory and litter biomass this lack of ladder fuels would hinder fire movement into the forest canopy except under the most extreme fire conditions the model is also able to account for changes in forest structure due to forest management fire suppression in a low severity fire regime forest such as p301 allows ladder fuels to accumulate increasing fire risk to the forest canopy similar to what is currently observed in many locations of the fire suppressed sierra nevada collins et al 2011 forest management tools such as mechanical understory thinning and prescribed fire can be represented in the ecohydrologic model and thus the potential for decreasing the likelihood of fire propagation into the forest canopy the coupled ecohydrologic approach is particular important here because it can account for differences in the effectiveness of these treatments associated with interaction among climate and fuel moistures forest growth rates and overstory understory relationships that evolve over time 4 4 model limitations and further development the fire effects model was designed to be structurally less complex than some established fire effects models e g fofem reinhardt et al 1997 and capture first order effects that are important for representing long term averages or fire regimes however because of this simplicity the model cannot capture many of the details that are important for replicating fire effects of specific wildfires for example the model doesn t account for the structure of the understory vegetation e g grass shrub that is consumed which can be an important second order control on how effectively the vegetation functions as ladder fuel in a similar manner the model also doesn t differentiate between consumption during the flaming front or post frontal combustion finney et al 2003 however incorporation of these more sophisticated fire effects elements would require a more complicated model structure that would not be compatible with the ecohydrologic modeling framework established in rhessys we have shown that the fire effects model can represent the major controls on fire effects namely different levels of intensity and stand structure wildfire is a contagious process and the physics of combustion and heat transfer confer autocorrelation in fire effects and observed fire severity kennedy and prichard 2017 prichard and kennedy 2014 the fire effects in a stand with a given fuel profile and structure are expected to differ depending on the fire intensity and behavior of neighboring stands johnson and kennedy 2019 when the fire effects model is integrated with a model of fire spread and an ecohydrologic model this coupled system will provide a spatial representation of fire spread and effects as they interact with the underlying topography wind and vegetation structure future development may consider longer correlation lengths between fire intensity index with commensurate representation of neighboring fire characteristics this would require careful consideration of scale in the framework of wmfire and considerable advancement in the representation of the physical process of heat transfer in models of intermediate complexity the performance of the fire effects model results will be sensitive to the performance of other submodels connected to the fire effects model particularly the fire spread model and models of both overstory and understory growth while previous studies have evaluated fire spread and general growth models in rhessys garcia et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 the ability to capture both understory and overstory growth has not been extensively evaluated evaluations of carbon cycling models in general often focus on aggregate responses through comparison with flux tower data friend et al 2007 or remote sensing products such as modis that lump overstory and understory biomass wu et al 2019 given the importance of overstory and understory distinctions as controls on fire effects additional evaluation of the ability of carbon cycling models to capture these layers is warranted ecohydrologic models are valuable tools that inform potential consequences of climate change land use change and forest management they incorporate dynamic physical and biological feedbacks that are essential to understand watershed processes as fire is an important physical and ecological driver in many watersheds mckenzie et al 2011 our understanding of future ecosystem services requires fully coupling fire spread and effects with ecohydrologic modeling we show here that this is possible within the existing model complexity framework of an ecohydrologic model and that we can achieve good replication of patterns of fire effects this will both improve our ability to understand future watershed dynamics but also to better project future fire regimes under climate change and land management littell et al 2018 showed that empirical projections of future fire regimes do not adequately represent feedbacks between climate and fuels the integration of the fire effects model developed in this study within an ecohydrologic model will allow us to explore those feedbacks declaration of competing

24929,wildfire affects landscape ecohydrologic processes through feedbacks between fire effects vegetation growth and water availability despite the links between these processes fire is rarely incorporated dynamically into ecohydrologic models which couple vegetation growth with water and nutrient fluxes this omission has the potential to produce inaccurate estimates of long term changes to carbon and water cycling in response to climate change and management in this study we describe a fire effects model that is coupled to a distributed ecohydrologic model rhessys and a fire spread model wmfire the fire effects model has intermediate structural complexity so as to be commensurate with the ecohydrologic model the fire effects model includes processes for litter and coarse woody debris consumption processes for fire associated vegetation mortality and consumption and takes into account canopy structure i e ladder fuels for propagation of fire effects into a forest canopy we evaluated the model in four western u s sites representing different vegetation climate and fire regimes the fire effects model was able to replicate patterns of expected fire effects across different ecosystems and stand ages without being tuned to produce them an emergent property of the model fire effects of shrubland and understory vegetation varied with surface fire intensity by design and fire effects in forest canopies were sensitive to parameters associated with the buildup of litter and understory ladder fuels these findings demonstrate that the fire effects model provides an effective tool for evaluating the post fire changes to physical and ecological processes future work will project future fire regimes and improve understanding of watershed dynamics under climate change and land management via the simulation of the fire effects model with fire spread and ecohydrology keywords fire effects ecohydrology mortality consumption rhessys western u s 1 introduction ecohydrologic models simulate interactions between landscape ecological and hydrological processes ecohydrologic models are widely used to assess how climate land use change and land management affect water resources vegetation health productivity growth and mortality carbon sequestration and their interactions available models vary widely in terms of the processes that are modeled and the level of physical realism with which processes are represented fatichi et al 2016 no known ecohydrologic models however explicitly account for disturbances such as wildfire or such disturbances are prescribed as an exogenous forcing despite the known strong interactions between wildfire and ecohydrology ecohydrologic processes both affect and are affected by wildfire wildfire intensity see fire related definitions in table 1 is a function of fuel loads and fuel moisture which are directly related to ecological processes such as vegetation growth and hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration et conversely wildfire is also a major control on vegetation affecting species composition and structural variables such as biomass and canopy cover this further affects et and water yield through modifications of vegetation bart 2016 roche et al 2018 given this bidirectional relationship between ecohydrology and wildfire the representation of fire effects on vegetation carbon in ecohydrologic models requires a fully coupled approach where wildfire and its effects co evolve with ecohydrologic processes harris et al 2016 predicting fire effects on vegetation is challenging because fire effects are often not only related to fire intensity but also to the characteristics and structure of vegetation wildfire commonly spreads via surface fuels such as litter and coarse woody debris rothermel 1972 for vegetation that lies in close proximity to the surface fuels e g grasses shrubs forest understories fire effects are related to vegetation properties and transient states such as moisture content in forested ecosystems propagation of fire to the upper forest canopy depends on the relation between understory flame lengths and the distance to the lower branches of the forest canopy as well as the presence of intermediate height vegetation i e ladder fuels to bridge the gap fire effects are also dynamic changing as vegetation structures evolve with stand age disturbance and management debano et al 1998 most ecohydrologic models treat wildfire as an exogenous forcing decisions on the magnitude of wildfire effects are often made subjectively tague et al 2009 although in some cases the decisions could be informed by remote sensing or land surveys lentile et al 2006 recent work has generated and spread wildfire dynamically in an ecohydrologic model kennedy et al 2017 but to complete the bidirectional coupling between wildfire and the ecohydrologic model the effect of fire on vegetation needs to be represented effectively the design of a fire effects model that links a fire spread model with an ecohydrologic model needs to be compatible with both the objectives of the modeling and the data constraints of the models canopy structure and ladder fuels are primary controls on fire behavior and corresponding canopy level effects in forested ecosystems in order to utilize ecohydrologic models to assess the effects of fuel treatments or climate on fire regimes the influence of canopy structure on fire effects must be accounted for however most established fire effect models that incorporate canopy structure require detailed knowledge about fire behavior fuel structure and or vegetation characteristics examples include stand level models with empirical estimates of fuel consumption consume prichard et al 2006 and fuel consumption and associated vegetation mortality fofem lutes et al 2012 these models require detailed accounting of the fuel bed commensurate with that required in semi empirical models of fire spread such as rothermel 1972 such detailed accounting is not accommodated by the existing structure of ecohydrologic models landscape scale models such as landis ii sturtevant et al 2009 and firebgc keane et al 2011 represent vegetation in more detail than ecohydrologic models including individual trees and age structures used to estimate fire occurrence and effects ecohydrologic models do not generally predict variables at the level of complexity necessary to be represented in existing fire effects models instead vegetation growth is modeled via ecosystem carbon cycling submodels that allow vegetation structure to respond to environmental variables and resource availability these models typically represent vegetation as a set of carbon stores leaves stems roots non structural carbohydrate but do not necessarily translate these carbon stores into structure attributes for example individual trees are not represented in the models but rather aggregated approaches are used as with so called big leaf models or models that have cohorts of stem size classes in these models detailed canopy structure variables such as bark thickness or spacing between individuals that would be used to calculate fire effects are rarely available furthermore spatially detailed information on weather variables such as wind that are important for fire behavior are not typically included the computational and parameter costs of including substantially more complexity in canopy structure and micrometeorology submodels in order to account for fire behavior would make ecohydrologic models infeasible for larger watersheds and scenario assessments hence we need a simpler way to represent canopy structure in fire effects models that are coupled with ecohydrologic models while retaining enough realism to replicate ecohydrologic processes effectively an effective watershed scale fire effects model for evaluating vegetation carbon change should be complex enough to respond to key drivers of fire effects variability such as stand age time since most recent fire and forest management such as fuel treatments but generalizable enough to operate in multiple ecosystem types including shrublands open canopy forests and closed canopy forests and across a range of scales from hillslopes to 3 4th order watersheds in this paper we document the development of a fire effects model for use with an ecohydrologic model that accounts for the structure of vegetation but does so in a manner that is consistent with the level of detail of the ecohydrologic model we then use sensitivity analysis to provide insight into model processes and on the ground dynamics and relationships finally we test whether the model can replicate expected patterns of vegetation mortality and consumption at different stand ages and in different ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 rhessys and wmfire the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys is a spatially distributed ecohydrologic model that is used to simulate daily water carbon and nutrient fluxes in watersheds see tague and band 2004 with more recent advances to model subroutines described in tague et al 2013 and garcia et al 2016 the model is organized hierarchically vertical vegetation layers are simulated in patches the finest spatial resolution patches can be of arbitrary size but often modeled at 30 m as with this study patches are nested within zones that define radiation and meteorological forcing zones are nested within hillslopes and watersheds that define lateral redistribution of water and materials each vegetation canopy in rhessys comprises fine root coarse root live and dead stem and leaf carbon stores along with associated nitrogen stores that vary with species specific organ stoichiometry vegetation height is a species specific function of stem carbon stores and rooting depth is a species specific function of root carbon stores vegetation canopies are assigned a cover and gap fraction incoming shortwave radiation is attenuated with each canopy layer based on leaf area index and canopy fraction vegetation photosynthesis is based on the farquhar model farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 and vegetation respiration is based on ryan 1991 and tjoelker et al 2001 assimilated carbon is allocated to leaves stems and roots according to landsberg and waring 1997 coarse woody debris and litter stores on the ground surface are generated when vegetation undergoes phenological changes or mortality coarse woody debris carbon stores are generated from branch and stem turnover litter is produced from leaf turnover and the breakdown of coarse woody debris stores litter consists of four carbon stores and decay to soil carbon at varying rates soil carbon in rhessys consists of four carbon stores with varying decay rates since the effects of wildfire on soil carbon is generally limited due to limited transfer of heat into the soil certini 2005 wildfire was assumed to only affect the shallowest and fastest decaying soil store precipitation in rhessys is partitioned to rainfall and snowfall based on air temperature snowpack is computed from a quasi energy budget snow model that accounts for the effects of canopy cover on sublimation and melt vertical water fluxes in rhessys include interception infiltration and drainage through the rooting and unsaturated zones to a water table surface litter and canopy evaporation as well as vegetation transpiration are separately calculated using the penman monteith method monteith 1965 rhessys is coupled to a fire spread model wmfire kennedy et al 2017 the fire spread model does not replicate specific occurrences or perimeters of historical fires but rather aggregates spatial patterns of individual fires along with the seasonality and return intervals characteristic of contrasting fire regimes this level of complexity is compatible with the time space scales and process representation in rhessys the approach is designed to strike a balance between complexity and the uncertainty of model structure input data and parameters kennedy and mckenzie 2016 we aim for a similar balance here in designing a coupled fire effects model that links the fire spread model with changes in ecosystem stores of carbon and nitrogen fire spread in wmfire is organized on a pixelated grid that overlays the watershed patch structure in rhessys each month the number of potential ignitions is drawn from a poisson distribution and these ignitions are located randomly in the watershed successful ignition depends on fuel load and fuel moisture deficit of the chosen pixel if an ignition is successful wmfire estimates the probability of subsequent pixel to pixel fire spread p s as an aggregate multiplier that combines empirical submodels of the contributions of fuel load p s l fuel moisture deficit p s d slope p s s and wind p s w 1 p s l d s w p s l p s d p s s p s w the multiplier for fuel load is based on rhessys patch litter carbon stores and increases with higher loads the multiplier for fuel moisture is based on the relative moisture deficit 1 actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration of vegetation making fire spread more likely with higher deficits the multiplier for slope is based on the direction of fire movement relative to topography with fire more likely to move upslope than downslope the multiplier for wind increases when fire spread is oriented in the direction of the wind and at higher speeds where a dominant wind speed and direction is selected randomly from a distribution estimated from historical weather data output from wmfire includes a map of pixels that have burned and the probability of spread for each burned pixel but provides no information on how fire alters vegetation structure as represented by rhessys carbon and nutrient stores associated with each vertical vegetation layer in a given patch the fire effects model developed in this study is intended to address this deficiency and complete the bidirectional coupling between fire regimes and ecohydrology 2 2 fire effects model fire effects are modeled as a function of surface fire intensity and canopy structure surface fire intensity is modeled classically as a function of the available fuel loading the heat content and the rate of spread byram 1959 wmfire provides a measure of the probability of spread for a given patch related to wind speed and direction relative moisture deficit fine fuel load and topography in our initial fire effects implementation we use the wmfire calculated probability of spread p s as a normalized index of surface fire intensity the fire intensity index fii the fire intensity index acts a proxy for surface fire intensity given that they are related to a similar set of variables and it increases monotonically with fire intensity consequently if a patch experiences a fire with a higher probability of spread for example upslope movement in the direction of wind with high litter loads and high fuel deficits we assume that the fire intensity index will also be higher we use this formulation of fire intensity index as a starting point for the fire effects model the general structure of the fire effects model is shown in fig 1 when fire enters a patch in the model fire effects are computed separately for surface understory and overstory carbon stores as noted previously we also alter nitrogen stores by using parameterized stoichiometric relationships in different plant organs or litter and soil organic material for the remainder of the paper we describe changes to carbon stores but note that nitrogen stores are also modified surface carbon for each of the four litter stores l1 c l2 c l3 c l4 c the top soil layer store s1 c and coarse woody debris cwd c are consumed at a fixed proportion based on formulas adapted from the consume model prichard et al 2017 2a l 1 c o n s 1 0 l 1 c 2b l 2 c o n s 1 0 l 1 c 2c l 3 c o n s 0 85 l 1 c 2d l 4 c o n s 0

fire effects model works with one or two canopy layers as rhessys is a multi layer gappy big leaf model each vegetation canopy within a patch is associated with a single top of canopy height the fire effects model includes two height thresholds that are used to determine the proportion of a given canopy that is classified as overstory or understory vegetation fig 1 vegetation canopies with a height above the upper threshold ho are classified as overstory vegetation vegetation canopies that have a height below the lower threshold hu are classified as understory vegetation vegetation canopies with heights between the thresholds are considered to represent overstory and understory proportionally based on the relative distance between the height thresholds a single vegetation canopy may be classified as an understory and an overstory at different times during its growth cycle depending on the canopies height relative to the height thresholds for locations with two vegetation canopies we refer to the dominant vegetation canopy e g forest as the primary canopy and the sub canopy e g shrubs as the secondary canopy recognizing that the secondary canopy may overtop the primary canopy under some conditions for locations with a single vegetation type e g shrublands the vegetation is referred to as the primary canopy canopy mortality in the fire effects model is defined as the vegetation carbon component that is killed by wildfire fig 1 a portion of the total mortality is then allocated either to carbon stores that are consumed by the fire and counted as a net carbon flux to the atmosphere or to residual plant material that falls to the ground as a carbon flux to surface carbon stores for a canopy classified as understory leaf material in a burned patch is assumed to undergo 100 mortality for all other canopy carbon stores classified as understory e g stem carbon root carbon the proportion of vegetation mortality v pmort is a function of fire intensity index in that patch 3 v p m o r t f i i k u m o r t 1 k u m o r t f i i 1 k u m o r t 1 k u m o r t 1 where ku mort is an canopy specific understory mortality parameter that may be calibrated to provide a species specific relation between fii and v pmort vegetation with high ku mort values is more resistant to fire whereas vegetation with low ku mort values is more sensitive to fire the total amount of vegetation carbon mortality in a canopy v mort is computed as 4 v m o r t v c v p m o r t where v c is defined as the pre fire carbon gc m2 for a given vegetation store for aboveground vegetation

where kcons is a species specific consumption parameter specifying the relation between v pmort and v pcons fig 1 low values of kcons indicate that vegetation is easily consumed by fire while high values of kcons indicate that vegetation has a greater tendency to remain on the landscape as litter coarse woody debris or standing deadwood the total amount of aboveground vegetation carbon consumed

v p c o n s canopy mortality of vegetation classified as overstory is governed by a different relation from eq 3 instead it is a function of the combined biomass consumed from vegetation classified as

sigmoidal relation and ko mort 2 is a scale parameter representing the combined amount of understory and litter consumption where v pmort is equal to 50 the relation represents the role of ladder fuels in propagating fire into the overstory with higher consumption in the understory or litter assumed to increase fire propagation differences in the value of the ko mort 2 parameter can be implicitly used to account for location and species specific differences in ladder fuel behavior 2 3 study sites the fire effects model was tested in four locations in the western u s a shrubland located in southern california open canopy mixed conifer forests in the southern sierra nevada and northern new mexico and a closed canopy conifer forest in oregon fig 2 these locations provide a diverse set of land cover types and fire regimes for evaluating the robustness of the fire effects model an illustration of the expected patterns of vegetation mortality for each of the four sites is provided in fig 3 and described in more detail below rattlesnake canyon is a predominately shrubland watershed on the south side of the santa ynez mountains near santa barbara california the elevation of the study site is 800 m and is composed of sclerophyllous evergreen shrubs including ceanothus ceanothus megacarpus chamise adenostoma fasciculatum and manzanita arctostaphylos spp mean annual precipitation for rattlesnake is 518 mm the mean annual maximum temperature is 21 6 c and the mean annual minimum temperature is 12 1 c many wildfires in this area are wind driven although fuel driven fires are also common chaparral shrublands are adapted for wildfire wildfires spread through the canopy as crown fires which can produce high mortality regardless of stand age during extreme conditions keeley and fotheringham 2003 as a result we would expect modeled shrubland mortality in rattlesnake to be more sensitive to surface fire intensity than canopy structure the p301 watershed site near shaver lake california in the southern sierra nevada is part of the southern sierra critical zone observatory and kings river experimental watersheds krew research networks the elevation of the site is 1950 m and the mean annual precipitation is 1308 mm the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature is 14 4 c and 3 2 c respectively and it is located within the rain snow transition zone the open canopy mixed conifer forest in p301 consists of ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa incense cedar calocedrus decurrens white fir abies concolor jeffery pine pinus jeffreyi and sugar pine pinus lambertiana the understory vegetation includes young conifer species and chaparral shrubland species such as greenleaf manzanita arctostaphylos patula and mountain whitehorn ceanothus cordulatus prior to fire suppression in the 1900s the mixed conifer forest in the sierra nevada had a low severity fire regime with frequent understory wildfire at 5 20 year return intervals and infrequent canopy fire due to sparse ladder fuels kilgore and taylor 1979 scholl and taylor 2010 without reoccurring fire in the landscape densities have increased in both the forest canopy and the understory over the past century mcintyre et al 2015 which has increased the likelihood of high severity canopy fire in p301 we would expect the fire effects model to replicate this behavior with the forest canopy resistant to fire except under extreme surface fire intensities or following a large buildup of surface and understory fuels the santa fe watershed site in new mexico is an open canopy forest situated at an elevation of 2760 m the site receives monsoon rainfall during the summer snowfall during the winter and has a mean annual precipitation of 633 mm the mean annual maximum temperature is 13 4 c and the mean annual minimum temperature is 0 5 c vegetation is mixed conifer forest consisting of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii engelmann spruce picea engelmannii ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa quaking aspen populus tremuloides white fir abies concolor and white pine pinus strobiformis margolis and balmat 2009 natural fire return intervals have been estimated to be between 10 and 28 years margolis and balmat 2009 similar to p301 fire suppression over the past century has increased ladder fuel loads in the understory increasing the risk of fire propagation into the forest canopy fuels management to reduce understory biomass is being conducted in the forest to decrease fire severity a useful fire effects model should be able to replicate these processes with increasing forest mortality following the accumulation of ladder fuels and decreased forest mortality following fuel treatments the h j andrews experimental forest site in oregon is situated at an elevation of 975 m the mean annual precipitation of 2266 mm is concentrated during the winter season with a mix of rain and snow the mean annual maximum and minimum temperature is 14 4 c and 4 5 c respectively the mixed conifer forest consists of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii western hemlock tsuga heterophylla western redcedar thuja plicata noble fir abies procera and pacific silver fir abies amabilis fire effects in h j andrews are closely related to stand development oliver 1981 following a stand replacing wildfire or other major disturbance the forest begins stand initiation during this period small stature trees are vulnerable to fire though in many cases surface fuels may be insufficient for fire spread as the forest canopy becomes taller and closed a stem exclusion phase begins where understory growth cannot establish and a lack of ladder fuels protects the forest canopy from crown fire after a period of time small disturbances and increased forest mortality create gaps in the forest canopy that allow understory vegetation and young trees to reinitiate this understory growth can act as a ladder fuel increasing the fire risk for the forest canopy we expect that the model should replicate fire effects at each phase of stand development in h j andrews with forest vulnerability to fire decreasing during the transition from the stand initiation phase to the stem exclusion phase and then increasing during the transition to the understory reinitiation phase assembled datasets for rattlesnake p301 santa fe and h j andrews are described in detail in shields and tague 2012 bart et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 and garcia et al 2013 respectively for rattlesnake daily precipitation data were obtained from santa barbara county flood control district gauge 228 located 4 km south of the study site and daily temperature data from a national climate data center ncdc monitoring station located 9 km south of the study site the combined precipitation and temperature dataset extends from water year 1989 to 2009 with the water year defined as october 1 of the previous year to september 30 of the present year daily precipitation and temperature data for p301 water years 1942 2005 were generated by extending the short record from a krew meteorological station located near the outlet of the p301 watershed hunsaker and safeeq 2018 with a longer record from the grant grove climate station located 40 km to the southeast daily precipitation was adjusted using a scaling factor and daily temperature was adjusted using a linear regression model son and tague 2019 santa fe daily precipitation and temperature data water years 1942 2008 were obtained from two national weather service cooperative network climate stations in the city of santa fe located approximately 14 km to the west of the study site daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature data for h j andrews water years 1958 2004 were taken from a climatic station at watershed 2 cs2met for all of the sites we repeated the observed climate sequences for simulations requiring time series that were longer than the observed records 2 4 analysis at each study site we tested the fire effects model at the patch scale using a three step approach first we simulated the ecohydrologic model in the absence of fire and selected a single set of soil and vegetation parameters that satisfactorily produced typical long term 100 150 year trajectories of vegetation growth including height and biomass of the primary and secondary canopies second we used a global sensitivity analysis to assess the performance of the model structure to improve understanding of potential fire watershed dynamics and to guide the selection of calibration parameters finally we applied the fire effects model to vegetation at various stand ages to evaluate whether the modeled fire effects occurring at different times in a stand growth trajectory conform to expected fire effect patterns for each of these analyses the fire effects model was evaluated decoupled from the fire spread model in this paper we focus on fire effects from individual fires of different intensities the evaluation of fire regimes using the fully coupled model will be addressed in subsequent papers the ecohydrologic model rhessys was used to simulate vegetation succession at each of the four sites to identify parameter combinations that were consistent with known patterns of vegetation succession comparisons were based on qualitative descriptions of stand development at each site qualitative calibration of the model was used due to a lack of century scale vegetation data to compare modeled vegetation dynamics simulations began with no vegetation reflecting conditions following a stand replacing wildfire vegetation in rattlesnake p301 and santa fe was simulated for 100 years without fire and vegetation conditions were evaluated at stand ages 5 12 20 30 40 60 and 80 years vegetation in h j andrews was simulated for 150 years without fire due to its longer growth cycle with vegetation conditions evaluated at stand ages 5 12 20 40 70 100 and 140 years two vegetation canopies were simulated for the three forested ecosystems with a primary canopy representing the trees and a secondary canopy representing smaller shade tolerant vegetation the secondary canopy at these sites was restricted to grow no higher than the understory height threshold hu the shrubland site rattlesnake was modeled with a single primary canopy simulations were conducted using a latin hypercube selection of 250 parameter sets across plausible ranges of a number subsurface and vegetation parameters that were expected to be important for growth garcia et al 2016 see table 2 for parameter list other vegetation and hydrologic parameters were chosen from rhessys parameter libraries the runs were evaluated visually to assure that most runs conformed to expected succession dynamics at each site however since the objective of the study was to evaluate the fire effects model and not succession dynamics a single parameter set that provided representative dynamics was selected from among all the simulations in order to reduce dimensionality of the subsequent sensitivity tests we selected the parameter set that produced most consistently the rank median height for each canopy and the rank median litter load across the selected stand ages at each site a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual components of the fire effects model and evaluate whether the model could be simplified or parameters in the model fixed song et al 2015 we used the variance based sobol approach which uses input parameter contributions to the modeled output variance as an estimate of parameter sensitivity pianosi et al 2016 the sobol approach has the advantage of working with non linear and non monotonic models it can also be used on models with interacting parameters and can estimate interaction effects song et al 2015 the sobol model produces two types of output first order and total order indices first order indices quantify the direct contribution of a parameter to the output variance total order indices quantify the combined direct contributions and the indirect contributions of a parameter on the output variance indirect contributions are generated from interactions with other parameters the sensitivity analysis was implemented using the sobol2007 function saltelli et al 2010 sobol et al 2007 in the r sensitivity package pujol et al 2017 the sensitivity of the fire effects model was tested separately for each of the seven stand ages inputs to the sensitivity model included the two parameters that define the height thresholds for each patch ho and hu and four parameters for each vegetation canopy ku mort kcons ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 table 3 we also included the fire intensity index in the sensitivity test although the fire intensity index is an input variable passed to the fire effects model rather than an adjustable parameter we were interested in understanding the relative contribution of the fire intensity index to model output variability compared to the other parameters as with all global sensitivity tests results using the sobol approach can vary depending on the variability space of the input parameters pianosi et al 2016 we selected broad parameter ranges that encompassed most of the plausible parameter space table 3 the sensitivity analysis was run with 1000 unique parameter sets for each stand age sensitivity output was evaluated for the relative post fire change in four model variables for each canopy v pmort v pcons v cons and v resid fire effects were evaluated separately for all combinations of the four study sites the seven stand ages and for ten levels of the fire intensity index to assess whether the fire effects model conformed to expected behavior fig 3 the levels of the fire intensity index ranged from 0 1 to 1 by 0 1 representing a range of very low intensity to very high intensity fire for each site stand age fire intensity index combination we simulated fire effects using a latin hypercube selection of 100 parameter sets based on the parameters that were previously identified to be sensitive in the sensitivity test see table 3 for a total of 28 000 fire effects simulations 3 results 3 1 vegetation simulation vegetation in the model was simulated in order to produce a representative example of vegetation growth at each site the simulated canopy heights and litter carbon stores for each of the 250 fire free runs are displayed in fig 4 along with the representative run that was used for the subsequent sensitivity test the parameter values corresponding to the representative run are displayed in table 2 for rattlesnake shrub height increased rapidly during the first 12 years and then began to level off peaking at a little over 2 5 m of height litter accumulation shows the cyclical signature of the looped 21 year climate sequence but overall litter accumulation was fairly steady over the growth cycle of the shrubs the two open canopy sites p301 and santa fe had similar behavior to one another in the absence of fire following an initial period of slow growth the primary canopy had a short period of rapid growth followed by a long period of slower but steady growth the height of the secondary canopy in p301 stabilized after about 40 years while the height of the secondary canopy in santa fe showed consistent growth throughout the 100 year simulation period litter carbon on the other hand showed consistent accumulation during the simulation period in p301 while litter carbon in santa fe was more variable and did not display a trend litter carbon accumulation in santa fe was lower than p301 reflecting the smaller forest size in santa fe due to drier conditions and potentially higher rates of decomposition with summer precipitation for the closed canopy forest at h j andrews strong primary canopy growth during the stem exclusion phase prevented the secondary canopy from becoming established however after 60 years understory initiation began when forest gaps in the primary canopy allowed the understory to become established litter carbon in h j andrews showed a steady increase with stand age when fire was excluded from the system 3 2 sensitivity test a global sobol sensitivity test was used to compare the relative influence of model parameters and the model input variable fire intensity index on fire effects the tests were performed separately for each site and stand age combination we found that the sensitivities first order indices of the shrublands at rattlesnake were very similar to the sensitivities of the secondary canopies at p301 santa fe and h j andrews we also observed that the first order indices of the two open canopy sites p301 and santa fe were similar accordingly we show only first order indices for the primary canopy in the three sites that showed distinct behavior rattlesnake p301 and h j andrews fig 5 first order indices for the primary canopy of santa fe and all secondary canopies are provided in supplemental material total order indices for all sites were not substantially different from first order indices indicating that interactions among the parameters and the fire intensity index were not a substantial contributor to the output variance these results are also available in supplemental material in rattlesnake the sensitivity results did not vary by stand age since the shrubs remained below the understory height threshold across all stand ages we note that this does not imply that fire intensity does not vary with stand age and associated fuel accumulation but rather that the effects of fire of a given intensity with a given parameter set do not change across stand ages fire effects in rattlesnake were sensitive to parameters ku mort and kcons as well as the fire intensity index fig 5a changes in the response variable for vegetation mortality v pmort and the response variables for consumption v pcons and v cons were most sensitive to the fire intensity index the parameter ku mort acted as a secondary control for these response variables and the parameter kcons as a tertiary control the response variable for the proportion of residual carbon that falls to the ground v resid had the kcons parameter as was the most sensitive parameter fire effects in rattlesnake were not sensitive to the two height threshold parameters or the two parameters that control the fire effects in the overstory ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 similar patterns of sensitivity were observed for the understory canopies at each of the forested sites see supplementary material the sensitivity of fire effects in the open canopy forest p301 varied across stand age fig 5b at stand age 5 sensitivity was similar to that of an understory since the height of the primary canopy was well below the understory height threshold fig 4c at stand age 12 primary canopy height was close to the understory height threshold hu and fire effects showed sensitivity to this parameter by stand age 20 primary canopy height was greater than the overstory height threshold and sensitivity in the model shifted sensitivity to parameters ku mort and kcons as well as the input variable fire intensity index was greatly diminished while the sensitivity to ko mort 2 which defines how much understory and litter biomass is needed to be consumed to generate 50 mortality in the overstory was greatly increased fire effects were generally much more sensitive to the parameter ko mort 2 than the parameter ko mort 1 except for the response variable v resid where both parameters were similarly sensitive fire effects sensitivity in h j andrews was similar to p301 shifting from understory sensitive parameters and the fire intensity index at stand age 5 to overstory sensitive parameters in older stands fig 5c in summary the sensitivity results indicate that for vegetation that is shorter than the understory height threshold fire effects are most sensitive to the ku mort and kcons parameters in addition we have shown that fire effects are also very sensitive to the fire intensity index for vegetation that is taller than the overstory height threshold fire effects are most sensitive to the ko mort 2 parameter for the simulation of fire effects in the following section we only allowed the parameters ku mort and kcons to vary for vegetation canopies that were a shrubland or an understory for forest canopies we allowed ku mort kcons ko mort 1 and ko mort 2 to vary since depending on stand age forest canopies may behave like both an understory and an overstory all other parameters were fixed including ho and hu since these parameters were not consistently sensitive across stand age or site the parameter ranges for the fire effect simulations are found in table 3 3 3 fire effects we evaluated the fire effects model to understand how well it could replicate the expected temporal dynamics of fire effect behavior at each of the four sites fig 3 fire effects at each site were simulated across 7 stand ages and 10 levels of fire intensity index a time series of the aboveground carbon stores primary canopy secondary canopy litter for each site is presented in the top panels of fig 6 and fig 7 the vertical lines indicate the stand ages that fire effects were investigated the remaining panels show the associated percentage change in mortality consumption and residual carbon for the primary canopy at each site the distribution of responses for each site stand age fire intensity index combination was generated using 100 parameter sets fire effects in rattlesnake were similar across all stand ages since the height of the vegetation never exceeded the understory height threshold mortality was roughly linear with the fire intensity index with some variability based on different parameter values of ku mort fig 6b canopy consumption increased non linearly with the fire intensity index with lower levels of consumption for a given level of the fire intensity index except when for the fire intensity index goes to 1 fig 6c the carbon that is killed but not consumed falls to the ground as residual litter carbon in rattlesnake residual carbon increased with the fire intensity index until peaking at intermediate levels of the fire intensity index at which time residual carbon began to decrease fig 6d the initial increase in residual carbon is a result of fractionally less canopy consumption for a given level of mortality at lower levels of mortality fig 1 this reverses at higher levels of mortality when consumption becomes a fractionally higher component of mortality and levels of residual carbon begin to decline the fire effect results for rattlesnake were similar to those of the secondary canopy at the forested sites for p301 at stand ages 5 and 12 the forest canopy remained below the understory height threshold of 4 m fig 4c consequently fire effects at these stand ages were similar to the shrubs in rattlesnake however beginning at stand age 20 the forest canopy grew beyond the overstory height threshold and the controls on mortality in the primary canopy shifted to being a function of the combined understory and litter consumption fig 6f for stand ages 20 and 30 understory and litter biomass consumption was insufficient to propagate fire into the primary canopy except at the highest levels of the fire intensity index however litter accumulation with stand age in the absence of fire increased the amount of fuels available to burn and by stand age 80 mortality in the primary canopy had increased for fires at lower levels of intensity changes in primary canopy consumption and residual carbon mirrored the patterns observed with rattlesnake with consumption in p301 increasing non linearly with mortality and residual carbon levels peaking at intermediate levels of the fire intensity index although the total amount of carbon that becomes litter is a smaller percentage for stand ages greater than 20 years fig 6g and h the controls on fire effects in santa fe were similar to p301 fig 7 at a young stand age the primary canopy behaved as an understory and fire effects were primarily a function of the fire intensity index fire effects were depressed initially after the primary canopy height exceeded the overstory height threshold but with time the primary canopy again became vulnerable to fire following a buildup of fuels in the secondary canopy fire effects in h j andrews followed the pattern of stand development fig 7 during the stand initiation phase stand age 5 the primary canopy was vulnerable to fire since its height was below the understory height threshold for stand ages 12 20 and 40 the forest grew into the stem exclusion phase and the closed primary canopy inhibited the secondary canopy from becoming established fire did not spread effectively into the primary canopy during this period making the forest primary canopy resistant to fire after stand age 60 the primary canopy in h j andrews entered the understory reinitiation phase and was parameterized to become an open canopy forest by decreasing the canopy cover fraction representing the expected gap dynamics that occur in maturing forests in this region spies et al 1990 during this phase the secondary canopy was able to reestablish and accumulate sufficient levels of biomass to act as ladder fuels to the primary canopy 4 discussion the fire effects model was specifically designed to be used with an established ecohydrologic model rhessys and to be compatible with carbon cycling and big leaf models in general due to constraints on the data and processes that can be incorporated into the model our objective was a parsimonious design that still included canopy structure as a key process controlling fire effects the results of this study demonstrated that the fire effects model containing two height parameters per patch and four additional parameters per canopy was able to replicate broad expected patterns of fire effect dynamics across different ecosystems fig 3 for shrubland ecosystems dominated by canopy fires such as california s chaparral the model produced fire effects that were independent of stand age which agrees with observed fire effects in the ecosystem moritz et al 2004 in the open canopy forests of p301 and santa fe that historically had a low severity fire regime the forest canopy showed little fire effects unless the stand age of the forest canopy was very young or a prolonged fire free period allowed litter and understory ladder fuels to build up to sufficient levels to allow fire to spread into the forest canopy this behavior conforms to observed fire effects in low severity fire regimes forests agee 1998 in the closed canopy forest at h j andrews fire during the stem exclusion phase had little effect on the forest canopy it was only during stand initiation and following understory reinitiation that the forest canopy showed noticeable fire effects the fire effects model captured the distinct patterns of vegetation growth and fire vulnerability at each of these sites without being designed explicitly to replicate these patterns this was an emergent property of the model 4 1 fire effects and shrubland understory vegetation fire effects in shrublands and forest understory were more responsive to variability in the fire intensity index than the model parameters regardless of watershed the fire intensity index is a proxy for surface fire intensity that in this modeling system is calculated by the fire spread model and is passed to the effects model this responsiveness was expected and emphasizes the importance of generating an adequate measure of fire intensity in order to correctly model fire effects in shrublands where the understory is the only canopy layer the sensitivity of fire effects to fire intensity can be interpreted as fire intensity distinguishing between low severity fire and stand replacing fire i e high severity fire regimes a high intensity fire in these systems will result in removal of live vegetation with potential second order consequences on slope stability soil erosion and hydrology shakesby and doerr 2006 a low intensity fire in contrast will result in more shrub survival and less carbon removed from the landscape fire effects in shrublands and forest understory were also sensitive though less so to the parameter that controls how fire intensity relates to mortality ku mort and the parameter that scales the proportion of mortality that is consumed kcons these parameters may be refined if vegetation species are known to be more or less susceptible to mortality or combustion which might vary by species average stem diameter or bark thickness 4 2 fire effects and forests for forested canopies the fire effects model was successfully able to replicate expected fire effects at multiple stand ages fig 3 in young forests fire effects were similar to those estimated for shrublands and understory vegetation with fire intensity being the primary control on fire effects at this stage of stand development forests function effectively as an understory and a high intensity fire early in stand development may represent a stand replacing event this may have implications for reburn potential thompson et al 2007 and type conversion boisramé et al 2017 that may be accommodated by the coupled modeling system prior ecohydrologic modeling with rhessys has shown that the local microclimatological conditions can have a strong impact on the rate of vegetation regeneration after disturbance tague and moritz 2019 we expect that the coupling of an ecohydrologic model with fire effects may be better able to predict such local microclimatological conditions e g water status for regeneration that are missing from non coupled models of future fire regimes in a changing climate in intermediate and late aged forests when the canopy exceeds the overstory height threshold fire effects were less responsive to the fire intensity index but were very responsive to the parameter that controls how much understory and litter consumption is necessary to produce overstory mortality ko mort 2 in this context the understory and litter biomass act as mediators between fire intensity and overstory fire effects a low value for the ko mort 2 parameter means that fire propagation to the overstory is such that even low understory and litter consumption results in high severity overstory fire this may be representative of forest species with low hanging branches or with thin non fire resistant bark a higher value requires larger amounts of understory and litter consumption for the same severity in the overstory we emphasize however that understory consumption captures many of the first order controls on fire propagation to the overstory including fuel moisture and understory biomass effects thus establishing general plant function type related ranges for this parameter might be feasible at the watershed scale implementation of the fire effects model will necessitate understanding how ko mort 2 varies for different forest types and under different conditions for example if the value of ko mort 2 is too low fire effects in the forest overstory may be predicted to be too severe in ecosystems with forest species that are relatively resistant to fire such as pinus ponderosa this may hinder the establishment of larger old growth open forests that are characteristic of many dry forests with frequent fire regimes in the western u s fulé et al 1997 in contrast if the value of ko mort 2 is too high the forest canopy may be invulnerable to fire regardless of how much understory and litter is consumed while this issue necessitates further investigation at the watershed scale with the fully coupled ecohydrologic model we note that our results in the two dry forest systems i e santa fe and p301 showed suitable behavior over a range of ko mort 2 parameter values table 3 thus we anticipate that the fire effects model is likely robust under many watershed conditions 4 3 fire effects and fire regimes in this study we simulated fire effects at different stand ages effectively variable fire return intervals or reburn intervals assuming that the vegetation was free of fire during the period prior to that stand age however in some forests particularly those with a historically low severity fire regime e g p301 and santa fe the understory could be subject to repeated fire under this scenario we expect the model will function well for example once a forest overstory is established in p301 a fire return interval of 5 20 years scholl and taylor 2010 would prevent a substantial build up of understory and litter biomass this lack of ladder fuels would hinder fire movement into the forest canopy except under the most extreme fire conditions the model is also able to account for changes in forest structure due to forest management fire suppression in a low severity fire regime forest such as p301 allows ladder fuels to accumulate increasing fire risk to the forest canopy similar to what is currently observed in many locations of the fire suppressed sierra nevada collins et al 2011 forest management tools such as mechanical understory thinning and prescribed fire can be represented in the ecohydrologic model and thus the potential for decreasing the likelihood of fire propagation into the forest canopy the coupled ecohydrologic approach is particular important here because it can account for differences in the effectiveness of these treatments associated with interaction among climate and fuel moistures forest growth rates and overstory understory relationships that evolve over time 4 4 model limitations and further development the fire effects model was designed to be structurally less complex than some established fire effects models e g fofem reinhardt et al 1997 and capture first order effects that are important for representing long term averages or fire regimes however because of this simplicity the model cannot capture many of the details that are important for replicating fire effects of specific wildfires for example the model doesn t account for the structure of the understory vegetation e g grass shrub that is consumed which can be an important second order control on how effectively the vegetation functions as ladder fuel in a similar manner the model also doesn t differentiate between consumption during the flaming front or post frontal combustion finney et al 2003 however incorporation of these more sophisticated fire effects elements would require a more complicated model structure that would not be compatible with the ecohydrologic modeling framework established in rhessys we have shown that the fire effects model can represent the major controls on fire effects namely different levels of intensity and stand structure wildfire is a contagious process and the physics of combustion and heat transfer confer autocorrelation in fire effects and observed fire severity kennedy and prichard 2017 prichard and kennedy 2014 the fire effects in a stand with a given fuel profile and structure are expected to differ depending on the fire intensity and behavior of neighboring stands johnson and kennedy 2019 when the fire effects model is integrated with a model of fire spread and an ecohydrologic model this coupled system will provide a spatial representation of fire spread and effects as they interact with the underlying topography wind and vegetation structure future development may consider longer correlation lengths between fire intensity index with commensurate representation of neighboring fire characteristics this would require careful consideration of scale in the framework of wmfire and considerable advancement in the representation of the physical process of heat transfer in models of intermediate complexity the performance of the fire effects model results will be sensitive to the performance of other submodels connected to the fire effects model particularly the fire spread model and models of both overstory and understory growth while previous studies have evaluated fire spread and general growth models in rhessys garcia et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 the ability to capture both understory and overstory growth has not been extensively evaluated evaluations of carbon cycling models in general often focus on aggregate responses through comparison with flux tower data friend et al 2007 or remote sensing products such as modis that lump overstory and understory biomass wu et al 2019 given the importance of overstory and understory distinctions as controls on fire effects additional evaluation of the ability of carbon cycling models to capture these layers is warranted ecohydrologic models are valuable tools that inform potential consequences of climate change land use change and forest management they incorporate dynamic physical and biological feedbacks that are essential to understand watershed processes as fire is an important physical and ecological driver in many watersheds mckenzie et al 2011 our understanding of future ecosystem services requires fully coupling fire spread and effects with ecohydrologic modeling we show here that this is possible within the existing model complexity framework of an ecohydrologic model and that we can achieve good replication of patterns of fire effects this will both improve our ability to understand future watershed dynamics but also to better project future fire regimes under climate change and land management littell et al 2018 showed that empirical projections of future fire regimes do not adequately represent feedbacks between climate and fuels the integration of the fire effects model developed in this study within an ecohydrologic model will allow us to explore those feedbacks declaration of competing
