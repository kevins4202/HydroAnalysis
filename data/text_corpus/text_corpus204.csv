1020,the life index can be useful to determine the effect of changes in river flow on the community of aquatic macroinvertebrates and as a tool for the implementation of environmental flows this study demonstrates how to classify aquatic macroinvertebrates into a flow category in order to adjust the life index to costa rica a panel of experts was surveyed to classify the most common genera into a water velocity category based on their experience also for one year aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected in the low and middle basin of the naranjo river under different velocities and by using the titan2 package their respective thresholds for current velocity were determined variation was observed in the responses of the expert panel however several taxa overlapped by more than 60 between the expert classification and the titan2 test results the titan2 test assigned a velocity threshold to 32 genera with the inflection point being 0 1 m s the expert panel served as a tool to assign a category to those genera that the titan2 test did not contemplate organisms without morphological adaptations to survive fast flowing conditions decreased in frequency above 0 1 m s while genera related to moderate and high velocities increased in frequency through the panel of experts and the titan2 test it was possible to assign the most common genera in the country to a current velocity category and therefore adjust the life index keywords aquatic insect current velocity titan2 flow reduction water flow categories 1 introduction the presence and abundance of aquatic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems depend on factors such as water quality hydrogeomorphological characteristics and flow variations teferi et al 2013 gallardo et al 2014 brooks haeusler 2016 the latter is a physical habitat structurer which in turn conditions the distribution richness and diversity of species variations in the flow regime also influence the life cycle of many aquatic species bunn arthington 2002 allan castillo 2007 izquierdo madroñero 2013 flow regime variations can be generated naturally by fluctuations in the rainfall regime due to the shift between seasons or caused either by climate change or the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon quesada 2011 also flow variations can result from human activities either by water extraction or by the construction of dams decreasing the natural flow of water addressing these variations in flow numerous ecological studies associated with droughts have been carried out ligeiro et al 2013 řezníčková šikulová pařil zahradkova 2013 chessman 2014 boulton 2015 pinheiro ligeiro lucena molozzi castillo 2018 mathers worrall wood 2019 and the impact of flow reduction on aquatic communities has been examined extence baldi chad 1999 phelan et al 2017 reducing the ecological flow of a river affects the health of the ecosystem since a natural flow regime is considered the main component for maintaining a functioning ecosystem pastor ludwig biemans hoff kabat 2014 natural flow allows the renewal of substrates along the basin and removes fine substrates such as gravel and sand from interstitial spaces thus maintaining these habitats available for aquatic macroinvertebrates also it influences the carryover of nutrients and maintains longitudinal and transverse functional connectivity from headwaters to mouths flotemersch stribling paul 2006 allan castillo 2007 white et al 2017 therefore to keep lotic ecosystems in good working order five characteristics of flow must be ensured magnitude frequency duration time and range of change bunn arthington 2002 allan castillo 2007 pastor et al 2014 several studies have shown a response positive or negative in the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to flow variation e g extence et al 1999 dunbar et al 2010 taxa associated with slow flows tend to increase in abundance when flow decreases while other species associated with rapid flows exhibit an opposite response extence et al 1999 řezníčková et al 2013 in this way certain taxa can function as indicators of flow conditions additionally perturbations in community structure may occur as a direct consequence of variation in flow patterns or indirectly through changes in associated habitats extence et al 1999 dunbar et al 2010 faced with this panorama extence et al 1999 developed the index called lotic invertebrate index for flow evaluation life this index consists of giving a numerical value to each taxon depending on the micro habitat it selects according to water velocity categories furthermore it gives a higher value to organisms that are dependent on rapid and turbulent flows since when the flow rate decreases the habitats that are affected in the first instance are the rapids and waterfalls cortes ferreira oliveira oliveira 2002 thus the index is used to measure the assemblage response of aquatic macroinvertebrates based on their sensitivity to changes in the flow currently in neotropical rivers there is a boom in the planning and construction of hydroelectric dams of various sizes bringing with it the impact on flow regimes and aquatic fauna arantes fitzgerald hoeinghaus winemiller 2019 costa rica is no exception since 65 of the energy produced in the country comes from hydroelectric dams blanco 2012 and there is no methodology in the country that allows for determining the degree of effects or changes that occur in the assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates due to the decrease in flow the life index can be used to provide a baseline for the velocity preferences of a country s most common and abundant genera these characteristics would allow it to be used to establish an adequate flow reference to protect and maintain ecological integrity in those rivers where the water resource is used it can also be used to measure the impact of water extraction and to determine the effects of changes in the morphology of a river nevertheless the life index was developed in england and hydrogeomorphological climatological and species composition are different in tropical rivers therefore the objective of this work is to adjust the life index for costa rica associating aquatic macroinvertebrates to a flow category 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the naranjo river basin is located in costa rica s central pacific slope this basin has a drainage area of 323 39 km2 which corresponds to 0 63 of the national surface bill 20 098 costa rica the anthropogenic intervention in the basin is minimal the main activity being agriculture coffee and african palm and there are no hydroelectric dams or other water extraction activities therefore this basin is considered as a reference a total of ten sampling events were carried out during one annual cycle in which the four hydrological seasons of the year were evaluated dry dry to rain transition rainy rain to dry transition two sites were selected the first named n1 9 5120778 84 0334194 located in the lower basin at 100 m a s l and a second site named n2 9 4629111 84 0679361 in the middle basin at 620 m a s l both sites are surrounded by very humid premontane forest according to holdridge s classification holdridge 1964 n1 is characterized by the presence of rapids riffles and pools additionally boulders and gravel dominate the substrate and there is contact between the water body and vegetation of the bank which is composed of dispersed trees and grasses in the second site n2 rapids predominate with substrates dominated by boulders and rocks and both margins are covered with trees and shrubs in order to sample the largest number of microhabitats as determined by water velocity at each sampling site and event a total of ten samples were randomly collected during the dry season and dry to rain transition sampling was carried out in a transverse manner starting on one margin and ending on the other during the rainy season and rain to dry transition due to the increase flow sampling was started in a transverse manner and the river was entered as far as possible but was then stopped and another one was started in a similar manner at another location upstream until completing the 10 samples in each microhabitat a flowmeter global water ba1100 was submerged depth and the velocity at 60 percent of the depth were determined leopold wolman miller 1992 afterwards a d net 500 micron pore was introduced and the substrate was removed for 30 seconds so that the organisms were trapped in the net the material trapped in the net was then placed in plastic bags and preserved with 85 ethanol for later separation in the laboratory aquatic macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level mostly to genus by using the following taxonomic keys contreras harris 1998 roldán 1998 manzo archangelsky 2008 flowers de la rosa 2010 ramírez 2010 and springer 2010 the organisms were deposited in the aquatic entomology collection of the zoology museum of the university of costa rica mzucr 2 2 adjusting life index the life index is made up of three sections the first establishes categories according to the association of macroinvertebrates at each velocity category table 1 the second section corresponds to different categories of aquatic macroinvertebrate abundance table 2 which is evaluated by taxon recorded the third section table 3 assigns a final value according to the combination of the abundance categories in each flow category where the organisms that inhabit turbulent zones are given higher scores extence et al 1999 the first step in adjusting the index was to determine to which category table 1 an organism belongs this association is general and in theory should not vary from one body of water to another a survey was carried out with an expert panel beecham hall britton cottee rainer 2005 consisting of biologists with more than five years of experience working with aquatic macroinvertebrates in the survey the most common genera and families in the country were included and the panel was asked to select in which category turbulent fast moderate slow stagnant each taxon is most frequently observed the expert panel functions as an evaluation tool while at the same time it allows assigning a score to those genera that were not reported in the reference river rio naranjo then with the taxa registered and identified the titan test was used threshold indicator taxa analysis king barker 2014 to obtain the approximate velocity range that each taxon uses this test allows us to obtain the distribution of taxa along an environmental gradient over time and space the gradient is divided into two groups z which corresponds to negative classifications and responds negatively to the increase in the variable and z which are positive classifications and respond positively to the increase in the gradient baker king 2010 king barker 2014 monk et al 2017 hanh et al 2018 for each taxon titan determines an optimal point of change as the value that maximizes the association of taxa within both groups when this point passes from low to high values the abundance and frequency of occurrence in group z will decrease while group z will increase to determine the accuracy of the change in point value a 500 repeat bootstrap was implemented it allows generating two groups purity and confidence to evaluate the quality of response of each taxon purity is defined as the proportion in response to a direction increase or decrease when it passes the point of change that matches the observed response pure indicators are assigned in the same response direction confidence is estimated by the proportion of change points that consistently result in the significant grouping of a taxon for this study purity and confidence were considered with 90 values through software r r core team 2019 the graphs of the answers of the panel of experts were done with the ggplo2 package wickham 2016 and threshold indicator taxa analysis with the titan2 package baker king kahle 2019 thus with the information provided by the panel of experts and the results of the titan test for the genera of the naranjo river it is possible to generate the association of each taxon to a velocity category within the life cr index it is important to clarify that the work of extence et al 1999 contemplates species genera and families however in the case of costa rica only the genus level was used due to the great diversity of species the absence of taxonomic keys to the species level and lack of larval descriptions springer echeverría gutiérrez 2014 3 results in the case of this study in section i table 1 velocity category vi was eliminated due to the absence of records of organisms capable of surviving drought conditions thus the first section has only five categories of flow conditions table 1 sections ii and iii remain the same as proposed by extence et al 1999 3 1 expert panel in order to classify each genus into a velocity category the criteria of the panel of experts was used with a total of six participants who classified 72 taxa into each of the categories here we present only the results for the genera of baetidae ephemeroptera perlidae plecoptera and trichoptera the rest of the genera and families can be found in the supplementary materials section as a summary of the answers according to the evaluation obtained by the panel of experts for the family baetidae mayobaetis and moribaetis were recorded more frequently in turbulent velocities baetodes and camelobaetidius in fast velocities and callibaetis in standing water figure 1 the genus anacroneuria was recorded by most of the panel of experts in velocities considered as fast and to a lesser extent in the turbulent category figure 1 in the case of trichoptera only the genus atopsyche hydrobiosidae was placed 100 of the time in the category of fast velocity in which the panel of experts registers it more frequently figure 2 the genera leptonema smicridea hydropsychidae chimarra philopotamidae rhyacopsyche and anchitrichia hydroptilidae were classified in fast velocity in over 50 of the responses the genus phylloicus calamoceratidae is the only one that was classified in the slow velocity category the rest of the genera showed discrepancies in the answers by the panel of experts figure 2 3 2 velocity category according to titan2 through sampling in the rio naranjo a total of 230 microhabitats determined by water velocity were evaluated and a total of 7742 organisms were identified in 75 genera 38 families and 11 orders the titan test showed that the inflection point for the threshold defined by water velocity is 0 1 m s this suggests that slow water taxa decrease rapidly in abundance and frequency from 0 1 m s onwards however the moderate and fast velocity taxa have a slight increase and then remain constant in abundance and frequency then both z and z continue to decrease figure 3 the percentage of pure and reliable taxa was 43 32 taxa of these 15 taxa are indicators of moderate and rapid water velocities and 17 of low velocities taxa such as anacroneuria paltostoma maruina limonia and leucotrichia had a higher response to the increase in velocity while callibaetis epigomphus caenis limnocoris and phylloicus responded to velocities less than 0 2 m s figure 4 with the expert panel and titan2 test 77 genera were classified into one of the five categories of mean current velocity some families were classified in a water velocity category on family level such as aeshnidae gomphidae odonata polycentropidae trichoptera gerridae veliidae hemiptera etc because all their genera are found in the same current velocity condition table 4 4 discussion there is worldwide concern about the overexploitation of water resources and watercourse modifications thus measures have been generated to protect ecosystems and ensure aquatic biodiversity abell et al 2019 the implementation of methodologies to identify the effects of alterations in water bodies has been useful in watershed management plans vörösmarty et al 2010 bunn 2016 the life index developed by extence et al 1999 can be a useful tool to determine environmental flows and effects on the modification of the river channel in this study we adapted the index for costa rica and classified the country s most abundant genera and families into a velocity category the panel of experts served as a tool to classify or calibrate the results obtained in the reference river beecham et al 2005 when the velocity range in the titan2 test covered several categories or to assign a value to genera not recorded hence the genera moribaetis and mayobaetis ephemeroptera baetidae fig 1 were recorded in the naranjo river but the titan2 test did not consider them because they had a confidence level lower than 90 however it was possible to assign them to the turbulent velocity category through the panel of experts nonetheless for some genera the classification by the panel of experts may be confusing due to variability in responses for example in the case of the genus nectopsyche trichoptera leptoceridae 45 of responses were obtained in moderate velocity 45 in slow and 10 in standing water this situation makes it difficult to assign it to a category if only this method is applied the titan test was developed in 2010 and since then few studies have been published determining the threshold of aquatic macroinvertebrates for the variable velocity monk et al 2017 hanh et al 2018 therefore this study is the first to identify the response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to this variable for a river in costa rica and the central american region it should be noted that in this case to adjust the index a river with a wide variation in flow with few anthropological alterations and without hydroelectric dams was selected in order to evaluate the range of velocities during the dry as well as rainy seasons and therefore to obtain the greatest diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates titan2 classified organisms that respond positively z to water velocity increases however this does not mean that the progressive increase of the variable also translates into a rise in frequency and abundance of organisms as there is a velocity threshold and the test identified that the tipping point for aquatic macroinvertebrates at rapid velocities is 0 5 m s similar to the preference curves obtained by gore layzer mead 2001 for ephemeroptera trichoptera and plecoptera which show that there is a range that organisms prefer and at extreme velocities 2 m s organisms are difficult to register for this study genera belonging to the families corydalidae perlidae crambidae and hydropsychidae from the orders megaloptera plecoptera lepidoptera and trichoptera respectively responded positively to the increase in water flow similar to the results of hanh et al 2018 in the guayas river ecuador on the other hand gomphidae leptohyphidae and leptoceridae in the naranjo river responded negatively z similar to the study by monk et al 2017 while in hanh et al s study 2018 they were classified as z this variation between studies may be due to the type of river where the study was conducted or to different genera and species within the evaluated family titan2 also classified organisms that respond negatively z to increases in water velocity the tipping point being 0 1 m s thus between 0 and 0 1 m s is the range where organisms such as phylloicus calamoceratidae oecetis nectopsyche leptoceridae epigomphus gomphidae hetaerina calopterygidae among others are most frequently and abundantly found the caddisflies classified in the z construct cases or refuges of small grains of sand or pieces of leaves and the dragonfly and damselfly larvae have elongated and cylindrical bodies nether condition is suitable for colonizing high velocities gordon mcmahon finlayson 2004 for this reason these organisms have adapted to the microhabitats of lower velocities when expert responses and results obtained from the titan2 test make it difficult to assign a velocity category we recommend the use of literature on body shape and life strategies that mention the type of habitat that the aquatic macroinvertebrates tend to colonize characteristics such as flattened bodies presence of spiracles strong claws suckers hooks and presence of silk are traits that can be found in organisms that prefer higher velocity zones gordon et al 2004 meanwhile features such as stone shelters oval body and swimming legs are typical for organisms that prefer low and zero velocities with this study we concluded that the panel of experts and the titan test are two tools that allowed us to classify the most common genera of costa rica to a velocity category in order to adjust the life index the proposed adjustment of the life index was tested in the naranjo river located on the pacific slope of costa rica we found a good response on the sensitivity of the index to changes in the flow quesada alvarado et al paper in progress the next step is to apply the index

beecham et al 2005 when the velocity range in the titan2 test covered several categories or to assign a value to genera not recorded hence the genera moribaetis and mayobaetis ephemeroptera baetidae fig 1 were recorded in the naranjo river but the titan2 test did not consider them because they had a confidence level lower than 90 however it was possible to assign them to the turbulent velocity category through the panel of experts nonetheless for some genera the classification by the panel of experts may be confusing due to variability in responses for example in the case of the genus nectopsyche trichoptera leptoceridae 45 of responses were obtained in moderate velocity 45 in slow and 10 in standing water this situation makes it difficult to assign it to a category if only this method is applied the titan test was developed in 2010 and since then few studies have been published determining the threshold of aquatic macroinvertebrates for the variable velocity monk et al 2017 hanh et al 2018 therefore this study is the first to identify the response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to this variable for a river in costa rica and the central american region it should be noted that in this case to adjust the index a river with a wide variation in flow with few anthropological alterations and without hydroelectric dams was selected in order to evaluate the range of velocities during the dry as well as rainy seasons and therefore to obtain the greatest diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates titan2 classified organisms that respond positively z to water velocity increases however this does not mean that the progressive increase of the variable also translates into a rise in frequency and abundance of organisms as there is a velocity threshold and the test identified that the tipping point for aquatic macroinvertebrates at rapid velocities is 0 5 m s similar to the preference curves obtained by gore layzer mead 2001 for ephemeroptera trichoptera and plecoptera which show that there is a range that organisms prefer and at extreme velocities 2 m s organisms are difficult to register for this study genera belonging to the families corydalidae perlidae crambidae and hydropsychidae from the orders megaloptera plecoptera lepidoptera and trichoptera respectively responded positively to the increase in water flow similar to the results of hanh et al 2018 in the guayas river ecuador on the other hand gomphidae leptohyphidae and leptoceridae in the naranjo river responded negatively z similar to the study by monk et al 2017 while in hanh et al s study 2018 they were classified as z this variation between studies may be due to the type of river where the study was conducted or to different genera and species within the evaluated family titan2 also classified organisms that respond negatively z to increases in water velocity the tipping point being 0 1 m s thus between 0 and 0 1 m s is the range where organisms such as phylloicus calamoceratidae oecetis nectopsyche leptoceridae epigomphus gomphidae hetaerina calopterygidae among others are most frequently and abundantly found the caddisflies classified in the z construct cases or refuges of small grains of sand or pieces of leaves and the dragonfly and damselfly larvae have elongated and cylindrical bodies nether condition is suitable for colonizing high velocities gordon mcmahon finlayson 2004 for this reason these organisms have adapted to the microhabitats of lower velocities when expert responses and results obtained from the titan2 test make it difficult to assign a velocity category we recommend the use of literature on body shape and life strategies that mention the type of habitat that the aquatic macroinvertebrates tend to colonize characteristics such as flattened bodies presence of spiracles strong claws suckers hooks and presence of silk are traits that can be found in organisms that prefer higher velocity zones gordon et al 2004 meanwhile features such as stone shelters oval body and swimming legs are typical for organisms that prefer low and zero velocities with this study we concluded that the panel of experts and the titan test are two tools that allowed us to classify the most common genera of costa rica to a velocity category in order to adjust the life index the proposed adjustment of the life index was tested in the naranjo river located on the pacific slope of costa rica we found a good response on the sensitivity of the index to changes in the flow quesada alvarado et al paper in progress the next step is to apply the index

1021,in the greater serengeti mara ecosystem with the serengeti national park snp at its core people and wildlife are strongly dependent on water supply that has a strong seasonal and inter annual variability the mara river the only perennial river in snp and a number of small streams originate from outside snp before flowing through it in those watersheds increasing grazing pressure from livestock deforestation irrigation and other land uses affect river flows in snp that subsequently have impacts on wildlife we quantified the changes since the 1970s of river discharge dynamics we found that the baseflow recession period for the mbalageti river has remained unchanged at 70 days which is a natural system inside snp by contrast it has decreased from 100 days in the 1970s to 16 days at present for the mara river coinciding with increased commercial scale irrigation in kenya that extract mara river water before it reaches snp this irrigation will result in zero flow in the river in snp if the proposed dams in the river in kenya are built we observed high flash floods and prolonged periods of zero flows in streams draining livestock grazed watersheds where severe major erosion prevails that results in gully formation this eroded sediment is expected to silt and dry out the scattered dry season water holes in snp which are an important source of drinkable water for wildlife during the dry season it appears likely that the future water supply of snp is at risk and this has major consequences for its people and wildlife ecohydrology based solutions at the

degradation are the key factors driving the progressive decline of the flows of the mara river the only perennial river in snp fig 1b mati et al 2008 gereta et al 2009 mnaya et al 2017 between 1973 and 2000 for the mara watershed upstream of snp there has been a decline in natural forest by 31 an increase in agricultural land by 204 and savannah and rangelands reduced from 79 to 52 of the basin land mati et al 2008 kipampi et al 2017 and all these have significantly impacted the river flow dynamics in addition there is commercial scale irrigation in kenya using mara river water fig 1c in 2005 it extracted mara river water at a rate of 0 5 m3s 1 in the dry season hoffman et al 2011 which is larger than the measured minimum mara river flow of 0 3 m3 s 1 in snp in 2005 gereta et al 2009 thus in 2005 irrigation farmers in kenya took out about 62 of the mara river water during the dry season water availability determines habitat use and the seasonal distribution of large herbivores during the dry season hopcraft et al 2012 owen smith 2015 thus human activities that change water availability is expected to affect large herbivores particularly water dependent species kihwele et al 2020 the annual animal migration in snp depends on water from the mara river in the dry season and several scattered water holes in the other otherwise dry rivers in snp wolanski et al 1999 mati et al 2008 gereta et al 2009 mnaya et al 2017 hydrologically the serengeti mara ecosystem is made up of four different watersheds namely the transboundary mara river shared between kenya and tanzania the grumeti river the mbalageti river and the simiyu duma river in the far southwest of snp all flowing westwards to lake victoria wolanski et al 1999 despite of the ecological importance of surface water the availability of water in the ecosystem has not been monitored nor has the threat to this water been quantified from the increased use of river water for irrigation the increased use of fires and the increased overgrazing by cattle in watersheds originating from upstream snp but draining into snp mainly through the grumeti river if these flow dynamics are not quantified and monitored their consequences for people and wildlife cannot be predicted and mitigated thus we collected field data on the effects of land use regimes on the flow properties of streams draining small watersheds inside and outside snp and simultaneously we collected data on rainfall and the flows in the large rivers in snp using these data we quantified the cause and effects processes affecting these life supporting components of the ecosystem in snp we suggest that these processes are significant enough that they need to be taken into account by decision makers for the sustainable management of snp and its surrounding areas to ensure sustainable biodiversity conservation and flows of benefits to people our study does that by answering four hydrological questions of importance to the ecosystem namely 1 what are effects of livestock grazing in the loliondo game controlled area lgca fig 1 outside snp on the flow characteristics of small streams draining into snp 2 what are the effects of fire inside snp on the flow characteristics of small streams 3 is the hydrology regime stable inside snp 4 is the mara river likely to dry out in snp in the future due to human activities in kenya 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the study area covered the serengeti national park snp and the lgca the climate of the area follows the classical bimodal rainfall pattern of east africa mainly restricted to november may peaking in december and in march april the long rain generally occurs from late february through may while short rain occurs between october and december there is a pronounced rainfall gradient with rainfall increasing from the south east 500 mm to the far north 1200 mm the altitude varies from 3000 m in the ngorongoro highlands to about 920 m in the west near the shore of lake victoria the physical boundary of the ecosystem is formed by the great rift valley and the ngorongoro highlands in the east and lake victoria in the west 2 2 study design we studied the flow dynamics by establishing gauging sites in both large rivers fig 2 and small streams fig 3 the watershed areas of both large rivers and small streams at each gauging site were delineated from digital elevation model dem using hydrology toolset of arg gis 10 4 esri the dem data were acquired through shuttle radar topographic mission srtm of the area downloaded from the united state geological survey usgs website through the hydrology tool of the spatial analyst tool we processed the dem data by running the flow direction and accumulation and established a pour point along a network of channels based on the pour points we delineated 12 small watersheds of 1 km2 for experimental watersheds and seven sub watersheds for monitoring flow dynamics in large rivers these small watersheds are all very close to each other in the same landscape with visual similar features suggesting that they have similar physical environmental properties such as soil texture soil heat and water retention properties 2 3 rainfall data we acquired rainfall data for the period 2016 to 2018 from climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data chirps through the web browser https www chc ucsb edu data 2 4 measurement of the discharge of large rivers river flow dynamics in the large rivers were monitored from july 2016 to october 2018 at the stations shown in fig 2 the headwaters of the watersheds varied in their land use the bologonja mbalageti seronera and duma watersheds are natural entirely protected ecosystems the headwaters of the mara grumeti banagi and warangi rivers are located in human dominated ecosystems upstream of snp figs 1 and 2 the loggers logged data at 30 min interval for each of the river we developed a rating curve from typically 8 10 measurements of the flow rates and the water level following chaudry 2008 1 q c h m where q is the water discharge m3 s 1 c is the discharge when the effective depth of flow h is equal to 1 m and m is the coefficient that typically has a value between 2 and 4 according to the watershed we then used the rating curve for each station to calculate the discharge rate for the entire period of observation from the half hourly collected water level data 2 5 measurement of the discharge of the streams draining the small experimental watersheds to quantify how land use affects the watersheds hydrological processes we monitored the streamflows in small 1 km2 watersheds in snp subject to fire and wildlife grazing fire livestock grazing in lgca livestock and wildlife grazing without cattle and fire in snp control fig 3 data on streamflow were measured by water pressure loggers reefnet s third generation dive data loggers sensus ultra from march 2017 to november 2017 the loggers were deployed at the pour point of each delineated watershed to measure the pattern of water levels following rainfall events the loggers logged data at 15 min interval so that all flow events were captured to convert these water level data into discharge data we used the manning equation for open channel hydraulics chaudry 2008 2 q v a 3 v k n a p 2 3 s 1 2 where q is the discharge n is the manning coefficient that depends on the stream bed sediment and roughness characteristics and vegetation in the stream a is the cross sectional area m2 of the stream p is the wetted perimeter m s is the slope of the stream v is the velocity of water m s 1 of the flowing water and k 1 these small watersheds are all very close to each other in the same landscape with visual similar features suggesting that they have similar physical environmental properties such as soil texture soil heat and water retention properties 2 6 measurement of grass biomass in small watersheds the grass biomass of each small watershed was measured along three transects perpendicular to the river bank of 200 m length at 0 100 and 200 meters from the river bank at each such site a 20 m sub transect was laid down where grass biomass was measured by dropping a rising plate meter pasture meter at ten points 2 m apart and measuring the grass height as a proxy for grass biomass the data on grass biomass were analysed in a mixed model analysis of variance with treatment livestock grazing fire and control as fixed effects and transect nested with watershed and watershed as random effects the model was fitted using the lme function of the nlme library in r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 as lme biomass treatment distance random 1 watershed transect method reml data data grass the significance of the differences between the treatments was calculated using a tukey hsd test using the transect average biomass as replication 2 7 measurement of the infiltration rate in small watersheds data on infiltration rate were obtained using a single ring infiltrometer 15 cm diameter in each experimental watershed we installed the infiltrometer by driving it about eight centimetres into the soil we then filled the ring with water we monitored the infiltration of water into the soil by manually recording the depth of the water in the infiltrometer every 5 min for an hour we calculated the average infiltration rate for each infiltration sequence as the slope of the linear regression of the remaining water level versus time visual inspection of the infiltration graphs showed that a linear model was appropriate we then tested the effect of treatment livestock grazing fire and control using one way analysis of variance followed by tukey contrasts 2 8 estimating the recession time scale for both large rivers and small streams the large rivers and the small stream in snp and lgca have a classical hydrological behaviour at recession comprising of an exponential decrease of surface runoff after rain followed by a slower exponential decrease of the flow sustained by the drainage of the shallow aquifer and finally followed by an even slower exponential decrease of the flow sustained by the drainage of the deep aquifer brown et al 1981 an example from our data for the seronera river is shown in fig 4 thus we could estimate the baseflow recession time scale which is the time required for the base flow to decrease to 1 8 of its original value by using eq 4 4 q q o exp kt where t is the time in days k is the recession coefficient it has units of day 1 it is the slope of the flow recession curve in a log plot q is the discharge m3 s 1 and qo is the discharge at time 0 after rainfall 3 results 3 1 visual observations the rivers with headwaters entirely within snp generally showed no sign of bank erosion as their banks were covered by vegetation figs 5 a c the streams originating from intensively cattle grazed areas outside of snp in loliondo game controlled area lgca were mostly erosion gullies with intense erosion during high flows fig 5d and this gully formation propagated downstream in snp fig 5e 3 2 flow characteristics of streams in small watersheds the flows in the small streams draining watersheds originating from cattle treated areas in lgca varied rapidly with short lived flash floods and flow recessions lasting a few hours only fig 6 table 2 by contrast the flows in the small streams draining the fire treated and the control watersheds were less spikey with smaller floods and with flows lasting much longer after rainfall indeed the mean flow recession period in the control watersheds was 2 53 days 1 72 n 4 which is not significantly different from that 2 46 days 1 49 n 4 in the fire treated watersheds and this is significantly larger than that of 0 106 days 0 066 n 4 in the livestock treated watersheds as a result the streams in the control small watersheds had no flow for 63 98 16 83 n 4 of the time on the average in the fire treated small watersheds for 73 70 5 12 n 4 of the time and in the livestock treated small watersheds for 83 98 9 13 n 4 of the time fig 6 3 3 grass biomass and infiltration rate in the experimental watersheds the mixed model analysis of variance for the grass biomass showed a significant effect of treatment f2 12 4 23 p 0 041 and distance f1 2652 18 22 p 0 001 while their interaction was not significant f1 2652 2 36 p 0 09 a subsequent tukey hsd test showed that the grass biomass was not significantly different between control and fire treated watersheds p 0 05 while the watersheds with livestock present had a significantly lower biomass than both these treatments fig 7 in general there was inter specific variation in grass biomass within and between watersheds with similar treatments fig s1 the infiltration rate data suggest that the control watersheds had higher infiltration rates than the fire and livestock grazing treatment fig 8 but this treatment effect was not significant in a one way anova f2 12 2 08 p 0 17 3 4 flow characteristics of large rivers the large rivers within snp each had different flow recession rate so that some rivers had longer lasting flows than others but nevertheless the flows all varied slowly with time scales of days to weeks fig 9 a c table 3 the discharges varied from river to river and so did the water yield i e the discharge divided by the watershed area and this can be attributed not just to the geology but also to the rainfall that varied spatially fig 9d f the mean baseflow recession time scale was 27 63 days 23 3 n 8 most importantly for the ecology excepting the mara river which is perennial and the bolongonja river which is sustained by a perennial spring with the small flow of 0 02 m3s 1 all the other rivers dried out during the dry season the average number of days with zero flow in each river was 67 1 days per year 44 n 5 minimum 3 5 days maximum 130 days substantial differences in the flow recession time scale occurred between rivers that time scale ranging between a maximum of 70 days for the mbalageti river at sopa bridge and a minimum of 5 4 days for the grumeti river at klein s bridge table 3 this implies that after rain the rivers differed significantly in the way their base flows decreased exponentially to 1 8 of the original flow fig 9a c the peak recorded discharge i e during floods for the mara and mbalageti rivers was respectively 623 3 m3 s 1 on 17 april 2018 and 193 8 m3 s 1 on 2 december 2017 fig s2 however these high flow data are based on an extrapolation of the rating curve to levels for which no data exist hence these data during floods are indicative only the peak observed flood flows for the bologonja warangi grumeti banagi and seronera rivers were respectively 0 17 m3 s 1 on 28 march 2017 27 7 m3 s 1 on 16 march 2018 11 6 m3 s 1 on 20 april 2018 132 3 m3 s 1 on 5 january 2018 and 10 4 m3 s 1 on 27 april 2018 fig s2 3 5 historical changes to river flows the world meteorological study of the white nile basin in 1970 1974 gauged the mara river at mara mines and the mbalageti river near its outlet in lake victoria smec 1977 brown et al 1981 both of these historical gauging sites are very close to our gauging sites the mbalageti river watershed is entirely within snp thus in a natural state the mara river watershed is mostly in kenya with extensive deforestation and increasing use of mara river for irrigation occurring in kenya since the 1970s as shown in table 3 the baseflow recession time scale of the mbalageti river was 70 days in the 1970s and this has not changed i e the hydrological characteristics have not changed in snp by comparison the baseflow recession time scale of the mara river has decreased by a factor of about 6 from 100 days in the 1970s to 16 4 days at present 3 6 sedimentation induced historical changes to rivers inside snp the seronera river site number 6 in fig 2 is located entirely inside snp and it is now being modified by long term sedimentation that likely results from wet season erosion from dirt roads in the southern grasslands of snp this is illustrated by sequential photos dating back to 1996 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 cattle grazing we investigated how livestock grazing and fire affect the condition of small watersheds and their streamflow yields the livestock grazing treated watersheds in lgca had a smaller grass biomass and a smaller water infiltration rate than that in the control watersheds in snp the flow recession period was the same 2 53 days in the control watersheds and in the fire treated watersheds however the flow recession period was much shorter 0 11 days in the livestock grazing treated watersheds where therefore flash floods were common during rainfall and the flows were short lived after rainfall in addition our visual field observations and photographic evidence revealed intense gully erosion in the small streams originating outside snp in the lgca where there is intensive livestock grazing a clear indication of deteriorating watersheds these small streams are the tributaries of large rivers of snp such as the grumeti river which is seasonal in the dry season these rivers do not flow but they hold water through a network of water holes along the river the spikey floods in the small streams in lgca bring this sediment to snp and this sediment silts these water holes and shortens the time that these water holes retain water in the dry season evidence for the silting of water holes from soil erosion upstream is found in water holes in the seronera river that are silting from erosion from dirt roads in the southern grasslands of snp the sedimentation of the dry season water holes is expected to have a severe impact on the ecosystem because water from these water holes allows for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores in the dry season kihwele et al in prep thus cattle grazing in the buffer zones especially the lgca is likely to dry out these water holes in the future and thus this will alter the whole ecosystem processes and functioning in summary the hydrology has remained stable for watersheds within snp but river flows have become much more spikey and fast drying for the watersheds outside snp but draining into snp 4 2 irrigation in kenya the baseflow recession period of the mbalageti river has not changed 70 days table 3 since the 1970s its watershed is entirely within snp thus it is in a natural state because of total protection of resources in snp thus the hydrology of rivers entirely within snp appears stable over the last 45 years by contrast the baseflow recession time scale of the mara river in snp has decreased from 100 days in the early 1970s to 16 4 days at present this change means that for mara river water to reach snp in the early 1970s in the dry season a rainfall event was needed every 3 4 months in the mau forest in kenya now this is needed every 2 3 weeks this suggests that a future drought is likely to stop the mara river flow entering snp the main reason for that appears to be commercial irrigation in kenya indeed google earth images show that there are two commercial scale irrigation areas using mara river water in kenya one area is that shown in fig 1c and it appears slightly changed in surface area since 2005 the other area is located a few km downstream and it appears to have substantially grown by 40 since 2005 indicating that the total irrigation area may have increased by about 20 in 2005 the water extracted from the mara river for commercial scale irrigation in kenya was 0 5 m3s 1 during the dry season hoffman et al 2011 in the same year the low flow discharge of the mara river in snp was 0 3 m3s 1 gereta et al 2009 implying that in 2005 the commercial irrigators were withdrawing 62 of mara river water before it reached the serengeti mara ecosystem in november 2016 we measured a mara river discharge of 0 16 m3s 1 i e the commercial irrigators in kenya were extracting 75 79 of the mara river water before it reached snp the threat of kenya withdrawing water from the serengeti ecosystem is even worse because there are proposed dams on the mara river and its tributary the nyangores river also in kenya as well as a proposal for a dam in the mau forest in kenya to divert amala river water to another watershed to the east all these dams are located upstream of the irrigation areas the minimum proposed flow at the outlet of the dams would be 0 1 m3 s 1 mnaya et al 2017 however the irrigators in kenya are located downstream of these dams and to maintain their crops they need to extract all that water and thus they will completely dry out the mara river this will likely destroy the annual migration of wildebeest and zebras for which snp is famous mnaya et al 2017 the ecosystem may then change to one supporting a population of resident animals with no annual migration around water holes in rivers at least those that are not silting from overgrazing in lgca mnaya et al 2011 weeber et al 2020 indeed there is no other sufficient source of freshwater beside the mara river in snp in the dry season because as shown in table 3 all the other rivers dry out in the dry season except for the very small flow of 0 014 m3s 1 in the bologonja river that is fed by a perennial spring there is no drinkable water either in the southern plains of snp in the dry season because of high salinity levels gereta and wolanski 1998 wolanski et al 1999 gereta et al 2009 this paper is a plea for a strict control of commercial and artisanal irrigation in kenya and for improved livestock husbandry through increasing control of grazing in watersheds draining into snp with urgent action needed in lgca furthermore the use of fire as a management tool needs to proceed with caution and careful monitoring ecohydrology based solutions are urgently needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

2005 it extracted mara river water at a rate of 0 5 m3s 1 in the dry season hoffman et al 2011 which is larger than the measured minimum mara river flow of 0 3 m3 s 1 in snp in 2005 gereta et al 2009 thus in 2005 irrigation farmers in kenya took out about 62 of the mara river water during the dry season water availability determines habitat use and the seasonal distribution of large herbivores during the dry season hopcraft et al 2012 owen smith 2015 thus human activities that change water availability is expected to affect large herbivores particularly water dependent species kihwele et al 2020 the annual animal migration in snp depends on water from the mara river in the dry season and several scattered water holes in the other otherwise dry rivers in snp wolanski et al 1999 mati et al 2008 gereta et al 2009 mnaya et al 2017 hydrologically the serengeti mara ecosystem is made up of four different watersheds namely the transboundary mara river shared between kenya and tanzania the grumeti river the mbalageti river and the simiyu duma river in the far southwest of snp all flowing westwards to lake victoria wolanski et al 1999 despite of the ecological importance of surface water the availability of water in the ecosystem has not been monitored nor has the threat to this water been quantified from the increased use of river water for irrigation the increased use of fires and the increased overgrazing by cattle in watersheds originating from upstream snp but draining into snp mainly through the grumeti river if these flow dynamics are not quantified and monitored their consequences for people and wildlife cannot be predicted and mitigated thus we collected field data on the effects of land use regimes on the flow properties of streams draining small watersheds inside and outside snp and simultaneously we collected data on rainfall and the flows in the large rivers in snp using these data we quantified the cause and effects processes affecting these life supporting components of the ecosystem in snp we suggest that these processes are significant enough that they need to be taken into account by decision makers for the sustainable management of snp and its surrounding areas to ensure sustainable biodiversity conservation and flows of benefits to people our study does that by answering four hydrological questions of importance to the ecosystem namely 1 what are effects of livestock grazing in the loliondo game controlled area lgca fig 1 outside snp on the flow characteristics of small streams draining into snp 2 what are the effects of fire inside snp on the flow characteristics of small streams 3 is the hydrology regime stable inside snp 4 is the mara river likely to dry out in snp in the future due to human activities in kenya 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the study area covered the serengeti national park snp and the lgca the climate of the area follows the classical bimodal rainfall pattern of east africa mainly restricted to november may peaking in december and in march april the long rain generally occurs from late february through may while short rain occurs between october and december there is a pronounced rainfall gradient with rainfall increasing from the south east 500 mm to the far north 1200 mm the altitude varies from 3000 m in the ngorongoro highlands to about 920 m in the west near the shore of lake victoria the physical boundary of the ecosystem is formed by the great rift valley and the ngorongoro highlands in the east and lake victoria in the west 2 2 study design we studied the flow dynamics by establishing gauging sites in both large rivers fig 2 and small streams fig 3 the watershed areas of both large rivers and small streams at each gauging site were delineated from digital elevation model dem using hydrology toolset of arg gis 10 4 esri the dem data were acquired through shuttle radar topographic mission srtm of the area downloaded from the united state geological survey usgs website through the hydrology tool of the spatial analyst tool we processed the dem data by running the flow direction and accumulation and established a pour point along a network of channels based on the pour points we delineated 12 small watersheds of 1 km2 for experimental watersheds and seven sub watersheds for monitoring flow dynamics in large rivers these small watersheds are all very close to each other in the same landscape with visual similar features suggesting that they have similar physical environmental properties such as soil texture soil heat and water retention properties 2 3 rainfall data we acquired rainfall data for the period 2016 to 2018 from climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data chirps through the web browser https www chc ucsb edu data 2 4 measurement of the discharge of large rivers river flow dynamics in the large rivers were monitored from july 2016 to october 2018 at the stations shown in fig 2 the headwaters of the watersheds varied in their land use the bologonja mbalageti seronera and duma watersheds are natural entirely protected ecosystems the headwaters of the mara grumeti banagi and warangi rivers are located in human dominated ecosystems upstream of snp figs 1 and 2 the loggers logged data at 30 min interval for each of the river we developed a rating curve from typically 8 10 measurements of the flow rates and the water level following chaudry 2008 1 q c h m where q is the water discharge m3 s 1 c is the discharge when the effective depth of flow h is equal to 1 m and m is the coefficient that typically has a value between 2 and 4 according to the watershed we then used the rating curve for each station to calculate the discharge rate for the entire period of observation from the half hourly collected water level data 2 5 measurement of the discharge of the streams draining the small experimental watersheds to quantify how land use affects the watersheds hydrological processes we monitored the streamflows in small 1 km2 watersheds in snp subject to fire and wildlife grazing fire livestock grazing in lgca livestock and wildlife grazing without cattle and fire in snp control fig 3 data on streamflow were measured by water pressure loggers reefnet s third generation dive data loggers sensus ultra from march 2017 to november 2017 the loggers were deployed at the pour point of each delineated watershed to measure the pattern of water levels following rainfall events the loggers logged data at 15 min interval so that all flow events were captured to convert these water level data into discharge data we used the manning equation for open channel hydraulics chaudry 2008 2 q v a 3 v k n a p 2 3 s 1 2 where q is the discharge n is the manning coefficient that depends on the stream bed sediment and roughness characteristics and vegetation in the stream a is the cross sectional area m2 of the stream p is the wetted perimeter m s is the slope of the stream v is the velocity of water m s 1 of the flowing water and k 1 these small watersheds are all very close to each other in the same landscape with visual similar features suggesting that they have similar physical environmental properties such as soil texture soil heat and water retention properties 2 6 measurement of grass biomass in small watersheds the grass biomass of each small watershed was measured along three transects perpendicular to the river bank of 200 m length at 0 100 and 200 meters from the river bank at each such site a 20 m sub transect was laid down where grass biomass was measured by dropping a rising plate meter pasture meter at ten points 2 m apart and measuring the grass height as a proxy for grass biomass the data on grass biomass were analysed in a mixed model analysis of variance with treatment livestock grazing fire and control as fixed effects and transect nested with watershed and watershed as random effects the model was fitted using the lme function of the nlme library in r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 as lme biomass treatment distance random 1 watershed transect method reml data data grass the significance of the differences between the treatments was calculated using a tukey hsd test using the transect average biomass as replication 2 7 measurement of the infiltration rate in small watersheds data on infiltration rate were obtained using a single ring infiltrometer 15 cm diameter in each experimental watershed we installed the infiltrometer by driving it about eight centimetres into the soil we then filled the ring with water we monitored the infiltration of water into the soil by manually recording the depth of the water in the infiltrometer every 5 min for an hour we calculated the average infiltration rate for each infiltration sequence as the slope of the linear regression of the remaining water level versus time visual inspection of the infiltration graphs showed that a linear model was appropriate we then tested the effect of treatment livestock grazing fire and control using one way analysis of variance followed by tukey contrasts 2 8 estimating the recession time scale for both large rivers and small streams the large rivers and the small stream in snp and lgca have a classical hydrological behaviour at recession comprising of an exponential decrease of surface runoff after rain followed by a slower exponential decrease of the flow sustained by the drainage of the shallow aquifer and finally followed by an even slower exponential decrease of the flow sustained by the drainage of the deep aquifer brown et al 1981 an example from our data for the seronera river is shown in fig 4 thus we could estimate the baseflow recession time scale which is the time required for the base flow to decrease to 1 8 of its original value by using eq 4 4 q q o exp kt where t is the time in days k is the recession coefficient it has units of day 1 it is the slope of the flow recession curve in a log plot q is the discharge m3 s 1 and qo is the discharge at time 0 after rainfall 3 results 3 1 visual observations the rivers with headwaters entirely within snp generally showed no sign of bank erosion as their banks were covered by vegetation figs 5 a c the streams originating from intensively cattle grazed areas outside of snp in loliondo game controlled area lgca were mostly erosion gullies with intense erosion during high flows fig 5d and this gully formation propagated downstream in snp fig 5e 3 2 flow characteristics of streams in small watersheds the flows in the small streams draining watersheds originating from cattle treated areas in lgca varied rapidly with short lived flash floods and flow recessions lasting a few hours only fig 6 table 2 by contrast the flows in the small streams draining the fire treated and the control watersheds were less spikey with smaller floods and with flows lasting much longer after rainfall indeed the mean flow recession period in the control watersheds was 2 53 days 1 72 n 4 which is not significantly different from that 2 46 days 1 49 n 4 in the fire treated watersheds and this is significantly larger than that of 0 106 days 0 066 n 4 in the livestock treated watersheds as a result the streams in the control small watersheds had no flow for 63 98 16 83 n 4 of the time on the average in the fire treated small watersheds for 73 70 5 12 n 4 of the time and in the livestock treated small watersheds for 83 98 9 13 n 4 of the time fig 6 3 3 grass biomass and infiltration rate in the experimental watersheds the mixed model analysis of variance for the grass biomass showed a significant effect of treatment f2 12 4 23 p 0 041 and distance f1 2652 18 22 p 0 001 while their interaction was not significant f1 2652 2 36 p 0 09 a subsequent tukey hsd test showed that the grass biomass was not significantly different between control and fire treated watersheds p 0 05 while the watersheds with livestock present had a significantly lower biomass than both these treatments fig 7 in general there was inter specific variation in grass biomass within and between watersheds with similar treatments fig s1 the infiltration rate data suggest that the control watersheds had higher infiltration rates than the fire and livestock grazing treatment fig 8 but this treatment effect was not significant in a one way anova f2 12 2 08 p 0 17 3 4 flow characteristics of large rivers the large rivers within snp each had different flow recession rate so that some rivers had longer lasting flows than others but nevertheless the flows all varied slowly with time scales of days to weeks fig 9 a c table 3 the discharges varied from river to river and so did the water yield i e the discharge divided by the watershed area and this can be attributed not just to the geology but also to the rainfall that varied spatially fig 9d f the mean baseflow recession time scale was 27 63 days 23 3 n 8 most importantly for the ecology excepting the mara river which is perennial and the bolongonja river which is sustained by a perennial spring with the small flow of 0 02 m3s 1 all the other rivers dried out during the dry season the average number of days with zero flow in each river was 67 1 days per year 44 n 5 minimum 3 5 days maximum 130 days substantial differences in the flow recession time scale occurred between rivers that time scale ranging between a maximum of 70 days for the mbalageti river at sopa bridge and a minimum of 5 4 days for the grumeti river at klein s bridge table 3 this implies that after rain the rivers differed significantly in the way their base flows decreased exponentially to 1 8 of the original flow fig 9a c the peak recorded discharge i e during floods for the mara and mbalageti rivers was respectively 623 3 m3 s 1 on 17 april 2018 and 193 8 m3 s 1 on 2 december 2017 fig s2 however these high flow data are based on an extrapolation of the rating curve to levels for which no data exist hence these data during floods are indicative only the peak observed flood flows for the bologonja warangi grumeti banagi and seronera rivers were respectively 0 17 m3 s 1 on 28 march 2017 27 7 m3 s 1 on 16 march 2018 11 6 m3 s 1 on 20 april 2018 132 3 m3 s 1 on 5 january 2018 and 10 4 m3 s 1 on 27 april 2018 fig s2 3 5 historical changes to river flows the world meteorological study of the white nile basin in 1970 1974 gauged the mara river at mara mines and the mbalageti river near its outlet in lake victoria smec 1977 brown et al 1981 both of these historical gauging sites are very close to our gauging sites the mbalageti river watershed is entirely within snp thus in a natural state the mara river watershed is mostly in kenya with extensive deforestation and increasing use of mara river for irrigation occurring in kenya since the 1970s as shown in table 3 the baseflow recession time scale of the mbalageti river was 70 days in the 1970s and this has not changed i e the hydrological characteristics have not changed in snp by comparison the baseflow recession time scale of the mara river has decreased by a factor of about 6 from 100 days in the 1970s to 16 4 days at present 3 6 sedimentation induced historical changes to rivers inside snp the seronera river site number 6 in fig 2 is located entirely inside snp and it is now being modified by long term sedimentation that likely results from wet season erosion from dirt roads in the southern grasslands of snp this is illustrated by sequential photos dating back to 1996 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 cattle grazing we investigated how livestock grazing and fire affect the condition of small watersheds and their streamflow yields the livestock grazing treated watersheds in lgca had a smaller grass biomass and a smaller water infiltration rate than that in the control watersheds in snp the flow recession period was the same 2 53 days in the control watersheds and in the fire treated watersheds however the flow recession period was much shorter 0 11 days in the livestock grazing treated watersheds where therefore flash floods were common during rainfall and the flows were short lived after rainfall in addition our visual field observations and photographic evidence revealed intense gully erosion in the small streams originating outside snp in the lgca where there is intensive livestock grazing a clear indication of deteriorating watersheds these small streams are the tributaries of large rivers of snp such as the grumeti river which is seasonal in the dry season these rivers do not flow but they hold water through a network of water holes along the river the spikey floods in the small streams in lgca bring this sediment to snp and this sediment silts these water holes and shortens the time that these water holes retain water in the dry season evidence for the silting of water holes from soil erosion upstream is found in water holes in the seronera river that are silting from erosion from dirt roads in the southern grasslands of snp the sedimentation of the dry season water holes is expected to have a severe impact on the ecosystem because water from these water holes allows for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores in the dry season kihwele et al in prep thus cattle grazing in the buffer zones especially the lgca is likely to dry out these water holes in the future and thus this will alter the whole ecosystem processes and functioning in summary the hydrology has remained stable for watersheds within snp but river flows have become much more spikey and fast drying for the watersheds outside snp but draining into snp 4 2 irrigation in kenya the baseflow recession period of the mbalageti river has not changed 70 days table 3 since the 1970s its watershed is entirely within snp thus it is in a natural state because of total protection of resources in snp thus the hydrology of rivers entirely within snp appears stable over the last 45 years by contrast the baseflow recession time scale of the mara river in snp has decreased from 100 days in the early 1970s to 16 4 days at present this change means that for mara river water to reach snp in the early 1970s in the dry season a rainfall event was needed every 3 4 months in the mau forest in kenya now this is needed every 2 3 weeks this suggests that a future drought is likely to stop the mara river flow entering snp the main reason for that appears to be commercial irrigation in kenya indeed google earth images show that there are two commercial scale irrigation areas using mara river water in kenya one area is that shown in fig 1c and it appears slightly changed in surface area since 2005 the other area is located a few km downstream and it appears to have substantially grown by 40 since 2005 indicating that the total irrigation area may have increased by about 20 in 2005 the water extracted from the mara river for commercial scale irrigation in kenya was 0 5 m3s 1 during the dry season hoffman et al 2011 in the same year the low flow discharge of the mara river in snp was 0 3 m3s 1 gereta et al 2009 implying that in 2005 the commercial irrigators were withdrawing 62 of mara river water before it reached the serengeti mara ecosystem in november 2016 we measured a mara river discharge of 0 16 m3s 1 i e the commercial irrigators in kenya were extracting 75 79 of the mara river water before it reached snp the threat of kenya withdrawing water from the serengeti ecosystem is even worse because there are proposed dams on the mara river and its tributary the nyangores river also in kenya as well as a proposal for a dam in the mau forest in kenya to divert amala river water to another watershed to the east all these dams are located upstream of the irrigation areas the minimum proposed flow at the outlet of the dams would be 0 1 m3 s 1 mnaya et al 2017 however the irrigators in kenya are located downstream of these dams and to maintain their crops they need to extract all that water and thus they will completely dry out the mara river this will likely destroy the annual migration of wildebeest and zebras for which snp is famous mnaya et al 2017 the ecosystem may then change to one supporting a population of resident animals with no annual migration around water holes in rivers at least those that are not silting from overgrazing in lgca mnaya et al 2011 weeber et al 2020 indeed there is no other sufficient source of freshwater beside the mara river in snp in the dry season because as shown in table 3 all the other rivers dry out in the dry season except for the very small flow of 0 014 m3s 1 in the bologonja river that is fed by a perennial spring there is no drinkable water either in the southern plains of snp in the dry season because of high salinity levels gereta and wolanski 1998 wolanski et al 1999 gereta et al 2009 this paper is a plea for a strict control of commercial and artisanal irrigation in kenya and for improved livestock husbandry through increasing control of grazing in watersheds draining into snp with urgent action needed in lgca furthermore the use of fire as a management tool needs to proceed with caution and careful monitoring ecohydrology based solutions are urgently needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

1022,lid low impact development facilities play an important role in alleviating urban waterlogging and reducing non point source pollution considering the limited available area of the city it is not enough for studying how to select the combination of lid facilities when the total lid scale is determined in this study swmm model is used to simulate the effect for the combinations of three typical lid facilities rain garden green roof and permeable pavement in xixian new area of shaanxi province in china via once in a decade rainfall data based on the total area of lid facilities proposed is 15 of the total area of the simulated area how the three types of lid facilities are proportioned in the fixed area is studied topsis comprehensive evaluation method is used to select the optimal scenario considering water quantity water quality and construction cost the optimal scenario can be obtained when the rain garden proportion is 3 75 green roof proportion is 3 75 and permeable pavement proportion is 7 5 at this time the runoff control rate is 73 75 and the ss load reduction rate is 77 73 finally the rationality of topsis evaluation results is verified by response surface method the study also shows that combined lid facilities have better regulatory effects than single lid facility in the same total area the variation trend of runoff control rate and ss reduction rate has a high consistency these conclusions can provide technical reference for the selection of lid facilities and the determination of facility proportion in the subsequent sponge city construction keywords swmm lid facilities runoff control rate ss load reduction rate topsis response surface method 1 introduction due to the acceleration of urbanization the increase of hard pavement and impervious area proportion the natural hydrologic cycle mechanism is destroyed therefore urban waterlogging occurs frequently and water pollution is serious ma et al 2017 in recent years in order to solve the above problems the concept of sponge city has been more and more well known the main measure of it is to take the lid as the core aiming to have good storage infiltration and purification capacity for rainwater even if the underlying surface conditions of urban areas are changed han and wu 2019 lid facilities mainly include rain garden permeable pavement green roof biological retention cell rain barrel and so on swmm model was introduced by the us environmental protection agency in 1971 the model has a strong universality in simulation and a wide application range it can add many lid modules at the same time to simulate the process of runoff generation and concentration under the condition of rainfall as well as the generation erosion and transport of pollutant sara et al 2016 in recent years many scholars have made use of the powerful functions of swmm model and combined swmm with other methods to carry out relevant researches shang et al 2016 added rain garden and infiltration ditch measures to a core drainage area of fengxi new city in xixian new area to simulate the water quantity and quality under lid regulation then this study pointed out that the applicability of the two measures and which one was more optimal under different objectives at the same time for the construction of a new city without relevant data it was proposed to select the watershed similar to its nature as the reference for calibration and verification which can provide multiple data support and good matching on the basis of determining three lid facilities zhang et al 2018 provided the optimal proportion of three lid facilities to a commercial city of changzhou city by optimizing the allocation and taking the benefit economy as the goal kyle et al 2018 developed a coupled optimization simulation model by swmm with the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm borg moea the coupled model is capable of performing multi objective optimization which is used to evaluate lid stormwater controls based on swmm macro et al 2019 proposed a new open source model which combined swmm with the optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich it provides many heuristic optimization algorithms users can apply it to optimize the type size and layout of lid facilities as well as single target and multi target evaluation for the limited available area in the city it is necessary to study the best combination of various lid facilities in sponge city construction ehsan et al 2019 kyle et al 2018 in this paper fengxi new city in xixian new area of shaanxi province is taken as the study area to analyze the optimal proportion of typical lid facilities under the premise that the total area of lid facilities is fixed the key points of this study are as follows 1 establish and calibrate swmm model in the study area 2 use swmm to simulate various scenario of single lid facility and combined lid facilities 3 use topsis comprehensive assessment method to select the best scenario 4 the response surface method design expert is applied to verify the optimized configuration results 2 materials and methods 2 1 description to the research area the study area is located between xi an and xianyang of shaanxi province and the total study area is 23 65km2 the amount of natural precipitation here varies greatly from year to year and the seasonal distribution is uneven for example in september the precipitation is high but the winter is relatively small rainfall is concentrated in july august and september in the overall study area the southern terrain is higher than the north and the inner terrain of the area is flat with an average height difference of only 1 m according to the relevant plans the sponge city pilot area can be divided into six drainage areas the specific research area and drainage areas are shown in fig 1 2 2 the design of rainfall pattern and time series the local storm intensity formula is 1 q 2785 833 1 1 1658 l g p t 16 813 0 9302 where q is rainstorm intensity l s hm2 p is design return period a t is rainfall duration min t t 1 t 2 t 1 is starting water collection time 10 25 min t 2 is time of rainwater in the pipe min in this simulation chicago rainfall pattern is chosen the flood peak flow and runoff value of this rainfall pattern are stable and can be determined according to the rainfall intensity and rainfall duration conditions in a particular reproducing area li et al 2017 at home and abroad because of these characteristics of chicago rainfall pattern most scholars have applied it in related research and achieved good results in this study a 24 hour long term design rainfall pattern is used to construct a once in a decade rainfall time series which also can be used as the rainfall input under various subsequent design scenarios at the same time 19 2mm once in 2 years and once in 20 years rainfall are also set as short rainfall time series lasting 3 hours according to the rainfall pattern which are used for parameter sensitivity analysis of the model 2 3 swmm model establishment 2 3 1 generalization of the model according to the actual topographic map and rainwater network map the sub catchments nodes pipelines and outlets are generalized the water flow direction in the pipe is determined by the elevation of each node the generalization results are shown in fig 2 there are 217 sub catchments 165 nodes 165 pipe sections and 14 outlets in the study area the total study area is 23 65 km2 2 3 2 parameter settings the geometric parameters of the study area such as pipe length pipe diameter bottom elevation sub catchment area and impermeable area ratio were mainly obtained from the data of pipe network and underlying surface hydraulic and water quality parameters of swmm cannot be entirely obtained through the actual experiment so the initial value ranges of the parameters are determined according to the rainwater management model user manual environmental protection agency 2015 and a large number of relevant literatures johannessen et al 2019 hamouz and muthanna 2019 ehsan et al 2019 in the study area horton infiltration model is selected non linear reservoir model is used to calculate runoff concentration process and dynamic wave method is used to calculate drainage system among them hydraulic parameters mainly include the pipeline manning coefficient depression depth and soil seepage parameters the water quality parameters mainly include the flushing indicator the flushing coefficient the maximum accumulation and the accumulation rate constant in each land use type as the simulation area is a new urban area there are only a few actual water and water quality monitoring data so the data of adjacent basins can be used as the initial reference mark et al 2019 the sensitivity analysis of total runoff peak discharge and total suspended solids are carried out with rainfall data of 19 2mm once in 2 years and once in 20 years the results are shown in table a 1 and table a 2 the results show that the width of sub catchment area and manning coefficient of pipeline are the most sensitive among hydro hydraulic parameters among the water quality parameters the pavement and roof accumulated parameters are the most sensitive the simulated data of 20160918 and 20170916 rainfall events and the actual monitoring data were selected to calibrate the model parameters the rationality of model parameters was verified by rainfall events 20170925 and 20180702 the fitting results of measured data and simulated data in the verification process are shown in fig 3 after repeated adjustment and calculation calibration verification results of model parameters are shown in table a 3 the value of ens in the final four rainfalls are above 0 71 and the value of re is within 10 this indicates that the simulated values of the model are in good agreement with the actual measured values and the model parameters can be applied to the simulation analysis of water and water quality in the study area the final parameter settings are shown in table 1 the single parameters of each lid facility are determined by reference to the special report on low impact development in the core area of the new city of shaanxi the parameter values are shown in table 2 2 4 introduction of topsis topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution was first proposed by wang c l and yoon k in 1981 topsis ranks a limited number of evaluation objects according to their proximity to an idealized goal it can evaluate the relative merits of existing objects bo et al 2019 topsis method is a common method for multi objective decision analysis in a finite number of schemes in system engineering it is based on the normalized original data matrix to find the optimal and the worst scheme in a finite number of schemes which are expressed by the optimal vector and the worst vector respectively then the distance between each evaluation object with the optimal scheme and the worst scheme are calculated respectively which obtain the relative proximity between each evaluation object with the optimal scheme the rank of close proximity is used as the basis to evaluate the scheme 2 5 introduction of response surface method in this study the response surface method in design expert is used to verify the results design expert is a statistical software developed by state east company which is specially used for experimental scheme design and correlation analysis the response surface method can be used to fit the mathematical model through the results of the multi level test scheme and then the optimal point of the design is obtained mohamed et al 2019 through the analysis module the functional relationship between the response value and various factors can be analyzed and tested after selecting the mathematical transformation relationship and model fitting mode the software will automatically fit the parameters establish mathematical relationship and conduct variance analysis the optimization module can predict the best design parameters according to the established mathematical model relationship and the value range of each condition factor and the optimization objective 2 6 scenario setting and indicator calculation 2 6 1 scenario settings in order to simulate the proportion of all kinds of lid facilities in a fixed total area which is the best based on the relevant literature li et al 2019 mina et al 2019 te et al 2019 and the special research report on low impact development in the research area special report on low impact development of fengxi new city 2016 it is proposed to determine the establishment of lid facilities with a total area ratio of 15 according to the property map of the study area figure a 1 three kinds of lid facilities which are the most common to use and can respectively represent green space roof and pavement are selected as the research objects namely rainwater garden green roof and permeable pavement first of all in order to analyze the improvement effect of single facility with the increase of laying area the simulation calculation of different laying proportion of three types of single facility is carried out therefore seven scenarios with a proportion of 2 14 and the step size of 2 are set for the three lid facilities respectively secondly in order to carry out the simulation calculation of different proportions of three facilities under the condition of 15 fixed area ratio for combined lid facilities a total of 20 groups of different scenarios are set up to cover as comprehensive and scattered possible scenarios as possible this is to make the topsis comprehensive evaluation more accurate in general swmm is mainly used to simulate different scenarios and obtain relevant water quantity and quality data then topsis is used to evaluate multiple sets of simulation data to obtain the optimal scenario finally response surface method comes to check the rationality of the conclusion 2 6 2 indicator calculation each scenario has a certain improvement effect on water volume and water quality the specific improvement effect is quantified by calculating runoff control rate and pollutant load reduction rate the runoff control rate θ is calculated by the following formula 2 θ 1 r i r 100 where r i is total discharge volume in lid mode r is total discharge volume in traditional mode the pollutants simulated by the institute include ss suspended solids cod chemical oxygen demand tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen ma 2019 in urban runoff pollutants ss is often related to other pollutant indicators dhia et al 2008 so ss can be used as a control indicator of runoff pollutants the ss load reduction rate η is calculated by the following formula 3 η 1 p i p 100 where p i is total ss load in lid mode p is total ss load in traditional mode the construction costs of the three facilities refer to the special report on low impact development in the core area of fengxi new city the construction costs of rain garden green roof and permeable pavement are respectively 400 cny m2 350 cny m2 and 285 cny m2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of single lid facilities the simulated calculation results of water quantity and water quality of the three lid facilities under different laying proportion are shown in fig 4 as is shown when the laying proportion of each lid facility is increased both the runoff control rate and the ss load reduction rate show an upward trend in the laying scenario from 2 to 14 the runoff control rate of rain garden applied can increase from 38 70 to 45 92 and the ss load reduction rate can increase from 46 66 to 54 23 the runoff control rate of green roof applied increased from 31 42 to 43 25 and the ss load reduction rate increased from 40 32 to 50 88 the runoff control rate of permeable pavement applied increased from 36 63 to 45 92 and the ss load reduction rate increased from 38 93 to 54 22 under the same proportion of lid layout area the ss load reduction rate is higher than the runoff control rate this is because the initial rainwater pollution is severe but lid facilities can well retain the initial pollutants moreover when the same step size increases the proportion of lid laying the increase amplitude of the two indicators does not show a completely linear relationship the regulation effect of the rain garden has been maintained at a high level relative to the other two facilities but at a slower rate green roofs are the least effective of the three most of the green roofs are difficult to contain large amounts of rainwater which will eventually be discharged into adjacent green spaces or drainage pipes the regulation effect of permeable pavement increases rapidly with the increase of laying proportion 3 2 simulation results for lid combine facilities the 20 scenarios of three types of typical lid facilities combined under different laying proportion are established the swmm model is used to simulate and calculate the corresponding results as shown in table 3 it can be seen that the water quantity and water quality control effect of combined lid facilities are significantly improved compared with that of single lid facility when individual lid facilities are completely laid out in 15 of the total laying proportion the runoff control rates are only 44 097 46 277 and the ss load reduction rates are only 51 650 54 897 when the three type facilities are all used the maximum runoff control rate can reach 78 388 and the maximum ss load reduction rate can reach 80 772 the reasons for this prominent change are summarized as follows when only a type of lid facilities are set the number default is 1 in a sub catchment area because no specific number of facilities is set when adding multiple lid facilities there are multiple lid facilities in a sub catchment area for a sub catchment area multiple decentralized lid facilities must inevitably bring better regulatory effects than an individual single facility the variation trend of runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate in 20 scenarios is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the better runoff control rate is the better ss load reduction rate will be there is a significant consistent relationship between the variation trend of the two with the reduction of water volume pollutants are gradually reduced and the load reduction rate is also reduced in the same trend at the same time the ss load reduction rate is always higher than the runoff control rate which is still due to the higher content of pollutants in the initial rainwater while lid facilities can retain the most seriously polluted part of the initial rainwater 3 3 topsis comprehensive evaluation results 1 construct various matrices in this study 20 scenarios are evaluated and 3 evaluation indicators are calculated namely runoff control rate ss load reduction rate and construction costs the initial evaluation matrix is obtained from the raw data and the standardized matrix is calculated the runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate are both profitability indicators while the construction cost is loss indicators therefore this paper gives the same weight of 0 5 to the two kinds of indicators for research there are two types of profitability indicators for the purpose of studying different targets two extremes are chosen here the final weighting method is shown in table 4 according to the above three weighting methods three weighting matrices z1 z2 and z3 are calculated respectively the calculation results are as follows z 1 0 0377 0 0423 0 0916 0 0492 0 0481 0 0986 0 0486 0 0478 0 1056 0 0359 0 0398 0 1125

the positive and negative ideal solutions of the evaluation indicators according to the three weighting matrices the three group s results are calculated as follows z 1 0 0639 0 0623 0 0916 z 1 0 0359 0 0398 0 1286 z 2 0 1277 0 0000 0 0916 z 2 0 0718 0 0000 0 1286 z 3 0 0000 0 0623 0 0916 z 3 0 0000 0 0398 0 1286 3 calculate the euclidean distance and relative closeness degree of each evaluation scenario the euclidean distance calculated according to the formula is shown in table a 4 the relative nearness value obtained from the calculation results of euclidean distance is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the calculation results of relative nearness corresponding to the three weighting methods all reach the maximum value in the sixth scenario in the sixth scenario when the proportion of total lid facilities is 15 rain garden and green roof account for 3 75 and permeable pavement accounts for 7 5 the reason for the maximum value of the three weighting methods in the sixth scenario is that the change trends of runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate are highly consistent the better the runoff control rate is the better the ss load reduction rate will be moreover these two indicators are both profitability indicators and their total weight value remains unchanged according to the analysis of three individual lid facilities rainwater garden has the best effect but the highest cost green roofs are the least effective and the second most expensive with the increase of the laying proportion the effect of permeable pavement is faster and the cost is the lowest therefore when the three facilities are combined the proportion of permeable pavement is the largest 3 4 the result of response surface method 20 scenarios are input into the response surface method of design expert and the discrete points are fitted through the analysis module among the three fitting indicators the construction cost presents a simple linear relationship so the error is not analyzed here after fitting each scenario the normal distribution probability of the residual is shown in figure a 2 in the probability graph of normal distribution of each residual all scatter points basically surround a straight line with significant linear relationship the software conducts variance analysis according to the relationship between independent variables and each response value and conducts regression analysis on each fitting model the analysis results are shown in table a 5 analysis of variance is used for significance test of equation and coefficient the larger f value is the smaller sig and c v are indicating the lower degree of data dispersion and the higher significance and reliability it can be seen from table a 5 that the sig value of the two regression models is less than 0 0001 indicating that this regression model has a strong significance regression analysis is used to reflect the linear relationship between the input value and the predicted value meanwhile both the determination coefficient and the correction coefficient are greater than 0 9 indicating that the predicted value is highly reliable and can be used for prediction and optimization analysis the regression equation obtained by response surface method is as follows runoff control rate 73 51 11 84 a 3 30 b 28 92 ab 25 44 ac 17 95 bc ss load reduction rate 76 99 13

permeable pavements respectively the optimization module is used to optimize the layout proportion of three types of lid facilities weights are assigned according to the first method the optimization goal is the larger runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate while the smaller construction costs the constraint condition is that the total proportion of three lid facilities is 15 the response surface method provides two recommended scenarios and the optimization results are shown in table 5 it shows that the recommended results are close to the results obtained by topsis comprehensive assessment which proves that the conclusion is credible 4 conclusions and recommendations any lid facility of any proportion can improve water quantity and quality this improvement effect is gradually enhanced with the increase in the proportion of lid facilities but the increase rate does not show a linear trend combined lid facilities can improve water quantity and water quality significantly compared with individual facilities this indicates that if various lid facilities can be reasonably used better water quantity and water quality improvement will be achieved in different scenarios it can be seen that the change rules of runoff control rate and ss load cut rate are highly consistent a better runoff control rate is bound to bring a better ss load reduction rate meanwhile in the same scenario ss load reduction rate is often higher than runoff control rate considering the poor water quality of initial rainwater lid facilities can well retain and purify these pollutants according to the topsis assessment method when the total lid laid area is 15 of the study area rain garden and green roof account for 3 75 and permeable pavement accounts for 7 5 whatever weighting method can achieve the best cost performance this conclusion is also verified by response surface method in the further study more consideration should be given to the reasonable collocation of lid facilities according to local conditions in the actual project appropriate lid facilities should be selected according to the actual situation and specific objectives while the layout proportion should be studied strictly especially for new urban areas due to strong land availability and large available land area a variety of lid facilities can be selected to set without considering the total layout

1022,lid low impact development facilities play an important role in alleviating urban waterlogging and reducing non point source pollution considering the limited available area of the city it is not enough for studying how to select the combination of lid facilities when the total lid scale is determined in this study swmm model is used to simulate the effect for the combinations of three typical lid facilities rain garden green roof and permeable pavement in xixian new area of shaanxi province in china via once in a decade rainfall data based on the total area of lid facilities proposed is 15 of the total area of the simulated area how the three types of lid facilities are proportioned in the fixed area is studied topsis comprehensive evaluation method is used to select the optimal scenario considering water quantity water quality and construction cost the optimal scenario can be obtained when the rain garden proportion is 3 75 green roof proportion is 3 75 and permeable pavement proportion is 7 5 at this time the runoff control rate is 73 75 and the ss load reduction rate is 77 73 finally the rationality of topsis evaluation results is verified by response surface method the study also shows that combined lid facilities have better regulatory effects than single lid facility in the same total area the variation trend of runoff control rate and ss reduction rate has a high consistency these conclusions can provide technical reference for the selection of lid facilities and the determination of facility proportion in the subsequent sponge city construction keywords swmm lid facilities runoff control rate ss load reduction rate topsis response surface method 1 introduction due to the acceleration of urbanization the increase of hard pavement and impervious area proportion the natural hydrologic cycle mechanism is destroyed therefore urban waterlogging occurs frequently and water pollution is serious ma et al 2017 in recent years in order to solve the above problems the concept of sponge city has been more and more well known the main measure of it is to take the lid as the core aiming to have good storage infiltration and purification capacity for rainwater even if the underlying surface conditions of urban areas are changed han and wu 2019 lid facilities mainly include rain garden permeable pavement green roof biological retention cell rain barrel and so on swmm model was introduced by the us environmental protection agency in 1971 the model has a strong universality in simulation and a wide application range it can add many lid modules at the same time to simulate the process of runoff generation and concentration under the condition of rainfall as well as the generation erosion and transport of pollutant sara et al 2016 in recent years many scholars have made use of the powerful functions of swmm model and combined swmm with other methods to carry out relevant researches shang et al 2016 added rain garden and infiltration ditch measures to a core drainage area of fengxi new city in xixian new area to simulate the water quantity and quality under lid regulation then this study pointed out that the applicability of the two measures and which one was more optimal under different objectives at the same time for the construction of a new city without relevant data it was proposed to select the watershed similar to its nature as the reference for calibration and verification which can provide multiple data support and good matching on the basis of determining three lid facilities zhang et al 2018 provided the optimal proportion of three lid facilities to a commercial city of changzhou city by optimizing the allocation and taking the benefit economy as the goal kyle et al 2018 developed a coupled optimization simulation model by swmm with the borg multi objective evolutionary algorithm borg moea the coupled model is capable of performing multi objective optimization which is used to evaluate lid stormwater controls based on swmm macro et al 2019 proposed a new open source model which combined swmm with the optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich it provides many heuristic optimization algorithms users can apply it to optimize the type size and layout of lid facilities as well as single target and multi target evaluation for the limited available area in the city it is necessary to study the best combination of various lid facilities in sponge city construction ehsan et al 2019 kyle et al 2018 in this paper fengxi new city in xixian new area of shaanxi province is taken as the study area to analyze the optimal proportion of typical lid facilities under the premise that the total area of lid facilities is fixed the key points of this study are as follows 1 establish and calibrate swmm model in the study area 2 use swmm to simulate various scenario of single lid facility and combined lid facilities 3 use topsis comprehensive assessment method to select the best scenario 4 the response surface method design expert is applied to verify the optimized configuration results 2 materials and methods 2 1 description to the research area the study area is located between xi an and xianyang of shaanxi province and the total study area is 23 65km2 the amount of natural precipitation here varies greatly from year to year and the seasonal distribution is uneven for example in september the precipitation is high but the winter is relatively small rainfall is concentrated in july august and september in the overall study area the southern terrain is higher than the north and the inner terrain of the area is flat with an average height difference of only 1 m according to the relevant plans the sponge city pilot area can be divided into six drainage areas the specific research area and drainage areas are shown in fig 1 2 2 the design of rainfall pattern and time series the local storm intensity formula is 1 q 2785 833 1 1 1658 l g p t 16 813 0 9302 where q is rainstorm intensity l s hm2 p is design return period a t is rainfall duration min t t 1 t 2 t 1 is starting water collection time 10 25 min t 2 is time of rainwater in the pipe min in this simulation chicago rainfall pattern is chosen the flood peak flow and runoff value of this rainfall pattern are stable and can be determined according to the rainfall intensity and rainfall duration conditions in a particular reproducing area li et al 2017 at home and abroad because of these characteristics of chicago rainfall pattern most scholars have applied it in related research and achieved good results in this study a 24 hour long term design rainfall pattern is used to construct a once in a decade rainfall time series which also can be used as the rainfall input under various subsequent design scenarios at the same time 19 2mm once in 2 years and once in 20 years rainfall are also set as short rainfall time series lasting 3 hours according to the rainfall pattern which are used for parameter sensitivity analysis of the model 2 3 swmm model establishment 2 3 1 generalization of the model according to the actual topographic map and rainwater network map the sub catchments nodes pipelines and outlets are generalized the water flow direction in the pipe is determined by the elevation of each node the generalization results are shown in fig 2 there are 217 sub catchments 165 nodes 165 pipe sections and 14 outlets in the study area the total study area is 23 65 km2 2 3 2 parameter settings the geometric parameters of the study area such as pipe length pipe diameter bottom elevation sub catchment area and impermeable area ratio were mainly obtained from the data of pipe network and underlying surface hydraulic and water quality parameters of swmm cannot be entirely obtained through the actual experiment so the initial value ranges of the parameters are determined according to the rainwater management model user manual environmental protection agency 2015 and a large number of relevant literatures johannessen et al 2019 hamouz and muthanna 2019 ehsan et al 2019 in the study area horton infiltration model is selected non linear reservoir model is used to calculate runoff concentration process and dynamic wave method is used to calculate drainage system among them hydraulic parameters mainly include the pipeline manning coefficient depression depth and soil seepage parameters the water quality parameters mainly include the flushing indicator the flushing coefficient the maximum accumulation and the accumulation rate constant in each land use type as the simulation area is a new urban area there are only a few actual water and water quality monitoring data so the data of adjacent basins can be used as the initial reference mark et al 2019 the sensitivity analysis of total runoff peak discharge and total suspended solids are carried out with rainfall data of 19 2mm once in 2 years and once in 20 years the results are shown in table a 1 and table a 2 the results show that the width of sub catchment area and manning coefficient of pipeline are the most sensitive among hydro hydraulic parameters among the water quality parameters the pavement and roof accumulated parameters are the most sensitive the simulated data of 20160918 and 20170916 rainfall events and the actual monitoring data were selected to calibrate the model parameters the rationality of model parameters was verified by rainfall events 20170925 and 20180702 the fitting results of measured data and simulated data in the verification process are shown in fig 3 after repeated adjustment and calculation calibration verification results of model parameters are shown in table a 3 the value of ens in the final four rainfalls are above 0 71 and the value of re is within 10 this indicates that the simulated values of the model are in good agreement with the actual measured values and the model parameters can be applied to the simulation analysis of water and water quality in the study area the final parameter settings are shown in table 1 the single parameters of each lid facility are determined by reference to the special report on low impact development in the core area of the new city of shaanxi the parameter values are shown in table 2 2 4 introduction of topsis topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution was first proposed by wang c l and yoon k in 1981 topsis ranks a limited number of evaluation objects according to their proximity to an idealized goal it can evaluate the relative merits of existing objects bo et al 2019 topsis method is a common method for multi objective decision analysis in a finite number of schemes in system engineering it is based on the normalized original data matrix to find the optimal and the worst scheme in a finite number of schemes which are expressed by the optimal vector and the worst vector respectively then the distance between each evaluation object with the optimal scheme and the worst scheme are calculated respectively which obtain the relative proximity between each evaluation object with the optimal scheme the rank of close proximity is used as the basis to evaluate the scheme 2 5 introduction of response surface method in this study the response surface method in design expert is used to verify the results design expert is a statistical software developed by state east company which is specially used for experimental scheme design and correlation analysis the response surface method can be used to fit the mathematical model through the results of the multi level test scheme and then the optimal point of the design is obtained mohamed et al 2019 through the analysis module the functional relationship between the response value and various factors can be analyzed and tested after selecting the mathematical transformation relationship and model fitting mode the software will automatically fit the parameters establish mathematical relationship and conduct variance analysis the optimization module can predict the best design parameters according to the established mathematical model relationship and the value range of each condition factor and the optimization objective 2 6 scenario setting and indicator calculation 2 6 1 scenario settings in order to simulate the proportion of all kinds of lid facilities in a fixed total area which is the best based on the relevant literature li et al 2019 mina et al 2019 te et al 2019 and the special research report on low impact development in the research area special report on low impact development of fengxi new city 2016 it is proposed to determine the establishment of lid facilities with a total area ratio of 15 according to the property map of the study area figure a 1 three kinds of lid facilities which are the most common to use and can respectively represent green space roof and pavement are selected as the research objects namely rainwater garden green roof and permeable pavement first of all in order to analyze the improvement effect of single facility with the increase of laying area the simulation calculation of different laying proportion of three types of single facility is carried out therefore seven scenarios with a proportion of 2 14 and the step size of 2 are set for the three lid facilities respectively secondly in order to carry out the simulation calculation of different proportions of three facilities under the condition of 15 fixed area ratio for combined lid facilities a total of 20 groups of different scenarios are set up to cover as comprehensive and scattered possible scenarios as possible this is to make the topsis comprehensive evaluation more accurate in general swmm is mainly used to simulate different scenarios and obtain relevant water quantity and quality data then topsis is used to evaluate multiple sets of simulation data to obtain the optimal scenario finally response surface method comes to check the rationality of the conclusion 2 6 2 indicator calculation each scenario has a certain improvement effect on water volume and water quality the specific improvement effect is quantified by calculating runoff control rate and pollutant load reduction rate the runoff control rate θ is calculated by the following formula 2 θ 1 r i r 100 where r i is total discharge volume in lid mode r is total discharge volume in traditional mode the pollutants simulated by the institute include ss suspended solids cod chemical oxygen demand tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen ma 2019 in urban runoff pollutants ss is often related to other pollutant indicators dhia et al 2008 so ss can be used as a control indicator of runoff pollutants the ss load reduction rate η is calculated by the following formula 3 η 1 p i p 100 where p i is total ss load in lid mode p is total ss load in traditional mode the construction costs of the three facilities refer to the special report on low impact development in the core area of fengxi new city the construction costs of rain garden green roof and permeable pavement are respectively 400 cny m2 350 cny m2 and 285 cny m2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of single lid facilities the simulated calculation results of water quantity and water quality of the three lid facilities under different laying proportion are shown in fig 4 as is shown when the laying proportion of each lid facility is increased both the runoff control rate and the ss load reduction rate show an upward trend in the laying scenario from 2 to 14 the runoff control rate of rain garden applied can increase from 38 70 to 45 92 and the ss load reduction rate can increase from 46 66 to 54 23 the runoff control rate of green roof applied increased from 31 42 to 43 25 and the ss load reduction rate increased from 40 32 to 50 88 the runoff control rate of permeable pavement applied increased from 36 63 to 45 92 and the ss load reduction rate increased from 38 93 to 54 22 under the same proportion of lid layout area the ss load reduction rate is higher than the runoff control rate this is because the initial rainwater pollution is severe but lid facilities can well retain the initial pollutants moreover when the same step size increases the proportion of lid laying the increase amplitude of the two indicators does not show a completely linear relationship the regulation effect of the rain garden has been maintained at a high level relative to the other two facilities but at a slower rate green roofs are the least effective of the three most of the green roofs are difficult to contain large amounts of rainwater which will eventually be discharged into adjacent green spaces or drainage pipes the regulation effect of permeable pavement increases rapidly with the increase of laying proportion 3 2 simulation results for lid combine facilities the 20 scenarios of three types of typical lid facilities combined under different laying proportion are established the swmm model is used to simulate and calculate the corresponding results as shown in table 3 it can be seen that the water quantity and water quality control effect of combined lid facilities are significantly improved compared with that of single lid facility when individual lid facilities are completely laid out in 15 of the total laying proportion the runoff control rates are only 44 097 46 277 and the ss load reduction rates are only 51 650 54 897 when the three type facilities are all used the maximum runoff control rate can reach 78 388 and the maximum ss load reduction rate can reach 80 772 the reasons for this prominent change are summarized as follows when only a type of lid facilities are set the number default is 1 in a sub catchment area because no specific number of facilities is set when adding multiple lid facilities there are multiple lid facilities in a sub catchment area for a sub catchment area multiple decentralized lid facilities must inevitably bring better regulatory effects than an individual single facility the variation trend of runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate in 20 scenarios is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the better runoff control rate is the better ss load reduction rate will be there is a significant consistent relationship between the variation trend of the two with the reduction of water volume pollutants are gradually reduced and the load reduction rate is also reduced in the same trend at the same time the ss load reduction rate is always higher than the runoff control rate which is still due to the higher content of pollutants in the initial rainwater while lid facilities can retain the most seriously polluted part of the initial rainwater 3 3 topsis comprehensive evaluation results 1 construct various matrices in this study 20 scenarios are evaluated and 3 evaluation indicators are calculated namely runoff control rate ss load reduction rate and construction costs the initial evaluation matrix is obtained from the raw data and the standardized matrix is calculated the runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate are both profitability indicators while the construction cost is loss indicators therefore this paper gives the same weight of 0 5 to the two kinds of indicators for research there are two types of profitability indicators for the purpose of studying different targets two extremes are chosen here the final weighting method is shown in table 4 according to the above three weighting

scenario the euclidean distance calculated according to the formula is shown in table a 4 the relative nearness value obtained from the calculation results of euclidean distance is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the calculation results of relative nearness corresponding to the three weighting methods all reach the maximum value in the sixth scenario in the sixth scenario when the proportion of total lid facilities is 15 rain garden and green roof account for 3 75 and permeable pavement accounts for 7 5 the reason for the maximum value of the three weighting methods in the sixth scenario is that the change trends of runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate are highly consistent the better the runoff control rate is the better the ss load reduction rate will be moreover these two indicators are both profitability indicators and their total weight value remains unchanged according to the analysis of three individual lid facilities rainwater garden has the best effect but the highest cost green roofs are the least effective and the second most expensive with the increase of the laying proportion the effect of permeable pavement is faster and the cost is the lowest therefore when the three facilities are combined the proportion of permeable pavement is the largest 3 4 the result of response surface method 20 scenarios are input into the response surface method of design expert and the discrete points are fitted through the analysis module among the three fitting indicators the construction cost presents a simple linear relationship so the error is not analyzed here after fitting each scenario the normal distribution probability of the residual is shown in figure a 2 in the probability graph of normal distribution of each residual all scatter points basically surround a straight line with significant linear relationship the software conducts variance analysis according to the relationship between independent variables and each response value and conducts regression analysis on each fitting model the analysis results are shown in table a 5 analysis of variance is used for significance test of equation and coefficient the larger f value is the smaller sig and c v are indicating the lower degree of data dispersion and the higher significance and reliability it can be seen from table a 5 that the sig value of the two regression models is less than 0 0001 indicating that this regression model has a strong significance regression analysis is used to reflect the linear relationship between the input value and the predicted value meanwhile both the determination coefficient and the correction coefficient are greater than 0 9 indicating that the predicted value is highly reliable and can be used for prediction and optimization analysis the regression equation obtained by response surface method is as follows runoff control rate 73 51 11 84 a 3 30 b 28 92 ab 25 44 ac 17 95 bc ss load reduction rate 76 99 13 87 a 3 80 b 25 68 ab 21 42 ac 12 44 bc construction costs cny 9460 a 8277 5 b 6740 25 c it s a simple linear relationship where a b and c represent the proportions of rain gardens green roofs and permeable pavements respectively the optimization module is used to optimize the layout proportion of three types of lid facilities weights are assigned according to the first method the optimization goal is the larger runoff control rate and ss load reduction rate while the smaller construction costs the constraint condition is that the total proportion of three lid facilities is 15 the response surface method provides two recommended scenarios and the optimization results are shown in table 5 it shows that the recommended results are close to the results obtained by topsis comprehensive assessment which proves that the conclusion is credible 4 conclusions and recommendations any lid facility of any proportion can improve water quantity and quality this improvement effect is gradually enhanced with the increase in the proportion of lid facilities but the increase rate does not show a linear trend combined lid facilities can improve water quantity and water quality significantly compared with individual facilities this indicates that if various lid facilities can be reasonably used better water quantity and water quality improvement will be achieved in different scenarios it can be seen that the change rules of runoff control rate and ss load cut rate are highly consistent a better runoff control rate is bound to bring a better ss load reduction rate meanwhile in the same scenario ss load reduction rate is often higher than runoff control rate considering the poor water quality of initial rainwater lid facilities can well retain and purify these pollutants according to the topsis assessment method when the total lid laid area is 15 of the study area rain garden and green roof account for 3 75 and permeable pavement accounts for 7 5 whatever weighting method can achieve the best cost performance this conclusion is also verified by response surface method in the further study more consideration should be given to the reasonable collocation of lid facilities according to local conditions in the actual project appropriate lid facilities should be selected according to the actual situation and specific objectives while the layout proportion should be studied strictly especially for new urban areas due to strong land availability and large available land area a variety of lid facilities can be selected to set without considering the total layout area this can not only achieve the goal of water quantity and water quality but also improve the landscape effect declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

1023,study area watershed of the tocantins araguaia river focus of the study given the large discharge of rivers in tocantins araguaia watershed taw and consequently a great potential for hydropower generation we used the swat model to simulate the streamflow of the taw and investigated its energy potential new approaches to local hydrology our goal is to use the flow estimated by swat to simulate the energy potential at the tucuruí hydropower plant in tocantins araguaia river pará brazil we identified that in swat calibration some parameters are more sensitive to water processes than others hence allowing the improvement of simulation in the taw the validation of the model showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data observed in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality it was possible to generate hydropower potential in the taw and evaluate its potential when the swat streamflow was calibrated and validated this study may be useful for planning sustainable management and decision making to create public policies of hydrological basins located in tropical regions keywords tropical basin simulated flow hydropower plant energy potential 1 introduction the management of water resources according to the availability of water and the production of electric energy is the main concern for the future of countries that are extremely dependent on hydropower such as brazil therefore changes in the hydrological regime due to climate variability and the dynamics of land use and cover make these countries highly vulnerable brazil relies on its water resources to generate electric energy as almost 71 of all electric energy is produced by hydropower plants epe 2018 oliveira et al 2017 electric energy production using renewable resources is a global trend therefore the global renewable energy matrix is increasing as well as the dependence of energy generation on climatic variables queiroz et al 2019 this jeopardizes future operational and planning processes in the energy systems and increases the need for hydroclimatic monitoring of the basins that maintain the hydropower plants hydropower plants are the most widely used renewable energy sources in the world and represent about 16 of the world s energy matrix and more than 65 of the current global energy production capacity balkhair and rahman 2017 iea 2019 compared to other renewable energy sources hydropower is reliable economical highly efficient with low maintenance cost and large storage capacity yuksel et al 2010 in this context the perspectives on new hydroelectric plants in brazil for the next 20 to 30 years will be to use the hydrological potential of the amazon and the cerrado epe 2018 in this current conjuncture calibrated and validated hydrological models are an important tool that can help to establish a monitoring network including the energy potential of a basin the soil and water assessment tool swat has been used globally arnold et al 1998 abbaspour et al 2004 schuol et al 2008 arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 abbaspour et al 2015 pereira et al 2016 silva et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 the swat is a continuous semi distributed model designed to incorporate input data of numerical and vectorial origin arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2014 which aims to predict the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the impacts of soil use and management on the hydrological cycle sediment transport and water quality in river basins in this context research on the energy potential of hydroelectric dams in brazil has started to gain prominence in recent years with sticler et al 2013 using the ibis model mendes et al 2017 using auto regressive stochastic modeling and queiroz et al 2019 using the mgb in the world much has already been done using swat for this purpose with kusre et al 2010 pandey et al 2015 kumar and sharma 2016 balkhair and rahman 2017 oliveira et al 2017 abera et al 2018 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 however in brazil only two studies conducted by oliveira et al 2017 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 uses the swat model to investigate the hydroelectric potential in a basin in the cerrado and amazon therefore our research comes to support this very important theme which is the monitoring of water resources and energy potential of dams tocantins araguaia watershed taw is a large scale tropical basin in brazil located in the transition between two biomes amazon and cerrado tropical rainforest regions have potential for hydropower generation and stand out in the energy growth strategies of many nations stickler et al 2013 the large amount of precipitation in amazon assists in recharging its rivers and in the hydrological cycle of the region as well as providing hydraulic support to other regions of brazil such as the cerrado brazilian savanna malhi et al 2008 for demarty and bastien 2011 these flows are essential for a high potential in electricity generation through hydropower plants therefore we focus on two lines of research i understand taw flow dynamics through modeling calibrate and validate the swat and ii assess tucuruí hydropower plant production downstream the taw using the simulated flow such steps are necessary to determine the efficiency of the swat model in simulating flow in large tropical basins and if this flow is effective in simulating the energy potential of a hydroelectric plant this will support future work on this theme and will help future hydroelectric plants 2 material and methods 2 1 study area tocantins araguaia watershed taw drains about 918 822 km2 covering part of the midwest north and northeast regions of the country occupying 11 of the brazilian territory fig 1 the tocantins river rises near the federal capital of brazil about 1000 m of altitude in the central region of brazil and flows to the north of the amazon for 2 640 km its main tributary is the araguaia river with 1 670 km of extension mma 2005 we delimited the boundaries of the basin to the municipality of itupiranga downstream where the flow gauge is located used to calibrate and validate the swat thus the study area now has 764 000 km2 which corresponds to about 9 of the national territory thus the study area now has 764 000 km2 which corresponds to about 9 of the national territory the topography of the basin varies from 1 674 upstream to 200 meters downstream according to data from the national institute of meteorology inmet the average temperature varies between 26 1 c to 27 4 c upstream of the basin and downstream the maximum temperature varies from 31 8 c to 33 6 c the climate is tropical continental and the annual cumulative rainfall in the basin is more than 2000 mm mma 2005 falck et al 2015 due to its territorial extension taw is influenced by meteorological systems of various scales fig 2 such as the south atlantic convergence zone sacz frontal systems fs and mesoscale convective systems mcs which aid the water recharge that begins in september and october kodama 1992 reboita et al 2010 falck et al 2015 we observed the spatial distribution of precipitation for the taw and the main atmospheric precipitation systems fig 2 and in the western region of the basin it precipitates more than in the eastern portion based on the land use and cover the west region matches the forest reserves of the amazon the tucuruí hydropower plant thp in terms of power generation is the third largest in brazil 13 second only to the giant itaipu binational 23 in the paraná river and the newly built belo monte plant in the western amazon 16 according to the national electric energy agency national electric energy agency aneel 2018 however in terms of billings thp in taw is the largest in brazil since itaipu revenue is divided with paraguay only in 2019 thp earned a revenue of r 1 5 billion brazilian currency and over its more than 30 years thp has already generated over r 52 billion or us 10 billion for brazilian public coffers 2 2 swat model the swat model was developed with the ability to simulate surface runoff percolation lateral and underground flow evapotranspiration snow

2009 neitsch et al 2011 lironga and jianyuna 2012 silva et al 2018 swat is a semi distributed mathematical based model that estimates the components of the hydrological cycle through equations based on the physical processes that occur in a basin arnold et al 2012 the hydrological cycle in the swat model and determination of water production in the watershed is based on eq 1 which is the main equation of the model defined by water balance 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y i q s u r f i e a i w s e e p i q g w i where sw t is the final soil water content mm of water sw0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm of water t is the time days r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm of water q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm of water e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm of water w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm of water and q gw is the amount of return flow on day i mm of water 2 3 swat input data 2 3 1 digital elevation model dem we first calculate the flow accumulation flow networks and slope and delineate the watersheds which requires the dem of the study area the dem used fig 3 b has a 30 m 30 m grid resolution in a raster format and was designed in universal transverse mercator coordinate system utm at the wgs84 datum obtained through the website of the united states geological survey usgs it was also used to delimitate the basin and its sub basins fig 3a 2 3 2 soil and land use and cover data the soil data of the basin were obtained from the database of the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa through the brazilian soil classification system for the year 2018 swat requires information on the soil physical and chemical properties texture water content hydraulic conductivity bulk density ph organic carbon content horizontal depth and percentages of sand silt and clay for each soil horizon desta and lemma 2017 the following soils were found for the taw cambissolo inceptisol cam latossolo vermelho amarelo oxisol clva neossolo flúvico entisol cnf plintossolo plinthic subgroup ffc gleissolo entisol gxdb luvissolo alfisol luv and argissolo ultisol pvad clva cnf and ffc are the dominant soils in the taw with 26 4 22 2 and 21 3 of the total area respectively fig 4 a for land use and cover we used data from the mapbiomas project mapbiomas 2020 which is an initiative involving a collaborative network with specialists in the brazilian biomes land uses remote sensing gis and computer science mapbiomas utilizes cloud processing and automated classifiers developed and operated from the google earth engine platform to generate a historical series 30 years of annual maps mapbiomas 2018 in this study we used land use and cover for the year 2017 which had pasture and forest as predominant land uses in the taw 48 and 40 6 respectively followed by agricultural areas 8 8 and wetlands 1 3 fig 4b it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the data presented in figs 2 and 3 for the modeling with swat because the model will perform combinations between surface variables dem soil and land use and cover forming the hydrological response units hrus estimates of each component of the water cycle are made for each hru thus the model can better represent the hydrological processes of the basin better strauch et al 2012 2 3 3 hydrometeorological data the following meteorological data were applied in this study precipitation p wind velocity w solar radiation sr relative humidity rh temperature t and dew point temperature dewp for the variables w sr rh t and dewp we used the database of the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr for the period from 1979 to 2013 available through the national centers for environmental prediction ncep there are ten meteorological stations belonging to the national institute of meteorology inmet in the study area which were used to characterize the local climate with higher efficiency similar variables extracted from cfsr were used but for the period from 1969 to 2017 finally for a better representation of p we used data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc referring to 7 000 stations globally which are interpolated generating a series of global precipitation from 1901 to 2016 schneider et al 2017 flow data were obtained at the station of itupiranga upstream of the tucuruí hydropower plant referring to the historical series of the national water agency ana with 48 years of data from 1969 to 2017 data from 1969 to 1979 were used in the warm up from 1979 to 1995 for running the swat model from 1995 to 2000 for its calibration and finally from 2000 to 2017 for its validation in order to calibrate the model with greater efficiency and accuracy because of the size of the basin we used 9 3 in each river more stations in the upstream downstream direction of the taw fig 2 all with 40 years of data 2 3 4 swat calibration and validation according to previous studies on swat in the world abbaspour et al 2015 and in brazil serrão et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 and with the knowledge of the study region we selected 22 hydrological parameters potentially relevant for sensitivity analysis to perform this analysis we used the software swat cup 5 2 1 1 2019 version applying the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns as the objective function we performed global sensitivity analysis with 4 iterations of 700 runs of the model to extract the most sensitive parameters the sufi 2 algorithm maps all parameters and attempts to simulate the measured data within the 95 confidence interval 95ppu in an iterative process abbaspour et al 2015 this confidence interval is described as the 95ppu range and is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of the output variable such as flow evapotranspiration and sediment abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 andrade et al 2019 after each iteration swat cup shows the modeler user new ranges of each selected parameter usually smaller than the previous iteration to reduce uncertainty and improve model performance these new parameters were used for the next iteration this process was repeated until the fifth iteration when no further improvement in simulated flow performance was achieved according to andrade et al 2019 there are two indices that can quantify the fit between the swat simulation and the observed flow data which are the p and r factors for abbaspour et al 2004 and abbaspour et al 2015 p factor is the percentage of data observed in the model s prediction confidence interval ranging from 0 to 1 with 1 being the perfect fit between simulated and measured data on the other hand the r measures the mean confidence interval of the 95ppu range abbaspour et al 2018 andrade et al 2019 during the swat cup execution in the sensitivity analysis of the parameters the program uses the t test to measure the significance of each parameter the higher the absolute value the more sensitive parameter will be thus we calibrated the main sub basins 3 5 7 17 19 because they had hydrological stations with flow measurements in the total study period and finally we calibrated the mouth river this gives us an excellent fit between simulated and actual flow for brighenti et al 2019 the sensitivity ranking can be defined by two coefficients the t stat index and the p value of the student test according to abbaspour et al 2015 and brighenti et al 2019 the t index indicates the magnitude of the sensitivity of each parameter and the p value shows the parameters that are most sensitive in the iteration flow results were validated using the statistical indicators recommended by the international precipitation working group ipwg and described by liu et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 serrão et al 2016 desta and lemma 2017 abbaspour et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 six statistical indices were used pearson correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r² and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ns nash sutcliffe 1970 and the index of agreement based on willmott 1985 iw in the qualitative analysis of the data we used the quality coefficient u according to theil 1966 and the coefficient of residual mass crm blainski et al 2017 these equations are presented below 2 n s 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 3 i w 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o i o i o i 2 4 u i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 5 c r m i 1 n s i o i i 1 n s i in these equations si is the flow estimated by swat oi is the observed flow o i and is the average value of the flow ns can vary from to 1 and values close to 1 indicate better model performance the performance of the model was considered satisfactory if ns 0 7 iw varies from zero to one with zero indicating no agreement and one indicating perfect agreement in this study iw 0 7 was considered satisfactory the u coefficient theil compares the estimated data with the observed data when u 0 the model overestimates the observed data and when u 0 the model underestimates the observed data therefore when u 0 the result of the estimated data is better than the measured data crm measures the average trend between the simulated and measured values crm 0 indicates a perfect relationship between the data whereas positive values indicate a tendency of overestimation by the model and negative values indicate underestimation of the simulated variable 2 5 electric energy potential from simulated flow this study obtained the energy potential of the tocantins araguaia watershed in the eastern amazon the energy potential was calculated using eq 6 basso and botter 2012 stickler et al 2013 mendes et al 2017 and queiroz et al 2019 6 e q ρ g η p 0 δ t h t η t q t d t where e q mw is the electric energy potential monthly h t m is the difference between the heights of the maximum upstream level and minimum downstream level of the dam monthly q t m3 s 1 is the actual and simulated flow monthly ρ kg m3 is the water density g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity ηt is the turbine efficiency coefficient ηp is the efficiency of the plant and coefficient values in the supplementary material from this it is possible to carry out an analysis of the electric energy potential for the thp the energy potential was generated using the actual flow at the itupiranga station and the potential according to the flow simulated by the swat model in order to verify the efficiency of the simulated energy potential it is important to note that the potentials calculated from the simulated and observed flows are representative of thp however as thp is downstream of the basin the energetic potential of thp is the largest in the basin as can be seen in fig s 3 of the supplementary material fig 5 shows the steps taken in the present study 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and flow calibration during the sensitivity analysis we chose 11 parameters for the calibration process according to arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 and abbaspour et al 2018 the success of the calibration is due to two main factors the first concerns to the physical factors of the model input data soil types climate land use in the case of basins located in tropical forests bruijnzeel 2004 giertz et al 2005 and igwe 2011 pointed that the types of soils in these basins facilitate the water processes of infiltration percolation aquifer recharge and base flow with regard to climatology more specifically the availability of water the tropical zone has the highest levels of precipitation on the globe favoring the water processes mentioned regarding land use the more homogeneous the better for modeling arnold et al 2012 and in the case of taw two major uses stand out forest and agriculture fig 4 the second point is the dependence on the sensitivity analysis and calibration of the model according to gassman et al 2007 and arnold et al 2012 the general hydrological balance is simulated for each hru including the interception of canopy precipitation runoff infiltration and redistribution of water in the soil profile all these processes are represented by the parameters that can be calibrated in the swat so we presented in table 1 the parameters used to calibrate the model the relevant parameters in the sub basins in the upstream downstream direction are parameterized based on the available data literature and modeler s experience this procedure results in the regionalization of the parameters hence we follow the calibration processes recommended by arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 using the parameters described in table 1 for the sensitivity analysis and calibration of the model and then we present table 2 developed by abbaspour et al 2015 for europe and adapted to the reality of the taw at this moment we were able to reduce the total flow volume esco cn2 canmx and the underground flow alpha bf gwqmn gw revap gw delay this procedure was performed during 4 iterations of 700 runs of the model so that the new suggested parameter ranges are modified as described in table 1 and another iteration is then performed the procedure continues until satisfactory results are achieved in terms of p factor and r factor or no further improvements are seen in the objective function abbaspour et al 2015 this methodology was used by silva et al 2018 to calibrate an amazonian sub basin where ns 0 99 was reached when the authors decreased the base flow and the curve number oliveira et al 2019 calibrated the model for the upper rio paranaíba basin in the cerrado and observed that the most sensitive parameters in the region were cn2 gw delay esco related to the underground and the surface flow in india anand et al 2018 was successful in calibrating the swat changing the parameters cn2 sol awc esco gw delay and gw revap in arid and semi arid regions the main problems reported are the short depth of the soil because of the bedrock consequently the main flow components are surface flows silva et al 2018 mengistu et al 2019 in this context silva et al 2018b calibrated the swat for the são francisco sub middle basin in the semi arid region of brazil in the northeast of the country the authors were successful in calibrating ns 0 98 after increasing the values of the parameters related to surface runoff cn2 surlag sol awc also in the northeast of brazil andrade et al 2019 calibrated the swat for a rural basin where cn2 was the main calibration parameter in south africa mengistu et al 2019 calibrated the swat using the same methodology and presented great results in pakistan ghoraba 2015 obtained an excellent swat calibration when he regionalized the parameters responsible for surface flows cn2 sol awc esco several authors have used the regionalization of parameters to calibrate the swat around the world showing the efficiency of the method abbaspour et al 2004 kannan et al 2007 arnoud et al 2012 baker and miller 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 dias et al 2015 pereira et al 2016 desta and lemma 2017 anand et al 2018 dos santos et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 3 2 validation of the streamflow simulated for taw fig 6 shows the observed and simulated streamflow for the taw and its validation we noted that swat succeeded in describing the simulated streamflow throughout the observed time series although there is an error range between the minimum values of streamflow in the validation of the flow using the equations described in 2 4 4 we observed that the correlation and determination coefficients showed good performance between the flows both above 0 95 for the nash sutcliffe coefficient and willmott s index of agreement the estimate exhibited excellent performance with ns 0 99 and iw 0 99 theil s u coefficient had a value very close to zero 0 02 and crm 0 02 for the p and r factors values of 0 82 and 0 62 were obtained respectively therefore the performance of the model was considered excellent despite the greater uncertainty r factor some studies reveal high statistical indices associated with basins with high river flows silva et al 2018a used the swat model to estimate flow runoff and sediment flux for a small basin in northeastern amazonia and observed the best results between the estimated and observed flows in the fluviometric station that had the highest flow with ns 0 98 in the exhaust also in brazil silva et al 2018b modeled the flow and sediment flux with the swat for the são francisco river basin the third largest basin in brazil they highlighted that the swat estimates the flow more efficiently in basins with high flow rates in rivers the authors indicated r 0 97 ns 0 93 and iw 0 98 for stations with the highest flow rates likewise dos santos et al 2018 showed excellent results with the swat model for an amazonian sub basin in the iriri river west of our study basin in summary these surveys show that the swat model is able to efficiently simulate basin flow with high water availability exhibiting excellent statistical indices for europe abbaspour et al 2015 used the swat model to simulate the continent s water balance and observed that the best fits r ns were for rivers with greater flow in the semi arid region of pakistan ghoraba 2015 obtained an excellent swat calibration ns 0 90 r2 0 95 using the same calibration method as in our swat cup study likewise mengistu et al 2019 provides techniques for calibration and validation of swat model in data scarce arid and semi arid catchments in south africa the authors highlight excellent results for basins with little measured data and low water availability in the brazilian semi arid region andrade et al 2019 successfully calibrated the swat for a rural basin despite the low density of meteorological and hydrological stations thus we understand that like in various locations in the world swat applies to amazonian rivers we observed that most of the values simulated by swat are within the 95ppu range indicating a good calibration within the model s uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 emphasized the importance of the 95ppu bandwidth when describing the statistical indices p factor and r factor silva et al 2018 and serrão et al 2019 commented on the difficulty of modeling hydrological processes in amazon especially at its maximum and minimum values this is because the seasonality of precipitation and the high dynamics of land use and cover have a direct influence on the baseflows and final discharge of the rivers in this region similar studies on graphical and statistical calibration of swat have been widely reported in the literature from arid and semi arid basins meaurio et al 2015 silva et al 2017 to tropical forest basins desta and lemma et al 2017 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 brighenti et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 3 3 energy potential this section presents the power generation capacity for the thp based on the flow simulated by the swat model in order to ascertain whether the simulated energy potential matches the actual potential of the basin fig 7 presents the monthly energy generation potential observed and simulated in addition to the monthly streamflow simulated hydropower potential is directly associated with the flow hence it usually follows its seasonality the seasonality of the amazonian water bodies has been widely discussed coe et al 2009 panday et al 2015 dias et al 2015 falck et al 2015 in this context the potential for energy generation is higher in the summer and autumn periods rainy seasons march and april are the months of greatest potential for energy generation according to the results observed with 11 808 mw and 11 647 mw respectively in addition these months have simulated potential to generate 11 793 mw and 11 447 mw respectively on the other hand the months of lowest energy production are september and october the period of lowest flow in which the hydrological year begins in the region moreover we observed that there is a slight difference between the simulated and observed potentials where the simulated underestimated the observed by 15 mw on average this study does not evaluate the losses during the energy generation process discussed by furtado and fernandes 2015 instead we evaluated the maximum potential of the generation the evaluation of electricity generation is not new and most studies use stochastic models guo et al 2018 hussain et al 2019 dumitru and gligor 2019 however the analysis of dynamic and physical models or the insertion of climate forcers needs to be further studied aiming at a better economic and sustainable development of the regions that have these energy systems fig 8 presents the relationship between the energy potential simulated and observed for the taw as well as its validation the fit between simulated and observed energy was satisfactory based on the statistical parameters of validation subsection 2 4 4 even though some points were outside the curve fig 8 the coefficients of correlation and determination showed excellent performance both above 0 95 similarly the nash sutcliffe coefficient and willmott s index also showed excellent performance with values of ns 0 99 and iw 0 99 for the estimated energy potential according to the swat flow theil s u coefficient was 0 02 and crm was 0 02 thus the simulated energy potential with the flow estimated by the swat model was considered efficient and validated despite slight overestimate of 0 02 in the simulated potential compared to the observed value it is within the error limits established by the energy planning company therefore with the swat flow it is possible to estimate the hydroelectric potential of a tropical basin to plan future projects and to evaluate the revenue produced by power generation stickler et al 2013 investigated the energy potential of the xingu river basin in the southern amazon region and its dependence on the climatic impacts they worked with a regional model of rainfall and water flow and considered the energy potential validated and calibrated with ns and r2 values above 0 75 mendes et al 2017 analyzed the uncertainty of hydropower expansion in the amazon according to modeled scenarios of land use for 100 years they considered the flow and the hydropower potential validated from ns and r2 equal to or higher than 0 85 pandey et al 2015 evaluated the hydropower potential of the mat river micro basin in southern india using swat and obtained ns 0 72 r2 0 72 and iw 0 92 acknowledging swat as a great tool for studies on this subject also in india kusre et al 2010 evaluated the hydropower potential of the kopili river basin and considered that swat achieved good performance in the simulation of the flow and consequently of the hydropower potential of the basin 4 conclusions this study investigated the flow simulated by the swat model for a large scale watershed in brazil the tocantins araguaia river watershed and the hydropower potential in the third largest hydroelectric plant in brazil tucuruí dam with the regionalization of parameters during the calibration process it was possible to obtain excellent results between the estimated flow and the observed flow in addition to understanding how each parameter influences the water balance of the region thus all the statistical performance indicators attest to the excellent modeling the hydropower potential in the thp was generated based on a calibrated and validated streamflow that was simulated by swat since the simulated flow was excellent relative to the observed flow we obtained excellent results in the comparison between energy production evidencing the importance of the calibration of the model that could assist future energy enterprises this study can serve as a guideline for public managers to create policies management of hydrological basins located in tropical regions and aid in plan and decision making to create public policies that better meet the demand for the sustainable exploitation of amazonian natural resources in the current conjuncture of changes in land use and climate our next studies intend to bring the perspective of climate change on hydrological cycle in taw and energy production in thp as well as the merging of the land use change effects with the different climate change scenarios of the ipcc then what impacts will climate and land use changes bring to taw and thp credit authorship contribution statement edivaldo afonso de

1023,study area watershed of the tocantins araguaia river focus of the study given the large discharge of rivers in tocantins araguaia watershed taw and consequently a great potential for hydropower generation we used the swat model to simulate the streamflow of the taw and investigated its energy potential new approaches to local hydrology our goal is to use the flow estimated by swat to simulate the energy potential at the tucuruí hydropower plant in tocantins araguaia river pará brazil we identified that in swat calibration some parameters are more sensitive to water processes than others hence allowing the improvement of simulation in the taw the validation of the model showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data observed in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality it was possible to generate hydropower potential in the taw and evaluate its potential when the swat streamflow was calibrated and validated this study may be useful for planning sustainable management and decision making to create public policies of hydrological basins located in tropical regions keywords tropical basin simulated flow hydropower plant energy potential 1 introduction the management of water resources according to the availability of water and the production of electric energy is the main concern for the future of countries that are extremely dependent on hydropower such as brazil therefore changes in the hydrological regime due to climate variability and the dynamics of land use and cover make these countries highly vulnerable brazil relies on its water resources to generate electric energy as almost 71 of all electric energy is produced by hydropower plants epe 2018 oliveira et al 2017 electric energy production using renewable resources is a global trend therefore the global renewable energy matrix is increasing as well as the dependence of energy generation on climatic variables queiroz et al 2019 this jeopardizes future operational and planning processes in the energy systems and increases the need for hydroclimatic monitoring of the basins that maintain the hydropower plants hydropower plants are the most widely used renewable energy sources in the world and represent about 16 of the world s energy matrix and more than 65 of the current global energy production capacity balkhair and rahman 2017 iea 2019 compared to other renewable energy sources hydropower is reliable economical highly efficient with low maintenance cost and large storage capacity yuksel et al 2010 in this context the perspectives on new hydroelectric plants in brazil for the next 20 to 30 years will be to use the hydrological potential of the amazon and the cerrado epe 2018 in this current conjuncture calibrated and validated hydrological models are an important tool that can help to establish a monitoring network including the energy potential of a basin the soil and water assessment tool swat has been used globally arnold et al 1998 abbaspour et al 2004 schuol et al 2008 arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 abbaspour et al 2015 pereira et al 2016 silva et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 the swat is a continuous semi distributed model designed to incorporate input data of numerical and vectorial origin arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2014 which aims to predict the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the impacts of soil use and management on the hydrological cycle sediment transport and water quality in river basins in this context research on the energy potential of hydroelectric dams in brazil has started to gain prominence in recent years with sticler et al 2013 using the ibis model mendes et al 2017 using auto regressive stochastic modeling and queiroz et al 2019 using the mgb in the world much has already been done using swat for this purpose with kusre et al 2010 pandey et al 2015 kumar and sharma 2016 balkhair and rahman 2017 oliveira et al 2017 abera et al 2018 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 however in brazil only two studies conducted by oliveira et al 2017 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 uses the swat model to investigate the hydroelectric potential in a basin in the cerrado and amazon therefore our research comes to support this very important theme which is the monitoring of water resources and energy potential of dams tocantins araguaia watershed taw is a large scale tropical basin in brazil located in the transition between two biomes amazon and cerrado tropical rainforest regions have potential for hydropower generation and stand out in the energy growth strategies of many nations stickler et al 2013 the large amount of precipitation in amazon assists in recharging its rivers and in the hydrological cycle of the region as well as providing hydraulic support to other regions of brazil such as the cerrado brazilian savanna malhi et al 2008 for demarty and bastien 2011 these flows are essential for a high potential in electricity generation through hydropower plants therefore we focus on two lines of research i understand taw flow dynamics through modeling calibrate and validate the swat and ii assess tucuruí hydropower plant production downstream the taw using the simulated flow such steps are necessary to determine the efficiency of the swat model in simulating flow in large tropical basins and if this flow is effective in simulating the energy potential of a hydroelectric plant this will support future work on this theme and will help future hydroelectric plants 2 material and methods 2 1 study area tocantins araguaia watershed taw drains about 918 822 km2 covering part of the midwest north and northeast regions of the country occupying 11 of the brazilian territory fig 1 the tocantins river rises near the federal capital of brazil about 1000 m of altitude in the central region of brazil and flows to the north of the amazon for 2 640 km its main tributary is the araguaia river with 1 670 km of extension mma 2005 we delimited the boundaries of the basin to the municipality of itupiranga downstream where the flow gauge is located used to calibrate and validate the swat thus the study area now has 764 000 km2 which corresponds to about 9 of the national territory thus the study area now has 764 000 km2 which corresponds to about 9 of the national territory the topography of the basin varies from 1 674 upstream to 200 meters downstream according to data from the national institute of meteorology inmet the average temperature varies between 26 1 c to 27 4 c upstream of the basin and downstream the maximum temperature varies from 31 8 c to 33 6 c the climate is tropical continental and the annual cumulative rainfall in the basin is more than 2000 mm mma 2005 falck et al 2015 due to its territorial extension taw is influenced by meteorological systems of various scales fig 2 such as the south atlantic convergence zone sacz frontal systems fs and mesoscale convective systems mcs which aid the water recharge that begins in september and october kodama 1992 reboita et al 2010 falck et al 2015 we observed the spatial distribution of precipitation for the taw and the main atmospheric precipitation systems fig 2 and in the western region of the basin it precipitates more than in the eastern portion based on the land use and cover the west region matches the forest reserves of the amazon the tucuruí hydropower plant thp in terms of power generation is the third largest in brazil 13 second only to the giant itaipu binational 23 in the paraná river and the newly built belo monte plant in the western amazon 16 according to the national electric energy agency national electric energy agency aneel 2018 however in terms of billings thp in taw is the largest in brazil since itaipu revenue is divided with paraguay only in 2019 thp earned a revenue of r 1 5 billion brazilian currency and over its more than 30 years thp has already generated over r 52 billion or us 10 billion for brazilian public coffers 2 2 swat model the swat model was developed with the ability to simulate surface runoff percolation lateral and underground flow evapotranspiration snow and drainage network flow reservoir analysis hydrosedimentological cycle climatic aspects plant growth nutrients and pesticides in agricultural practices and water quality aspects dhar and mazumdar 2009 neitsch et al 2011 lironga and jianyuna 2012 silva et al 2018 swat is a semi distributed mathematical based model that estimates the components of the hydrological cycle through equations based on the physical processes that occur in a basin arnold et al 2012 the hydrological cycle in the swat model and determination of water production in the watershed is based on eq 1 which is the main equation of the model defined by water balance 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y i q s u r f i e a i w s e e p i q g w i where sw t is the final soil water content mm of water sw0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm of water t is the time days r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm of water q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm of water e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm of water w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm of water and q gw is the amount of return flow on day i mm of water 2 3 swat input data 2 3 1 digital elevation model dem we first calculate the flow accumulation flow networks and slope and delineate the watersheds which requires the dem of the study area the dem used fig 3 b has a 30 m 30 m grid resolution in a raster format and was designed in universal transverse mercator coordinate system utm at the wgs84 datum obtained through the website of the united states geological survey usgs it was also used to delimitate the basin and its sub basins fig 3a 2 3 2 soil and land use and cover data the soil data of the basin were obtained from the database of the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa through the brazilian soil classification system for the year 2018 swat requires information on the soil physical and chemical properties texture water content hydraulic conductivity bulk density ph organic carbon content horizontal depth and percentages of sand silt and clay for each soil horizon desta and lemma 2017 the following soils were found for the taw cambissolo inceptisol cam latossolo vermelho amarelo oxisol clva neossolo flúvico entisol cnf plintossolo plinthic subgroup ffc gleissolo entisol gxdb luvissolo alfisol luv and argissolo ultisol pvad clva cnf and ffc are the dominant soils in the taw with 26 4 22 2 and 21 3 of the total area respectively fig 4 a for land use and cover we used data from the mapbiomas project mapbiomas 2020 which is an initiative involving a collaborative network with specialists in the brazilian biomes land uses remote sensing gis and computer science mapbiomas utilizes cloud processing and automated classifiers developed and operated from the google earth engine platform to generate a historical series 30 years of annual maps mapbiomas 2018 in this study we used land use and cover for the year 2017 which had pasture and forest as predominant land uses in the taw 48 and 40 6 respectively followed by agricultural areas 8 8 and wetlands 1 3 fig 4b it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the data presented in figs 2 and 3 for the modeling with swat because the model will perform combinations between surface variables dem soil and land use and cover forming the hydrological response units hrus estimates of each component of the water cycle are made for each hru thus the model can better represent the hydrological processes of the basin better strauch et al 2012 2 3 3 hydrometeorological data the following meteorological data were applied in this study precipitation p wind velocity w solar radiation sr relative humidity rh temperature t and dew point temperature dewp for the variables w sr rh t and dewp we used the database of the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr for the period from 1979 to 2013 available through the national centers for environmental prediction ncep there are ten meteorological stations belonging to the national institute of meteorology inmet in the study area which were used to characterize the local climate with higher efficiency similar variables extracted from cfsr were used but for the period from 1969 to 2017 finally for a better representation of p we used data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc referring to 7 000 stations globally which are interpolated generating a series of global precipitation from 1901 to 2016 schneider et al 2017 flow data were obtained at the station of itupiranga upstream of the tucuruí hydropower plant referring to the historical series of the national water agency ana with 48 years of data from 1969 to 2017 data from 1969 to 1979 were used in the warm up from 1979 to 1995 for running the swat model from 1995 to 2000 for its calibration and finally from 2000 to 2017 for its validation in order to calibrate the model with greater efficiency and accuracy because of the size of the basin we used 9 3 in each river more stations in the upstream downstream direction of the taw fig 2 all with 40 years of data 2 3 4 swat calibration and validation according to previous studies on swat in the world abbaspour et al 2015 and in brazil serrão et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 and with the knowledge of the study region we selected 22 hydrological parameters potentially relevant for sensitivity analysis to perform this analysis we used the software swat cup 5 2 1 1 2019 version applying the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns as the objective function we performed global sensitivity analysis with 4 iterations of 700 runs of the model to extract the most sensitive parameters the sufi 2 algorithm maps all parameters and attempts to simulate the measured data within the 95 confidence interval 95ppu in an iterative process abbaspour et al 2015 this confidence interval is described as the 95ppu range and is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of the output variable such as flow evapotranspiration and sediment abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 andrade et al 2019 after each iteration swat cup shows the modeler user new ranges of each selected parameter usually smaller than the previous iteration to reduce uncertainty and improve model performance these new parameters were used for the next iteration this process was repeated until the fifth iteration when no further improvement in simulated flow performance was achieved according to andrade et al 2019 there are two indices that can quantify the fit between the swat simulation and the observed flow data which are the p and r factors for abbaspour et al 2004 and abbaspour et al 2015 p factor is the percentage of data observed in the model s prediction confidence interval ranging from 0 to 1 with 1 being the perfect fit between simulated and measured data on the other hand the r measures the mean confidence interval of the 95ppu range abbaspour et al 2018 andrade et al 2019 during the swat cup execution in the sensitivity analysis of the parameters the program uses the t test to measure the significance of each parameter the higher the absolute value the more sensitive parameter will be thus we calibrated the main sub basins 3 5 7 17 19 because they had hydrological stations with flow measurements in the total study period and finally we calibrated the mouth river this gives us an excellent fit between simulated and actual flow for brighenti et al 2019 the sensitivity ranking can be defined by two coefficients the t stat index and the p value of the student test according to abbaspour et al 2015 and brighenti et al 2019 the t index indicates the magnitude of the sensitivity of each parameter and the p value shows the parameters that are most sensitive in the iteration flow results were validated using the statistical indicators recommended by the international precipitation working group ipwg and described by liu et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 serrão et al 2016 desta and lemma 2017 abbaspour et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 and de oliveira serrão et al 2020 six statistical indices were used pearson correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r² and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ns nash sutcliffe 1970 and the index of agreement based on willmott 1985 iw in the qualitative analysis of the data we used the quality coefficient u according to theil 1966 and the coefficient of residual mass crm blainski et al 2017 these equations are presented below 2 n s 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 3 i w 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o i o i o i 2 4 u i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 5 c r m i 1 n s i o i i 1 n s i in these equations si is the flow estimated by swat oi is the observed flow o i and is the average value of the flow ns can vary from to 1 and values close to 1 indicate better model performance the performance of the model was considered satisfactory if ns 0 7 iw varies from zero to one with zero indicating no agreement and one indicating perfect agreement in this study iw 0 7 was considered satisfactory the u coefficient theil compares the estimated data with the observed data when u 0 the model overestimates the observed data and when u 0 the model underestimates the observed data therefore when u 0 the result of the estimated data is better than the measured data crm measures the average trend between the simulated and measured values crm 0 indicates a perfect relationship between the data whereas positive values indicate a tendency of overestimation by the model and negative values indicate underestimation of the simulated variable 2 5 electric energy potential from simulated flow this study obtained the energy potential of the tocantins araguaia watershed in the eastern amazon the energy potential was calculated using eq 6 basso and botter 2012 stickler et al 2013 mendes et al 2017 and queiroz et al 2019 6 e q ρ g η p 0 δ t h t η t q t d t where e q mw is the electric energy potential monthly h t m is the difference between the heights of the maximum upstream level and minimum downstream level of the dam monthly q t m3 s 1 is the actual and simulated flow monthly ρ kg m3 is the water density g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity ηt is the turbine efficiency coefficient ηp is the efficiency of the plant and coefficient values in the supplementary material from this it is possible to carry out an analysis of the electric energy potential for the thp the energy potential was generated using the actual flow at the itupiranga station and the potential according to the flow simulated by the swat model in order to verify the efficiency of the simulated energy potential it is important to note that the potentials calculated from the simulated and observed flows are representative of thp however as thp is downstream of the basin the energetic potential of thp is the largest in the basin as can be seen in fig s 3 of the supplementary material fig 5 shows the steps taken in the present study 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and flow calibration during the sensitivity analysis we chose 11 parameters for the calibration process according to arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 and abbaspour et al 2018 the success of the calibration is due to two main factors the first concerns to the physical factors of the model input data soil types climate land use in the case of basins located in tropical forests bruijnzeel 2004 giertz et al 2005 and igwe 2011 pointed that the types of soils in these basins facilitate the water processes of infiltration percolation aquifer recharge and base flow with regard to climatology more specifically the availability of water the tropical zone has the highest levels of precipitation on the globe favoring the water processes mentioned regarding land use the more homogeneous the better for modeling arnold et al 2012 and in the case of taw two major uses stand out forest and agriculture fig 4 the second point is the dependence on the sensitivity analysis and calibration of the model according to gassman et al 2007 and arnold et al 2012 the general hydrological balance is simulated for each hru including the interception of canopy precipitation runoff infiltration and redistribution of water in the soil profile all these processes are represented by the parameters that can be calibrated in the swat so we presented in table 1 the parameters used to calibrate the model the relevant parameters in the sub basins in the upstream downstream direction are parameterized based on the available data literature and modeler s experience this procedure results in the regionalization of the parameters hence we follow the calibration processes recommended by arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 using the parameters described in table 1 for the sensitivity analysis and calibration of the model and then we present table 2 developed by abbaspour et al 2015 for europe and adapted to the reality of the taw at this moment we were able to reduce the total flow volume esco cn2 canmx and the underground flow alpha bf gwqmn gw revap gw delay this procedure was performed during 4 iterations of 700 runs of the model so that the new suggested parameter ranges are modified as described in table 1 and another iteration is then performed the procedure continues until satisfactory results are achieved in terms of p factor and r factor or no further improvements are seen in the objective function abbaspour et al 2015 this methodology was used by silva et al 2018 to calibrate an amazonian sub basin where ns 0 99 was reached when the authors decreased the base flow and the curve number oliveira et al 2019 calibrated the model for the upper rio paranaíba basin in the cerrado and observed that the most sensitive parameters in the region were cn2 gw delay esco related to the underground and the surface flow in india anand et al 2018 was successful in calibrating the swat changing the parameters cn2 sol awc esco gw delay and gw revap in arid and semi arid regions the main problems reported are the short depth of the soil because of the bedrock consequently the main flow components are surface flows silva et al 2018 mengistu et al 2019 in this context silva et al 2018b calibrated the swat for the são francisco sub middle basin in the semi arid region of brazil in the northeast of the country the authors were successful in calibrating ns 0 98 after increasing the values of the parameters related to surface runoff cn2 surlag sol awc also in the northeast of brazil andrade et al 2019 calibrated the swat for a rural basin where cn2 was the main calibration parameter in south africa mengistu et al 2019 calibrated the swat using the same methodology and presented great results in pakistan ghoraba 2015 obtained an excellent swat calibration when he regionalized the parameters responsible for surface flows cn2 sol awc esco several authors have used the regionalization of parameters to calibrate the swat around the world showing the efficiency of the method abbaspour et al 2004 kannan et al 2007 arnoud et al 2012 baker and miller 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 dias et al 2015 pereira et al 2016 desta and lemma 2017 anand et al 2018 dos santos et al 2018 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 3 2 validation of the streamflow simulated for taw fig 6 shows the observed and simulated streamflow for the taw and its validation we noted that swat succeeded in describing the simulated streamflow throughout the observed time series although there is an error range between the minimum values of streamflow in the validation of the flow using the equations described in 2 4 4 we observed that the correlation and determination coefficients showed good performance between the flows both above 0 95 for the nash sutcliffe coefficient and willmott s index of agreement the estimate exhibited excellent performance with ns 0 99 and iw 0 99 theil s u coefficient had a value very close to zero 0 02 and crm 0 02 for the p and r factors values of 0 82 and 0 62 were obtained respectively therefore the performance of the model was considered excellent despite the greater uncertainty r factor some studies reveal high statistical indices associated with basins with high river flows silva et al 2018a used the swat model to estimate flow runoff and sediment flux for a small basin in northeastern amazonia and observed the best results between the estimated and observed flows in the fluviometric station that had the highest flow with ns 0 98 in the exhaust also in brazil silva et al 2018b modeled the flow and sediment flux with the swat for the são francisco river basin the third largest basin in brazil they highlighted that the swat estimates the flow more efficiently in basins with high flow rates in rivers the authors indicated r 0 97 ns 0 93 and iw 0 98 for stations with the highest flow rates likewise dos santos et al 2018 showed excellent results with the swat model for an amazonian sub basin in the iriri river west of our study basin in summary these surveys show that the swat model is able to efficiently simulate basin flow with high water availability exhibiting excellent statistical indices for europe abbaspour et al 2015 used the swat model to simulate the continent s water balance and observed that the best fits r ns were for rivers with greater flow in the semi arid region of pakistan ghoraba 2015 obtained an excellent swat calibration ns 0 90 r2 0 95 using the same calibration method as in our swat cup study likewise mengistu et al 2019 provides techniques for calibration and validation of swat model in data scarce arid and semi arid catchments in south africa the authors highlight excellent results for basins with little measured data and low water availability in the brazilian semi arid region andrade et al 2019 successfully calibrated the swat for a rural basin despite the low density of meteorological and hydrological stations thus we understand that like in various locations in the world swat applies to amazonian rivers we observed that most of the values simulated by swat are within the 95ppu range indicating a good calibration within the model s uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 emphasized the importance of the 95ppu bandwidth when describing the statistical indices p factor and r factor silva et al 2018 and serrão et al 2019 commented on the difficulty of modeling hydrological processes in amazon especially at its maximum and minimum values this is because the seasonality of precipitation and the high dynamics of land use and cover have a direct influence on the baseflows and final discharge of the rivers in this region similar studies on graphical and statistical calibration of swat have been widely reported in the literature from arid and semi arid basins meaurio et al 2015 silva et al 2017 to tropical forest basins desta and lemma et al 2017 silva et al 2018 serrão et al 2019 brighenti et al 2019 de oliveira serrão et al 2020 3 3 energy potential this section presents the power generation capacity for the thp based on the flow simulated by the swat model in order to ascertain whether the simulated energy potential matches the actual potential of the basin fig 7 presents the monthly energy generation potential observed and simulated in addition to the monthly streamflow simulated hydropower potential is directly associated with the flow hence it usually follows its seasonality the seasonality of the amazonian water bodies has been widely discussed coe et al 2009 panday et al 2015 dias et al 2015 falck et al 2015 in this context the potential for energy generation is higher in the summer and autumn periods rainy seasons march and april are the months of greatest potential for energy generation according to the results observed with 11 808 mw and 11 647 mw respectively in addition these months have simulated potential to generate 11 793 mw and 11 447 mw respectively on the other hand the months of lowest energy production are september and october the period of lowest flow in which the hydrological year begins in the region moreover we observed that there is a slight difference between the simulated and observed potentials where the simulated underestimated the observed by 15 mw on average this study does not evaluate the losses during the energy generation process discussed by furtado and fernandes 2015 instead we evaluated the maximum potential of the generation the evaluation of electricity generation is not new and most studies use stochastic models guo et al 2018 hussain et al 2019 dumitru and gligor 2019 however the analysis of dynamic and physical models or the insertion of climate forcers needs to be further studied aiming at a better economic and sustainable development of the regions that have these energy systems fig 8 presents the relationship between the energy potential simulated and observed for the taw as well as its validation the fit between simulated and observed energy was satisfactory based on the statistical parameters of validation subsection 2 4 4 even though some points were outside the curve fig 8 the coefficients of correlation and determination showed excellent performance both above 0 95 similarly the nash sutcliffe coefficient and willmott s index also showed excellent performance with values of ns 0 99 and iw 0 99 for the estimated energy potential according to the swat flow theil s u coefficient was 0 02 and crm was 0 02 thus the simulated energy potential with the flow estimated by the swat model was considered efficient and validated despite slight overestimate of 0 02 in the simulated potential compared to the observed value it is within the error limits established by the energy planning company therefore with the swat flow it is possible to estimate the hydroelectric potential of a tropical basin to plan future projects and to evaluate the revenue produced by power generation stickler et al 2013 investigated the energy potential of the xingu river basin in the southern amazon region and its dependence on the climatic impacts they worked with a regional model of rainfall and water flow and considered the energy potential validated and calibrated with ns and r2 values above 0 75 mendes et al 2017 analyzed the uncertainty of hydropower expansion in the amazon according to modeled scenarios of land use for 100 years they considered the flow and the hydropower potential validated from ns and r2 equal to or higher than 0 85 pandey et al 2015 evaluated the hydropower potential of the mat river micro basin in southern india using swat and obtained ns 0 72 r2 0 72 and iw 0 92 acknowledging swat as a great tool for studies on this subject also in india kusre et al 2010 evaluated the hydropower potential of the kopili river basin and considered that swat achieved good performance in the simulation of the flow and consequently of the hydropower potential of the basin 4 conclusions this study investigated the flow simulated by the swat model for a large scale watershed in brazil the tocantins araguaia river watershed and the hydropower potential in the third largest hydroelectric plant in brazil tucuruí dam with the regionalization of parameters during the calibration process it was possible to obtain excellent results between the estimated flow and the observed flow in addition to understanding how each parameter influences the water balance of the region thus all the statistical performance indicators attest to the excellent modeling the hydropower potential in the thp was generated based on a calibrated and validated streamflow that was simulated by swat since the simulated flow was excellent relative to the observed flow we obtained excellent results in the comparison between energy production evidencing the importance of the calibration of the model that could assist future energy enterprises this study can serve as a guideline for public managers to create policies management of hydrological basins located in tropical regions and aid in plan and decision making to create public policies that better meet the demand for the sustainable exploitation of amazonian natural resources in the current conjuncture of changes in land use and climate our next studies intend to bring the perspective of climate change on hydrological cycle in taw and energy production in thp as well as the merging of the land use change effects with the different climate change scenarios of the ipcc then what impacts will climate and land use changes bring to taw and thp credit authorship contribution statement edivaldo afonso de

1024,a method of the simultaneous reduction of external and internal load of phosphorus as a new solution for lake restoration is presented a flow through stratified lake with diverse morphometry was selected for the study in all three parts of the lake an oxygen deficit was noted at the lake bottom at peak summer stagnation with a simultaneous increase in mineral forms of phosphorus the concentration of orthophosphates at sites i ii and iii reached 0 301 0 318 and 0 395 mg p l 1 respectively additionally a large load of nutrients originating from the main inflow annual load of 14395 9 kg p y 1 and 16 4829 8 kg n y 1 indicates that the conditions present in the lake are conducive to more intensive eutrophication in this situation reduction of the main loads of nutrients can be achieved by the simultaneous employment of pipelines delivering oxygenated water to the lake bottom during summer stagnation and a pipeline withdrawing deoxygenated and nutrient rich water from the bottom in the vicinity of the outflow from the lake it has been calculated that during the period of summer stagnation vi ix the operation of delivering pipelines can reduce the phosphorus load from the main inflow by 5800 5 kg 40 3 using the pipeline withdrawing site iii the amount of phosphorus removed from the lake would increase by 30 4 from 2259 6 kg to 3247 8 kg an additional solution can be dosing the precipitating substances into the pipes delivering water to the lake which will enable precise inactivation of phosphorus keywords flow through lake nutrients lake protection lake restoration 1 introduction universal access to the latest knowledge together with advanced technologies create at least in theory opportunities to implement efficient methods for water quality improvement in practice however restoration of waterbodies is always an arduous challenge and is not always successful hamilton and dada 2016 mackay et al 2014 moss et al 2002 implemented restoration projects frequently fail due to the absence of long term monitoring programs and complex conservation measures in the catchment of a given waterbody consequently the local community and authorities are discouraged from continuing the efforts despite ongoing consultations with scientists and continuing conservation and rehabilitation programs developed by teams of experts on the basis of complex monitoring investigations in lake restoration measures may fail completely dunalska et al 2018 the reasons for this range from local contradictory financial and political interests to the lack of education and communication between managers and water users as a consequence the applied technical solutions are chosen haphazardly and implemented by companies that focus on making profit many restoration methods have been developed and implemented cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 jeppesen et al 2009 klapper 2003 søndergaard et al 2007 including the technical engineering methods and the ecological engineering solutions often referred to as methods supporting the proper restoration of waterbodies the most popular technical engineering methods include hypolimnetic withdrawal bottom sediment removal sediment capping phosphorus inactivation in water and bottom sediments artificial aeration with and without destratification and hydraulic regulations such as flushing or altering the water level ecological engineering methods involve the control of primary production i e application of biocides macrophyte harvesting macrophyte re establishment and the use of floating wetlands and artificial substrates another group comprises methods where ichthyofauna communities are manipulated that is the abundance of planktivorous and benthivorous fish is altered abell 2018 the choice of method to apply in a specific lake depends on its morphometric traits the characteristics of its catchment basin the physicochemical properties of the water and sediments and on biological parameters hence monitoring is vital to all restoration measures currently mathematical modelling is also a useful tool in the assessment of short and long term effects of proposed measures abell and hamilton 2015 bayer et al 2013 trolle et al 2014 such models should support decision making processes indicating potential directions of action and simultaneously providing an evaluation of benefits an additional recommended instrument for monitoring implemented solutions apart from classical analytical approaches involves the use of high frequency monitoring techniques marcé et al 2016 an opportunity to conduct automated measurements and to trace environmental changes in real time allows rapid detection of potential threats to positive and permanent outcomes of the applied methods modern restoration should be an integrated strategy where the aim is not only to select restoration methods to be applied in waterbodies but also to ensure that there is a set of legal regulations and obligations involving both the national government and local governments which guarantees effective control of sources of pollution the gravest problem continues to be the influx of nutrients into waterbodies from external jeppesen et al 2007 hamilton and dada 2016 and internal sources søndergaard et al 2003 welch and cooke 2005 theoretically bottom sediments in lakes have an endless stock of phosphorus and nitrogen and the so called internal supply can sustain primary production for many years it is particularly difficult to protect flow through lakes where surface inflows import large loads of nutrients from the entire catchment dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 lakes initially accumulate nutrients but with time when anoxic conditions form near the lake bottom while the bottom sediments lose sorptive capacity the process of degradation intensifies it is of key importance in the protection of natural water resources to be able to identify the boundary between moderate eutrophy and cascade like eutrophication and to implement adequate protective and remedial measures early enough in view of the above the objective of this study was to develop a universal effective and simple method restoration for lake river systems with using their natural hydrological and morphometric factors a flow through lake with diverse morphometry was chosen as a model waterbody in the past the lake had been subjected to three restoration methods which all failed to improve the quality of water the concept underlying the new method was based on detailed studies of the physicochemical parameters of the lake water and the water balance of nutrients in the inflows and the outflow of the lake on the basis of these data the detail thermal oxygen profiles the trophic status of the lake and of the nitrogen and phosphorus loading from external sources were estimated the results allowed the main reason of the continuing degradation of the lake water to be assessed despite previous restoration efforts which had been applied to improve water quality the additional discussion of research results in the context of various methods of restoration widely described in literature have allowed an innovative method of improving water quality in lake to be developed which involves large external nutrient loadings and internal supply on the initial phase to be reduced 2 material and methods 2 1 study site ełckie lake is located in ełckie lake district kondracki 2002 within the administrative boundaries of the town of ełk the surface area of the lake is 382 4 ha the maximum depth reaches 55 8 m and the medium depth is 15 m basic morphometric data are given in table 1 ełckie lake divides into three parts northern surface area 80 4 ha maximum depth 24 0 m and capacity 7 779 thousand m3 site i central surface area 185 5 ha maximum depth 55 8 m and capacity 44 885 thousand m3 site ii and southern part surface area 116 5 ha maximum depth 11 7 m and capacity 4 756 thousand m3 site iii lossow and gawrońska 1992 the lake is fed by the ełk river which flows into the lake s central part and leaves the lake at its southern end the woszczelski stream plays a significant role in the ełckie lake water balance which enters the lake in its northern part water from the stream is used by a fish farm situated in the immediate vicinity of the lake bańkowska 2007 the surface area of the lake s total catchment is 979 8 km2 while the direct catchment measures 315 1 ha the percentage contribution of land use is as follows 37 3 of urbanized land 32 4 of farmland 16 6 of forests 9 7 of other cropped land and garden allotments 3 3 of abandoned farmland with a large share of natural plant communities raport viep 2012 2 2 the lake s restoration timeline the first attempt to restore ełckie lake was made in 1998 when the following methods were employed bio hydro structures with periphyton algae on the surface acting as a biological filter aeration without destratification and phosphorus inactivation unfortunately a complex analysis of the ecological consequences of those remedial measures in ełckie lake carried out in 2009 failed to demonstrate any improvement in the lake water quality on the contrary progressing eutrophication of the lake was revealed ejsmont karabin et al 2009 the bio hydro structures caused a distinct reduction in the content of nutrients only in the spring with phosphorus being reduced up to 66 but throughout the rest of the plant growing season that is in the summer and autumn the amount of nutrients in the lake water behind the barrier was observed to be rising a possible reason could be the release of an additional pool of nitrogen and phosphorus due to the processes of excretion death and decomposition the bio hydro structures did not even show a periodic biofiltration effect with respect to the total content of water dissolved compounds measured by electric conductivity bańkowska 2007 as for the aeration and inactivation technologies it was shown that although the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion were improved the release of phosphates from the bottom sediments was not diminished the water transparency was not improved to more than 2 m and the biomass of algae in the near surface water layer was not reduced bańkowska 2008 in 2009 the following adverse developments were observed a dramatic decrease in water transparency down to 0 85 in the northern basin and to 0 9 in the southern basin oxygen deficit in the entire hypolimnion an increase in the content of suspended solids an increase in the maximum concentrations of total phosphorus and mineral phosphorus in the hypolimnion an increase in the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in bottom water consistently equal or higher chlorophyll a concentrations than noted in the first years following the restoration treatments an increase in the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton including a greater share of cyanobacteria absence of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage a strong increase in the share of the tecta form in the keratella cochlearis population a strong decrease in the share of indicator rotifera species the disappearance of the cold stenothermic filinia terminalis in the hypolimnion waters an increase in the share of cyclopoida in the biomass of crustacea and finally an increase in the ratio of cyclopoida biomass to cladocera biomass ejsmont karabin et al 2009 a possible cause of the lack of long term positive effects following the implemented technical solutions could be certain construction flaws difficulties submerging the bio hydro structures and the aerator for oxygenation of lake waters erroneous methodological assumptions leaving the structures without cleaning and the lack of control over the work of aeration devices however the root of the problem was that the restoration treatments were conducted only within the lake basin but the external sources of pollution were not cut off 2 2 water sample collection physicochemical properties of ełckie lake were determined in an annual cycle taking into account all plant growing seasons april june august and october 2016 samples were taken from the surface and bottom layers in three the deepest sites of the lake northern st i central st ii and southern st iii fig 1 roman numerals in addition the hydrochemical

circulation was occurring at all research stations the water temperature changed within a range of 4 9 8 0 c at site i and 6 1 8 6 c at site iii much lower and less variable temperatures 4 0 5 9 c were determined at site ii which was directly related to the morphometric structure and a large maximum depth 55 8 m in this part of the lake in the spring the oxygen content in the vertical profile at site i was from 10 6 mg o2 l 1 at a depth of 20 m to 13 2 mg o2 l 1 at the water surface at site ii from 9 7 mg o2 l 1 55 m deep to 11 5 mg o2 l 1 surface and at site iii from 9 6 mg o2 l 1 10 m deep to 12 4 mg o2 l 1 surface fig 2 despite water circulation at the shallower parts of the lake i e sites i and iii a decrease in the oxygen content above the lake bottom was noted down to 2 2 and 3 mg o2 l 1 respectively which confirmed that oxygen was being intensively depleted in the water layers near the bottom in june a characteristic vertical stratification pattern was observed the thickness of the epilimnion at all sites was 3 m with the water temperature in the lake s central part being somewhat lower 19 9 20 0 c than in the northern and southern parts 20 4 20 5 c and 20 2 20 4 c respectively the highest temperature gradient i e 5 3 c m 1 was observed between the 3rd and 4th meter of depth at site i at the same depth the temperature gradient at sites ii and iii was identical and equalled 3 7 c m 1 the hypolimnion in the deepest part site ii was relatively cold 4 6 7 5 c at sites i and iii the temperature of the hypolimnion was 6 8 7 5 c and 8 3 8 7 c respectively during peak summer stagnation i e at the end of august the thickness of the hypolimnion at all sites increased by 2 m the temperature of the surface layers was 21 4 c at site i 22 0 c at site ii and 22 2 c at site iii the maximum temperature gradient in the shallower parts of the lake decreased to 3 5 and 2 7 c m 1 the temperature near the lake bottom was at 7 0 c site i 4 8 c site ii and 9 6 c site iii in october 2016 thermal stratification continued to be observed at sites i and ii at the epilimnion temperature equal 12 2 12 5 c in the southern part site iii autumn circulation was identified the difference in the temperature of water between the bottom and surface layers was just 0 5 c fig 2 the thermal pattern had a direct influence on the content of dissolved oxygen as early as in june either complete anoxia or trace amounts of oxygen were noted in the hypolimnion of the northern site i and southern site iii part of the lake at the same time the hypolimnion of the deepest middle part of the lake site ii had an oxygen content equal 5 3 mg o2 l 1 above the bottom to 8 7 mg o2 l 1 in the upper hypolimnion in the surface layers the content of oxygen was 10 9 at site i 10 0 at site ii and 8 9 mg o2 l 1 at site iii during peak summer stagnation anaerobic conditions also occurred in the lake s deepest part site ii in august the oxygen depleted layer stretched 10 m from the bottom only to grow to 20 m in early october at all sites the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen were determined in summer in the surface water layer in june and august the per cent oxygen saturation was respectively 122 5 and 118 3 at site i 111 5 and 132 5 at site ii and 100 1 and 128 2 at site iii 3 2 physico chemical characteristics of lake waters the concentrations of nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus in the surface layer of lake water varied within the range of 0 77 to 1 14 mg n l 1 and from 0 137 to 0 222 mg p l 1 at site i and respectively 0 7 1 01 mg n l 1 and 0 14 0 216 mg p l 1 at site ii as well as 0 87 1 00 mg n l 1 and 0 143 0 226 mg p l 1 at site iii table 2 the dominant form of both nitrogen and phosphorus was the organic fraction norg 7 4 3 and porg 90 2 at site i norg 67 7 and porg 86 2 at site ii and norg 69 2 and porg 84 3 at site iii in the bottom layers of lake water organic phosphorus was only slightly dominant porg 56 4 at site i porg 52 0 at site ii and porg 59 8 at site iii whereas in the case of nitrogen the mineral form of this element was prevalent nmin 72 7 at site i nmin 56 3 at site ii and nmin 66 3 at site iii table 3 the n p ratio in the surface layers of lake water varied within a range of 4 4 to 6 4 at site i from 4 7 to 6 1 at site ii and from 3 9 to 6 5 at site iii throughout the whole research period the n p ratio was higher than 16 so called redfield s weight ratio and therefore nitrogen was the element limiting primary production the concentrations of chlorophyll a in the surface water layer varied from 12 3 to 27 8 mg m 3 at site i 3 5 15 4 mg m 3 at site ii and 5 3 12 6 mg m 3 at site iii the best visibility was observed at site iii 1 45 4 0 m 2 3 m on average while the worst one was at site i 0 5 1 5 m 0 9 m on average at site ii water transparency changed within 1 1 and 3 2 m 1 9 m on average the highest concentrations of organic carbon in the surface lake water were observed in the summer season in june and august the toc content was respectively 9 58 and 8 61 mg l 1 at site i 8 82 and 8 51 mg l 1 at site ii and 8 75 and 8 35 mg l 1 at site iii in the bottom layers of water the toc content changed in a range of 7 52 to 8 73 mg l 1 site i from 6 87 to 7 48 mg l 1 site ii and from 7 67 to 7 82 mg l 1 site iii high values of the trophic state index tsi 50 in all three parts of the lake were characteristic as eutrophic considering only the tsi point scoring scale calculated on the basis of phosphorus concentrations the classification should be lowered to the state of hypertrophy tsitp 82 site i 80 site ii 81 site iii table 2 3 3 nutrients concentration in the inflows the maximum values of total phosphorus 14 73 mg p l 1 and total nitrogen 42 15 mg n l 1 table 4 were identified at site 3 i e at the outlet of a stormwater sewage system into the lake at the same time extremely high counts of escherichia coli bacteria 800 000 c f u 100ml were determined which indicates the importance of untreated wastewater korzeniewska 2016 during the entire research period the average total phosphorus concentration at that site was 5 21 mg p l 1 while the total content of nitrogen averaged 16 47 mg n l 1 elevated concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were also detected at the outlets of the stormwater sewage system located in the ełk river s shoreline zone concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen fluctuated in the range of 0 12 1 23 mg p l 1 and 0 61 8 45 mg n l 1 at site 6 and 0 29 0 69 mg p l 1 and 0 54 7 88 mg n l 1 at site 5 in this case high counts of escherichia coli bacteria were detected 1 600 c f u 100ml and 94 000 c f u 100ml respectively which suggests a fecal source of pollution korzeniewska 2016 taking into account water flows and the its associated nutrient concentrations it was concluded that the most serious threat to the quality of water in ełckie lake is the ełk river site 8 the water flow in the river changes ranges from 2007 to 8153 l s 1 the annual load of nutrients was 14395 9 kg p y 1 and 16 4829 8 kg n y 1 which represents 89 8 and 93 8 respectively of the total load from the lake s inflows the second largest source of nutrients is the inflow from sunowo lake site 13 7 2 of p and 4 6 of n during the period of time under consideration the balance of phosphorus and nitrogen calculated from the surface inflows and outflows was negative the surface outflow from the lake site 9 was from 409 to 3535 l s 1 1617 l s 1 on average with the phosphorus and nitrogen content within a range of 0 04 0 32 mg p l 1 and 0 85 1 43 mg n l 1 table 4 currently ełckie lake continues to play a role in the accumulation of nutrients during the time period analyzed in this study the lake still contained 10283 kg of phosphorus and 121696 kg of nitrogen dunalska 2016 4 discussion at present anaerobic conditions appear in all parts of ełckie lake near the lake bottom during summer stratification when this happens the internal enrichment process is activated and huge quantities of nutrients previously accumulated in bottom sediments are released to stop this process the oxygen conditions must be maintained in water above the lake bottom an increase in the oxygen content in the bottom water causes a beneficial change in the oxidation reduction conditions in this layer and helps to inhibit the process of secondary release of nutrients deposited in bottom sediments cooke et al 2005 søndergaard et al 2003 as a consequence the limited availability of phosphorus to autotrophic organisms in surface water layers diminishes primary production the most popular solutions implemented for lake water aeration are either aeration systems or equipment pressing pure oxygen to the deepest layers of water cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 visser et al 2016 such devices compressors pipeline aerators diffusors deep water aerators or pulverizes are most often powered by electricity and sometimes by wind power costs of using these systems are typically high which is due to the prices of electric power and costs of maintenance an alternative solution is to supply oxygen with the water from surface inflows rather than implementing more popular systems supplying pressed air or pure gas dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 in the central part of ełckie lake the anaerobic conditions are observed near the bottom during august in early october the anaerobic layer is increased up to 20 m delivering the oxygenated the average oxygen concentration 8 mg l 1 water from the ełk river directly to the bottom of the lake via a pipeline can maintain oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion throughout the whole period of summer stagnation and thus eliminate the internal supply the difference in hydrostatic pressures needed to operate a pipeline can be achieved by raising the water level in the watercourse slightly by means of a weir installed at the site where it flows into the lake in poland a solution of this type has been implemented in łajskie lake łopata and wiśniewski 2013 a factor which favored the inactivation and permanent block of phosphorus in bottom sediments of a lake can be the application of various coagulants broadly used in lake restoration abell 2018 cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 another method applied to reduce the amount of biogenic substances in lake water is through the withdrawal of hypolimnetic phosphorus and nitrogen rich waters through a pipeline directly to the outflow from a lake during the summer stagnation the maximum concentration of phosphorus in the bottom water layer of the southern part of ełckie lake site iii is 4 times higher than in the surface water layer therefore withdrawal of this water can reduce the nutrient concentration and the primary production during autumn circulation hypolimnetic withdrawal as a restoration method was implemented for the first time in kortowskie lake in 1956 the method consists of blocking the surface outflow with a weir and placing a pipeline on the lake bottom with the inlet in the lake s deepest part and the outlet at the lake s outflow the difference in the levels of water between the upper edge of the pipe and the surface of the dammed up lake means that the pipeline acts like a hydraulic lever enabling the outflow of the hypolimnetic water during stratification deoxygenated and heavily polluted bottom water rather than surface water leaves the lake numerous studies dealing with lake kortowskie have demonstrated that after a few decades the installed pipeline has not only slowed down the eutrophication process in the lake dunalska et al 2007 but also reduced internal nutrient loading dunalska et al 2018 the low costs associated with this method as well as the systematic reduction of nutrients from the lake ecosystem were the reasons put forward for favouring the implementation of this method in many water bodies elsewhere both in europe and in north america lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 ełckie lake is an example which confirms that application of any random in lake restoration method will not suffice to improve the environmental conditions within waterbodies as a consequence of large influxes of pollutants from external sources nowadays the greatest problem for the lake is caused by the ełk river which delivers about 90 of the total load of nutrients in this situation an innovative solution could consist of the simultaneous reduction of internal and external loads of pollutants this can be achieved by implementing a system of pipelines delivering oxygenated water from the river directly to the bottom of the deepest 55 m middle part of the lake at the same time coagulants should be dosed above the inlet into the pipelines which will enable precipitation of phosphorus meanwhile maintaining oxic conditions in the hypolimnion will block the process of internal enrichment similar effects can be achieved in the zone of water outflow from the lake that is the lake s southern part site iii the water directly above the lake bottom which is rich in nutrients during thermal stratification could be removed from the lake through the pipeline to the outflow thus the main aim of this treatment will be to improve oxidation reduction conditions near the bottom thereby blocking phosphorus found in bottom sediments and precipitating phosphorus contained in river water by using pipelines delivering water to the lake in addition the pipeline transporting water outside the lake will make the ecosystem poorer with regard to nutrients originating from the bottom sediments and from in lake lake primary production capturing some of the load of nutrients via the pipelines carrying water into and out of the lake will decrease the content of these elements in the trophogenic layer which should limit the primary production in the lake and contribute to a gradual improvement of the water quality it has been calculated that during the period of summer stagnation vi ix the operation of delivering pipelines can reduce the phosphorus load from the ełk river by 5800 5 kg 40 3 on the other hand taking into account the phosphorus concentration in the bottom layer of lake water in the zone of using the pipeline withdrawing site iii the amount of phosphorus removed from the lake would increase by 30 4 from 2259 6 kg to 3247 8 kg implementation of such solutions will also result in the dilution of water in the hypolimnion which is not achievable under natural conditions due to the thermal stratification of lake water the system of delivering and withdrawing pipelines can be control by using automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm the use of instrumented platforms can provide real time data to scientists managers and local end users via wireless technology marcé et al 2016 in the proposed technological solution automated control of thermal conditions within vertical profiles will allow the water flow volumes in the pipes to be manipulated so as to optimize the rate of organic matter decomposition and precipitation of nutrients in addition to quantitatively optimizing nutrient removal in the zone of the water withdrawing pipes an automatic measurement of oxygen content at the lake bottom near the outlet of the water delivering pipeline will allow the amount and type of dosed coagulant to be manipulated oxic conditions will mean that inexpensive and environmentally safe ferrous coagulants can be dosed under anoxic conditions it will be necessary to apply for example aluminum coagulants which are not sensitive to changes in oxidation reduction potential if additionally multiparametric probes and measurements of conductivity ambient light turbidity and photosynthetic pigments are included it becomes possible to conduct continuous monitoring of primary production in the lake without having to make time consuming determinations by a team of experts furthermore all data from automated stations can be used by a research unit supporting the process of implementing and operating the pipeline system this information could also be used by the local authorities or any interested parties via online access this can be of great importance for education and promotion of rational use of surface waterbodies the literature proves that ahfm systems have been successfully deployed across the globe and provide researchers with a wealth of information on changes in water quality as a response to anthropogenic and climatic drivers meinson et al 2016 5 conclusions the lake restoration methods proposed so far have focused on protective measures in the catchment or on technologies applied in the lake by using simultaneously pipelines delivering oxygen rich water to the lake bottom in the inflow zone and pipelines withdrawing deoxygenated and nutrient rich water from the bottom layers in the outflow zone a highly effective method can be obtained that would both protect and restore open lakes an additional option to dose substances which will precipitate nutrients in the pipelines delivering water to the lake will create an opportunity to precisely inactivate phosphorus depending on the physicochemical conditions at the lake bottom furthermore the use of the latest high frequency monitoring technologies means that for the first time in history the process of lake restoration can be accurately analyzed controlled and consulted at any location in the world by having an on line access to data this innovative solution can be applied in flow through stratified lakes with diverse morphometry having at least two deeper areas in the lake s basin that is in the inflow zone and in the outflow zone this method can give rise to a new approach to water management from the river to the lake and back to the river below the lake the low cost of implementing this method in comparison with high socio economic benefits can contribute to the improvement of ecosystem services conflict

1024,a method of the simultaneous reduction of external and internal load of phosphorus as a new solution for lake restoration is presented a flow through stratified lake with diverse morphometry was selected for the study in all three parts of the lake an oxygen deficit was noted at the lake bottom at peak summer stagnation with a simultaneous increase in mineral forms of phosphorus the concentration of orthophosphates at sites i ii and iii reached 0 301 0 318 and 0 395 mg p l 1 respectively additionally a large load of nutrients originating from the main inflow annual load of 14395 9 kg p y 1 and 16 4829 8 kg n y 1 indicates that the conditions present in the lake are conducive to more intensive eutrophication in this situation reduction of the main loads of nutrients can be achieved by the simultaneous employment of pipelines delivering oxygenated water to the lake bottom during summer stagnation and a pipeline withdrawing deoxygenated and nutrient rich water from the bottom in the vicinity of the outflow from the lake it has been calculated that during the period of summer stagnation vi ix the operation of delivering pipelines can reduce the phosphorus load from the main inflow by 5800 5 kg 40 3 using the pipeline withdrawing site iii the amount of phosphorus removed from the lake would increase by 30 4 from 2259 6 kg to 3247 8 kg an additional solution can be dosing the precipitating substances into the pipes delivering water to the lake which will enable precise inactivation of phosphorus keywords flow through lake nutrients lake protection lake restoration 1 introduction universal access to the latest knowledge together with advanced technologies create at least in theory opportunities to implement efficient methods for water quality improvement in practice however restoration of waterbodies is always an arduous challenge and is not always successful hamilton and dada 2016 mackay et al 2014 moss et al 2002 implemented restoration projects frequently fail due to the absence of long term monitoring programs and complex conservation measures in the catchment of a given waterbody consequently the local community and authorities are discouraged from continuing the efforts despite ongoing consultations with scientists and continuing conservation and rehabilitation programs developed by teams of experts on the basis of complex monitoring investigations in lake restoration measures may fail completely dunalska et al 2018 the reasons for this range from local contradictory financial and political interests to the lack of education and communication between managers and water users as a consequence the applied technical solutions are chosen haphazardly and implemented by companies that focus on making profit many restoration methods have been developed and implemented cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 jeppesen et al 2009 klapper 2003 søndergaard et al 2007 including the technical engineering methods and the ecological engineering solutions often referred to as methods supporting the proper restoration of waterbodies the most popular technical engineering methods include hypolimnetic withdrawal bottom sediment removal sediment capping phosphorus inactivation in water and bottom sediments artificial aeration with and without destratification and hydraulic regulations such as flushing or altering the water level ecological engineering methods involve the control of primary production i e application of biocides macrophyte harvesting macrophyte re establishment and the use of floating wetlands and artificial substrates another group comprises methods where ichthyofauna communities are manipulated that is the abundance of planktivorous and benthivorous fish is altered abell 2018 the choice of method to apply in a specific lake depends on its morphometric traits the characteristics of its catchment basin the physicochemical properties of the water and sediments and on biological parameters hence monitoring is vital to all restoration measures currently mathematical modelling is also a useful tool in the assessment of short and long term effects of proposed measures abell and hamilton 2015 bayer et al 2013 trolle et al 2014 such models should support decision making processes indicating potential directions of action and simultaneously providing an evaluation of benefits an additional recommended instrument for monitoring implemented solutions apart from classical analytical approaches involves the use of high frequency monitoring techniques marcé et al 2016 an opportunity to conduct automated measurements and to trace environmental changes in real time allows rapid detection of potential threats to positive and permanent outcomes of the applied methods modern restoration should be an integrated strategy where the aim is not only to select restoration methods to be applied in waterbodies but also to ensure that there is a set of legal regulations and obligations involving both the national government and local governments which guarantees effective control of sources of pollution the gravest problem continues to be the influx of nutrients into waterbodies from external jeppesen et al 2007 hamilton and dada 2016 and internal sources søndergaard et al 2003 welch and cooke 2005 theoretically bottom sediments in lakes have an endless stock of phosphorus and nitrogen and the so called internal supply can sustain primary production for many years it is particularly difficult to protect flow through lakes where surface inflows import large loads of nutrients from the entire catchment dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 lakes initially accumulate nutrients but with time when anoxic conditions form near the lake bottom while the bottom sediments lose sorptive capacity the process of degradation intensifies it is of key importance in the protection of natural water resources to be able to identify the boundary between moderate eutrophy and cascade like eutrophication and to implement adequate protective and remedial measures early enough in view of the above the objective of this study was to develop a universal effective and simple method restoration for lake river systems with using their natural hydrological and morphometric factors a flow through lake with diverse morphometry was chosen as a model waterbody in the past the lake had been subjected to three restoration methods which all failed to improve the quality of water the concept underlying the new method was based on detailed studies of the physicochemical parameters of the lake water and the water balance of nutrients in the inflows and the outflow of the lake on the basis of these data the detail thermal oxygen profiles the trophic status of the lake and of the nitrogen and phosphorus loading from external sources were estimated the results allowed the main reason of the continuing degradation of the lake water to be assessed despite previous restoration efforts which had been applied to improve water quality the additional discussion of research results in the context of various methods of restoration widely described in literature have allowed an innovative method of improving water quality in lake to be developed which involves large external nutrient loadings and internal supply on the initial phase to be reduced 2 material and methods 2 1 study site ełckie lake is located in ełckie lake district kondracki 2002 within the administrative boundaries of the town of ełk the surface area of the lake is 382 4 ha the maximum depth reaches 55 8 m and the medium depth is 15 m basic morphometric data are given in table 1 ełckie lake divides into three parts northern surface area 80 4 ha maximum depth 24 0 m and capacity 7 779 thousand m3 site i central surface area 185 5 ha maximum depth 55 8 m and capacity 44 885 thousand m3 site ii and southern part surface area 116 5 ha maximum depth 11 7 m and capacity 4 756 thousand m3 site iii lossow and gawrońska 1992 the lake is fed by the ełk river which flows into the lake s central part and leaves the lake at its southern end the woszczelski stream plays a significant role in the ełckie lake water balance which enters the lake in its northern part water from the stream is used by a fish farm situated in the immediate vicinity of the lake bańkowska 2007 the surface area of the lake s total catchment is 979 8 km2 while the direct catchment measures 315 1 ha the percentage contribution of land use is as follows 37 3 of urbanized land 32 4 of farmland 16 6 of forests 9 7 of other cropped land and garden allotments 3 3 of abandoned farmland with a large share of natural plant communities raport viep 2012 2 2 the lake s restoration timeline the first attempt to restore ełckie lake was made in 1998 when the following methods were employed bio hydro structures with periphyton algae on the surface acting as a biological filter aeration without destratification and phosphorus inactivation unfortunately a complex analysis of the ecological consequences of those remedial measures in ełckie lake carried out in 2009 failed to demonstrate any improvement in the lake water quality on the contrary progressing eutrophication of the lake was revealed ejsmont karabin et al 2009 the bio hydro structures caused a distinct reduction in the content of nutrients only in the spring with phosphorus being reduced up to 66 but throughout the rest of the plant growing season that is in the summer and autumn the amount of nutrients in the lake water behind the barrier was observed to be rising a possible reason could be the release of an additional pool of nitrogen and phosphorus due to the processes of excretion death and decomposition the bio hydro structures did not even show a periodic biofiltration effect with respect to the total content of water dissolved compounds measured by electric conductivity bańkowska 2007 as for the aeration and inactivation technologies it was shown that although the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion were improved the release of phosphates from the bottom sediments was not diminished the water transparency was not improved to more than 2 m and the biomass of algae in the near surface water layer was not reduced bańkowska 2008 in 2009 the following adverse developments were observed a dramatic decrease in water transparency down to 0 85 in the northern basin and to 0 9 in the southern basin oxygen deficit in the entire hypolimnion an increase in the content of suspended solids an increase in the maximum concentrations of total phosphorus and mineral phosphorus in the hypolimnion an increase in the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in bottom water consistently equal or higher chlorophyll a concentrations than noted in the first years following the restoration treatments an increase in the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton including a greater share of cyanobacteria absence of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage a strong increase in the share of the tecta form in the keratella cochlearis population a strong decrease in the share of indicator rotifera species the disappearance of the cold stenothermic filinia terminalis in the hypolimnion waters an increase in the share of cyclopoida in the biomass of crustacea and finally an increase in the ratio of cyclopoida biomass to cladocera biomass ejsmont karabin et al 2009 a possible cause of the lack of long term positive effects following the implemented technical solutions could be certain construction flaws difficulties submerging the bio hydro structures and the aerator for oxygenation of lake waters erroneous methodological assumptions leaving the structures without cleaning and the lack of control over the work of aeration devices however the root of the problem was that the restoration treatments were conducted only within the lake basin but the external sources of pollution were not cut off 2 2 water sample collection physicochemical properties of ełckie lake were determined in an annual cycle taking into account all plant growing seasons april june august and october 2016 samples were taken from the surface and bottom layers in three the deepest sites of the lake northern st i central st ii and southern st iii fig 1 roman numerals in addition the hydrochemical

circulation was occurring at all research stations the water temperature changed within a range of 4 9 8 0 c at site i and 6 1 8 6 c at site iii much lower and less variable temperatures 4 0 5 9 c were determined at site ii which was directly related to the morphometric structure and a large maximum depth 55 8 m in this part of the lake in the spring the oxygen content in the vertical profile at site i was from 10 6 mg o2 l 1 at a depth of 20 m to 13 2 mg o2 l 1 at the water surface at site ii from 9 7 mg o2 l 1 55 m deep to 11 5 mg o2 l 1 surface and at site iii from 9 6 mg o2 l 1 10 m deep to 12 4 mg o2 l 1 surface fig 2 despite water circulation at the shallower parts of the lake i e sites i and iii a decrease in the oxygen content above the lake bottom was noted down to 2 2 and 3 mg o2 l 1 respectively which confirmed that oxygen was being intensively depleted in the water layers near the bottom in june a characteristic vertical stratification pattern was observed the thickness of the epilimnion at all sites was 3 m with the water temperature in the lake s central part being somewhat lower 19 9 20 0 c than in the northern and southern parts 20 4 20 5 c and 20 2 20 4 c respectively the highest temperature gradient i e 5 3 c m 1 was observed between the 3rd and 4th meter of depth at site i at the same depth the temperature gradient at sites ii and iii was identical and equalled 3 7 c m 1 the hypolimnion in the deepest part site ii was relatively cold 4 6 7 5 c at sites i and iii the temperature of the hypolimnion was 6 8 7 5 c and 8 3 8 7 c respectively during peak summer stagnation i e at the end of august the thickness of the hypolimnion at all sites increased by 2 m the temperature of the surface layers was 21 4 c at site i 22 0 c at site ii and 22 2 c at site iii the maximum temperature gradient in the shallower parts of the lake decreased to 3 5 and 2 7 c m 1 the temperature near the lake bottom was at 7 0 c site i 4 8 c site ii and 9 6 c site iii in october 2016 thermal stratification continued to be observed at sites i and ii at the epilimnion temperature equal 12 2 12 5 c in the southern part site iii autumn circulation was identified the difference in the temperature of water between the bottom and surface layers was just 0 5 c fig 2 the thermal pattern had a direct influence on the content of dissolved oxygen as early as in june either complete anoxia or trace amounts of oxygen were noted in the hypolimnion of the northern site i and southern site iii part of the lake at the same time the hypolimnion of the deepest middle part of the lake site ii had an oxygen content equal 5 3 mg o2 l 1 above the bottom to 8 7 mg o2 l 1 in the upper hypolimnion in the surface layers the content of oxygen was 10 9 at site i 10 0 at site ii and 8 9 mg o2 l 1 at site iii during peak summer stagnation anaerobic conditions also occurred in the lake s deepest part site ii in august the oxygen depleted layer stretched 10 m from the bottom only to grow to 20 m in early october at all sites the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen were determined in summer in the surface water layer in june and august the per cent oxygen saturation was respectively 122 5 and 118 3 at site i 111 5 and 132 5 at site ii and 100 1 and 128 2 at site iii 3 2 physico chemical characteristics of lake waters the concentrations of nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus in the surface layer of lake water varied within the range of 0 77 to 1 14 mg n l 1 and from 0 137 to 0 222 mg p l 1 at site i and respectively 0 7 1 01 mg n l 1 and 0 14 0 216 mg p l 1 at site ii as well as 0 87 1 00 mg n l 1 and 0 143 0 226 mg p l 1 at site iii table 2 the dominant form of both nitrogen and phosphorus was the organic fraction norg 7 4 3 and porg 90 2 at site i norg 67 7 and porg 86 2 at site ii and norg 69 2 and porg 84 3 at site iii in the bottom layers of lake water organic phosphorus was only slightly dominant porg 56 4 at site i porg 52 0 at site ii and porg 59 8 at site iii whereas in the case of nitrogen the mineral form of this element was prevalent nmin 72 7 at site i nmin 56 3 at site ii and nmin 66 3 at site iii table 3 the n p ratio in the surface layers of lake water varied within a range of 4 4 to 6 4 at site i from 4 7 to 6 1 at site ii and from 3 9 to 6 5 at site iii throughout the whole research period the n p ratio was higher than 16 so called redfield s weight ratio and therefore nitrogen was the element limiting primary production the concentrations of chlorophyll a in the surface water layer varied from 12 3 to 27 8 mg m 3 at site i 3 5 15 4 mg m 3 at site ii and 5 3 12 6 mg m 3 at site iii the best visibility was observed at site iii 1 45 4 0 m 2 3 m on average while the worst one was at site i 0 5 1 5 m 0 9 m on average at site ii water transparency changed within 1 1 and 3 2 m 1 9 m on average the highest concentrations of organic carbon in the surface lake water were observed in the summer season in june and august the toc content was respectively 9 58 and 8 61 mg l 1 at site i 8 82 and 8 51 mg l 1 at site ii and 8 75 and 8 35 mg l 1 at site iii in the bottom layers of water the toc content changed in a range of 7 52 to 8 73 mg l 1 site i from 6 87 to 7 48 mg l 1 site ii and from 7 67 to 7 82 mg l 1 site iii high values of the trophic state index tsi 50 in all three parts of the lake were characteristic as eutrophic considering only the tsi point scoring scale calculated on the basis of phosphorus concentrations the classification should be lowered to the state of hypertrophy tsitp 82 site i 80 site ii 81 site iii table 2 3 3 nutrients concentration in the inflows the maximum values of total phosphorus 14 73 mg p l 1 and total nitrogen 42 15 mg n l 1 table 4 were identified at site 3 i e at the outlet of a stormwater sewage system into the lake at the same time extremely high counts of escherichia coli bacteria 800 000 c f u 100ml were determined which indicates the importance of untreated wastewater korzeniewska 2016 during the entire research period the average total phosphorus concentration at that site was 5 21 mg p l 1 while the total content of nitrogen averaged 16 47 mg n l 1 elevated concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were also detected at the outlets of the stormwater sewage system located in the ełk river s shoreline zone concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen fluctuated in the range of 0 12 1 23 mg p l 1 and 0 61 8 45 mg n l 1 at site 6 and 0 29 0 69 mg p l 1 and 0 54 7 88 mg n l 1 at site 5 in this case high counts of escherichia coli bacteria were detected 1 600 c f u 100ml and 94 000 c f u 100ml respectively which suggests a fecal source of pollution korzeniewska 2016 taking into account water flows and the its associated nutrient concentrations it was concluded that the most serious threat to the quality of water in ełckie lake is the ełk river site 8 the water flow in the river changes ranges from 2007 to 8153 l s 1 the annual load of nutrients was 14395 9 kg p y 1 and 16 4829 8 kg n y 1 which represents 89 8 and 93 8 respectively of the total load from the lake s inflows the second largest source of nutrients is the inflow from sunowo lake site 13 7 2 of p and 4 6 of n during the period of time under consideration the balance of phosphorus and nitrogen calculated from the surface inflows and outflows was negative the surface outflow from the lake site 9 was from 409 to 3535 l s 1 1617 l s 1 on average with the phosphorus and nitrogen content within a range of 0 04 0 32 mg p l 1 and 0 85 1 43 mg n l 1 table 4 currently ełckie lake continues to play a role in the accumulation of nutrients during the time period analyzed in this study the lake still contained 10283 kg of phosphorus and 121696 kg of nitrogen dunalska 2016 4 discussion at present anaerobic conditions appear in all parts of ełckie lake near the lake bottom during summer stratification when this happens the internal enrichment process is activated and huge quantities of nutrients previously accumulated in bottom sediments are released to stop this process the oxygen conditions must be maintained in water above the lake bottom an increase in the oxygen content in the bottom water causes a beneficial change in the oxidation reduction conditions in this layer and helps to inhibit the process of secondary release of nutrients deposited in bottom sediments cooke et al 2005 søndergaard et al 2003 as a consequence the limited availability of phosphorus to autotrophic organisms in surface water layers diminishes primary production the most popular solutions implemented for lake water aeration are either aeration systems or equipment pressing pure oxygen to the deepest layers of water cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 visser et al 2016 such devices compressors pipeline aerators diffusors deep water aerators or pulverizes are most often powered by electricity and sometimes by wind power costs of using these systems are typically high which is due to the prices of electric power and costs of maintenance an alternative solution is to supply oxygen with the water from surface inflows rather than implementing more popular systems supplying pressed air or pure gas dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 in the central part of ełckie lake the anaerobic conditions are observed near the bottom during august in early october the anaerobic layer is increased up to 20 m delivering the oxygenated the average oxygen concentration 8 mg l 1 water from the ełk river directly to the bottom of the lake via a pipeline can maintain oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion throughout the whole period of summer stagnation and thus eliminate the internal supply the difference in hydrostatic pressures needed to operate a pipeline can be achieved by raising the water level in the watercourse slightly by means of a weir installed at the site where it flows into the lake in poland a solution of this type has been implemented in łajskie lake łopata and wiśniewski 2013 a factor which favored the inactivation and permanent block of phosphorus in bottom sediments of a lake can be the application of various coagulants broadly used in lake restoration abell 2018 cooke et al 2005 hamilton 2018 another method applied to reduce the amount of biogenic substances in lake water is through the withdrawal of hypolimnetic phosphorus and nitrogen rich waters through a pipeline directly to the outflow from a lake during the summer stagnation the maximum concentration of phosphorus in the bottom water layer of the southern part of ełckie lake site iii is 4 times higher than in the surface water layer therefore withdrawal of this water can reduce the nutrient concentration and the primary production during autumn circulation hypolimnetic withdrawal as a restoration method was implemented for the first time in kortowskie lake in 1956 the method consists of blocking the surface outflow with a weir and placing a pipeline on the lake bottom with the inlet in the lake s deepest part and the outlet at the lake s outflow the difference in the levels of water between the upper edge of the pipe and the surface of the dammed up lake means that the pipeline acts like a hydraulic lever enabling the outflow of the hypolimnetic water during stratification deoxygenated and heavily polluted bottom water rather than surface water leaves the lake numerous studies dealing with lake kortowskie have demonstrated that after a few decades the installed pipeline has not only slowed down the eutrophication process in the lake dunalska et al 2007 but also reduced internal nutrient loading dunalska et al 2018 the low costs associated with this method as well as the systematic reduction of nutrients from the lake ecosystem were the reasons put forward for favouring the implementation of this method in many water bodies elsewhere both in europe and in north america lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 ełckie lake is an example which confirms that application of any random in lake restoration method will not suffice to improve the environmental conditions within waterbodies as a consequence of large influxes of pollutants from external sources nowadays the greatest problem for the lake is caused by the ełk river which delivers about 90 of the total load of nutrients in this situation an innovative solution could consist of the simultaneous reduction of internal and external loads of pollutants this can be achieved by implementing a system of pipelines delivering oxygenated water from the river directly to the bottom of the deepest 55 m middle part of the lake at the same time coagulants should be dosed above the inlet into the pipelines which will enable precipitation of phosphorus meanwhile maintaining oxic conditions in the hypolimnion will block the process of internal enrichment similar effects can be achieved in the zone of water outflow from the lake that is the lake s southern part site iii the water directly above the lake bottom which is rich in nutrients during thermal stratification could be removed from the lake through the pipeline to the outflow thus the main aim of this treatment will be to improve oxidation reduction conditions near the bottom thereby blocking phosphorus found in bottom sediments and precipitating phosphorus contained in river water by using pipelines delivering water to the lake in addition the pipeline transporting water outside the lake will make the ecosystem poorer with regard to nutrients originating from the bottom sediments and from in lake lake primary production capturing some of the load of nutrients via the pipelines carrying water into and out of the lake will decrease the content of these elements in the trophogenic layer which should limit the primary production in the lake and contribute to a gradual improvement of the water quality it has been calculated that during the period of summer stagnation vi ix the operation of delivering pipelines can reduce the phosphorus load from the ełk river by 5800 5 kg 40 3 on the other hand taking into account the phosphorus concentration in the bottom layer of lake water in the zone of using the pipeline withdrawing site iii the amount of phosphorus removed from the lake would increase by 30 4 from 2259 6 kg to 3247 8 kg implementation of such solutions will also result in the dilution of water in the hypolimnion which is not achievable under natural conditions due to the thermal stratification of lake water the system of delivering and withdrawing pipelines can be control by using automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm the use of instrumented platforms can provide real time data to scientists managers and local end users via wireless technology marcé et al 2016 in the proposed technological solution automated control of thermal conditions within vertical profiles will allow the water flow volumes in the pipes to be manipulated so as to optimize the rate of organic matter decomposition and precipitation of nutrients in addition to quantitatively optimizing nutrient removal in the zone of the water withdrawing pipes an automatic measurement of oxygen content at the lake bottom near the outlet of the water delivering pipeline will allow the amount and type of dosed coagulant to be manipulated oxic conditions will mean that inexpensive and environmentally safe ferrous coagulants can be dosed under anoxic conditions it will be necessary to apply for example aluminum coagulants which are not sensitive to changes in oxidation reduction potential if additionally multiparametric probes and measurements of conductivity ambient light turbidity and photosynthetic pigments are included it becomes possible to conduct continuous monitoring of primary production in the lake without having to make time consuming determinations by a team of experts furthermore all data from automated stations can be used by a research unit supporting the process of implementing and operating the pipeline system this information could also be used by the local authorities or any interested parties via online access this can be of great importance for education and promotion of rational use of surface waterbodies the literature proves that ahfm systems have been successfully deployed across the globe and provide researchers with a wealth of information on changes in water quality as a response to anthropogenic and climatic drivers meinson et al 2016 5 conclusions the lake restoration methods proposed so far have focused on protective measures in the catchment or on technologies applied in the lake by using simultaneously pipelines delivering oxygen rich water to the lake bottom in the inflow zone and pipelines withdrawing deoxygenated and nutrient rich water from the bottom layers in the outflow zone a highly effective method can be obtained that would both protect and restore open lakes an additional option to dose substances which will precipitate nutrients in the pipelines delivering water to the lake will create an opportunity to precisely inactivate phosphorus depending on the physicochemical conditions at the lake bottom furthermore the use of the latest high frequency monitoring technologies means that for the first time in history the process of lake restoration can be accurately analyzed controlled and consulted at any location in the world by having an on line access to data this innovative solution can be applied in flow through stratified lakes with diverse morphometry having at least two deeper areas in the lake s basin that is in the inflow zone and in the outflow zone this method can give rise to a new approach to water management from the river to the lake and back to the river below the lake the low cost of implementing this method in comparison with high socio economic benefits can contribute to the improvement of ecosystem services conflict
