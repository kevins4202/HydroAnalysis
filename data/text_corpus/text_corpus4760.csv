23800,a variant of the flux form semi lagrangian ffsl advection scheme is presented suitable for use on arbitrary unstructured meshes the time step used with the scheme is not constrained by the courant number resulting in model run times that may be many times faster than courant constrained schemes the scheme also has the property of mass conservation this makes the scheme a potential candidate for offline simulation of tracers in unstructured sediment transport biogeochemical or atmospheric chemistry models we describe the numerics of the scheme and apply it to a number of idealised and real applications to demonstrate its utility in these test cases we compare results from the offline ffsl scheme with those generated by the original hydrodynamic model which uses high order conservative tracer transport we assess the ffsl scheme for accuracy conservation and computational efficiency additionally traditional semi lagrangian advection schemes are included in assessments for comparison results indicate that the ffsl scheme produces closer agreement with tracer distributions generated by the hydrodynamic model than the semi lagrange scheme and mass conservation was vastly superior the ffsl scheme was also an order of magnitude faster than the hydrodynamic model in certain cases the ffsl scheme presented here therefore offers a viable mass conserving computationally efficient option for use in offline transport models on arbitrary unstructured meshes keywords unstructured modelling numerical modelling coastal processes semi lagrangian advection 1 introduction transport models providing the solution to the advection diffusion equation for tracers may be de coupled from their hydrodynamic driver and use offline flow data as forcing rood 1987 if unconditionally stable advection methods are implemented these approaches can be several orders of magnitude faster than coupled transport schemes owing largely to increased time step sizes gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 this efficiency makes them attractive for use in sediment transport biogeochemical or atmospheric chemistry models where significant computational burdens are imposed due to the large number of tracers that must be transported such offline transport models have been used to simulate biogeochemical processes on structured curvilinear grids baird et al 2020 where the execution times of these models compared to fully coupled bgc hydrodynamic models is typically an order of magnitude less the use of a long time step is crucial to ensure greater model throughput and most unconditionally stable transport models use semi lagrangian type approaches to achieve these goals however biogeochemical and sediment transport models also require local mass conservation so that the mass budgets of their state variables balance and any use of long time steps in the transport solver must be administered in a locally conservative sense a key difficulty associated with the construction of such schemes relates to the form of the transport equation that is solved traditional semi lagrangian methods in which the back trajectories associated with a discrete set of grid points in the domain are evaluated are typically formulated using the advective form of the conservation equation which is not guaranteed to conserve mass and hence overall mass conservation is difficult to ensure using these unconditionally stable schemes this problem has received attention in the literature in the past e g dawson et al 2004 and naifar et al 2007 in order to ensure conservation the schemes used to compute the flow and tracer transport must be compatible i e the transport algorithm should reduce to the discrete continuity equation when subjected to a spatially uniform scalar field as well as satisfying the constancy condition naifar et al 2007 where in the absence of sources or sinks an initially uniform tracer field remains uniform thereafter the use of different offline transport schemes to those used to compute the underlying flow in the hydrodynamic model may lead to violations of these compatibility conditions resulting in spurious fluxes lin and rood 1996 naifar et al 2007 report that satisfaction of the constancy condition in the transport solver requires the flow fields to satisfy the continuity equation up to machine accuracy this fact represents the core difficulty in the application of offline transport solvers if a longer time step is used in the transport solver than the hydrodynamic driver the hydrodynamic model flow fields must be averaged or aggregated in some way over that longer step and usually no longer satisfy the continuity equation exactly mathematically in the case of such time averages the most intuitive aggregation over a longer time step the change in surface height over a long time step is not equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of the averaged flow velocities rather it is equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of averaged transports velocities cross sectional area in z vertical coordinate models this area also changes over the long time step at the free surface in σ models the area changes in every layer proportional to the free surface deflection this implies that for a transport scheme to achieve exact consistency and compatibility with the underlying conservation laws it must make use of a careful flux splitting over the short and long time steps consistently aggregating mean volume fluxes as well as mean flow velocities as noted by gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 there are numerous such lagrangian inspired schemes that maintain mass conservation e g incremental re mapping described by dukowicz and baumgardner 2000 and lipscomb and ringler 2005 the cell integrated semi lagrangian scheme cisl in two dimensions nair and machenhauer 2002 non interpolating schemes staniforth and côté 1991 flux form semi lagrangian approaches lin and rood 1996 the cosmic scheme of leonard et al 1996 as well as finite volume approaches to the semi lagrangian scheme leslie and purser 1995 nair et al 2003 additionally bermejo 1990 report improved mass conservation characteristics for semi lagrangian schemes using cubic spline interpolation for divergence free flows by adopting a finite volume type formulation the so called flux form semi lagrangian ffsl schemes of lin and rood 1996 and leonard et al 1996 ensure that mass conservation is achieved locally within each cell and thus by extension over the domain as a whole these results are achieved through careful construction of the scheme applying semi lagrangian techniques to evaluate conservative mass fluxes across cell faces rather than to the cell centred tracer itself local tracer concentrations are then updated by solving the local mass balance via the continuity equation both lin and rood 1996 and leonard et al 1996 have demonstrated that such ffsl techniques allow the use of long time steps relative to the conventional cfl 1 limitations associated with explicit eulerian approaches to be used while maintaining exact conservation and consistency in addition to the initial development of ffsl type methods for regular grids with constant spacing such schemes have recently been extended to coastal modelling applications based on structured curvilinear grids gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 again achieving exact conservation and consistency using long time steps while ffsl techniques have previously been developed for various structured grid models there remains a need to employ analogous methods on the arbitrary mesh configurations used in unstructured models in this paper we adapt the ffsl scheme of gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 to operate on arbitrarily structured voronoi type meshes applicable for example to a class of recently developed unstructured c grid hydrodynamic solvers herzfeld et al 2020 our motivation is to develop a transport scheme that may be used by offline coastal ocean ecological models which allows long time steps relative to the conventional courant restriction to enhance computational efficiency on variable resolution meshes containing small cell sizes while also conserving mass in the following sections we describe the scheme apply it to two idealised test domains and two realistic coastal domains and demonstrate that the ffsl scheme produces accurate and conservative tracer distributions compared to the original hydrodynamic model used to generate the underlying flow fields to illustrate the benefits of the approach we also compare the ffsl results with a traditional semi lagrangian advection scheme e g casulli and cheng 1992 we also compare the computational efficiencies of the various schemes 2 formulation the evolution of a generic tracer ψ can be expressed in terms of the well known advective transport equation 1 ψ t x u ψ z w ψ 0 here u x t u x t v x t is a time varying horizontal velocity field w x t is the associated vertical velocity and x is a horizontal divergence operator to simplify our presentation we have also here assumed no dissipative viscous or mixing contributions and have not included explicit source or sink terms such contributions may be added to 1 without impacting the derivations below note that 1 is simply a statement of mass conservation and reduces to the standard continuity equation when a unit tracer ψ 1 is considered 2 x u z w 0 this equivalence between 1 and 2 in the unitary tracer case is a key compatibility constraint that will be revisited in subsequent sections in the following derivations the term mass conservation is intended to denote the preservation of the integral characteristics of the flow such that t v ψ d v 0 while the methods presented here may be extended to achieve similar conservation characteristics wrt physically mass conserving flows such simulations would require the use of a non boussinesq hydrodynamical formulation which is not pursued here 2 1 review of structured grid approaches various ffsl type schemes have been developed for structured grid models e g lin and rood 1996 leonard et al 1996 and gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 with a standard finite volume discretisation of 1 typically being sought with semi lagrangian techniques applied to evaluate the various flux terms following lin and rood 1996 the two dimensional structured grid ffsl scheme may be summarised as 3 h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f ψ t 1 2 g ψ t g ψ t 1 2 f ψ t 4 f ψ δ t δ x u h ψ i 1 2 u h ψ i 1 2 5 g ψ δ t δ y v h ψ j 1 2 v h ψ j 1 2 6 f ψ u i h i δ t δ x ψ i 1 2 ψ i 1 2 7 g ψ v j h j δ t δ y ψ j 1 2 ψ j 1 2 where h ψ i j t u h i 1 2 v h j 1 2 denote the finite volume type cell mean and mass flux values associated with the structured grid point i j and evaluated at time t u v are the horizontal velocity components and δ x δ y the structured grid spacing increments f ψ and g ψ represent conservative fluxes in the x and y directions respectively and f ψ and g ψ are transverse correction terms to be discussed in further detail subsequently note that 4 and 5 form the basis of a conservative flux form solution to the advection transport equation while 6 and 7 form the basis of the advective form we note that in 3 flux form solution along one axis e g f uses the advective form equation from the transverse direction g as an argument this highlights the concept of the flux form method the function f may be interpreted as the flux form advection using arguments of a weighted sum of the value of ψ along the x axis and the value of ψ projected onto the x axis from the y direction due to velocity v we consider this in more detail below the semi lagrangian aspects of the scheme enter through the definition of the streamline averaged tracer values ψ which given the definition of the axis aligned courant number c u δ t δ x can be evaluated according to leonard et al 1996 eq 71 8 c ψ i 1 2 i p n ψ i p full cells δ c ψ i n 1 δ c fractional component this expression sets ψ to be a value representative of all upstream cells that a streamline originating from a given face i 1 2 passes through in the course of a given time step in other words the effective tracer value that is fluxed through the face in the single step in structured grid models computation of ψ is relatively straightforward given the velocity u acting over a time step of length δ t the length of the streamline is u δ t and the associated courant number is c u δ t δ x if the courant number is greater than one the streamline traverses multiple upstream cells and this implies that all the tracer values associated with every cell the streamline encounters will flux through the given cell face located at the base of the streamline the integer part of the courant number n represents the number of cells that the streamline passes through entirely while the fractional component δ c is the fraction of the last cell the streamline traverses ordinarily this fractional part is evaluated with any sub grid interpolant scheme our description of the structured grid ffsl scheme is completed by returning to an analysis of the transverse correction terms f ψ and g ψ presented above these terms are so named based on their function as corrections to the direction split ffsl form presented in 3 in which axis aligned fluxes are computed independently a careful analysis of this expression shows that the x axis correction f ψ contributes to the y axis flux g ψ and vice versa acting as described in leonard et al 1996 fig 5 to ensure that the streamline averaged values ψ contains a projection of the flow from both the x and y axis directions previous studies e g gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 have shown the inclusion of these direction splitting corrections to be important to maintain both long time step stability and numerical accuracy in practice the transverse correction terms f ψ and g ψ are incorporated within the full ffsl update by means of a predictor corrector approach in which an initial non conservative projection is used to evaluate the conservative direction split fluxes that are ultimately used to advance the solution in time this two step behaviour is illustrated through an expansion of the ffsl update 3 to detail the action of individual terms h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ t g ψ t 9 g 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ t f ψ t 10 h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ g t δ t g 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ f t δ t here ψ g t δ t and ψ f t δ t are the non conservative projections associated with the transverse terms f ψ and g ψ representing respectively estimates for advection of the tracer ψ in the y and x axis directions these estimates are computed using a traditional non flux form semi lagrangian method with ψ g t δ t and ψ f t δ t taken to be the tracer values interpolated to the end the of the y and x axis aligned streamlines computed using 8 a full description of this direction split ffsl technique for coastal models based on structured curvilinear grids is presented in gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 the method may be extended to three dimensional structured grid models by introducing three axis aligned flux terms f ψ g ψ and h ψ as well as three transverse correction terms f ψ g ψ and h ψ 2 2 extension to unstructured models adapting the conventional ffsl approach to arbitrary unstructured meshes requires significant departure from the standard structured methodology and as such we present a full derivation that works incrementally from the underlying conservation laws we have adopted the nomenclature of herzfeld et al 2020 to integrate over the cells of an unstructured c grid type discretisation with l e denoting the length of a cell edge a c the cell area u h e k the normally oriented horizontal mass flux crossing the edge e and n ˆ e 1 indicating the sign of the flux wrt the local cell orientation w k 1 2 represent equivalent mass fluxes in the vertical direction considering the evolution of 1 over a single time step t δ t which we are assuming will be longer than the cfl bound time step the following statement of integral conservation is considered 11 ψ t δ t ψ t t t δ t x u ψ z w ψ d t denoting ω as the area of the domain da a surface area element zb the sea floor and η the sea surface and integrating 11 over both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the domain 12 ω z b η ψ t δ t d z d a ω z b η ψ t d z d a t t δ t ω z b η x u ψ z w ψ d z d a d t a finite volume spatial discretisation can then be obtained by simplifying various

of horizontally unstructured polygonal cells c consisting of an arbitrary number of horizontal edges e as well as the upper and lower cell interfaces k 1 2 defined in terms of a vertical stack of moving fluid layers with thickness h x t in practice h may be constant or variable through part or the whole of the water column depending on the vertical coordinate system used we have sought to construct a 2nd order accurate spatial discretisation evaluating the integral terms in 13 15 via midpoint type quadrature rules substituting 13 15 into 12 leads to the semi discrete evolution equation for our unstructured system 16 h ψ c k t δ t h ψ c k t 1 a c t t δ t e n ˆ e l e u h e k ψ e k a c w ψ c k 1 2 w ψ c k 1 2 d t the quantities h ψ c k t are the finite volume type cell mean tracer values centred within each cell c and layer k and evaluated at time t anticipating that the mass flux terms will emanate from a separate hydrodynamic model while it is the evolution of the tracers ψ that we wish to evaluate using a semi lagrangian approach from 16 we approximate a fully discrete tracer update by introducing the flux splitting h ψ c k t δ t h ψ c k t δ t a c e n ˆ e l e u h e k ψ e k 17 a c w c k 1 2 ψ c k 1 2 w c k 1 2 ψ c k 1 2 18 with ψ 1 δ t t t δ t ψ d t 19 and u h i 1 δ t t t δ t u h i d t w i 1 δ t t t δ t w i d t here the double overbars denote an aggregation of the horizontal and vertical mass flux terms over the time step as will be discussed in subsequent sections these aggregated mass fluxes can be evaluated explicitly based on direct output from the hydrodynamic model the remaining time integral terms ψ can be interpreted as an aggregation of the tracer ψ that crosses a cell edge face due to advection within a single time step consistent with the structured grid methodology described previously in this study these terms are evaluated by integration along the multi dimensional streamlines x s i e back trajectories emanating from each edge face in the mesh such that 20 d x s d t u x t 21 ψ e k 1 δ t t t δ t ψ x s t t d t 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ d x ψ c k 1 2 1 l z 0 z 1 ψ d z where the time integrated tracer values that cross a particular edge face is approximated as a spatial integral along an equivalent streamline segment x 0 x 1 of length l in our unstructured model configuration evaluation of 21 requires various constructions first integrating 20 to find the discrete multi dimensional path of the streamline as it cuts through various unstructured cells and then evaluating the integral of the tracer along this curve using numerical quadrature rules evaluation of vertical fluxes is more straightforward with computations restricted to one dimensional evaluations over structured columns the layout of a generic hexagonal mesh is illustrated in fig 1 where red dots denote cell centres and green triangles edge integration points we require to trace streamline paths from each edge integration point i e the destination point to its streamline end point the source point and to compute the effective streamline integrated tracer value as per 21 to compute the full tracer flux this value is multiplied by the aggregated mass flux associated with the edge or vertical face consistent with the horizontal and vertical flux terms expressed in 17 the new tracer values at the next time step are determined through evaluation of these flux divergences computing the divergence of the edge and face centred tracer fluxes associated with each cell according to a standard finite volume type procedure in this study we approximate the continuous streamline paths as a collection of piecewise linear segments with each segment either spanning across a full polygonal cell or comprising of a streamline s fractional termination within a given cell when it arrives at the source in effect this procedure breaks each full model time step into a sequence of sub time steps such that δ t δ t s i with each sub step s i associated with a given streamline segment see fig 1 for detail to facilitate the computation of streamline segments we employ a linear least squares type reconstruction of velocity components based on cell centred east and north components given the interpolated velocity components u i v i evaluated at the start of a given segment s i the direction of the segment is computed as 22 θ i arctan v i u i π note that we are tracing trajectories in an upstream direction i e in the opposite direction to the velocity vector hence the addition of π in 22 the length of the segment is extrapolated across the width of the cell terminating either at an opposing cell edge or interior to the cell if the end of a streamline path has been reached in the case of segments that span full cells the intersection point between the linear segment and opposing cell edge are computed and the processes repeated for the next upstream cell and so on the streamline tracing procedure terminates when a distance equivalent to the full model time step has been exhausted note that we only trace one streamline back from the edge centre in this approach which whilst sufficient may be improved upon in terms of accuracy by considering multiple trajectories from a given edge throughout the segment building process we make use of various local indexing structures within mpas compas there exist indexing arrays that map each cell centre to neighbouring centres and each centre to its surrounding edges using these maps the trajectory from an edge destination location e g t0 for cell tc in fig 1 may be computed and for the cell associated with that edge e g t0 the intersection of that trajectory with an exit edge may be identified on an edge by edge basis once found the new cell in which the source cell resides is the mapping in that exit edge direction this approach allows us to efficiently walk the mesh from cell to cell checking only the set of local neighbours i e number of edges per cell o 1 rather than looping on the global mesh concurrent with the computation of streamline segment geometry we evaluate the associated streamline integrated tracer values through an approximation of 21 via the application of a two point quadrature rule per segment 23 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ i d x 1 l s i 1 2 d s i ψ x s i ψ x s i 1 where ψ x s i k denotes an interpolation of the tracer ψ to an arbitrary segment endpoint x s i k and d s i is the length of the segment the linear least squares based interpolation operators used in this study to evaluate 23 are described in detail in the subsequent section considering the full three dimensional advective transport dynamics expressed in 17 we integrate along both horizontal streamlines from cell edges as well as vertical streamlines from upper and lower cell faces horizontal streamlines are integrated within a given model layer in a two dimensional sense data is projected vertically onto common horizontal planes while vertical streamlines are computed within a given one dimensional model column data is projected horizontally a critical aspect of our streamline integration procedure is that the interpolation to both quadrature points in 23 be carried out using the same cell centred interpolant consistent with the idea of individual streamline segments spanning across full model cells experimental studies have shown that any attempt to recycle interpolated values from previous segments leads to degradation and instability in the solution 2 3 conservative piecewise linear reconstruction when evaluating both streamline segment geometry and streamline integrated tracer values as per expressions 22 and 23 defined above an evaluation of both the velocity field as well as the tracer variables is required at arbitrary positions within the model s unstructured mesh interpolating data onto locations where streamlines cross cell edges and or faces in this study we have employed a linear least squares based methodology to support interpolation over our unstructured mesh building a set of piecewise linear interpolants within each polygonal cell c such that an arbitrary discrete variable θ is represented as a linear variation about the mean 24 θ x θ c β x x c θ here θ c denotes the finite volume type integral mean value of the variable θ within a given cell c and x c is the cell s centre of mass β 0 1 is scalar parameter associated with each cell in the mesh used to ensure the interpolants remain monotonic i e no new minima or maxima are introduced as will be discussed in detail subsequently noting that θ x θ c when the gradient terms vanish the interpolant 24 is seen to be a conservative reconstruction preserving the integral of the underlying finite volume data θ this behaviour is needed to build a mass conserving transport scheme the interpolation coefficients i e the spatial gradient terms θ in 24 can be evaluated by fitting the piecewise linear interpolant 24 to the values associated with a cell c as well as its nearest neighbours c j c 1 c 2 c n in a least squares sense 25 x 1 x c y 1 y c x 2 x c y 2 y c x n x c y n y c θ x θ y θ 1 θ c θ 2 θ c θ n θ c a θ θ in this study the over determined system 25 is solved using an svd approach determining the interpolation coefficients in matrix form at model initialisation such that 26 θ x θ y v σ 1 u t θ 1 θ c θ 2 θ c θ n θ c where u σ v t a in practice 26 results in a set of interpolation coefficients being stored for each cell in the mesh in the case of tracer variables the cell mean data θ is available as part of the model s prognostic variable set allowing 26 to be evaluated directly when interpolating velocity components and additional pre processing step is required first reconstructing the tangential velocity components on cell edges using the unstructured c grid numerical operators described in e g herzfeld et al 2020 and then rotating onto a common longitude latitude coordinate system and averaging to cell centres in the case of tracer variables the interpolation coefficients are further modified to force the interpolants to be locally monotone in this work we have employed a barth jespersen type barth and jespersen 1989 michalak and ollivier gooch 2008 slope limiting strategy reducing the value of the scalar parameter β included in expression 24 to ensure the interpolation centred about each cell does not under overshoot the data associated with its immediate neighbours considering the piecewise linear nature of the interpolants extrema are guaranteed to occur at the vertices of the polygonal cells a monotone enforcing value for the parameter β can therefore be found by iterating through the vertices v i of each cell and evaluating the following find the largest negative difference δ v i min min θ v i θ c between cell values at vertex v i find the largest positive difference δ v i max max θ v i θ c between cell values at vertex v i compute the unconstrained vertex interpolation θ v i θ c x v i x c θ set the vertex limiter value β v i min 1 δ v i max θ v i θ c if θ v i θ c 0 min 1 δ v i min θ v i θ c if θ v i θ c 0 1 if θ v i θ c 0 assign the limit of vertex values β min β v i for each cell the action of the parameter β is to locally decrease numerical gradients associated with the cell centred interpolation functions to ensure that no new minima or maxima are created in extreme cases where β 0 the interpolants are reduced to piecewise constant representations note that it is only the tracers that we expect to behave monotonically velocities can do have local extrema since the momentum equation includes local sources sinks as well as advective transport therefore in our work the slope limiting is applied only to tracer variables experimental studies suggest that use of unlimited velocity reconstructions enhances the overall accuracy of the ffsl scheme note that the slope limiting approach guarantees monotonicity of tracer values used for the cell face fluxes however this does not guarantee that the divergence of those fluxes will deliver a monotone updated tracer value as a flux corrected transport type scheme zalesak 1979 or the universal limiter of thuburn 1996 will do indeed using a first order approximation to locate the streamline source where only velocity values at cell edge locations are used small isolated monotonicity violations have been seen to occur in test cases these errors are isolated in time and space in the sense that violations typically occur in single cells once during the simulation and revert to monotone behaviour at the subsequent time step they are not cumulative and do not introduce bias in the solution when a second order approach is taken to locating the streamline source in conjunction with slope limiting we find monotonicity is exactly preserved or errors are substantially reduced in our tests the process for second order streamline approximation is find a streamline source for a sub time step using edge velocities u i v i evaluated at the start of a given segment s i interpolate new velocities onto this streamline source location to provide u i v i compute mean velocities using the edge and new velocities 0 5 u i u i 0 5 v i v i re compute the streamline source location from the edge destination using the mean velocities although this approach is more computationally expensive we use the second order approach in the test cases presented below due to its superior monotonic behaviour the use of piecewise linear interpolants suggests our unstructured ffsl scheme should show approximately 2nd order accuracy in space and time roughly equivalent to linear upwind eulerian advection schemes such as the well known formulation of van leer 1979 these expectations are confirmed by various experimental results presented in section 3 in which favourable comparisons to several eulerian and semi lagrangian transport formulations is demonstrated as noted previously excessive activation of the slope limiter may be expected to reduce spatial accuracy to 1st order 2 4 incorporating advective corrections while the unstructured ffsl scheme presented above does not employ direction splitting in the horizontal in contrast with the structured grid ffsl formulations of e g leonard et al 1996 and lin and rood 1996 a direction splitting is still applied to separate horizontal and vertical computations as noted previously streamlines departing from cell edges are evaluated in the horizontal direction only within a given model layer and streamlines departing from cell top and bottom faces are integrated in only in the vertical direction within a given model column to ameliorate the effect of such splitting we employ a variation of the corrected flux approach of leonard et al 1996 to estimate horizontal vertical coupling multi dimensional coupling effects manifest in the evaluation of streamline integrated tracer values e g from 21 27 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ x s t t d x as per leonard et al 1996 an accurate evaluation of this integral should account for the variation of the tracer in both space and time and therefore can be approximated to 2nd order by considering a time centred tracer distribution 28 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ x t 1 2 δ t d x 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ t 1 2 ϕ ψ t d x where ϕ is a correction term that accounts for advection in the split axis direction in the case of our unstructured ffsl scheme a vertical correction should be added to the computation of fluxes in the horizontal while a horizontal correction must be added to the vertical flux evaluation consistent with the structured grid algorithm e g 3 9 these transverse correction terms can be incorporated into the full ffsl update using a predictor corrector approach when computing the horizontal streamline integrated fluxes an estimate for advection in the vertical is added 29 ψ e k 1 l x 0 x 1 1 γ ψ t γ ψ z t δ t d x while a corresponding horizontal correction is added to the evaluation of vertical fluxes 30 ψ c k 1 2 1 l z 0 z 1 1 γ ψ t γ ψ x t δ t d z here ψ z t δ t and ψ x t δ t are projections in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively introducing a strang splitting strang 1968 like correction to our direction split flux evaluations γ 0 1 is a time centred weighting with γ 1 2 leading to a 2nd order accurate update in practice introducing a marginal implicit bias γ 0 55 was found to improve the stability of the scheme and is used in the various configurations presented in subsequent sections consistent with the structured grid algorithm described previously the vertical and horizontal projections ψ z t δ t and ψ x t δ t are computed using a non flux form semi lagrangian approach taking the values of the tracer ψ interpolated to the ends of vertical and horizontal streamlines based on the same unstructured streamline tracing and interpolation approaches developed above a full flux corrected time step of our unstructured ffsl scheme is comprised of the following stages evaluate horizontal fluxes trace to the end of vertical streamlines to compute the projection ψ z t δ t form the corrected tracer variable 1 γ ψ t γ ψ z t δ t for horizontal flux computation integrate along horizontal streamlines to compute cell edge tracer values ψ e k evaluate vertical fluxes trace to the end of horizontal streamlines to compute the projection ψ x t δ t form the corrected tracer variable 1 γ ψ t γ ψ x t δ t for vertical flux computation integrate along vertical streamlines to compute cell top bottom face tracer values ψ c k 1 2 the ffsl time step is completed through evaluation of 17 computing tracer tendencies as the divergence of horizontal and vertical tracer fluxes u h ψ and w ψ 2 5 time splitting for offline transport typically the computational burden associated with the advection of passive tracers is substantial in particular for configurations incorporating biogeochemical and or sediment processes provided these processes do not feed back to hydrodynamics that contribute large numbers of tracer variables the greatest impact in decreasing run times in such configurations is typically achieved by increasing the model time step an outcome that requires overcoming the advective cfl constraint which typically limits conventional eulerian transport solvers to use very small time step sizes in the following we present a time splitting approach in which the time step used to advance transport processes is some large multiple of that of the underlying hydrodynamic model s gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 this splitting effectively de couples the transport and hydrodynamic solution processes and is typically achieved as a two step procedure in which the hydrodynamic model is run first without tracers saving the prognostic flow field to file with the passive tracer dynamics then evaluated in a subsequent transport only pass based on the pre computed hydrodynamical output through the use of semi lagrangian techniques this second pass may employ a much increased time step size this transport only solver is here called an offline transport model while it is straightforward to separate the underlying hydrodynamics and tracer transport in a procedural sense a key complication relates to ensuring the tracer dynamics remain consistent with the underlying hydrodynamical solution when different hydrodynamic and transport time step sizes are used these difficulties can be explained by considering the consistency of the underlying hydrodynamical continuity equation when integrated over varying step lengths the continuity equation is presented here in simplified one dimensional form for illustrative purpose 31 h t x u h 0 consider the integration of 31 from t to t 2 δ

2 t j δ t 1 3 j 0 n 2 h i 1 2 t j δ t due to the nonlinearity of the flux terms it is clear that the naïve long step update 35 is not equivalent to the sum of two short steps 33 demonstrating that a time split update based on a simple averaging of state variables independently leads to inconsistencies and that careful constructions are needed to guarantee compatibility such issues can be resolved through the aggregation and averaging of fluxes rather than state variables such that 36 u h 1 δ t t t δ t u h d t 1 n j 0 n 1 u h t j δ t are the consistently averaged nonlinear fluxes for a long transport time step consisting of n short hydrodynamical sub steps this approach is integral to ensuring the consistency of the scheme since in the case of a constant tracer the continuity equation is recovered substitution of the time averaged fluxes 36 into the ffsl update 17 leads to a time split transport scheme that is exactly compatible with the underlying hydrodynamical solution furthermore the use of these fluxes from the hydrodynamic model directly simplifies the computation of the tracer flux by dealing only with scalar quantities during the streamline integration the operation of this time split algorithm can be summarised as follows run the full hydrodynamic model using a short time step length output the prognostic state u h as well as the edge face fluxes u h and w to file evaluate the time averaged fluxes u h w over the long step length n δ t using 36 compute the time averaged velocities u w similarly run the transport model evaluate the streamline integrated tracer values ψ using the time averaged velocities u w to compute streamline geometry combine with the time averaged fluxes u h w to compute full tracer fluxes and evaluate 17 while ffsl type schemes are not bound by an explicit cfl constraint the maximum admissible time step size is still limited by the so called lipschitz condition which requires that streamlines do not cross in any given time step to account for such a bound we retain a sub stepping algorithm typically used for standard eulerian advection schemes to ensure satisfaction of the cfl constraint within the sub stepping algorithm the model time step is bisected if a stability constraint is violated in the real and idealised test cases presented in sections 3 and 4 invocation of the sub stepping algorithm was found to be a relatively rare occurrence for the unstructured ffsl scheme presented here 3 idealised test cases in order to demonstrate the utility of the scheme we first apply it to two simple idealised cases the first test is a closed basin with 3d rotational flow in which a passive tracer in the form of a gaussian hill is allowed to rotate since the tracer is infinitely differentiable in this case we may compute the convergence rate also the lack of sources of volume and mass in this case allows us to exactly assess mass conservation of the scheme the second test is a simple infinite open channel with alongshore wind stress in which a gaussian hill is advected with the flow we use this test to demonstrate the scheme is consistent and monotonic to avoid confusion we hereafter refer to our scheme as heen ffsl to distinguish it from the structured grid ffsl schemes described previously in these test cases we run on quadrilateral grids so that standard established advection schemes can be used for tracers here we use the 3rd order accurate monotonic ultimate quickest scheme of leonard 1991 or the second order muscl scheme of van leer 1979 by using these schemes we circumvent any ambiguity of scheme accuracy that perhaps may be encountered when using more sophisticated hi order schemes designed for unstructured meshes we consider the solutions using the hd model the benchmark solution velocity and volume fluxes are averaged at a predefined interval usually 1 h and saved offline for use with a transport model using the heen ffsl scheme a passive tracer is then simulated using the heen ffsl scheme in conjunction with these fields at the longer time step and compared to the benchmark solution we also assess mass conservation characteristics where possible and computational efficiency of the benchmark and heen ffsl simulations note that the reported timing for the hd simulation includes the cost of both the hydrodynamic and tracer advection computation and the transport timing includes the cost of import of the 3d transport data in this respect the runtimes quoted represent the wall time required to produce a solution of tracer distribution rather than the time spent in the tracer advection scheme the compatibility of the scheme is tested by assessing the constancy condition we simulate a tracer with unit initial condition and it should remain at unity for the simulation duration for the scheme to be compatible monotonicity is assessed by applying a metric which computes the minimum and maximum tracer values of all cells in the neighbourhood of the streamline source cell such that these neighbourhood cells will contribute to the tracer interpolation applied to fluxes at cell faces the updated tracer solution must then lie within the bounds of these extrema for the scheme to be monotonic note that this monotonicity metric tests updated tracer values against local rather than global extrema the metric reports the maximum deviation of updated values from local extrema for the entire simulation with negative values indicating an undershoot and positive values an overshoot although many flux form advection schemes are designed to deliver monotone tracer values to be used for the cell face fluxes this does not guarantee that the divergence of those fluxes will deliver a monotone updated tracer value here we test that criterion only a flux corrected transport type scheme will guarantee that divergence of fluxes produces a monotone updated tracer the model used to generate the benchmark hd solutions is the compas model described by herzfeld et al 2020 this is an unstructured model operating on arbitrary polygonal cells and employs the trisk numerics in the horizontal although designed for unstructured meshes the compas model also operates on orthogonal curvilinear grids allowing a benchmark run to be performed using structured model configurations based on quadrilateral grids meshes used with compas are required to be a set of polygonal cells which are orthogonal cell edges must be perpendicular to the line joining adjacent cell centres centroidal triangle vertices must be positioned at the centre of mass of each polygonal cell and well centred cell vertices must lie in the interior of their associated dual triangles these polygons are typically constructed from voronoi diagrams of which the dual is a delaunay triangulation additionally meshes must also conform to the geometry of coastal and open boundaries and adhere to user defined rules a weighting function that specify the mesh resolution the generation of grids conforming to these requirements is not trivial requiring the construction of highly optimised centroidal voronoi tessellations cvt s and non obtuse delaunay triangulations compas uses the unstructured meshing library jigsaw engwirda 2017 https github com dengwirda jigsaw to accomplish these tasks resulting in high quality meshes that support the requirements of the trisk numerics note that orthogonal curvilinear grids used in structured models also conform to the above requirements 3 1 closed basin in this test we assess the rate of convergence of the scheme and its conservation properties the test consists of three dimensional flow in a closed basin of size 25 25 km and depth 50 m a gaussian hill of radius 10 km is placed in the centre of the domain and allowed to rotate with the applied circulation this circulation is driven by a sheared wind stress where a stress of 0 1 n m 2 is applied in a clockwise direction at the boundaries of the domain and stress decreases to zero at the centre such wind forcing drives clockwise circulation in the domain throughout the water column a secondary transverse circulation exists with upwelling at the centre and downwelling at the domain boundaries this transverse circulation tends to uniformly distribute the passive tracer over time since the basin has no sources or sinks of mass this test also enables the conservation properties of the scheme to be assessed constant density is employed in this test with temperature set to 25 c and salinity to 35 psu horizontal resolution is 200 m and 12 vertical geopotential layers are used with exponential spacing at the surface and 5 m spacing in the interior of the water column coriolis is constant at 8 9672 1 0 5 s 1 southern hemisphere vertical closure is performed using the mellor yamada 2 0 mellor and yamada 1982 scheme and horizontal diffusion is set to zero the hd model is allowed to run for 20 days where in the first 10 days spin up of the circulation is allowed to be established the gaussian hill is kept fixed for these first 10 days then allowed to rotate with a rotation rate approximately once every 2 1 days when using the ultimate quickest scheme in the hd model the solution is considered the exact solution for the purposes of the convergence analysis we also use this case to investigate conservation properties due to the transverse circulation and associated lateral spreading of the gaussian hill deviation from the initial condition is expected and the initial condition cannot be considered the true solution after numerous rotations the sea level associated surface circulation and gaussian hill at 15 days after just over 2 rotations are shown in fig 2 the experiment was then run with various resolutions in order to assess the rate of convergence these resolutions time steps and viscosity used are shown in table 1 the heen ffsl scheme is then applied as the advection scheme in a transport model which uses offline mean velocity volume flux vertical diffusivity fields and elevation snapshots from the hd model for each resolution vertical mixing used averaged values of vertical diffusivity from the hd model and horizontal diffusivity is set to zero the time step used for r200 was 18 min and 1 h for all other resolutions fig 2 c shows that the courant number approaches zero at the centre of the domain for r200 but exceeds 2 on the edges hence heen ffsl exercises the long time step stability properties near the perimeter of the domain for this resolution for r500 the courant number increases to close to 3 on the edges then decreases for coarser resolutions since the time step is kept constant but resolutions decrease to 0 23 for r5000 subsequent test simulations further stress this stability limit the gaussian hill solutions at 15 days for each resolution are shown in fig 3 low resolutions are more diffuse with peak values at the centres considerably less than the initial condition and higher resolution solutions more closely resemble the initial condition r5000 has a peak value at the centre of 0 59 at 15 days whereas r200 has a peak value of 1 0 these peak values slowly decrease over time as the transverse circulation homogenises tracer concentration in the domain similarly concentrations at the domain boundaries which initially are zero slowly increase over time the l2 and l error norms are computed following yu et al 2020 appendix a 37 l 2 ψ ω ψ ψ t 2 d a 1 2 ω ψ t 2 d a 1 2 38 l ψ m a x ω ψ ψ t m a x ω ψ t the subscript t refers to the analytic solution the error norms reported here are also computed at 15 days and plotted in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that a typical convergence profile exists with pre and post asymptotic ranges bracketing a linear decrease e g surana et al 2016 fig 1 it is this linear section between r2500 and r1000 that we employ to estimate the convergence rate a least squares fit between the r2500 and r1000 cases results in a slope of 2 14 for the l2 norm and 1 84 for the l norm the error norms are plotted against those computed using the quickest and muscl schemes in fig 4 b showing all schemes converge at a second order rate for this test within the linear range heen ffsl shows slightly greater errors than quickest and slightly less than muscl we therefore conclude that heen ffsl exhibits better than second order convergence and possesses an accuracy between those delivered by the quickest and muscl schemes a traditional i e non flux form semi lagrangian advection scheme lagrange was used with quadratic least squares interpolation of departure point values the surface passive tracer solution is more diffuse than the quickest benchmark and heen ffsl solution fig 5 although the peak concentration at 15 days remains at 1 0 furthermore the l2 l error norms are 0 0046 0 0033 and 0 459 0 506 for heen ffsl and lagrange respectively demonstrating the significant loss of accuracy due to damping using lagrange the total mass of the gaussian surface is expressed as a mass anomaly which is the percentage change in mass from the initial condition at 10 days fig 6 both the heen ffsl and quickest schemes result in a conservative solution with 2 1 0 11 and 5 1 0 8 change in total mass content respectively from when the gaussian hill begins rotating to the end of the simulation whereas the conservation characteristics for the traditional semi lagrangian scheme are quite poor having a 4 5 change in total mass this result is expected as the advective form of the conservation equation upon which the traditional semi lagrangian scheme is based does not conserve the integral mass of the flow more alarmingly while the heen ffsl and quickest total mass establishes a steady state the semi lagrange mass shows a clear increase over the course of the simulation a demonstrable characteristic of non conservative formulations the quickest scheme ran on 36 processors with a runtime of 1000 1 whereas heen ffsl used one processor and had a runtime 4 times faster obviously runtime parity to heen ffsl will be achieved if enough processors are used however larger timesteps will similarly decrease heen ffsl runtime the offline transport is clearly more computationally efficient in this case the heen ffsl scheme was exactly monotonic for the r200 test case and satisfied the constancy condition by exactly preserving the unit tracer this is further investigated in the next more stringent test along with an analysis of runtimes 3 2 open channel in this experiment we test the scheme in a simple controllable configuration and assess its performance in terms of consistency and monotonicity the test chosen is that of an alongshore wind stress applied to an open channel having a sloping bottom with open boundaries at its western and eastern ends this test is one favoured to assess open boundary conditions e g chapman 1985 palma and matano 1998 and palma and matano 2001 and has an analytic solution for the 2d linear case using cyclic open boundaries an infinite coast is emulated which provides the analytic solution whereby alongshore gradients are eliminated to result in a cross shore elevation slope and constant alongshore flow this test was also simulated in herzfeld et al 2020 to demonstrate the performance of compas the channel used is 50 km long and 25 km wide with a wind stress of 0 1 n m 2 applied in the x direction westerly wind the bottom depth is 50 m at the southern land boundary and 110 m at the northern boundary vertical resolution is represented by 24 geopotential layers and horizontal resolution is 200 m cyclic open boundaries are applied at the western and eastern ends the southern hemisphere case is considered with coriolis constant at 8 9672 1 0 5 s 1 and density held constant at 1024 76 kg m 3 t 20 c s 35 psu vertical mixing used the mellor yamada 2 0 mellor and yamada 1982 scheme horizontal viscosity is 8 m 2 s 1 the linear 2d analytic solution gives an along shore depth averaged velocity of 0 195 ms 1 the cross shore depth averaged velocity is zero and elevation has a cross shore slope of 2 05 1 0 6 m 1 these results assume a linear depth averaged model and using a 3d non linear model provides a slight deviation from these expectations in particular 3d velocity shear is seen in the vertical with the surface velocity vector rotated to the left of the wind vector to deliver a small cross shore surface velocity component the experiment is run for 15 days when a steady state is achieved the solutions of depth averaged velocity and elevation for these cases are shown in fig 7 for a location mid channel 13 5 14 5 km a passive tracer is also simulated and introduced at the western boundary when the model has reached steady state at 12 days the injection of the passive tracer takes the form of a gaussian hill which is subsequently advected eastwards with the flow retaining its shape this test is similar to the gaussian hill test of skamarock and gassmann 2011 except rather than advecting the hill around the earth we advect along a linear channel there is a slight drift of the gaussian surface toward the northern boundary owing to the non zero surface cross shore velocity the tracer is mixed vertically but not horizontally we consider solutions within the first 25 km of the along shore domain to avoid any boundary contamination issues as the surface approaches the eastern boundary which cannot have cyclic conditions for the passive tracer the heen ffsl scheme is used as the advection scheme in a transport model which uses offline mean velocity volume flux vertical diffusivity fields and elevation snapshots from the hd model to transport a passive tracer vertical mixing used averaged values of vertical diffusivity from the hd model and horizontal diffusivity is set to zero the maximum courant number is 2 23 hence the heen ffsl scheme must again exercise its long time step stability properties an analytic solution is constructed by locating the centre of the gaussian surface in the hd model on 2000 01 12 12 00 and 2000 01 13 12 00 when the surface lies entirely within the domain and linearly interpolating between those endpoints the gaussian hill is then reconstructed spatially along this trajectory in the same manner as the open boundary condition was constructed snapshots of the gaussian hill once it has entered the domain at 2000 01 12 10 00 00 for ultimate quickest heen ffsl advection schemes and the analytic solution are shown in fig 8 runtime statistics including the error norms relative to the analytic solution are summarised in table 2 the error norms reported here are computed as the mean of the norms from 37 and 38 calculated from 2000 01 12 12 00 to 2000 01 13 12 00 these results show that the accuracy of heen ffsl is on par with the ultimate quickest and muscl convection schemes owing to the cyclic boundary conditions all simulations were performed on 1 processor and the hd simulations would obviously perform more efficiently if parallel processed however these statistics provide an indication of relative wall times required to generate a viable solution of interest is that when used inline the heen ffsl scheme is significantly slower than ultimate quickest or muscl due to computational expense of streamline tracing from every cell edge using offline heen ffsl the runtimes decrease by a factor of 33 the heen ffsl is currently un optimised with regard to parallelisation using master slave partitioning is unlikely to be successful since one generally does not know how far the streamline needs to be traced hence in a partitioned domain one does not know how large a ghost zone must intrude into adjacent partitions to accommodate a streamline trajectory to be safe the entire domain should be accessible to a given partition which is not computationally efficient and is counter to the philosophy of master slave partitioning however other approaches to parallelisation are possible which will be explored in future the unit tracer and monotonicity metrics are shown in fig 9 the unit tracer is exactly preserved using heen ffsl at 15 days with no deviation from unity to machine precision fig 9a demonstrating that in this application the scheme is consistent with the continuity equation the monotonicity metric fig 9b shows no over or under shoots to the single precision supported by the output files overall the scheme can be considered consistent and monotone in this case these test cases show that the heen ffsl is a viable candidate for tracer transport using long time steps and produces acceptable solutions which have demonstrated consistency show good conservation and monotonic behaviour and deliver large gains in computational efficiency when used in an offline capacity these test cases are relatively simple in nature so that aspects relating to assessment of conservation and conformity to a benchmark can be controlled one of the configuration choices to assist in this control was the use of regular quadrilateral grids heen ffsl is designed to operate on arbitrary meshes so now we turn our attention to more realistic test cases that use more complex arbitrary meshes 4 realistic test cases the approach to assessment in the following realistic test cases is the same as that used for the idealised tests we produce a hd simulation using high order eulerian transport methods and save mean quantities for use by the offline solver the transport model is then invoked using these offline quantities and we simulate a passive tracer with the same initial conditions and boundary forcing as temperature or salinity in the hd simulation these passive tracers are then compared against their equivalent hd benchmark distribution 4 1 east australian current upwelling a short regional forecast simulation is performed on the east coast of australia capturing the east australian current eac flowing southward along the shelf edge during the period simulated coastal upwelling develops in the south of the domain we assess the temperature response in both the full hydrodynamic and offline transport models the domain chosen is a circular domain centred on 35 5 s 151 e the model mesh uses a so called hex radius mesh spacing distribution in which a gaussian distribution is prescribed having high resolution at the circle centre and decreasing in resolution at the open boundaries the resolution of the mesh is illustrated in fig 10 a and the underlying bathymetry in fig 10 b maximum resolution is 900 m at the domain centre and the minimum is 10 km at the open boundary the model uses bathymetry from the geosciences australia 2002 database with regions outside this extent filled using the dbdb2 naval research laboratory digital bathymetry data base https www7320 nrlssc navy mil dbdb2 www global database the model is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 which supplies initial conditions and currents sea level temperature and salinity on the open boundaries low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with a tidal signal from the global tide model of cartwright and ray 1990 using the implementation of eanes and bettadpur 1996 the open boundary formulation used is that described in herzfeld et al 2020 surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2013 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 no surface heat or salt fluxes are applied in this simulation there are 64 layers in the vertical and the mellor and yamada 1982 closure scheme is used horizontal viscosity is set to 2800 m 2 s 1 and horizontal diffusivity is zero again the ultimate quickest scheme is used for tracer advection in the hd model with the modifications described in herzfeld et al 2020 to render it suitable for use with unstructured meshes the time step in this case is 38 s and the model is run over a 5 day period from 2014 12 03 to capture an upwelling event at the coast the evolution of the upwelling event is shown in fig 11 starting 2014 12 03 until 2014 12 08 the initial condition fig 11 a shows cooler water associated with upwelling centred around jervis bay this water is approximately 1 c cooler than water offshore as the simulation progresses this cold upwelled water moves further south and intensifies to become 2 c cooler than offshore water by 2014 12 08 a cool intrusion enters from offshore toward the end of the simulation and a warm plume is advected south along the shelf edge at this time a large anticyclonic eddy associated with the eac is centred on 36 s 152 e hence the cool coastal water is likely driven by onshore bottom ekman flow the temperature solution obtained using the hydrodynamic model is replicated in fig 12 a with the heen ffsl solution shown in fig 12 b the heen ffsl model used a 1 h timestep zero horizontal diffusivity and the maximum courant number was 4 75 located unsurprisingly at the centre of the domain where resolution is greatest the ultimate quickest scheme runs at 50 1 1 processor whereas the ffsl scheme is 18 times faster at 900 1 solutions are again comparable however the longer time step used in ffsl has the attractive attribute of producing a significantly less diffuse solution the water in the upwelling zone of the southern domain is noticeably cooler with sharper fronts separating it from offshore water as well as the warm shelf edge plumes being more pronounced the reduced numerical diffusion using the heen ffsl scheme can be explained by considering the analysis of warming and hyett 1974 who show that the magnitude of diffusive error terms in the discretisation of transport operators typically scales with the advective courant number c u δ t δ x achieving a minimum for c 1 this behaviour suggests the degree of spurious numerical diffusion associated with a given simulation is a function of the size of the time step used with smaller step sizes leading to increased diffusivity in the case of the full hd model results presented here it is argued that use of a relatively small time step c 1 as dictated by the nonlinear hydrodynamics leads to the generation of additional numerical diffusion compared to heen ffsl despite the ultimate quickest scheme being nominally higher order accurate this behaviour is consistent with practical experience using semi lagrangian type schemes for coastal modelling applications in which less diffuse solution are typically associated with the use of long step sizes note that whilst low numerical diffusion is an attractive attribute for a numerical advection scheme it does not necessarily make the solutions more accurate the addition of explicit horizontal diffusion of 500 m 2 s 1 largely reconciles the differences compared to the benchmark solution fig 12 c demonstrating that such differences are largely a product of the inherent diffusivity of the numerical schemes in this regard we can say that the heen ffsl scheme provides a better solution than the hydrodynamic model s although it does raise the question of what is the correct solution in the next section we compare the various methods to observation to address this note that while the transport scheme can operate with a long time step the open boundary conditions may not e g an upstream advection condition is bound by the courant number in the cases of fig 12 we use a clamped obc using parent model data ofam which results in a stripe of tracer discontinuity along the boundary the implementation of adaptive obcs that are not stability bound requires more attention the constancy condition is tested by simulating a unit tracer with the open boundaries clamped to unit values similar to the open channel test case the solution is exactly unity throughout the simulation fig 13 a to the single precision accommodated by file output this indicates that the heen ffsl scheme is compatible with the continuity equation even when run in complex configurations involving unstructured meshes and time averaged hydrodynamical inputs the monotonicity metric showed two violations at the surface of order 1 1 0 5 these occurred near the centre of the domain where the courant number was largest since these errors are small isolated and the scheme reverts to monotone behaviour at the subsequent time step we consider this an acceptable error 4 2 storm bay flood plume the full compas hydrodynamical model was evaluated against observations in herzfeld et al 2020 in the storm bay region of southern tasmania australia and we use this domain to also examine the performance of the heen ffsl scheme it is fortuitous that in this region during june 2015 observations of a flood event were captured by a slocum glider and are available for model assessment the domain includes storm bay d entrecasteaux channel and the derwent estuary region in south east tasmania australia fig 14 the storm bay area is dominated by local forcing notably freshwater inputs from the huon and derwent rivers in late summer storm bay may be impacted from offshore by the east australian current water flowing down the east coast of tasmania and in winter the region is influenced by the zeehan current flowing down the west coast these current systems are introduced into the model via the open boundaries the model is nested within a larger scale regional model covering the whole of tasmania and bass strait fig 14 which in turn is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with 8 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 obtained from the tpxo global model egbert and erofeeva 2002 and applied at the boundary of the regional model the local model is subsequently nested within the regional model and therefore inherits both low frequency and tidal ssh signals surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2013 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km heat fluxes applied at the surface boundary condition were computed from standard meteorological variables provided by access a wet and dry bulb temperature air pressure wind speed and cloud amount using short and longwave calculations outlined in zillmann 1972 and the bulk method for sensible and latent heat using bulk coefficients of kondo 1975 for the surface freshwater fluxes precipitation was provided by access a and evaporation was computed from the latent heat flux wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 the model was run from 2015 06 01 to 2015 06 20 during which both huon and derwent rivers were in flood delivering fresh water into storm bay the mesh configuration for the hydrodynamic model we use is a distance to coast weighting the coast solution of herzfeld et al 2020 resolution varies from 3 km at the offshore boundary to 300 m within the estuaries maximum cell size distance between centres is 4 1 km and minimum cell size is 47 m the k ϵ turbulence closure model of rodi 1987 is applied the unstructured ultimate quickest scheme was again used for tracer advection in the hd model and the smagorinsky horizontal mixing was implemented with an empirical constant of 0 1 added to a defined base rate of 80 m 2 s 1 with areal scaling on the mesh and horizontal diffusivity is zero freshwater flows down the huon and derwent rivers peak at 1290 and 235 m 3 s 1 respectively on 2015 06 09 the derwent river is regulated higher upstream in its catchment such that controlled volumes are released downstream consequently flow is usually less than the huon flow from the huon typically turns left into d entrecasteaux channel herzfeld et al 2010 eventually exiting the northern channel into storm bay this characteristic is also observed in the hydrodynamic model where a well defined plume is observed after the flood peak on 10 and 11 june and salinity is persistently lower in the northern d entrecasteaux flow from the derwent tends to head south eastward across storm bay this is also observed in the model although peak flows occurred on 9 june the maximum plume extent in storm bay due to flow from the derwent occurred around 16 june this is a consequence of the lag in the plume transiting the estuary but also favourable wind and tide conditions combining to push the freshwater plume further into storm bay at this time a snapshot of the salinity distribution at 2015 06 16 00 00 00 when freshwater intrusion into storm bay was maximum is provided in fig 15 with the hd surface salinity distribution shown in a the equivalent heen ffsl surface salinity distribution in b and c a time series at the glider trajectory origin blue dot included in a is the glider trajectory and a distance scale both the hd salinity and ffsl salinity time series and surface distribution on 16 june are very similar with negligible visual differences notable when comparing the full hd output and the heen ffsl results the rmse is plotted in fig 16 for the period 2015 06 01 to 2015 06 18 showing that differences within storm bay are less than 0 1 with areas impacted by the flood plume near the mouth of the derwent estuary 0 2 the greatest differences are located in the reaches of the derwent and huon estuaries where the rmse is 1 5 this is likely the consequence of phase differences in plume position and associated double penalty errors when the flood plume transits the estuaries we assess the hd and heen ffsl salinity solutions against observations acquired from the glider we do this following the methodology of herzfeld et al 2020 where we bring the glider to the model by averaging the glider observations in space and time onto the model mesh as opposed to bringing the model to the glider by interpolating the model onto the glider trajectory both glider and model data can then be presented as a time series and standard quantitative metrics rmse root mean squared error mae mean absolute error cc correlation coefficient bias and willmott skill score willmott 1981 are used for assessment the hd and heen ffsl comparisons for 2015 06 16 are shown in fig 17 a and b respectively the glider depth in fig 17 c and the number of glider observations averaged onto the model mesh in fig 17 d during 16 june the glider makes 12 ascents to the surface allowing the detail of fresh plume to be examined as the glider moves offshore minimum salinity is 31 1 psu at the surface of the northern portion of the trajectory and maximum is 35 1 psu at depth a comparison of hd and heen ffsl time series again shows very similar behaviour during this period confirmed quantitatively by comparing the skill metrics in fact the ffsl salinity shows slightly improved skill metrics compared to the full hydrodynamical solutions underlying consistency was again assessed for the storm bay configuration with a unit tracer showing no deviation when advected by the complex flow field over the full simulation period not shown the runtime of the hydrodynamic model was 5 1 using 16 processors and a time step of 6 s and heen ffsl ran at 26 1 on 1 processor with a time step of 30 min overall it is found that the heen ffsl solution is highly comparable to the hydrodynamic solution achieved with considerable saving in computational cost and both solutions exhibited a high level of skill when compared to high resolution observational data 5 conclusions we present a new conservative advection scheme based on the flux form semi lagrangian method which is bound by the lipschitz stability condition and therefore operates on long time steps the scheme differs to that presented by previous authors in that it may be used with the arbitrary meshes favoured by unstructured models including triangular quadrilateral or hexagonal meshes rather than structured grids the scheme may be used both within a full hydrodynamic model or in an offline capacity as a transport model that uses time averaged hydrodynamical inputs an attractive attribute of the heen ffsl scheme for the latter application is the ability to de couple the transport time step from that of the underlying hydrodynamics enabling long time steps to be used to resolve computationally expensive tracer dynamics this time splitting requires the hd model to save offline average volume fluxes to compute the mass flux divergence as well average velocities to compute the ffsl backward trajectories we exercise the scheme in the transport model mode with time steps much larger than the underlying hydrodynamic model and observe speed ups of up to several orders of magnitude in some cases while producing acceptable solutions in fact the longer time step leads to fewer evaluations of advective tendencies contributing to an associated reduction in the spurious numerical dissipation generated by the discrete scheme experimental results confirm that the heen ffsl method leads to less diffuse solutions than the full hd equivalent we have tested the scheme in various idealised controllable test cases and found it to accurately conserve mass and produce solutions comparable to the full hd model these characteristics carried through to more complex realistic cases the model also was also found to be compatible with the discrete continuity equation where throughout test simulations unitary tracers remained at that value to the single precision accommodated by file output the monotonicity of the scheme was also acceptable in these test cases showing no or very small and isolated over or under shoots relative to local extrema the universal flux limiter of thuburn 1996 has been successfully implemented in the heen ffsl scheme to enforce the monotonicity of streamline integrated fluxes however we have not used this in the cases presented in this study with direct slope limiting of the reconstructed interpolation functions sufficient it may be that more extreme non monotone behaviour could manifest under certain conditions in areas of large tracer gradients that are subject to high courant numbers for example such effects have not currently been observed though remain the subject of ongoing investigation in its current form the heen ffsl scheme is largely un optimised and is not expected to scale well with increasing tracer number unlike traditional semi lagrangian schemes where the location of the source cell only needs to be computed once irrespective of the number of tracers used in this scheme the streamline needs to be recomputed for each tracer so that the streamline tracer integration can take place to scale well with increasing tracers either a tracer loop must be initiated at each instance a new streamline location is found or the locations of the streamline must be cached for cycling through all tracers the efficiency of these approaches is yet to be explored currently we use linear least squares for interpolation of cell centred velocity and tracers onto faces we have shown that this scheme delivers better than second order convergence when used in a rotating gaussian hill test case and accuracy assessed using error norms was comparable to various higher order accurate eulerian advection schemes the choice of first order interpolation was largely chosen due to the simplicity of including a slope limiter for ensuring monotonicity of the interpolated value for this scheme it is critical that the face interpolated value be monotone in order for the flux divergence to deliver a monotonic updated tracer solution the accuracy may be improved using higher order least squares interpolation this is an area for further work although it is anticipated the inclusion of a slope limiter for such schemes will not be trivial future work may also be removing the horizontal vertical directional splitting however this would involve more difficult computation of entry and exit points of streamlines through volumetric cells in 3d space although we present the heen ffsl here for use in an offline transport model it has also been used within the full hd model to advect tracers directly the attraction here is that it is not bound by the cfl condition and the tracer time step may be de coupled from the baroclinic time step such that the transport algorithm is invoked at some integer multiple of the baroclinic step since the temperature and salinity and therefore density fields are held constant during this interval updating active tracers too infrequently has been observed to lead to instability with the baroclinic dynamics becoming decoupled from all other dynamics operating at the shorter time step in practice we find that the tracer can be safely set at 5 the baroclinic time step invoking the transport algorithm infrequently reduces the effective numerical diffusion of the solution and increases model throughput and is a viable alternative to traditional advection schemes in the hd model the heen ffsl scheme is particularly suitable for offline transport models coupled to sediment transport or biogeochemical modules where the computation burden drastically increases due to the number of tracers to transport 60 similar suitability would be observed in atmospheric chemistry models while this scheme is anticipated to be suitable for these applications we have not yet exercised it using actual biogeochemical or sediment transport distributions however we expect similar performance to its

23800,a variant of the flux form semi lagrangian ffsl advection scheme is presented suitable for use on arbitrary unstructured meshes the time step used with the scheme is not constrained by the courant number resulting in model run times that may be many times faster than courant constrained schemes the scheme also has the property of mass conservation this makes the scheme a potential candidate for offline simulation of tracers in unstructured sediment transport biogeochemical or atmospheric chemistry models we describe the numerics of the scheme and apply it to a number of idealised and real applications to demonstrate its utility in these test cases we compare results from the offline ffsl scheme with those generated by the original hydrodynamic model which uses high order conservative tracer transport we assess the ffsl scheme for accuracy conservation and computational efficiency additionally traditional semi lagrangian advection schemes are included in assessments for comparison results indicate that the ffsl scheme produces closer agreement with tracer distributions generated by the hydrodynamic model than the semi lagrange scheme and mass conservation was vastly superior the ffsl scheme was also an order of magnitude faster than the hydrodynamic model in certain cases the ffsl scheme presented here therefore offers a viable mass conserving computationally efficient option for use in offline transport models on arbitrary unstructured meshes keywords unstructured modelling numerical modelling coastal processes semi lagrangian advection 1 introduction transport models providing the solution to the advection diffusion equation for tracers may be de coupled from their hydrodynamic driver and use offline flow data as forcing rood 1987 if unconditionally stable advection methods are implemented these approaches can be several orders of magnitude faster than coupled transport schemes owing largely to increased time step sizes gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 this efficiency makes them attractive for use in sediment transport biogeochemical or atmospheric chemistry models where significant computational burdens are imposed due to the large number of tracers that must be transported such offline transport models have been used to simulate biogeochemical processes on structured curvilinear grids baird et al 2020 where the execution times of these models compared to fully coupled bgc hydrodynamic models is typically an order of magnitude less the use of a long time step is crucial to ensure greater model throughput and most unconditionally stable transport models use semi lagrangian type approaches to achieve these goals however biogeochemical and sediment transport models also require local mass conservation so that the mass budgets of their state variables balance and any use of long time steps in the transport solver must be administered in a locally conservative sense a key difficulty associated with the construction of such schemes relates to the form of the transport equation that is solved traditional semi lagrangian methods in which the back trajectories associated with a discrete set of grid points in the domain are evaluated are typically formulated using the advective form of the conservation equation which is not guaranteed to conserve mass and hence overall mass conservation is difficult to ensure using these unconditionally stable schemes this problem has received attention in the literature in the past e g dawson et al 2004 and naifar et al 2007 in order to ensure conservation the schemes used to compute the flow and tracer transport must be compatible i e the transport algorithm should reduce to the discrete continuity equation when subjected to a spatially uniform scalar field as well as satisfying the constancy condition naifar et al 2007 where in the absence of sources or sinks an initially uniform tracer field remains uniform thereafter the use of different offline transport schemes to those used to compute the underlying flow in the hydrodynamic model may lead to violations of these compatibility conditions resulting in spurious fluxes lin and rood 1996 naifar et al 2007 report that satisfaction of the constancy condition in the transport solver requires the flow fields to satisfy the continuity equation up to machine accuracy this fact represents the core difficulty in the application of offline transport solvers if a longer time step is used in the transport solver than the hydrodynamic driver the hydrodynamic model flow fields must be averaged or aggregated in some way over that longer step and usually no longer satisfy the continuity equation exactly mathematically in the case of such time averages the most intuitive aggregation over a longer time step the change in surface height over a long time step is not equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of the averaged flow velocities rather it is equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of averaged transports velocities cross sectional area in z vertical coordinate models this area also changes over the long time step at the free surface in σ models the area changes in every layer proportional to the free surface deflection this implies that for a transport scheme to achieve exact consistency and compatibility with the underlying conservation laws it must make use of a careful flux splitting over the short and long time steps consistently aggregating mean volume fluxes as well as mean flow velocities as noted by gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 there are numerous such lagrangian inspired schemes that maintain mass conservation e g incremental re mapping described by dukowicz and baumgardner 2000 and lipscomb and ringler 2005 the cell integrated semi lagrangian scheme cisl in two dimensions nair and machenhauer 2002 non interpolating schemes staniforth and côté 1991 flux form semi lagrangian approaches lin and rood 1996 the cosmic scheme of leonard et al 1996 as well as finite volume approaches to the semi lagrangian scheme leslie and purser 1995 nair et al 2003 additionally bermejo 1990 report improved mass conservation characteristics for semi lagrangian schemes using cubic spline interpolation for divergence free flows by adopting a finite volume type formulation the so called flux form semi lagrangian ffsl schemes of lin and rood 1996 and leonard et al 1996 ensure that mass conservation is achieved locally within each cell and thus by extension over the domain as a whole these results are achieved through careful construction of the scheme applying semi lagrangian techniques to evaluate conservative mass fluxes across cell faces rather than to the cell centred tracer itself local tracer concentrations are then updated by solving the local mass balance via the continuity equation both lin and rood 1996 and leonard et al 1996 have demonstrated that such ffsl techniques allow the use of long time steps relative to the conventional cfl 1 limitations associated with explicit eulerian approaches to be used while maintaining exact conservation and consistency in addition to the initial development of ffsl type methods for regular grids with constant spacing such schemes have recently been extended to coastal modelling applications based on structured curvilinear grids gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 again achieving exact conservation and consistency using long time steps while ffsl techniques have previously been developed for various structured grid models there remains a need to employ analogous methods on the arbitrary mesh configurations used in unstructured models in this paper we adapt the ffsl scheme of gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 to operate on arbitrarily structured voronoi type meshes applicable for example to a class of recently developed unstructured c grid hydrodynamic solvers herzfeld et al 2020 our motivation is to develop a transport scheme that may be used by offline coastal ocean ecological models which allows long time steps relative to the conventional courant restriction to enhance computational efficiency on variable resolution meshes containing small cell sizes while also conserving mass in the following sections we describe the scheme apply it to two idealised test domains and two realistic coastal domains and demonstrate that the ffsl scheme produces accurate and conservative tracer distributions compared to the original hydrodynamic model used to generate the underlying flow fields to illustrate the benefits of the approach we also compare the ffsl results with a traditional semi lagrangian advection scheme e g casulli and cheng 1992 we also compare the computational efficiencies of the various schemes 2 formulation the evolution of a generic tracer ψ can be expressed in terms of the well known advective transport equation 1 ψ t x u ψ z w ψ 0 here u x t u x t v x t is a time varying horizontal velocity field w x t is the associated vertical velocity and x is a horizontal divergence operator to simplify our presentation we have also here assumed no dissipative viscous or mixing contributions and have not included explicit source or sink terms such contributions may be added to 1 without impacting the derivations below note that 1 is simply a statement of mass conservation and reduces to the standard continuity equation when a unit tracer ψ 1 is considered 2 x u z w 0 this equivalence between 1 and 2 in the unitary tracer case is a key compatibility constraint that will be revisited in subsequent sections in the following derivations the term mass conservation is intended to denote the preservation of the integral characteristics of the flow such that t v ψ d v 0 while the methods presented here may be extended to achieve similar conservation characteristics wrt physically mass conserving flows such simulations would require the use of a non boussinesq hydrodynamical formulation which is not pursued here 2 1 review of structured grid approaches various ffsl type schemes have been developed for structured grid models e g lin and rood 1996 leonard et al 1996 and gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 with a standard finite volume discretisation of 1 typically being sought with semi lagrangian techniques applied to evaluate the various flux terms following lin and rood 1996 the two dimensional structured grid ffsl scheme may be summarised as 3 h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f ψ t 1 2 g ψ t g ψ t 1 2 f ψ t 4 f ψ δ t δ x u h ψ i 1 2 u h ψ i 1 2 5 g ψ δ t δ y v h ψ j 1 2 v h ψ j 1 2 6 f ψ u i h i δ t δ x ψ i 1 2 ψ i 1 2 7 g ψ v j h j δ t δ y ψ j 1 2 ψ j 1 2 where h ψ i j t u h i 1 2 v h j 1 2 denote the finite volume type cell mean and mass flux values associated with the structured grid point i j and evaluated at time t u v are the horizontal velocity components and δ x δ y the structured grid spacing increments f ψ and g ψ represent conservative fluxes in the x and y directions respectively and f ψ and g ψ are transverse correction terms to be discussed in further detail subsequently note that 4 and 5 form the basis of a conservative flux form solution to the advection transport equation while 6 and 7 form the basis of the advective form we note that in 3 flux form solution along one axis e g f uses the advective form equation from the transverse direction g as an argument this highlights the concept of the flux form method the function f may be interpreted as the flux form advection using arguments of a weighted sum of the value of ψ along the x axis and the value of ψ projected onto the x axis from the y direction due to velocity v we consider this in more detail below the semi lagrangian aspects of the scheme enter through the definition of the streamline averaged tracer values ψ which given the definition of the axis aligned courant number c u δ t δ x can be evaluated according to leonard et al 1996 eq 71 8 c ψ i 1 2 i p n ψ i p full cells δ c ψ i n 1 δ c fractional component this expression sets ψ to be a value representative of all upstream cells that a streamline originating from a given face i 1 2 passes through in the course of a given time step in other words the effective tracer value that is fluxed through the face in the single step in structured grid models computation of ψ is relatively straightforward given the velocity u acting over a time step of length δ t the length of the streamline is u δ t and the associated courant number is c u δ t δ x if the courant number is greater than one the streamline traverses multiple upstream cells and this implies that all the tracer values associated with every cell the streamline encounters will flux through the given cell face located at the base of the streamline the integer part of the courant number n represents the number of cells that the streamline passes through entirely while the fractional component δ c is the fraction of the last cell the streamline traverses ordinarily this fractional part is evaluated with any sub grid interpolant scheme our description of the structured grid ffsl scheme is completed by returning to an analysis of the transverse correction terms f ψ and g ψ presented above these terms are so named based on their function as corrections to the direction split ffsl form presented in 3 in which axis aligned fluxes are computed independently a careful analysis of this expression shows that the x axis correction f ψ contributes to the y axis flux g ψ and vice versa acting as described in leonard et al 1996 fig 5 to ensure that the streamline averaged values ψ contains a projection of the flow from both the x and y axis directions previous studies e g gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 have shown the inclusion of these direction splitting corrections to be important to maintain both long time step stability and numerical accuracy in practice the transverse correction terms f ψ and g ψ are incorporated within the full ffsl update by means of a predictor corrector approach in which an initial non conservative projection is used to evaluate the conservative direction split fluxes that are ultimately used to advance the solution in time this two step behaviour is illustrated through an expansion of the ffsl update 3 to detail the action of individual terms h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ t g ψ t 9 g 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ t f ψ t 10 h ψ i j t δ t h ψ i j t f 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ g t δ t g 1 2 ψ t 1 2 ψ f t δ t here ψ g t δ t and ψ f t δ t are the non conservative projections associated with the transverse terms f ψ and g ψ representing respectively estimates for advection of the tracer ψ in the y and x axis directions these estimates are computed using a traditional non flux form semi lagrangian method with ψ g t δ t and ψ f t δ t taken to be the tracer values interpolated to the end the of the y and x axis aligned streamlines computed using 8 a full description of this direction split ffsl technique for coastal models based on structured curvilinear grids is presented in gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 the method may be extended to three dimensional structured grid models by introducing three axis aligned flux terms f ψ g ψ and h ψ as well as three transverse correction terms f ψ g ψ and h ψ 2 2 extension to unstructured models adapting the conventional ffsl approach to arbitrary unstructured meshes requires significant departure from the standard structured methodology and as such we present a full derivation that works incrementally from the underlying conservation laws we have adopted the nomenclature of herzfeld et al 2020 to integrate over the cells of an unstructured c grid type discretisation with l e denoting the length of a cell edge a c the cell area u h e k the normally oriented horizontal mass flux crossing the edge e and n ˆ e 1 indicating the sign of the flux wrt the local cell orientation w k 1 2 represent equivalent mass fluxes in the vertical direction considering the evolution of 1 over a single time step t δ t which we are assuming will be longer than the cfl bound time step the following statement of integral conservation is considered 11 ψ t δ t ψ t t t δ t x u ψ z w ψ d t denoting ω as the area of the domain da a surface area element zb the sea floor and η the sea surface and integrating 11 over both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the domain 12 ω z b η ψ t δ t d z d a ω z b η ψ t d z d a t t δ t ω z b η x u ψ z w ψ d z d a d t a finite volume spatial discretisation can then be obtained by simplifying various

of horizontally unstructured polygonal cells c consisting of an arbitrary number of horizontal edges e as well as the upper and lower cell interfaces k 1 2 defined in terms of a vertical stack of moving fluid layers with thickness h x t in practice h may be constant or variable through part or the whole of the water column depending on the vertical coordinate system used we have sought to construct a 2nd order accurate spatial discretisation evaluating the integral terms in 13 15 via midpoint type quadrature rules substituting 13 15 into 12 leads to the semi discrete evolution equation for our unstructured system 16 h ψ c k t δ t h ψ c k t 1 a c t t δ t e n ˆ e l e u h e k ψ e k a c w ψ c k 1 2 w ψ c k 1 2 d t the quantities h ψ c k t are the finite volume type cell mean tracer values centred within each cell c and layer k and evaluated at time t anticipating that the mass flux terms will emanate from a separate hydrodynamic model while it is the evolution of the tracers ψ that we wish to evaluate using a semi lagrangian approach from 16 we approximate a fully discrete tracer update by introducing the flux splitting h ψ c k t δ t h ψ c k t δ t a c e n ˆ e l e u h e k ψ e k 17 a c w c k 1 2 ψ c k 1 2 w c k 1 2 ψ c k 1 2 18 with ψ 1 δ t t t δ t ψ d t 19 and u h i 1 δ t t t δ t u h i d t w i 1 δ t t t δ t w i d t here the double overbars denote an aggregation of the horizontal and vertical mass flux terms over the time step as will be discussed in subsequent sections these aggregated mass fluxes can be evaluated explicitly based on direct output from the hydrodynamic model the remaining time integral terms ψ can be interpreted as an aggregation of the tracer ψ that crosses a cell edge face due to advection within a single time step consistent with the structured grid methodology described previously in this study these terms are evaluated by integration along the multi dimensional streamlines x s i e back trajectories emanating from each edge face in the mesh such that 20 d x s d t u x t 21 ψ e k 1 δ t t t δ t ψ x s t t d t 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ d x ψ c k 1 2 1 l z 0 z 1 ψ d z where the time integrated tracer values that cross a particular edge face is approximated as a spatial integral along an equivalent streamline segment x 0 x 1 of length l in our unstructured model configuration evaluation of 21 requires various constructions first integrating 20 to find the discrete multi dimensional path of the streamline as it cuts through various unstructured cells and then evaluating the integral of the tracer along this curve using numerical quadrature rules evaluation of vertical fluxes is more straightforward with computations restricted to one dimensional evaluations over structured columns the layout of a generic hexagonal mesh is illustrated in fig 1 where red dots denote cell centres and green triangles edge integration points we require to trace streamline paths from each edge integration point i e the destination point to its streamline end point the source point and to compute the effective streamline integrated tracer value as per 21 to compute the full tracer flux this value is multiplied by the aggregated mass flux associated with the edge or vertical face consistent with the horizontal and vertical flux terms expressed in 17 the new tracer values at the next time step are determined through evaluation of these flux divergences computing the divergence of the edge and face centred tracer fluxes associated with each cell according to a standard finite volume type procedure in this study we approximate the continuous streamline paths as a collection of piecewise linear segments with each segment either spanning across a full polygonal cell or comprising of a streamline s fractional termination within a given cell when it arrives at the source in effect this procedure breaks each full model time step into a sequence of sub time steps such that δ t δ t s i with each sub step s i associated with a given streamline segment see fig 1 for detail to facilitate the computation of streamline segments we employ a linear least squares type reconstruction of velocity components based on cell centred east and north components given the interpolated velocity components u i v i evaluated at the start of a given segment s i the direction of the segment is computed as 22 θ i arctan v i u i π note that we are tracing trajectories in an upstream direction i e in the opposite direction to the velocity vector hence the addition of π in 22 the length of the segment is extrapolated across the width of the cell terminating either at an opposing cell edge or interior to the cell if the end of a streamline path has been reached in the case of segments that span full cells the intersection point between the linear segment and opposing cell edge are computed and the processes repeated for the next upstream cell and so on the streamline tracing procedure terminates when a distance equivalent to the full model time step has been exhausted note that we only trace one streamline back from the edge centre in this approach which whilst sufficient may be improved upon in terms of accuracy by considering multiple trajectories from a given edge throughout the segment building process we make use of various local indexing structures within mpas compas there exist indexing arrays that map each cell centre to neighbouring centres and each centre to its surrounding edges using these maps the trajectory from an edge destination location e g t0 for cell tc in fig 1 may be computed and for the cell associated with that edge e g t0 the intersection of that trajectory with an exit edge may be identified on an edge by edge basis once found the new cell in which the source cell resides is the mapping in that exit edge direction this approach allows us to efficiently walk the mesh from cell to cell checking only the set of local neighbours i e number of edges per cell o 1 rather than looping on the global mesh concurrent with the computation of streamline segment geometry we evaluate the associated streamline integrated tracer values through an approximation of 21 via the application of a two point quadrature rule per segment 23 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ i d x 1 l s i 1 2 d s i ψ x s i ψ x s i 1 where ψ x s i k denotes an interpolation of the tracer ψ to an arbitrary segment endpoint x s i k and d s i is the length of the segment the linear least squares based interpolation operators used in this study to evaluate 23 are described in detail in the subsequent section considering the full three dimensional advective transport dynamics expressed in 17 we integrate along both horizontal streamlines from cell edges as well as vertical streamlines from upper and lower cell faces horizontal streamlines are integrated within a given model layer in a two dimensional sense data is projected vertically onto common horizontal planes while vertical streamlines are computed within a given one dimensional model column data is projected horizontally a critical aspect of our streamline integration procedure is that the interpolation to both quadrature points in 23 be carried out using the same cell centred interpolant consistent with the idea of individual streamline segments spanning across full model cells experimental studies have shown that any attempt to recycle interpolated values from previous segments leads to degradation and instability in the solution 2 3 conservative piecewise linear reconstruction when evaluating both streamline segment geometry and streamline integrated tracer values as per expressions 22 and 23 defined above an evaluation of both the velocity field as well as the tracer variables is required at arbitrary positions within the model s unstructured mesh interpolating data onto locations where streamlines cross cell edges and or faces in this study we have employed a linear least squares based methodology to support interpolation over our unstructured mesh building a set of piecewise linear interpolants within each polygonal cell c such that an arbitrary discrete variable θ is represented as a linear variation about the mean 24 θ x θ c β x x c θ here θ c denotes the finite volume type integral mean value of the variable θ within a given cell c and x c is the cell s centre of mass β 0 1 is scalar parameter associated with each cell in the mesh used to ensure the interpolants remain monotonic i e no new minima or maxima are introduced as will be discussed in detail subsequently noting that θ x θ c when the gradient terms vanish the interpolant 24 is seen to be a conservative reconstruction preserving the integral of the underlying finite volume data θ this behaviour is needed to build a mass conserving transport scheme the interpolation coefficients i e the spatial gradient terms θ in 24 can be evaluated by fitting the piecewise linear interpolant 24 to the values associated with a cell c as well as its nearest neighbours c j c 1 c 2 c n in a least squares sense 25 x 1 x c y 1 y c x 2 x c y 2 y c x n x c y n y c θ x θ y θ 1 θ c θ 2 θ c θ n θ c a θ θ in this study the over determined system 25 is solved using an svd approach determining the interpolation coefficients in matrix form at model initialisation such that 26 θ x θ y v σ 1 u t θ 1 θ c θ 2 θ c θ n θ c where u σ v t a in practice 26 results in a set of interpolation coefficients being stored for each cell in the mesh in the case of tracer variables the cell mean data θ is available as part of the model s prognostic variable set allowing 26 to be evaluated directly when interpolating velocity components and additional pre processing step is required first reconstructing the tangential velocity components on cell edges using the unstructured c grid numerical operators described in e g herzfeld et al 2020 and then rotating onto a common longitude latitude coordinate system and averaging to cell centres in the case of tracer variables the interpolation coefficients are further modified to force the interpolants to be locally monotone in this work we have employed a barth jespersen type barth and jespersen 1989 michalak and ollivier gooch 2008 slope limiting strategy reducing the value of the scalar parameter β included in expression 24 to ensure the interpolation centred about each cell does not under overshoot the data associated with its immediate neighbours considering the piecewise linear nature of the interpolants extrema are guaranteed to occur at the vertices of the polygonal cells a monotone enforcing value for the parameter β can therefore be found by iterating through the vertices v i of each cell and evaluating the following find the largest negative difference δ v i min min θ v i θ c between cell values at vertex v i find the largest positive difference δ v i max max θ v i θ c between cell values at vertex v i compute the unconstrained vertex interpolation θ v i θ c x v i x c θ set the vertex limiter value β v i min 1 δ v i max θ v i θ c if θ v i θ c 0 min 1 δ v i min θ v i θ c if θ v i θ c 0 1 if θ v i θ c 0 assign the limit of vertex values β min β v i for each cell the action of the parameter β is to locally decrease numerical gradients associated with the cell centred interpolation functions to ensure that no new minima or maxima are created in extreme cases where β 0 the interpolants are reduced to piecewise constant representations note that it is only the tracers that we expect to behave monotonically velocities can do have local extrema since the momentum equation includes local sources sinks as well as advective transport therefore in our work the slope limiting is applied only to tracer variables experimental studies suggest that use of unlimited velocity reconstructions enhances the overall accuracy of the ffsl scheme note that the slope limiting approach guarantees monotonicity of tracer values used for the cell face fluxes however this does not guarantee that the divergence of those fluxes will deliver a monotone updated tracer value as a flux corrected transport type scheme zalesak 1979 or the universal limiter of thuburn 1996 will do indeed using a first order approximation to locate the streamline source where only velocity values at cell edge locations are used small isolated monotonicity violations have been seen to occur in test cases these errors are isolated in time and space in the sense that violations typically occur in single cells once during the simulation and revert to monotone behaviour at the subsequent time step they are not cumulative and do not introduce bias in the solution when a second order approach is taken to locating the streamline source in conjunction with slope limiting we find monotonicity is exactly preserved or errors are substantially reduced in our tests the process for second order streamline approximation is find a streamline source for a sub time step using edge velocities u i v i evaluated at the start of a given segment s i interpolate new velocities onto this streamline source location to provide u i v i compute mean velocities using the edge and new velocities 0 5 u i u i 0 5 v i v i re compute the streamline source location from the edge destination using the mean velocities although this approach is more computationally expensive we use the second order approach in the test cases presented below due to its superior monotonic behaviour the use of piecewise linear interpolants suggests our unstructured ffsl scheme should show approximately 2nd order accuracy in space and time roughly equivalent to linear upwind eulerian advection schemes such as the well known formulation of van leer 1979 these expectations are confirmed by various experimental results presented in section 3 in which favourable comparisons to several eulerian and semi lagrangian transport formulations is demonstrated as noted previously excessive activation of the slope limiter may be expected to reduce spatial accuracy to 1st order 2 4 incorporating advective corrections while the unstructured ffsl scheme presented above does not employ direction splitting in the horizontal in contrast with the structured grid ffsl formulations of e g leonard et al 1996 and lin and rood 1996 a direction splitting is still applied to separate horizontal and vertical computations as noted previously streamlines departing from cell edges are evaluated in the horizontal direction only within a given model layer and streamlines departing from cell top and bottom faces are integrated in only in the vertical direction within a given model column to ameliorate the effect of such splitting we employ a variation of the corrected flux approach of leonard et al 1996 to estimate horizontal vertical coupling multi dimensional coupling effects manifest in the evaluation of streamline integrated tracer values e g from 21 27 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ x s t t d x as per leonard et al 1996 an accurate evaluation of this integral should account for the variation of the tracer in both space and time and therefore can be approximated to 2nd order by considering a time centred tracer distribution 28 ψ 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ x t 1 2 δ t d x 1 l x 0 x 1 ψ t 1 2 ϕ ψ t d x where ϕ is a correction term that accounts for advection in the split axis direction in the case of our unstructured ffsl scheme a vertical correction should be added to the computation of fluxes in the horizontal while a horizontal correction must be added to the vertical flux evaluation consistent with the structured grid algorithm e g 3 9 these transverse correction terms can be incorporated into the full ffsl update using a predictor corrector approach when computing the horizontal streamline integrated fluxes an estimate for advection in the vertical is added 29 ψ e k 1 l x 0 x 1 1 γ ψ t γ ψ z t δ t d x while a corresponding horizontal correction is added to the evaluation of vertical fluxes 30 ψ c k 1 2 1 l z 0 z 1 1 γ ψ t γ ψ x t δ t d z here ψ z t δ t and ψ x t δ t are projections in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively introducing a strang splitting strang 1968 like correction to our direction split flux evaluations γ 0 1 is a time centred weighting with γ 1 2 leading to a 2nd order accurate update in practice introducing a marginal implicit bias γ 0 55 was found to improve the stability of the scheme and is used in the various configurations presented in subsequent sections consistent with the structured grid algorithm described previously the vertical and horizontal projections ψ z t δ t and ψ x t δ t are computed using a non flux form semi lagrangian approach taking the values of the tracer ψ interpolated to the ends of vertical and horizontal streamlines based on the same unstructured streamline tracing and interpolation approaches developed above a full flux corrected time step of our unstructured ffsl scheme is comprised of the following stages evaluate horizontal fluxes trace to the end of vertical streamlines to compute the projection ψ z t δ t form the corrected tracer variable 1 γ ψ t γ ψ z t δ t for horizontal flux computation integrate along horizontal streamlines to compute cell edge tracer values ψ e k evaluate vertical fluxes trace to the end of horizontal streamlines to compute the projection ψ x t δ t form the corrected tracer variable 1 γ ψ t γ ψ x t δ t for vertical flux computation integrate along vertical streamlines to compute cell top bottom face tracer values ψ c k 1 2 the ffsl time step is completed through evaluation of 17 computing tracer tendencies as the divergence of horizontal and vertical tracer fluxes u h ψ and w ψ 2 5 time splitting for offline transport typically the computational burden associated with the advection of passive tracers is substantial in particular for configurations incorporating biogeochemical and or sediment processes provided these processes do not feed back to hydrodynamics that contribute large numbers of tracer variables the greatest impact in decreasing run times in such configurations is typically achieved by increasing the model time step an outcome that requires overcoming the advective cfl constraint which typically limits conventional eulerian transport solvers to use very small time step sizes in the following we present a time splitting approach in which the time step used to advance transport processes is some large multiple of that of the underlying hydrodynamic model s gillibrand and herzfeld 2016 this splitting effectively de couples the transport and hydrodynamic solution processes and is typically achieved as a two step procedure in which the hydrodynamic model is run first without tracers saving the prognostic flow field to file with the passive tracer dynamics then evaluated in a subsequent transport only pass based on the pre computed hydrodynamical output through the use of semi lagrangian techniques this second pass may employ a much increased time step size this transport only solver is here called an offline transport model while it is straightforward to separate the underlying hydrodynamics and tracer transport in a procedural sense a key complication relates to ensuring the tracer dynamics remain consistent with the underlying hydrodynamical solution when different hydrodynamic and transport time step sizes are used these difficulties can be explained by considering the consistency of the underlying hydrodynamical continuity equation when integrated over varying step lengths the continuity equation is presented here in simplified one dimensional form for illustrative purpose 31 h t x u h 0 consider the integration of 31 from t to t 2 δ t first in two short steps of length δ t 32 h i t 1 δ t h i t δ t δ x u h i 1 2 t u h i 1 2 t h i t 2 δ t h i t 1 δ t δ t δ x u h i 1 2 t δ t u h i 1 2 t δ t 33 such that h i t 2 δ t h i t δ t δ x u h i 1 2 t δ t u h i 1 2 t u h i 1 2 t δ t u h i 1 2 t and then in one long step of 2 δ t 34 h i t 2 δ t h i t 2 δ t δ x u h i 1 2 u h i 1 2 where u 1 n 1 j 0 n u t j δ t and h 1 n 1 j 0 n h t j δ t are time averaged velocity and fluid thickness states evaluated over the long time step leading to 35 h i t 2 δ t h i t 2 δ t δ x 1 3 j 0 n 2 u i 1 2 t j δ t 1 3 j 0 n 2 h i 1 2 t j δ t 1 3 j 0 n 2 u i 1 2 t j δ t 1 3 j 0 n 2 h i 1 2 t j δ t due to the nonlinearity of the flux terms it is clear that the naïve long step update 35 is not equivalent to the sum of two short steps 33 demonstrating that a time split update based on a simple averaging of state variables independently leads to inconsistencies and that careful constructions are needed to guarantee compatibility such issues can be resolved through the aggregation and averaging of fluxes rather than state variables such that 36 u h 1 δ t t t δ t u h d t 1 n j 0 n 1 u h t j δ t are the consistently averaged nonlinear fluxes for a long transport time step consisting of n short hydrodynamical sub steps this approach is integral to ensuring the consistency of the scheme since in the case of a constant tracer the continuity equation is recovered substitution of the time averaged fluxes 36 into the ffsl update 17 leads to a time split transport scheme that is exactly compatible with the underlying hydrodynamical solution furthermore the use of these fluxes from the hydrodynamic model directly simplifies the computation of the tracer flux by dealing only with scalar quantities during the streamline integration the operation of this time split algorithm can be summarised as follows run the full hydrodynamic model using a short time step length output the prognostic state u h as well as the edge face fluxes u h and w to file evaluate the time averaged fluxes u h w over the long step length n δ t using 36 compute the time averaged velocities u w similarly run the transport model evaluate the streamline integrated tracer values ψ using the time averaged velocities u w to compute streamline geometry combine with the time averaged fluxes u h w to compute full tracer fluxes and evaluate 17 while ffsl type schemes are not bound by an explicit cfl constraint the maximum admissible time step size is still limited by the so called lipschitz condition which requires that streamlines do not cross in any given time step to account for such a bound we retain a sub stepping algorithm typically used for standard eulerian advection schemes to ensure satisfaction of the cfl constraint within the sub stepping algorithm the model time step is bisected if a stability constraint is violated in the real and idealised test cases presented in sections 3 and 4 invocation of the sub stepping algorithm was found to be a relatively rare occurrence for the unstructured ffsl scheme presented here 3 idealised test cases in order to demonstrate the utility of the scheme we first apply it to two simple idealised cases the first test is a closed basin with 3d rotational flow in which a passive tracer in the form of a gaussian hill is allowed to rotate since the tracer is infinitely differentiable in this case we may compute the convergence rate also the lack of sources of volume and mass in this case allows us to exactly assess mass conservation of the scheme the second test is a simple infinite open channel with alongshore wind stress in which a gaussian hill is advected with the flow we use this test to demonstrate the scheme is consistent and monotonic to avoid confusion we hereafter refer to our scheme as heen ffsl to distinguish it from the structured grid ffsl schemes described previously in these test cases we run on quadrilateral grids so that standard established advection schemes can be used for tracers here we use the 3rd order accurate monotonic ultimate quickest scheme of leonard 1991 or the second order muscl scheme of van leer 1979 by using these schemes we circumvent any ambiguity of scheme accuracy that perhaps may be encountered when using more sophisticated hi order schemes designed for unstructured meshes we consider the solutions using the hd model the benchmark solution velocity and volume fluxes are averaged at a predefined interval usually 1 h and saved offline for use with a transport model using the heen ffsl scheme a passive tracer is then simulated using the heen ffsl scheme in conjunction with these fields at the longer time step and compared to the benchmark solution we also assess mass conservation characteristics where possible and computational efficiency of the benchmark and heen ffsl simulations note that the reported timing for the hd simulation includes the cost of both the hydrodynamic and tracer advection computation and the transport timing includes the cost of import of the 3d transport data in this respect the runtimes quoted represent the wall time required to produce a solution of tracer distribution rather than the time spent in the tracer advection scheme the compatibility of the scheme is tested by assessing the constancy condition we simulate a tracer with unit initial condition and it should remain at unity for the simulation duration for the scheme to be compatible monotonicity is assessed by applying a metric which computes the minimum and maximum tracer values of all cells in the neighbourhood of the streamline source cell such that these neighbourhood cells will contribute to the tracer interpolation applied to fluxes at cell faces the updated tracer solution must then lie within the bounds of these extrema for the scheme to be monotonic note that this monotonicity metric tests updated tracer values against local rather than global extrema the metric reports the maximum deviation of updated values from local extrema for the entire simulation with negative values indicating an undershoot and positive values an overshoot although many flux form advection schemes are designed to deliver monotone tracer values to be used for the cell face fluxes this does not guarantee that the divergence of those fluxes will deliver a monotone updated tracer value here we test that criterion only a flux corrected transport type scheme will guarantee that divergence of fluxes produces a monotone updated tracer the model used to generate the benchmark hd solutions is the compas model described by herzfeld et al 2020 this is an unstructured model operating on arbitrary polygonal cells and employs the trisk numerics in the horizontal although designed for unstructured meshes the compas model also operates on orthogonal curvilinear grids allowing a benchmark run to be performed using structured model configurations based on quadrilateral grids meshes used with compas are required to be a set of polygonal cells which are orthogonal cell edges must be perpendicular to the line joining adjacent cell centres centroidal triangle vertices must be positioned at the centre of mass of each polygonal cell and well centred cell vertices must lie in the interior of their associated dual triangles these polygons are typically constructed from voronoi diagrams of which the dual is a delaunay triangulation additionally meshes must also conform to the geometry of coastal and open boundaries and adhere to user defined rules a weighting function that specify the mesh resolution the generation of grids conforming to these requirements is not trivial requiring the construction of highly optimised centroidal voronoi tessellations cvt s and non obtuse delaunay triangulations compas uses the unstructured meshing library jigsaw engwirda 2017 https github com dengwirda jigsaw to accomplish these tasks resulting in high quality meshes that support the requirements of the trisk numerics note that orthogonal curvilinear grids used in structured models also conform to the above requirements 3 1 closed basin in this test we assess the rate of convergence of the scheme and its conservation properties the test consists of three dimensional flow in a closed basin of size 25 25 km and depth 50 m a gaussian hill of radius 10 km is placed in the centre of the domain and allowed to rotate with the applied circulation this circulation is driven by a sheared wind stress where a stress of 0 1 n m 2 is applied in a clockwise direction at the boundaries of the domain and stress decreases to zero at the centre such wind forcing drives clockwise circulation in the domain throughout the water column a secondary transverse circulation exists with upwelling at the centre and downwelling at the domain boundaries this transverse circulation tends to uniformly distribute the passive tracer over time since the basin has no sources or sinks of mass this test also enables the conservation properties of the scheme to be assessed constant density is employed in this test with temperature set to 25 c and salinity to 35 psu horizontal resolution is 200 m and 12 vertical geopotential layers are used with exponential spacing at the surface and 5 m spacing in the interior of the water column coriolis is constant at 8 9672 1 0 5 s 1 southern hemisphere vertical closure is performed using the mellor yamada 2 0 mellor and yamada 1982 scheme and horizontal diffusion is set to zero the hd model is allowed to run for 20 days where in the first 10 days spin up of the circulation is allowed to be established the gaussian hill is kept fixed for these first 10 days then allowed to rotate with a rotation rate approximately once every 2 1 days when using the ultimate quickest scheme in the hd model the solution is considered the exact solution for the purposes of the convergence analysis we also use this case to investigate conservation properties due to the transverse circulation and associated lateral spreading of the gaussian hill deviation from the initial condition is expected and the initial condition cannot be considered the true solution after numerous rotations the sea level associated surface circulation and gaussian hill at 15 days after just over 2 rotations are shown in fig 2 the experiment was then run with various resolutions in order to assess the rate of convergence these resolutions time steps and viscosity used are shown in table 1 the heen ffsl scheme is then applied as the advection scheme in a transport model which uses offline mean velocity volume flux vertical diffusivity fields and elevation snapshots from the hd model for each resolution vertical mixing used averaged values of vertical diffusivity from the hd model and horizontal diffusivity is set to zero the time step used for r200 was 18 min and 1 h for all other resolutions fig 2 c shows that the courant number approaches zero at the centre of the domain for r200 but exceeds 2 on the edges hence heen ffsl exercises the long time step stability properties near the perimeter of the domain for this resolution for r500 the courant number increases to close to 3 on the edges then decreases for coarser resolutions since the time step is kept constant but resolutions decrease to 0 23 for r5000 subsequent test simulations further stress this stability limit the gaussian hill solutions at 15 days for each resolution are shown in fig 3 low resolutions are more diffuse with peak values at the centres considerably less than the initial condition and higher resolution solutions more closely resemble the initial condition r5000 has a peak value at the centre of 0 59 at 15 days whereas r200 has a peak value of 1 0 these peak values slowly decrease over time as the transverse circulation homogenises tracer concentration in the domain similarly concentrations at the domain boundaries which initially are zero slowly increase over time the l2 and l error norms are computed following yu et al 2020 appendix a 37 l 2 ψ ω ψ ψ t 2 d a 1 2 ω ψ t 2 d a 1 2 38 l ψ m a x ω ψ ψ t m a x ω ψ t the subscript t refers to the analytic solution the error norms reported here are also computed at 15 days and plotted in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that a typical convergence profile exists with pre and post asymptotic ranges bracketing a linear decrease e g surana et al 2016 fig 1 it is this linear section between r2500 and r1000 that we employ to estimate the convergence rate a least squares fit between the r2500 and r1000 cases results in a slope of 2 14 for the l2 norm and 1 84 for the l norm the error norms are plotted against those computed using the quickest and muscl schemes in fig 4 b showing all schemes converge at a second order rate for this test within the linear range heen ffsl shows slightly greater errors than quickest and slightly less than muscl we therefore conclude that heen ffsl exhibits better than second order convergence and possesses an accuracy between those delivered by the quickest and muscl schemes a traditional i e non flux form semi lagrangian advection scheme lagrange was used with quadratic least squares interpolation of departure point values the surface passive tracer solution is more diffuse than the quickest benchmark and heen ffsl solution fig 5 although the peak concentration at 15 days remains at 1 0 furthermore the l2 l error norms are 0 0046 0 0033 and 0 459 0 506 for heen ffsl and lagrange respectively demonstrating the significant loss of accuracy due to damping using lagrange the total mass of the gaussian surface is expressed as a mass anomaly which is the percentage change in mass from the initial condition at 10 days fig 6 both the heen ffsl and quickest schemes result in a conservative solution with 2 1 0 11 and 5 1 0 8 change in total mass content respectively from when the gaussian hill begins rotating to the end of the simulation whereas the conservation characteristics for the traditional semi lagrangian scheme are quite poor having a 4 5 change in total mass this result is expected as the advective form of the conservation equation upon which the traditional semi lagrangian scheme is based does not conserve the integral mass of the flow more alarmingly while the heen ffsl and quickest total mass establishes a steady state the semi lagrange mass shows a clear increase over the course of the simulation a demonstrable characteristic of non conservative formulations the quickest scheme ran on 36 processors with a runtime of 1000 1 whereas heen ffsl used one processor and had a runtime 4 times faster obviously runtime parity to heen ffsl will be achieved if enough processors are used however larger timesteps will similarly decrease heen ffsl runtime the offline transport is clearly more computationally efficient in this case the heen ffsl scheme was exactly monotonic for the r200 test case and satisfied the constancy condition by exactly preserving the unit tracer this is further investigated in the next more stringent test along with an analysis of runtimes 3 2 open channel in this experiment we test the scheme in a simple controllable configuration and assess its performance in terms of consistency and monotonicity the test chosen is that of an alongshore wind stress applied to an open channel having a sloping bottom with open boundaries at its western and eastern ends this test is one favoured to assess open boundary conditions e g chapman 1985 palma and matano 1998 and palma and matano 2001 and has an analytic solution for the 2d linear case using cyclic open boundaries an infinite coast is emulated which provides the analytic solution whereby alongshore gradients are eliminated to result in a cross shore elevation slope and constant alongshore flow this test was also simulated in herzfeld et al 2020 to demonstrate the performance of compas the channel used is 50 km long and 25 km wide with a wind stress of 0 1 n m 2 applied in the x direction westerly wind the bottom depth is 50 m at the southern land boundary and 110 m at the northern boundary vertical resolution is represented by 24 geopotential layers and horizontal resolution is 200 m cyclic open boundaries are applied at the western and eastern ends the southern hemisphere case is considered with coriolis constant at 8 9672 1 0 5 s 1 and density held constant at 1024 76 kg m 3 t 20 c s 35 psu vertical mixing used the mellor yamada 2 0 mellor and yamada 1982 scheme horizontal viscosity is 8 m 2 s 1 the linear 2d analytic solution gives an along shore depth averaged velocity of 0 195 ms 1 the cross shore depth averaged velocity is zero and elevation has a cross shore slope of 2 05 1 0 6 m 1 these results assume a linear depth averaged model and using a 3d non linear model provides a slight deviation from these expectations in particular 3d velocity shear is seen in the vertical with the surface velocity vector rotated to the left of the wind vector to deliver a small cross shore surface velocity component the experiment is run for 15 days when a steady state is achieved the solutions of depth averaged velocity and elevation for these cases are shown in fig 7 for a location mid channel 13 5 14 5 km a passive tracer is also simulated and introduced at the western boundary when the model has reached steady state at 12 days the injection of the passive tracer takes the form of a gaussian hill which is subsequently advected eastwards with the flow retaining its shape this test is similar to the gaussian hill test of skamarock and gassmann 2011 except rather than advecting the hill around the earth we advect along a linear channel there is a slight drift of the gaussian surface toward the northern boundary owing to the non zero surface cross shore velocity the tracer is mixed vertically but not horizontally we consider solutions within the first 25 km of the along shore domain to avoid any boundary contamination issues as the surface approaches the eastern boundary which cannot have cyclic conditions for the passive tracer the heen ffsl scheme is used as the advection scheme in a transport model which uses offline mean velocity volume flux vertical diffusivity fields and elevation snapshots from the hd model to transport a passive tracer vertical mixing used averaged values of vertical diffusivity from the hd model and horizontal diffusivity is set to zero the maximum courant number is 2 23 hence the heen ffsl scheme must again exercise its long time step stability properties an analytic solution is constructed by locating the centre of the gaussian surface in the hd model on 2000 01 12 12 00 and 2000 01 13 12 00 when the surface lies entirely within the domain and linearly interpolating between those endpoints the gaussian hill is then reconstructed spatially along this trajectory in the same manner as the open boundary condition was constructed snapshots of the gaussian hill once it has entered the domain at 2000 01 12 10 00 00 for ultimate quickest heen ffsl advection schemes and the analytic solution are shown in fig 8 runtime statistics including the error norms relative to the analytic solution are summarised in table 2 the error norms reported here are computed as the mean of the norms from 37 and 38 calculated from 2000 01 12 12 00 to 2000 01 13 12 00 these results show that the accuracy of heen ffsl is on par with the ultimate quickest and muscl convection schemes owing to the cyclic boundary conditions all simulations were performed on 1 processor and the hd simulations would obviously perform more efficiently if parallel processed however these statistics provide an indication of relative wall times required to generate a viable solution of interest is that when used inline the heen ffsl scheme is significantly slower than ultimate quickest or muscl due to computational expense of streamline tracing from every cell edge using offline heen ffsl the runtimes decrease by a factor of 33 the heen ffsl is currently un optimised with regard to parallelisation using master slave partitioning is unlikely to be successful since one generally does not know how far the streamline needs to be traced hence in a partitioned domain one does not know how large a ghost zone must intrude into adjacent partitions to accommodate a streamline trajectory to be safe the entire domain should be accessible to a given partition which is not computationally efficient and is counter to the philosophy of master slave partitioning however other approaches to parallelisation are possible which will be explored in future the unit tracer and monotonicity metrics are shown in fig 9 the unit tracer is exactly preserved using heen ffsl at 15 days with no deviation from unity to machine precision fig 9a demonstrating that in this application the scheme is consistent with the continuity equation the monotonicity metric fig 9b shows no over or under shoots to the single precision supported by the output files overall the scheme can be considered consistent and monotone in this case these test cases show that the heen ffsl is a viable candidate for tracer transport using long time steps and produces acceptable solutions which have demonstrated consistency show good conservation and monotonic behaviour and deliver large gains in computational efficiency when used in an offline capacity these test cases are relatively simple in nature so that aspects relating to assessment of conservation and conformity to a benchmark can be controlled one of the configuration choices to assist in this control was the use of regular quadrilateral grids heen ffsl is designed to operate on arbitrary meshes so now we turn our attention to more realistic test cases that use more complex arbitrary meshes 4 realistic test cases the approach to assessment in the following realistic test cases is the same as that used for the idealised tests we produce a hd simulation using high order eulerian transport methods and save mean quantities for use by the offline solver the transport model is then invoked using these offline quantities and we simulate a passive tracer with the same initial conditions and boundary forcing as temperature or salinity in the hd simulation these passive tracers are then compared against their equivalent hd benchmark distribution 4 1 east australian current upwelling a short regional forecast simulation is performed on the east coast of australia capturing the east australian current eac flowing southward along the shelf edge during the period simulated coastal upwelling develops in the south of the domain we assess the temperature response in both the full hydrodynamic and offline transport models the domain chosen is a circular domain centred on 35 5 s 151 e the model mesh uses a so called hex radius mesh spacing distribution in which a gaussian distribution is prescribed having high resolution at the circle centre and decreasing in resolution at the open boundaries the resolution of the mesh is illustrated in fig 10 a and the underlying bathymetry in fig 10 b maximum resolution is 900 m at the domain centre and the minimum is 10 km at the open boundary the model uses bathymetry from the geosciences australia 2002 database with regions outside this extent filled using the dbdb2 naval research laboratory digital bathymetry data base https www7320 nrlssc navy mil dbdb2 www global database the model is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 which supplies initial conditions and currents sea level temperature and salinity on the open boundaries low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with a tidal signal from the global tide model of cartwright and ray 1990 using the implementation of eanes and bettadpur 1996 the open boundary formulation used is that described in herzfeld et al 2020 surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2013 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 no surface heat or salt fluxes are applied in this simulation there are 64 layers in the vertical and the mellor and yamada 1982 closure scheme is used horizontal viscosity is set to 2800 m 2 s 1 and horizontal diffusivity is zero again the ultimate quickest scheme is used for tracer advection in the hd model with the modifications described in herzfeld et al 2020 to render it suitable for use with unstructured meshes the time step in this case is 38 s and the model is run over a 5 day period from 2014 12 03 to capture an upwelling event at the coast the evolution of the upwelling event is shown in fig 11 starting 2014 12 03 until 2014 12 08 the initial condition fig 11 a shows cooler water associated with upwelling centred around jervis bay this water is approximately 1 c cooler than water offshore as the simulation progresses this cold upwelled water moves further south and intensifies to become 2 c cooler than offshore water by 2014 12 08 a cool intrusion enters from offshore toward the end of the simulation and a warm plume is advected south along the shelf edge at this time a large anticyclonic eddy associated with the eac is centred on 36 s 152 e hence the cool coastal water is likely driven by onshore bottom ekman flow the temperature solution obtained using the hydrodynamic model is replicated in fig 12 a with the heen ffsl solution shown in fig 12 b the heen ffsl model used a 1 h timestep zero horizontal diffusivity and the maximum courant number was 4 75 located unsurprisingly at the centre of the domain where resolution is greatest the ultimate quickest scheme runs at 50 1 1 processor whereas the ffsl scheme is 18 times faster at 900 1 solutions are again comparable however the longer time step used in ffsl has the attractive attribute of producing a significantly less diffuse solution the water in the upwelling zone of the southern domain is noticeably cooler with sharper fronts separating it from offshore water as well as the warm shelf edge plumes being more pronounced the reduced numerical diffusion using the heen ffsl scheme can be explained by considering the analysis of warming and hyett 1974 who show that the magnitude of diffusive error terms in the discretisation of transport operators typically scales with the advective courant number c u δ t δ x achieving a minimum for c 1 this behaviour suggests the degree of spurious numerical diffusion associated with a given simulation is a function of the size of the time step used with smaller step sizes leading to increased diffusivity in the case of the full hd model results presented here it is argued that use of a relatively small time step c 1 as dictated by the nonlinear hydrodynamics leads to the generation of additional numerical diffusion compared to heen ffsl despite the ultimate quickest scheme being nominally higher order accurate this behaviour is consistent with practical experience using semi lagrangian type schemes for coastal modelling applications in which less diffuse solution are typically associated with the use of long step sizes note that whilst low numerical diffusion is an attractive attribute for a numerical advection scheme it does not necessarily make the solutions more accurate the addition of explicit horizontal diffusion of 500 m 2 s 1 largely reconciles the differences compared to the benchmark solution fig 12 c demonstrating that such differences are largely a product of the inherent diffusivity of the numerical schemes in this regard we can say that the heen ffsl scheme provides a better solution than the hydrodynamic model s although it does raise the question of what is the correct solution in the next section we compare the various methods to observation to address this note that while the transport scheme can operate with a long time step the open boundary conditions may not e g an upstream advection condition is bound by the courant number in the cases of fig 12 we use a clamped obc using parent model data ofam which results in a stripe of tracer discontinuity along the boundary the implementation of adaptive obcs that are not stability bound requires more attention the constancy condition is tested by simulating a unit tracer with the open boundaries clamped to unit values similar to the open channel test case the solution is exactly unity throughout the simulation fig 13 a to the single precision accommodated by file output this indicates that the heen ffsl scheme is compatible with the continuity equation even when run in complex configurations involving unstructured meshes and time averaged hydrodynamical inputs the monotonicity metric showed two violations at the surface of order 1 1 0 5 these occurred near the centre of the domain where the courant number was largest since these errors are small isolated and the scheme reverts to monotone behaviour at the subsequent time step we consider this an acceptable error 4 2 storm bay flood plume the full compas hydrodynamical model was evaluated against observations in herzfeld et al 2020 in the storm bay region of southern tasmania australia and we use this domain to also examine the performance of the heen ffsl scheme it is fortuitous that in this region during june 2015 observations of a flood event were captured by a slocum glider and are available for model assessment the domain includes storm bay d entrecasteaux channel and the derwent estuary region in south east tasmania australia fig 14 the storm bay area is dominated by local forcing notably freshwater inputs from the huon and derwent rivers in late summer storm bay may be impacted from offshore by the east australian current water flowing down the east coast of tasmania and in winter the region is influenced by the zeehan current flowing down the west coast these current systems are introduced into the model via the open boundaries the model is nested within a larger scale regional model covering the whole of tasmania and bass strait fig 14 which in turn is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with 8 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 obtained from the tpxo global model egbert and erofeeva 2002 and applied at the boundary of the regional model the local model is subsequently nested within the regional model and therefore inherits both low frequency and tidal ssh signals surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2013 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km heat fluxes applied at the surface boundary condition were computed from standard meteorological variables provided by access a wet and dry bulb temperature air pressure wind speed and cloud amount using short and longwave calculations outlined in zillmann 1972 and the bulk method for sensible and latent heat using bulk coefficients of kondo 1975 for the surface freshwater fluxes precipitation was provided by access a and evaporation was computed from the latent heat flux wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 the model was run from 2015 06 01 to 2015 06 20 during which both huon and derwent rivers were in flood delivering fresh water into storm bay the mesh configuration for the hydrodynamic model we use is a distance to coast weighting the coast solution of herzfeld et al 2020 resolution varies from 3 km at the offshore boundary to 300 m within the estuaries maximum cell size distance between centres is 4 1 km and minimum cell size is 47 m the k ϵ turbulence closure model of rodi 1987 is applied the unstructured ultimate quickest scheme was again used for tracer advection in the hd model and the smagorinsky horizontal mixing was implemented with an empirical constant of 0 1 added to a defined base rate of 80 m 2 s 1 with areal scaling on the mesh and horizontal diffusivity is zero freshwater flows down the huon and derwent rivers peak at 1290 and 235 m 3 s 1 respectively on 2015 06 09 the derwent river is regulated higher upstream in its catchment such that controlled volumes are released downstream consequently flow is usually less than the huon flow from the huon typically turns left into d entrecasteaux channel herzfeld et al 2010 eventually exiting the northern channel into storm bay this characteristic is also observed in the hydrodynamic model where a well defined plume is observed after the flood peak on 10 and 11 june and salinity is persistently lower in the northern d entrecasteaux flow from the derwent tends to head south eastward across storm bay this is also observed in the model although peak flows occurred on 9 june the maximum plume extent in storm bay due to flow from the derwent occurred around 16 june this is a consequence of the lag in the plume transiting the estuary but also favourable wind and tide conditions combining to push the freshwater plume further into storm bay at this time a snapshot of the salinity distribution at 2015 06 16 00 00 00 when freshwater intrusion into storm bay was maximum is provided in fig 15 with the hd surface salinity distribution shown in a the equivalent heen ffsl surface salinity distribution in b and c a time series at the glider trajectory origin blue dot included in a is the glider trajectory and a distance scale both the hd salinity and ffsl salinity time series and surface distribution on 16 june are very similar with negligible visual differences notable when comparing the full hd output and the heen ffsl results the rmse is plotted in fig 16 for the period 2015 06 01 to 2015 06 18 showing that differences within storm bay are less than 0 1 with areas impacted by the flood plume near the mouth of the derwent estuary 0 2 the greatest differences are located in the reaches of the derwent and huon estuaries where the rmse is 1 5 this is likely the consequence of phase differences in plume position and associated double penalty errors when the flood plume transits the estuaries we assess the hd and heen ffsl salinity solutions against observations acquired from the glider we do this following the methodology of herzfeld et al 2020 where we bring the glider to the model by averaging the glider observations in space and time onto the model mesh as opposed to bringing the model to the glider by interpolating the model onto the glider trajectory both glider and model data can then be presented as a time series and standard quantitative metrics rmse root mean squared error mae mean absolute error cc correlation coefficient bias and willmott skill score willmott 1981 are used for assessment the hd and heen ffsl comparisons for 2015 06 16 are shown in fig 17 a and b respectively the glider depth in fig 17 c and the number of glider observations averaged onto the model mesh in fig 17 d during 16 june the glider makes 12 ascents to the surface allowing the detail of fresh plume to be examined as the glider moves offshore minimum salinity is 31 1 psu at the surface of the northern portion of the trajectory and maximum is 35 1 psu at depth a comparison of hd and heen ffsl time series again shows very similar behaviour during this period confirmed quantitatively by comparing the skill metrics in fact the ffsl salinity shows slightly improved skill metrics compared to the full hydrodynamical solutions underlying consistency was again assessed for the storm bay configuration with a unit tracer showing no deviation when advected by the complex flow field over the full simulation period not shown the runtime of the hydrodynamic model was 5 1 using 16 processors and a time step of 6 s and heen ffsl ran at 26 1 on 1 processor with a time step of 30 min overall it is found that the heen ffsl solution is highly comparable to the hydrodynamic solution achieved with considerable saving in computational cost and both solutions exhibited a high level of skill when compared to high resolution observational data 5 conclusions we present a new conservative advection scheme based on the flux form semi lagrangian method which is bound by the lipschitz stability condition and therefore operates on long time steps the scheme differs to that presented by previous authors in that it may be used with the arbitrary meshes favoured by unstructured models including triangular quadrilateral or hexagonal meshes rather than structured grids the scheme may be used both within a full hydrodynamic model or in an offline capacity as a transport model that uses time averaged hydrodynamical inputs an attractive attribute of the heen ffsl scheme for the latter application is the ability to de couple the transport time step from that of the underlying hydrodynamics enabling long time steps to be used to resolve computationally expensive tracer dynamics this time splitting requires the hd model to save offline average volume fluxes to compute the mass flux divergence as well average velocities to compute the ffsl backward trajectories we exercise the scheme in the transport model mode with time steps much larger than the underlying hydrodynamic model and observe speed ups of up to several orders of magnitude in some cases while producing acceptable solutions in fact the longer time step leads to fewer evaluations of advective tendencies contributing to an associated reduction in the spurious numerical dissipation generated by the discrete scheme experimental results confirm that the heen ffsl method leads to less diffuse solutions than the full hd equivalent we have tested the scheme in various idealised controllable test cases and found it to accurately conserve mass and produce solutions comparable to the full hd model these characteristics carried through to more complex realistic cases the model also was also found to be compatible with the discrete continuity equation where throughout test simulations unitary tracers remained at that value to the single precision accommodated by file output the monotonicity of the scheme was also acceptable in these test cases showing no or very small and isolated over or under shoots relative to local extrema the universal flux limiter of thuburn 1996 has been successfully implemented in the heen ffsl scheme to enforce the monotonicity of streamline integrated fluxes however we have not used this in the cases presented in this study with direct slope limiting of the reconstructed interpolation functions sufficient it may be that more extreme non monotone behaviour could manifest under certain conditions in areas of large tracer gradients that are subject to high courant numbers for example such effects have not currently been observed though remain the subject of ongoing investigation in its current form the heen ffsl scheme is largely un optimised and is not expected to scale well with increasing tracer number unlike traditional semi lagrangian schemes where the location of the source cell only needs to be computed once irrespective of the number of tracers used in this scheme the streamline needs to be recomputed for each tracer so that the streamline tracer integration can take place to scale well with increasing tracers either a tracer loop must be initiated at each instance a new streamline location is found or the locations of the streamline must be cached for cycling through all tracers the efficiency of these approaches is yet to be explored currently we use linear least squares for interpolation of cell centred velocity and tracers onto faces we have shown that this scheme delivers better than second order convergence when used in a rotating gaussian hill test case and accuracy assessed using error norms was comparable to various higher order accurate eulerian advection schemes the choice of first order interpolation was largely chosen due to the simplicity of including a slope limiter for ensuring monotonicity of the interpolated value for this scheme it is critical that the face interpolated value be monotone in order for the flux divergence to deliver a monotonic updated tracer solution the accuracy may be improved using higher order least squares interpolation this is an area for further work although it is anticipated the inclusion of a slope limiter for such schemes will not be trivial future work may also be removing the horizontal vertical directional splitting however this would involve more difficult computation of entry and exit points of streamlines through volumetric cells in 3d space although we present the heen ffsl here for use in an offline transport model it has also been used within the full hd model to advect tracers directly the attraction here is that it is not bound by the cfl condition and the tracer time step may be de coupled from the baroclinic time step such that the transport algorithm is invoked at some integer multiple of the baroclinic step since the temperature and salinity and therefore density fields are held constant during this interval updating active tracers too infrequently has been observed to lead to instability with the baroclinic dynamics becoming decoupled from all other dynamics operating at the shorter time step in practice we find that the tracer can be safely set at 5 the baroclinic time step invoking the transport algorithm infrequently reduces the effective numerical diffusion of the solution and increases model throughput and is a viable alternative to traditional advection schemes in the hd model the heen ffsl scheme is particularly suitable for offline transport models coupled to sediment transport or biogeochemical modules where the computation burden drastically increases due to the number of tracers to transport 60 similar suitability would be observed in atmospheric chemistry models while this scheme is anticipated to be suitable for these applications we have not yet exercised it using actual biogeochemical or sediment transport distributions however we expect similar performance to its

23801,a field multibeam survey discovered a group of regularly spaced submarine canyons on the continental shelf in the northern south china sea however they are not included in the bathymetry datasets commonly used by the oceanographic community in this study we employ a very high resolution as fine as 54 m numerical model that resolves these submarine canyons to investigate their impacts on the local internal tide generation and propagation results show that the barotropic to internal tidal conversion rate exhibits an alternating distribution on each flank of submarine canyons rotational direction of the tidal flow determines a positive conversion rate on the west flank and a negative rate on the east flank the rough seafloor due to the submarine canyons does not appreciably change the dissipation of barotropic tides but significantly affects the dissipation of internal tides leading to an averaged dissipation rate of 1 2 10 9 w kg 1 internal tides also induce a bottom intensified mean flow which causes westward mean transport on the continental slope and a clockwise circulation inside each submarine canyon the mean flow satisfies a momentum budget between the coriolis force pressure gradient and divergence of momentum flux of barotropic and internal tides we highlight that the divergence of the pseudo momentum flux of internal tides acts as a stress and is especially reinforced near the sea bottom and surface its effect on the sea surface is even comparable with moderate winds 13 m s 1 keywords internal tides energy balance momentum flux shenhu submarine canyon group suntans data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction submarine canyons are one of the most common morphological features on continental slopes they are associated with various oceanic phenomena that link the shelves and deep ocean canyons are hotspots with enhanced mixing in the global ocean and are believed to be related to dissipation or breaking of internal waves kunze et al 2002 not only are canyons a source of locally generated internal waves but also a sink of internal waves arriving from the remote deep ocean about 10 of continental slopes are carved out by submarine canyons therefore it is important to understand their influence on ocean stratification and circulation as well as their subsequent effects on nutrient cycles biological productivity and sediment transport internal waves are sensitive to specific geometry of submarine canyons especially their flank steepness and aspect ratio nazarian and legg 2017a b steep flanks are favorable for high mode internal wave generation and the v shaped topography may converge internal wave energy hence leading to strong energy dissipation and diapycnal mixing especially near the canyon head kunze et al 2002 on continental slopes incised canyons also cause complex reflection and transmission of remotely incident internal waves internal wave energy may be trapped near the canyon bottom due to supercritical reflection from steep canyon flanks gordon and marshall 1976 recent observations revealed bottom trapped diurnal internal tides inside the eel canyon waterhouse et al 2017 submarine canyons are important sinks to maintain the energy balance of the global ocean energy losses are more than 100 w in the most commonly studied submarine canyons such as monterey canyon eel canyon la jolla canyon gaoping canyon etc petruncio et al 1998 wain et al 2013 waterhouse et al 2017 alberty et al 2017 lee et al 2009 according to the energy loss estimated from the observations in monterey canyon a crude extrapolation to global dissipation in submarine canyons is about 15 gw for the m 2 internal tides a more precise estimate using simplified geometry models of submarine canyons suggests that 15 gw may be an underestimate nazarian et al 2021 their estimate gives an energy loss of 30 8 75 3 gw accounting for 3 2 7 8 of the total energy of global m 2 internal tides it is in a wide range because their method relates to the geometric properties of submarine canyons and seasonal stratification nevertheless 20 of the m 2 internal tide energy dissipates over continental shelves and their adjacent slopes de lavergne et al 2019 so the submarine canyons actually account for a large fraction of local energy dissipation the above estimates only consider the incoming internal tides locally generated internal tides and interactions with large scale circulations may induce additional dissipation therefore in order to accurately assess the global energy dissipation and oceanic mixing individual studies focusing on specific submarine canyons including high resolution models and refined field observation are necessary in addition to general global estimates interaction between internal waves and mean flow has not yet been fully resolved the pseudo momentum flux also called the eliassen palm ep flux eliassen and palm 1961 is an important concept in atmospheric science its divergence acts as wave forcing on the atmospheric circulation meteorologists have used the ep flux to explain various atmospheric phenomena such as the stratospheric circulation miyahara et al 1993 stratospheric sudden warming matsuno 1971a b quasi biennial cycle of the tropical stratosphere holton and lindzen 1972 etc however the role of internal wave momentum flux in the ocean is not well understood no significant vertical flux of horizontal momentum is found in the open ocean ruddick and joyce 1979 brown and owens 1981 plueddemann 1987 polzin 2008 probably owing to exchanged energy cancellation between surface and bottom reflections of internal waves olbers and eden 2017 however recent theoretical and numerical works reveal its potential contribution in wave mean flow interaction muench and kunze 1999 speculated that the pseudo momentum flux of internal waves may play a role in sustaining equatorial deep jets for superinertial tidal forcing both the propagating and locally dissipating internal tides can impose a drag on the mean flow and for sub inertial tidal forcing bottom trapped internal tides are generated and significantly damp the barotropic tides as well shakespeare et al 2020 associated with a net momentum flux internal waves radiated away from the seafloor may enhance mean flow and eddies in the upper ocean shakespeare and hogg 2019 studies on the pseudo momentum flux lead to the non acceleration theorem andrews and mcintyre 1976 which states that in the sense of time mean internal waves cannot exchange energy with background mean flow in the absence of nonlinearity and dissipation enhanced dissipation by shelf breaks and submarine canyons may provide an opportunity to investigate whether internal waves can induce an effective mean flow previous studies mostly focused on long and individual canyons either using realistic bathymetry e g kunze et al 2002 lee et al 2009 waterhouse et al 2017 or idealized representation e g zhang et al 2014 nazarian and legg 2017a b but the joint effects of a group of submarine canyons are rarely investigated in addition the submarine canyons investigated in previous studies are usually at a length scale of 10 100 km long and 1 10 km wide while most submarine canyons in the global continental shelves are short and narrow harris et al 2014 high resolution topography required to resolve such submarine canyons is scarce for example a recent geological survey li et al 2016b in the northern south china sea using the multibeam echosounder discovered 17 slope confined submarine canyons shenhu submarine canyon group fig 1 they are located in water depths of 300 2000 m their lengths range from 17 to 35 km with approximately 7 km spacing each of them is on a much smaller scale than most studied submarine canyons such as monterey canyon moreover they are also not resolved by the state of the art global bathymetry products commonly used in the oceanographic community for instance the shuttle radar topography mission srtm bathymetric product has a resolution of 30 but its effective topographic resolution is coarser than 10 km in many parts of the global ocean where singlebeam or multibeam acoustic soundings are sparse or unavailable becker et al 2009 smith and sandwell 1997 fig 1c shows the topography of the shenhu area extracted from the srtm dataset which shows no submarine canyons a fake ridge on the continental slope is derived from an abnormal ship sounding 60 100 difference of internal tide generation was found comparative simulations with and without consideration of small scale abyssal hills in the mid atlantic ridge and east pacific rise melet et al 2013 and we speculate that similar effects may occur with submarine canyons therefore the impacts of submarine canyons and accuracy of estimated mixing based on current bathymetry products should be re evaluated not only do the internal waves in the shenhu area include internal tides and internal solitary waves propagating from luzon strait but also internal tides generated locally by the shelf break and submarine canyons few in situ observations of internal waves in this area are available so far a high resolution synoptic survey inside the 17 submarine canyons is still not financially feasible at the moment alternatively a very high resolution numerical model which can fully resolve the submarine canyons is employed solely focusing on the local internal tide generation and propagation in the shenhu area through investigating the energy balance and momentum budget we are aimed to understand the contribution of a group of submarine canyons rather than a single one to local mixing and its role in transporting materials internal tides or internal solitary waves arriving from luzon strait will be investigated in the near future after some fundamental local dynamics of internal tides are understood in this paper the model configuration and parameters are introduced in section 2 energy balance and a momentum budget related to internal tide generation in the shenhu area are demonstrated and analyzed in sections 3 and 4 respectively discussions and potential applications are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model configurations the stanford unstructured nonhydrostatic terrain following adaptive navier stokes simulator suntans fringer et al 2006 is employed to numerically analyze the generation and propagation of internal tides in the shenhu area the model numerically

the reference density ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 the horizontal and vertical viscosity coefficients ν h and ν v and the diffusion coefficients k h and k v are all assumed to be constant in the model the equation of state is based on a polynomial function of absolute salinity and conservative temperature roquet et al 2015 provided by the gibbs seawater oceanographic toolbox http www teos 10 org mcdougall and barker 2011 the model runs in a rectangular domain covering the shenhu area fig 1 unstructured grids are implemented to achieve very high resolution in order to resolve the fine topographic features of the shenhu submarine canyon group while relatively coarse grids near the open boundary allow high computation efficiency there are in total 122 754 cells with cell size varying from 54 m in the center to 4 6 km on the open boundaries the mean distance between the voronoi points is 575 m with a standard deviation of 738 m a 50 km sponge layer is implemented on the open boundaries to prevent boundary reflection of internal waves the time step is 6 s satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition barotropic tides are imposed on the open boundaries to generate internal tides using the tidal constituents extracted from the tpxo a global tidal model with data assimilation of satellite observations egbert and erofeeva 2002 the initial stratification for the internal tide generation model is horizontally uniform and the vertical profile is specified from the averaged ctd measurements during historical cruises in the south china sea farmer et al 2009 to better understand the effects of internal waves a comparative test is carried out in which the temperature and salinity are both uniform thus only the barotropic tides exist in the model in order to distinguish these two scenarios in the following description they are termed as the stratified and homogeneous model respectively two sets of topography data are used as the bottom boundary one is extracted from the global srtm dataset and the other is to replace the continental slope in the shenhu area from the srtm dataset by the multibeam data the submarine canyons are only resolved by the multibeam data fig 1b not by the srtm data fig 1c the internal tide generation is the most efficient at the critical or supercritical slopes i e the topographic slope s is equal to or greater than the slope of internal wave characteristics 2 α n 2 ω 2 ω 2 f 2 in which ω n and f are the tidal buoyancy and inertial frequency respectively as shown in fig 2 different critical conditions lead to different efficiency of internal tide generation i e different tidal conversion energy flux and dissipation thus it is crucial to correctly resolve the features of bathymetry the submarine canyons are only resolved by the multibeam data not by the srtm data the shelf break along the 300 500 m isobaths is a major generation site for m 2 tidal forcing since the continental slope is carved out by the submarine canyons each flank of the submarine canyons has a steep slope so that it has critical and supercritical slopes however the srtm topography resolves no critical or supercritical slopes on the continental slope except some spurious values around 115 4 e 20 n due to the fake ridge high order numerical schemes are implemented to reduce numerical diffusion the 2nd order central difference scheme is used for momentum advection and a total variation diminishing tvd scheme with the superbee limiter for the temperature and salinity advection zhang et al 2011 according to the model results the tidal flow in the region of interest is on the order of 0 05 m s 1 the internal tide generation is relatively weak and no overturns or shear instability are found in the model results so no specific turbulence closure model is employed and explicit viscosity and diffusivity are adopted in the model in addition which turbulence closure model is more suitable for internal tide simulation is still inconclusive robertson and dong 2019 using constant viscosity and diffusivity coefficients and following sensitivity experiments will provide straightforward understanding of parameterization of mixing due to internal tides the vertical and horizontal diffusion coefficients are specified as small constants k v 1 0 5 m2 s 1 and k h 1 0 4 m2 s 1 the vertical and horizontal viscosity coefficients are both constant throughout the whole domain previous studies e g nikurashin and legg 2011 kang and fringer 2012 suggested that the choices of viscosity coefficients can be in a relatively broad range without significantly affecting the results sensitivity experiments will be performed with ν v varying from 10 5 to 10 1 m2 s 1 to examine their impacts on the model results although very fine grids are used in the model the nonhydrostatic effect is still neglected owing to the small aspect ratio of simulated internal tides significantly reducing the computational cost an additional sensitivity experiment is carried out to validate that the nonhydrostatic model does not change the energy and momentum estimate in this area compared with the hydrostatic model the suntans model has been well used to simulate internal tide generation and propagation its performance was validated in several studies in the south china sea zhang et al 2011 li et al 2016a and monterey canyon jachec et al 2006 kang and fringer 2012 numerical calculation may induce high frequency noise appearing near the grid scales in some specific cases the noisy flow may form coherent structures which can affect calculations in energetics to avoid that power spectral analysis is conducted and the results suggests that the power spectra of the model velocities results not shown are well consistent with the garrett munk spectra garrett and munk 1972 and the numerically induced high frequency noise only accounts for a trivial fraction of the internal wave energy here we consider that the suntans is capable of returning reliable and meaningful results for our analysis especially when no literatures or in situ observations are available at this moment to validate our simulated baroclinic structures within the submarine canyon group the internal tides in this region include those locally generated and arrivals from luzon strait technically it is difficult to separate these two mechanisms from either numerical model results or in situ observational data however in our numerical experiment only the barotropic tidal flows are imposed on the open boundaries so that only internal tides generated locally by the shelf break and submarine canyons are simulated while the internal tides arriving from luzon strait are excluded thus it serves the main purpose of investigating the local generation energy balance and momentum budget of internal tides rather than an operational application subsequently these numerical results can be used to advise further field investigation in the studied region 2 2 velocity decomposition in order to separate the barotropic and baroclinic motions the modeled velocity u u v w is decomposed to the time independent mean flow u 0 u 0 v 0 w 0 depth independent barotropic tidal velocity u u v w and internal tide velocity u v w i e 3 u u 0 x y z u x y t u x y z t v v 0 x y z v x y t v x y z t w w 0 x y z w x y z t w x y z t the eulerian mean flow u 0 is obtained through averaged u in a wave period after 20 m 2 tidal periods the mean flow reaches a steady state and u 0 remains almost constant with time it is at least one order smaller in magnitude than either the barotropic or internal tide velocity it will be used to evaluate the volume transport in the next section and its influence on the calculation of energetics can be neglected the horizontal barotropic velocity is obtained through the depth integral 4 u 1 h h 0 u d z and v 1 h h 0 v d z in which the integral from z 0 to the sea surface elevation η is ignored the vertical barotropic velocity w is a linear function of depth and satisfies the boundary conditions at the free surface and bottom 5 w η t u η x v η y at z η u h x v h y at z h the velocity due to internal tides must satisfy the baroclinic condition 6 h 0 u d z h 0 v d z h 0 w d z 0 as well as the pressure perturbation p 7 h 0 p d z 0 3 results energy balance 3 1 theoretical equations for energetics with reference to kang and fringer 2012 the depth integrated energy flux of barotropic tides is 8 f 0 ρ 0 h u h 1 2 u h u h g η ρ 0 h ν h h 1 2 u h u h which includes the advection of barotropic kinetic energy pressure work done by barotropic tides and diffusion with the pressure work playing a dominant role its divergence represents the net energy input by the barotropic tides here u h represents the horizontal barotropic tidal velocity and g the gravity when the barotropic tides flow and reverse over irregular topography in a stratified ocean part of the barotropic tidal energy is converted to internal tides the tidal conversion rate is 9 c p z h w p z h u h h h indicating the rate of pressure work done by barotropic tides on baroclinic tides here the angle brackets represent the wave period average part of the generated internal tides radiates away and the rest dissipates locally the depth integrated baroclinic energy flux indicates the energy 10 f p u u h e k e p ν h e k κ h e p in which e k and e p are the kinetic and available potential energy density respectively and the overbar denotes the depth integral for small amplitude waves the latter two terms on the rhs of eq 10 i e the energy advection and diffusion are usually at least one order smaller than the pressure work lamb and nguyen 2009 therefore the depth integrated baroclinic energy flux is approximated by 11 f p u in order to avoid losing high frequency motions the time averaged values are updated at each time step and then averaged every tidal period in the suntans model after 20 m 2 tidal periods the conversion rate and energy flux remain almost unchanged i e the whole system approaches a steady state and the energy balance is approximately achieved in the period average sense the conversion rate and energy flux averaged in the 30th m 2 period will be used for energetics analysis box a shown in fig 2 represents the shelf break and box b represents the continental slope and submarine canyons which will be used for regional average respectively the dashed line inside box b separates the submarine canyons to the west and east groups which have different tidal conversions the viscosity coefficients are prescribed parameters in the model they are not necessarily the realistic values in the ocean but they are needed to incorporate unresolved sub grid dissipation that is crucial to energy balance of numerical schemes however large viscosity coefficients may induce undesirable non physical side effects kang and fringer 2012 sensitivity experiments through varying the horizontal and vertical viscosity coefficients are employed to evaluate their roles in the energy balance 3 2 tidal conversion and energy flux the shelf break with isobath in the range 300 m to 500 m is a major site to generate internal tides consistent with the critical conditions shown in fig 2 the concave shape of submarine canyons leads the conversion rate to have alternating signs on each flank corresponding to the convergence and divergence of energy flux fig 3 the positive conversion rate on the west flank represents energy conversion from barotropic to internal tides with the reverse on the east flank this phenomenon results from the interference between locally generated and remotely incident internal tides more specifically depending on the phase difference between the bottom pressure of internal tides and barotropic tidal forcing derived from eq 9 12 c p a w a cos g p g w in which p a g p and w a g w are the amplitude and phase of pressure of internal tides and vertical velocity of barotropic tides at the bottom respectively the internal tide generation arises from the shelf break through the across shore tidal flow interacting with the bottom topography the normal to the shelf break is in the south southeast direction for simplicity it is assumed that the meridional barotropic tidal flow v is the major component to generate internal tides according to the linear theory the bottom pressure perturbation p of locally generated internal tides and the across shelf tidal flow v are in phase i e g p g v this equality is also verified from the phase relation derived from the model results shown in fig 4d and b when the generated internal tides propagate offshore the phase difference δ g between the shelf break and submarine canyons is determined by the wave speed of internal tides since the length of submarine canyons is much greater than their width the vertical barotropic velocity is approximately determined by the zonal gradient of topography alone i e 13 w u h x v h y u h x so the phase g w is approximately equal to g u π and g u on the west and east flank respectively this phase relation between g w and g u is verified in fig 4c and a respectively thus the phase lag between p and w above the submarine canyon becomes 14 g p g w g v g u δ g π on the west flank g v g u δ g on the east flank apparently the phase difference g p g w is out of phase between the west and east flank here we only consider the dominant 1st mode internal waves if the submarine canyon is close to the shelf break the phase difference δ g due to internal tide propagation is small so the phase lag 14 is primarily determined by the tidal current phase lag g v g u which is related to the rotational direction of tidal ellipse previous numerical experiments for a single submarine canyon by zhang et al 2014 also proved that it is the rotation of tidal flow which causes the alternating signs of conversion rate here not only does this simple analysis explain this argument but can also be used to determine in which flank the conversion rate is positive or negative as shown in fig 4e the tidal ellipse rotates clockwise above the submarine canyons so the conversion rate is positive on the west flank and negative on the east flank petruncio et al 2002 suggested that the earth s rotation causes the asymmetric conversion the coriolis effect may affect the rotation of tidal flow but it is not a direct factor to determine the sign of conversion rates the offshore energy flux of internal tides is almost along the submarine canyons fig 3a it is greater above the west group of submarine canyons primarily due to the strong internal tide generation from the shelf break in the deep basin the energy flux steers towards the east owing to the refraction caused by varying depth previous studies found asymmetric energy flux radiating onshore zhang et al 2014 it is related to asymmetric conversion rate on the two flanks for shenhu submarine canyon group the canyon flanks are almost perpendicular to the shelf break therefore the energy flux radiated from the canyon flanks is nearly along the continental slope so that the asymmetry in onshore energy flux is not obvious in our case the viscosity coefficients are prescribed parameters which may influence the energetics of internal tides in the model the numerical experiments reveal that the conversion rate and energy flux are not sensitive to the horizontal viscosity coefficient ν h but they both decrease with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v fig 5 the variation is especially apparent for large ν v for example the total conversion rate and baroclinic energy radiation decrease 13 and 17 respectively as ν v increases from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the conversion and baroclinic energy radiation remain almost constant given relatively small vertical viscosity coefficients for example ν v 1 0 3 10 4 and 10 5 m2 s 1 the impact of viscosity on the conversion is consistent with the prediction of a linear analytical model provided by shakespeare et al 2021 in that the dissipation always reduces the internal tide generation unless the water depth is infinite modal formation due to surface reflection enhances the conversion whereas the dissipation controls how much internal wave energy emitted from the bottom can reach the surface to form resonant modes 3 3 dissipation the depth integrated baroclinic energy dissipation rate can be inferred as the difference between the local conversion rate and divergence of the baroclinic energy flux 15 ɛ i c h f the area averaged dissipation rate is 7 19 10 4 w m 2 on the shelf break box a in fig 2 and 1 21 10 3 w m 2 on the continental slope box b more specifically the group of submarine canyons west of 115 2 e induces a dissipation rate of 1 54 10 3 w m 2 and the eastern group 9 34 10 4 w m 2 in the comparative case using the srtm topography the dissipation rate on the shelf break 6 67 10 4 w m 2 is equivalent to that with the multibeam topography however the dissipation rate on the continental slope 6 96 10 4 w m 2 is 43 reduced if the dissipation due to the fake ridge is excluded the latter dissipation rate is further reduced to 6 03 10 4 w m 2 this comparison highlights the remarkable role of submarine canyons in the energy dissipation of internal tides interestingly except a noticeable increase from 8 45 10 4 w m 2 to 1 58 10 3 w m 2 as ν v increases from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the inferred energy dissipation rate is not sensitive to the vertical viscosity coefficient ν v either on the shelf break fig 5d or that above the submarine canyons fig 5e the inferred dissipation includes the interior dissipation due to velocity shears dissipation caused by bottom drag and numerical effect the latter one includes diffusions related to advection schemes and numerical errors both of which are difficult to evaluate directly the interior dissipation rate can be calculated directly from the model 16 ɛ m ρ 0 ν h h u h u ν v u z u z the interior dissipation due to the vertical viscosity is usually one or two orders of magnitude greater than that due to the horizontal viscosity so the vertical viscosity is dominant the bottom panels of fig 5 show that ɛ m monotonically increases with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v for small ν v ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 their relationship is approximately linear i e one order of magnitude change of ν v causes roughly one order of magnitude increase or decrease of the interior dissipation meanwhile increasing viscosity coefficients inhibits the generation of high wavenumber fluctuations hence reducing velocity shears and overall dissipation the joint effect of increasing ν v and decreasing shear reduces the rate of the interior dissipation increase with ν v this effect is especially apparent for large ν v the bottom drag is another factor causing energy dissipation the dissipation rates due to the baroclinic bottom drag are given by 17 d ρ 0 c d u h u u v v w 2 at z h c d 0 0025 is a commonly used bottom drag coefficient the bottom panels in fig 5 show that d decreases with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v opposite to the interior dissipation ɛ m it is close to a constant if small viscosity coefficients are applied ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 for ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 d drops rapidly with increasing ν v owing to reduced bottom flow it is noted that the bottom drag may not be fully resolved in the model since the bottom grid is greater than the thickness of bottom boundary layers for example the vertical grid size is 34 m near the 1000 m depth while the estimated bottom boundary layer is only several meters for ν v 1 0 3 m2 s 1 relevant turbulence closure models for bottom boundary layers exist large et al 1994 burchard et al 2008 but need substantial empirical inputs to determine the dimensionless constants trowbridge and lentz 2018 instead we ran an additional model to increase the vertical resolution to 500 vertically uniform layers to examine the impact of bottom boundary layers the corresponding vertical grid size is reduced to 7 9 m even though this is still not fine enough to resolve the bottom boundary layer it is already the limit of our computation and storage the obtained dissipations due to the bottom drag shown as the red solid diamonds in the bottom panels of fig 5 are greater than those with 100 layers but less than a factor of 2 5 this does not substantially change the energetics analysis the interior dissipation prevails for large ν v ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 while the bottom drag becomes dominant for small ν v in total the modeled dissipation which is the sum of d and ɛ m increases with increasing viscosity coefficient as the inverted triangles shown in the middle panels of fig 5 the discrepancies between the modeled and inferred dissipation likely arise from the numerical diffusions and errors in fig 5d the modeled dissipation is slightly greater than the inferred one as ν v 1 0 1 m2 s 1 this is related to the approximation used to calculate energy flux 11 in which the ignored diffusion terms i e the last two terms in eq 10 so that the divergence of baroclinic energy flux is overestimated this overestimate becomes apparent for large ν v compared with the modeled dissipation which is highly sensitive to the viscosity coefficients the inferred dissipation is nearly independent on the dissipation parameters so it is preferred in the energetic analysis to ensure a closure of energy balance the scales of conversion rate and divergence of energy flux are not sensitive to ν v as well therefore ν v 1 0 3 m2 s 1 is used in the following energetic analysis 3 4 the overall energy balance and comparison with the srtm topography when the multibeam topography is used the total energy input by barotropic tides to the shelf break box a in fig 2 and continental slope box b is 31 4 mw of which 22 9 mw 73 of the total energy is converted to internal tides and the rest 8 5 mw 27 dissipates through internal tides 18 5 mw energy 59 radiates away and 4 4 mw 14 dissipates locally the dissipation due to barotropic tides is almost twice that of internal tides overall 41 of the total input energy dissipates in this region contributing to local mixing more specifically on the shelf break 10 6 mw energy is converted from barotropic to baroclinic tides and 0 4 mw energy of internal tides dissipates while 12 3 mw energy is converted and 4 0 mw dissipates on the continental slope the tidal conversion is equivalent between the shelf break and continental slope even though the area of the shelf break is only 16 of the continental slope the west and east group of submarine canyons have different properties in the energetics the tidal conversion is 9 4 mw and 2 8 mw on the west and east group respectively and the corresponding dissipation is 2 3 mw and 1 7 mw respectively the energetics on the west group of submarine canyons are obviously more active than those on the east group the srtm topography does not resolve the submarine canyons on the continental slope in this case 29 0 mw energy in total is input by barotropic tides of that 22 0 mw 76 of the total energy is converted to internal tides roughly equivalent to the multibeam case the dissipation is 7 0 mw 24 due to barotropic tides and 2 7 mw 9 due to internal tides the barotropic dissipation is roughly equal to the multibeam case but the baroclinic dissipation is significantly reduced on the shelf break the conversion rate 11 4 mw and energy flux divergence 11 0 mw are both greater than those with the multibeam topography but their dissipations are roughly equal on the continental slope the conversion rate 10 6 mw is smaller while the energy flux divergence 8 3 mw is approximately equal as a result the dissipation is 2 3 mw 43 smaller than that with the multibeam topography if the contribution of the fake ridge is excluded the internal tide dissipation on the continental slope is even further reduced to 1 9 mw these comparisons suggest that the incised submarine canyons on the continental slope do not change the internal tides radiated away from the shelf break and continental slope most of which are low mode waves their main function is to excite high wavenumber or short wavelength internal waves which dissipate locally considering that in reality a huge amount of internal tide energy originates from luzon strait alford et al 2015 the dissipation induced by the submarine canyons can be more significant this phenomenon greatly depends on the length scale of submarine canyons some large scale submarine canyons such as monterey canyon may generate considerable low mode internal waves which can propagate away 4 results momentum budgets 4 1 mean flow induced by barotropic and internal tides wave generated mean flow is of special concern because its persistence determines the distribution and migration of water properties and materials it is usually driven by nonlinear interaction between tidal movements topography density gradient wind stress or other oceanic processes pugh 1987 friction or dissipation caused by special topographic features such as headlands or sandbanks may induce additional potential vorticity thus generating eddies or circulations near coast in addition to the bottom friction vorticity conservation and tidal conversion from barotropic to internal tides become important in deep water the lagrangian mean flow is defined as 18 u v u 0 v 0 z b u n 2 b v n 2 the 1st term on the rhs is the eulerian residual current obtained through averaging local current u v over one or several tidal cycles at a fixed point in space the 2nd term on the rhs is induced by the velocity and buoyancy fluctuation due to internal waves it describes the stokes drift induced by internal waves and vanishes if the background density is homogeneous or after it is depth integrated in the simulations the velocity is averaged every m 2 tidal period to obtain the eulerian mean flow the mean flow becomes steady after 20 m 2 tidal periods averages in the 30th m 2 tidal period will be used in this section the depth integrated mean flow i e the mean volume transport is shown in fig 6 for comparison of model results with the homogeneous and stratified background density for the homogeneous case fig 6a c there is a westward mean transport along the continental slope and an eastward one along the shelf break inside each submarine canyon the residual mean transport is towards the north along the west flank and southward along the east flank forming a clockwise circulation negative vorticity in the stratified case fig 6b d the transport is enhanced in comparison with the homogeneous case it is directed towards the west along the continental slope while eastward in the deep basin approximately south of the 1500 m isobath overall there is an on shore transport on the continental slope inside each submarine canyon the transport has a similar pattern but is stronger than the homogeneous case also forming a clockwise circulation negative vorticity in addition we also observe several eddy like residual circulations with horizontal scales of 10 km on the shelf 4 2 transformed eulerian mean equation for barotropic and baroclinic tides the magnitude of the residual mean flow is in millimeters per second it satisfies a leading order balance represented by the wave period averaged and depth integrated transformed eulerian mean tem equations bühler 2014 19 f v 0 g h η x g r x h u u x v u y u z η η t b x f u 0 g h η y g r y h u v x v v y v z η η t b y the residual flow u 0 v 0 comes from the depth average of the lagrangian mean flow 18 it is equivalent to the eulerian mean velocity u 0 v 0 in the sense of depth integral because the 2nd term on the rhs of eq 18 is purely baroclinic the baroclinic pressure head 20 r z η g 1 b d z is related to the buoyancy fluctuation b caused by internal tides the 3rd term on the rhs of eqs 19 comes from the barotropic advections which are moved here as a stress term named the barotropic stress they act as a body force the 4th terms emerge from the depth integral following the leibniz integral rule according to the calculation of the model results they are much smaller than the other depth integrated ones thus neglected the last term is the divergence of pseudo momentum or eliassen palm ep flux induced by internal waves 21 b x u u u v u w f n 2 v b b y u v v v v w f n 2 u b the linear internal wave theory suggests that w b are both zero at the surface and bottom boundaries so the depth integral of the divergence of pseudo momentum flux in the z direction vanishes the depth integrated viscosity which is approximately equal to the bottom drag is too small to be considered 4 3 momentum budget we investigate the momentum balance for the barotropic and internal tides respectively in the sense of wave period average and depth integral in the homogeneous case after 20 m 2 tidal periods the acceleration of mean flow is about three orders smaller of magnitude than the coriolis force further confirming that the mean flow reaches a steady state the tem equations 19 become 22 f v 0 g h η x h u u x v u y f u 0 g h η y h u v x v v y the spatial distribution of each term is shown in fig 7 and their variations along transect a in fig 8 calculated from fig 8 the correlation coefficients between the total forces on the rhs of eq 22 and coriolis force on the lhs are 99 6 and 99 7 in the x and y directions respectively the results confirm that the major momentum budget is characterized by the geostrophic balance an onshore transport is generated along the west flank of each submarine canyon with an offshore transport along the east flank resulting in an eastward and westward coriolis force on the west and east flank respectively which are balanced by the pressure gradient due to a convex like sea surface elevation above each submarine canyon the coriolis force and sea surface slope are greater west of 115 2 e than east of 115 2 e due to steeper canyon flanks although the barotropic stress is relatively small it still shows coherence with the submarine canyons and mitigates the pressure gradient in the zonal direction it is relatively large on the shelf break and generates an offshore acceleration in the coastal region different relative importance of bottom friction in shallow and deep water may introduce asymmetric advection of vorticity huthnance 1973 proposed this theory to interpret the residual circulation around sandbanks in the north sea the mean flow is under a balance between the bottom drag and the net momentum flux input by tides so the mean flow is along the isobath and its direction makes an acute angle with the tidal axis towards shallow water in our case it is the barotropic stress rather than the bottom friction that plays a role of dissipation to induce the clockwise circulation inside the submarine canyons referring to the orientation of tidal ellipses shown in fig 4e the intersection angle between the tidal axis and isobath generates a northward mean flow on the west flank and a southward mean flow on the east flank in the across shore direction the rotation becomes important due to the relative long length scale of continental slope the potential vorticity conservation can also induce a westward along shore mean flow in addition to the asymmetric advection of vorticity by the barotropic tides compared with the homogeneous case the momentum balance in the stratified case includes two additional terms the baroclinic pressure gradient due to disturbed stratification and divergence of the pseudo momentum flux both of which are related to internal waves the depth integrated tem equations now read 23 f v 0 g h η x g r x h u u x v u y b x f u 0 g h η y g r y h u v x v v y b y each term in eq 23 is averaged in the 30th m 2 tidal period and shown in figs 9 and 10 and their variations along transect a are shown in fig 11 the depth integrated barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradients fig 9 are both greater than the barotropic pressure gradient in the homogeneous case fig 7c d the barotropic pressure gradient is directly related to the mean sea surface elevation which is high offshore and low onshore however the mean sea surface reveals no coherence with the submarine canyons this is different from the homogeneous case in which the convex like stripes of sea surface elevation are parallel to the submarine canyons this incoherence is owing to that beneath the surface the barotropic pressure due to the sea surface elevation is counteracted by the baroclinic pressure due to the stratification perturbation by internal waves fig 9c d after adding the total pressure gradient fig 9e f reveals a coherent pattern with the submarine canyons the pressure gradient directs towards west on the west flank of each submarine canyon and east on the east flank it is onshore on the shelf and in the deep basin while a weak offshore pressure gradient appears on the continental slope the barotropic stress fig 10c d shares a similar pattern as that in the homogeneous case but it is much smaller than divergence of pseudo momentum flux induced by internal tides fig 10e f they result from the nonlinear effects of barotropic and baroclinic tides respectively acting as a body drag to rectify the momentum in the zonal direction the pseudo momentum flux of internal tides is convergent on the west flank of submarine canyons and divergent on the east flank mitigating the corresponding pressure gradient force in the momentum budget in the meridional direction the pseudo momentum flux is generally divergent tending to drive a westward along shore mean transport in the stratified case the formation mechanism of mean transport is similar to the homogeneous case the irregular topography converts energy from barotropic tides to internal tides high mode internal tides dissipate locally due to their short wavelength this reinforces the local dissipation as well as the asymmetric advection of vorticity thus forming similar patterns as the homogeneous case but with increased magnitudes the sum of the force terms on the rhs of eq 23 is not exactly equal to the coriolis force on the lhs fig 11 their correlation coefficients are 77 5 and 79 2 in the meridional and zonal directions respectively the discrepancy is related to low frequency perturbations due to baroclinic adjustment on the one hand and computational errors in post processing on the other especially the interpolation from the staggered unstructured grids and the calculation of differentials 4 4 vertical structure of mean flow and pseudo momentum flux the effect of topography is mainly reflected in the vertical distributions of momentums fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of the lagrangian mean flows along transect a in the stratified case they are all intensified in about 100 m above the bottom either for the multibeam or srtm topography here the internal radius of deformation is much greater than the tidal excursion this is in line with conclusions of maas and zimmerman 1989a b that depth dependent vortex stretching due to internal waves and depth dependent nonlinear advection drive the near bottom residual circulation whereas small amplitude topography is assumed in contrast the residual flow is vertically uniform in the homogeneous case the topography affects the vertical structure of mean flow as well if the continental slope is carved out by the submarine canyons i e the multibeam topography is used in the model there is a noticeable westward mean flow near the bottom which is intensified inside a 100 m bottom layer above the submarine canyons its magnitude can reach more than 1 cm s 1 if the continental slope is relatively smooth i e the srtm topography is used the mean flow is also bottom intensified but with strong vertical shear that includes an eastward mean flow near the bottom and a westward one above this structure is related to the zero heat flux on the bottom boundary which requires the isotherms to intersection with the bottom at a right angle thus forming convex isotherm displacements in the meridional direction and generating the above bottom flow pattern under the constraint of the thermal wind relation meanwhile a clockwise mean circulation is found near the top of the fake ridge large values of each momentum component are along the characteristics of generated internal waves which emit from the critical slopes on the seafloor fig 13 strong shear along the internal wave beams causes strong dissipation and so can lead to non zero divergence of momentum flux and generate mean flows as predicted by the non acceleration theorem andrews and mcintyre 1976 bühler 2014 the momentum in the west of 115 2 e is greater than that in the east consistent with the intensity of internal tide generation from a perspective of momentum balance both the pressure gradient and divergence of pseudo momentum flux have a southward component against the coriolis force so as to maintain the westward mean flow inside the submarine canyons the momentum components are even one order of magnitude greater than those in the interior owing to strong interference between internal wave characteristics li et al 2019 this forms a clockwise mean circulation near the bottom of each submarine canyon i e the bottom mean flow goes offshore along the east flank but onshore along the west flank the mean flow can reach more than 2 cm s 1 which may significantly influence the material transport such as sediments or nutrients as well as the geomorphology and evolution of submarine canyons on a long time scale the momentums are weakly intensified in a thin surface layer it is estimated that the mean pseudo momentum fluxes in the top 5 layers approximately 43 m thick in total can impose a mean surface stress above the continental slope of 0 3 n m 2 which is equivalent to the surface stress caused by 13 m s 1 wind according to the bulk formula provided by large and pond 1981 this stress is balanced by the coriolis force and surface pressure gradient driving the mean surface flow in the stratified case the mean surface flow has a spatial scale of 10 20 km and shows no correlation with the submarine canyons however in the homogeneous case the surface and interior mean flow is almost horizontally uniform implying barotropic control by the topography 5 summary and discussion internal tide generation and propagation are sensitive to irregular topography the multibeam survey li et al 2016b disclosed 17 submarine canyons in the shenhu area with length from 17 to 35 km and a regular spacing of 7 km these submarine canyons are not recorded in the high resolution topography datasets commonly used by the oceanography community such as srtm etopo1 etc the numerical simulations with the multibeam and srtm topography reveal different energy balance and momentum budgets during the internal tide generation and propagation in addition to the submarine canyons the multibeam detected undulating bedforms which make the sea floor even rougher these undulating bedforms are extremely irregular with a length scale ranging in kilometers and a height of tens of meters they are not resolved in the suntans model due to the coarse vertical grids near the bottom boundary their roles in internal tide generation and propagation remain unknown in order to resolve these submarine canyons very high resolution meshes are used above the submarine canyons and unstructured grids to speed up numerical simulation different from previous analyses in which the most energetic internal tides originate offshore and propagate into the submarine canyons e g petruncio et al 1998 kunze et al 2002 alberty et al 2017 waterhouse et al 2017 nazarian et al 2021 etc only locally generated internal tides are simulated in the shenhu area internal tides arriving from the remaining regions in the south china sea such as luzon strait dongsha atoll etc are excluded when the multibeam topography is used 76 22 9 mw of the energy input by barotropic tides is converted to internal tides and 14 4 4 mw is lost due to internal tide dissipations that is to say 19 of energy is lost from locally generated internal tides this dissipation efficiency is almost triple that for remotely generated internal tides incident on submarine canyons viz 3 2 7 8 as estimated by nazarian et al 2021 the local energy loss corresponds to a averaged dissipation rate of 1 2 10 9 w kg 1 it is larger than the background dissipation rate in the open ocean 10 10 10 12 w kg 1 scheifele et al 2018 but it is one or two orders smaller than those in other submarine canyons for instance 4 2 10 8 w kg 1 in the eel canyon waterhouse et al 2017 3 3 10 8 w kg 1 in the la jolla canyon hamann et al 2021 2 10 7 2 10 8 w kg 1 in monterey canyon wain et al 2013 etc as locally generated internal tides are one order weaker than those incident from offshore to the above submarine canyons the incident energy flux to the continental slope by the internal tides generated from luzon strait is 10 kw m 1 which is about 20 times stronger than the local generated one the local maximum energy flux is 0 5 kw m 1 so it is anticipated that the total dissipation caused by shenhu submarine canyon group can reach a similar level as the above submarine canyons the dissipation rate is also spatially dependent it can reach 10 8 w kg 1 or even higher on the shelf break near the canyon head or in the bottom layers when the srtm topography is used 76 of barotropic tidal energy is converted to internal tides and the averaged dissipation rate induced by internal tides drops to 0 8 10 9 w kg 1 this is opposite to the results of elmes et al 2022 in that the submarine canyon reduces the dissipation this is probably related to their two layer model in which the effects of critical and supercritical slopes cannot be resolved it is noted that the estimation for the srtm topography includes the influence of a fake ridge which comes from an abnormal ship sounding and does not exist in the real ocean but the dissipation due to the fake ridge only accounts for a small fraction of the total dissipation in the region of interest it should also be noticed in particular that the tidal dissipation is constrained by the tidal flow defined on the open boundaries which is a caveat of regional models expanding the boundaries to include the whole northern south china sea is anticipated in the future to re evaluate the energy balance in this region the energetics derived from this numerical model with very high resolution can be a useful reference for the parameterization of tidal mixing the dissipation rate estimated by de lavergne et al 2020 in this region 115 e 20 n is 1 10 8 w kg 1 which includes both locally generated and arriving internal tides remotely forced by three major tidal constituents m 2 s 2 and k 1 their estimated dissipation is composed of four types of energy sinks which are wave wave interaction of low mode waves wave breaking through shoaling low mode wave dissipation at critical slopes and low mode wave scattering and high mode wave generation due to rough sea floor all of them are sensitive to topography the spatial resolution in de larvergne et al s estimate is 0 5 which cannot resolve the 17 submarine canyons in this region our regional model has revealed a 50 difference of dissipation rates between the multibeam and srtm topography besides p1 in the deep basin is 135 km from p2 on the submarine canyons approximately two wavelengths of the 1st mode m 2 internal tides the corresponding energy flux is reduced by 88 from p2 to p1 for the 1st mode internal tides and the high modes almost all disappear at p1 table 1 these imply a far smaller decay length scale than those assumed in their parameterization method de lavergne et al 2020 high resolution numerical models with sufficient bathymetry resolution are required to assist in improving parameterization schemes although high performance computation is a hindrance so far mean or residual currents due to tidal rectification are well known in shallow water near the coast the mean flow usually arises from asymmetric advection in a tidal cycle due to friction from bottom or lateral boundaries hunt and johns 1963 longuet higgins 1970 huthnance 1973 loder 1980 here the barotropic stress due to irregular topography acting as a form drag plays a dissipative role to balance the asymmetric advection of vorticity the magnitude of the residual circulation is dependent on the ratio between the topographic scale and the tidal excursion clockwise circulations are formed inside the submarine canyons whereas the residual flow is feeble along the shelf break and the continental slope stratification enhances the dissipative effect the model results reveal an apparent divergence of pseudo momentum flux due to the generated internal tides as a result the depth integrated residual currents are reinforced in the stratified case it is a baroclinic response due to depth dependent vortex stretching and advection by internal waves a notable feature of the internal tide rectification is the bottom trapped or intensified mean flow maas and zimmerman 1989b which is also exhibited in the model results a mooring observation on the continental slope which is about 300 km east from shenhu area discovered an intensified westward along shore flow 0 15 m s 1 in a 100 m bottom layer xie et al 2018 the authors attribute this to the internal tide breaking however direct breaking due to shear instability i e the richardson number is less than 0 25 not shown is not found in our model results relatively apparent mean flows 5 mm s 1 are also found along the internal wave characteristics and inside a thin surface layer the estimated mean momentum flux input to the sea surface is 0 3 n m 2 equivalent to stress from a sea surface wind of 13 m s 1 if this is the case the actual contributions of internal wave momentum flux to mesoscale eddies and basin scale circulation are worth further investigation pinkel et al 2012 slope confined submarine canyons are major channels for sediments to be transported to the abyssal seabed they can also trap turbidite sands and form oil and gas reservoirs their formation and evolution result from several geological processes including erosion slumping and landslides all of which are related to the hydraulic conditions in the ocean as a ubiquitous hydrodynamical phenomenon occurring near irregular bathymetry the contributions of internal tides are still unknown even though the mean flow generated by internal tides is weak its long term impact should not be underestimated abundant sediments are carried downstream from the pearl river delta to the deep basin through shenhu submarine canyon group the bottom intensified clockwise mean flow decelerates downstream sediment transport on the west flanks of the submarine canyons but accelerates it on the east flanks hence reinforcing sediment deposition on the west flank and sediment erosion on the east flank this effect may be related to the present morphological feature of the submarine canyons which have narrower and steeper east flanks than the west ones li et al 2016b this may also cause an eastward migration of the submarine canyons on the geological time scale as found from seismic profiles su et al 2020 taking 115 2 e as a dividing line the general morphological features such as the head depth maximum canyon relief channel width etc are significantly different between east and west coincident with the regionally different intensity of internal tide generation whether or how internal tides modify the geomorphic features of submarine canyons is worth a future study with a combination of morphological and hydrodynamic models credit authorship contribution statement qiang li methodology software

23801,a field multibeam survey discovered a group of regularly spaced submarine canyons on the continental shelf in the northern south china sea however they are not included in the bathymetry datasets commonly used by the oceanographic community in this study we employ a very high resolution as fine as 54 m numerical model that resolves these submarine canyons to investigate their impacts on the local internal tide generation and propagation results show that the barotropic to internal tidal conversion rate exhibits an alternating distribution on each flank of submarine canyons rotational direction of the tidal flow determines a positive conversion rate on the west flank and a negative rate on the east flank the rough seafloor due to the submarine canyons does not appreciably change the dissipation of barotropic tides but significantly affects the dissipation of internal tides leading to an averaged dissipation rate of 1 2 10 9 w kg 1 internal tides also induce a bottom intensified mean flow which causes westward mean transport on the continental slope and a clockwise circulation inside each submarine canyon the mean flow satisfies a momentum budget between the coriolis force pressure gradient and divergence of momentum flux of barotropic and internal tides we highlight that the divergence of the pseudo momentum flux of internal tides acts as a stress and is especially reinforced near the sea bottom and surface its effect on the sea surface is even comparable with moderate winds 13 m s 1 keywords internal tides energy balance momentum flux shenhu submarine canyon group suntans data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction submarine canyons are one of the most common morphological features on continental slopes they are associated with various oceanic phenomena that link the shelves and deep ocean canyons are hotspots with enhanced mixing in the global ocean and are believed to be related to dissipation or breaking of internal waves kunze et al 2002 not only are canyons a source of locally generated internal waves but also a sink of internal waves arriving from the remote deep ocean about 10 of continental slopes are carved out by submarine canyons therefore it is important to understand their influence on ocean stratification and circulation as well as their subsequent effects on nutrient cycles biological productivity and sediment transport internal waves are sensitive to specific geometry of submarine canyons especially their flank steepness and aspect ratio nazarian and legg 2017a b steep flanks are favorable for high mode internal wave generation and the v shaped topography may converge internal wave energy hence leading to strong energy dissipation and diapycnal mixing especially near the canyon head kunze et al 2002 on continental slopes incised canyons also cause complex reflection and transmission of remotely incident internal waves internal wave energy may be trapped near the canyon bottom due to supercritical reflection from steep canyon flanks gordon and marshall 1976 recent observations revealed bottom trapped diurnal internal tides inside the eel canyon waterhouse et al 2017 submarine canyons are important sinks to maintain the energy balance of the global ocean energy losses are more than 100 w in the most commonly studied submarine canyons such as monterey canyon eel canyon la jolla canyon gaoping canyon etc petruncio et al 1998 wain et al 2013 waterhouse et al 2017 alberty et al 2017 lee et al 2009 according to the energy loss estimated from the observations in monterey canyon a crude extrapolation to global dissipation in submarine canyons is about 15 gw for the m 2 internal tides a more precise estimate using simplified geometry models of submarine canyons suggests that 15 gw may be an underestimate nazarian et al 2021 their estimate gives an energy loss of 30 8 75 3 gw accounting for 3 2 7 8 of the total energy of global m 2 internal tides it is in a wide range because their method relates to the geometric properties of submarine canyons and seasonal stratification nevertheless 20 of the m 2 internal tide energy dissipates over continental shelves and their adjacent slopes de lavergne et al 2019 so the submarine canyons actually account for a large fraction of local energy dissipation the above estimates only consider the incoming internal tides locally generated internal tides and interactions with large scale circulations may induce additional dissipation therefore in order to accurately assess the global energy dissipation and oceanic mixing individual studies focusing on specific submarine canyons including high resolution models and refined field observation are necessary in addition to general global estimates interaction between internal waves and mean flow has not yet been fully resolved the pseudo momentum flux also called the eliassen palm ep flux eliassen and palm 1961 is an important concept in atmospheric science its divergence acts as wave forcing on the atmospheric circulation meteorologists have used the ep flux to explain various atmospheric phenomena such as the stratospheric circulation miyahara et al 1993 stratospheric sudden warming matsuno 1971a b quasi biennial cycle of the tropical stratosphere holton and lindzen 1972 etc however the role of internal wave momentum flux in the ocean is not well understood no significant vertical flux of horizontal momentum is found in the open ocean ruddick and joyce 1979 brown and owens 1981 plueddemann 1987 polzin 2008 probably owing to exchanged energy cancellation between surface and bottom reflections of internal waves olbers and eden 2017 however recent theoretical and numerical works reveal its potential contribution in wave mean flow interaction muench and kunze 1999 speculated that the pseudo momentum flux of internal waves may play a role in sustaining equatorial deep jets for superinertial tidal forcing both the propagating and locally dissipating internal tides can impose a drag on the mean flow and for sub inertial tidal forcing bottom trapped internal tides are generated and significantly damp the barotropic tides as well shakespeare et al 2020 associated with a net momentum flux internal waves radiated away from the seafloor may enhance mean flow and eddies in the upper ocean shakespeare and hogg 2019 studies on the pseudo momentum flux lead to the non acceleration theorem andrews and mcintyre 1976 which states that in the sense of time mean internal waves cannot exchange energy with background mean flow in the absence of nonlinearity and dissipation enhanced dissipation by shelf breaks and submarine canyons may provide an opportunity to investigate whether internal waves can induce an effective mean flow previous studies mostly focused on long and individual canyons either using realistic bathymetry e g kunze et al 2002 lee et al 2009 waterhouse et al 2017 or idealized representation e g zhang et al 2014 nazarian and legg 2017a b but the joint effects of a group of submarine canyons are rarely investigated in addition the submarine canyons investigated in previous studies are usually at a length scale of 10 100 km long and 1 10 km wide while most submarine canyons in the global continental shelves are short and narrow harris et al 2014 high resolution topography required to resolve such submarine canyons is scarce for example a recent geological survey li et al 2016b in the northern south china sea using the multibeam echosounder discovered 17 slope confined submarine canyons shenhu submarine canyon group fig 1 they are located in water depths of 300 2000 m their lengths range from 17 to 35 km with approximately 7 km spacing each of them is on a much smaller scale than most studied submarine canyons such as monterey canyon moreover they are also not resolved by the state of the art global bathymetry products commonly used in the oceanographic community for instance the shuttle radar topography mission srtm bathymetric product has a resolution of 30 but its effective topographic resolution is coarser than 10 km in many parts of the global ocean where singlebeam or multibeam acoustic soundings are sparse or unavailable becker et al 2009 smith and sandwell 1997 fig 1c shows the topography of the shenhu area extracted from the srtm dataset which shows no submarine canyons a fake ridge on the continental slope is derived from an abnormal ship sounding 60 100 difference of internal tide generation was found comparative simulations with and without consideration of small scale abyssal hills in the mid atlantic ridge and east pacific rise melet et al 2013 and we speculate that similar effects may occur with submarine canyons therefore the impacts of submarine canyons and accuracy of estimated mixing based on current bathymetry products should be re evaluated not only do the internal waves in the shenhu area include internal tides and internal solitary waves propagating from luzon strait but also internal tides generated locally by the shelf break and submarine canyons few in situ observations of internal waves in this area are available so far a high resolution synoptic survey inside the 17 submarine canyons is still not financially feasible at the moment alternatively a very high resolution numerical model which can fully resolve the submarine canyons is employed solely focusing on the local internal tide generation and propagation in the shenhu area through investigating the energy balance and momentum budget we are aimed to understand the contribution of a group of submarine canyons rather than a single one to local mixing and its role in transporting materials internal tides or internal solitary waves arriving from luzon strait will be investigated in the near future after some fundamental local dynamics of internal tides are understood in this paper the model configuration and parameters are introduced in section 2 energy balance and a momentum budget related to internal tide generation in the shenhu area are demonstrated and analyzed in sections 3 and 4 respectively discussions and potential applications are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model configurations the stanford unstructured nonhydrostatic terrain

of state is based on a polynomial function of absolute salinity and conservative temperature roquet et al 2015 provided by the gibbs seawater oceanographic toolbox http www teos 10 org mcdougall and barker 2011 the model runs in a rectangular domain covering the shenhu area fig 1 unstructured grids are implemented to achieve very high resolution in order to resolve the fine topographic features of the shenhu submarine canyon group while relatively coarse grids near the open boundary allow high computation efficiency there are in total 122 754 cells with cell size varying from 54 m in the center to 4 6 km on the open boundaries the mean distance between the voronoi points is 575 m with a standard deviation of 738 m a 50 km sponge layer is implemented on the open boundaries to prevent boundary reflection of internal waves the time step is 6 s satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition barotropic tides are imposed on the open boundaries to generate internal tides using the tidal constituents extracted from the tpxo a global tidal model with data assimilation of satellite observations egbert and erofeeva 2002 the initial stratification for the internal tide generation model is horizontally uniform and the vertical profile is specified from the averaged ctd measurements during historical cruises in the south china sea farmer et al 2009 to better understand the effects of internal waves a comparative test is carried out in which the temperature and salinity are both uniform thus only the barotropic tides exist in the model in order to distinguish these two scenarios in the following description they are termed as the stratified and homogeneous model respectively two sets of topography data are used as the bottom boundary one is extracted from the global srtm dataset and the other is to replace the continental slope in the shenhu area from the srtm dataset by the multibeam data the submarine canyons are only resolved by the multibeam data fig 1b not by the srtm data fig 1c the internal tide generation is the most efficient at the critical or supercritical slopes i e the topographic slope s is equal to or greater than the slope of internal wave characteristics 2 α n 2 ω 2 ω 2 f 2 in which ω n and f are the tidal buoyancy and inertial frequency respectively as shown in fig 2 different critical conditions lead to different efficiency of internal tide generation i e different tidal conversion energy flux and dissipation thus it is crucial to correctly resolve the features of bathymetry the submarine canyons are only resolved by the multibeam data not by the srtm data the shelf break along the 300 500 m isobaths is a major generation site for m 2 tidal forcing since the continental slope is carved out by the submarine canyons each flank of the submarine canyons has a steep slope so that it has critical and supercritical slopes however the srtm topography resolves no critical or supercritical slopes on the continental slope except some spurious values around 115 4 e 20 n due to the fake ridge high order numerical schemes are implemented to reduce numerical diffusion the 2nd order central difference scheme is used for momentum advection and a total variation diminishing tvd scheme with the superbee limiter for the temperature and salinity advection zhang et al 2011 according to the model results the tidal flow in the region of interest is on the order of 0 05 m s 1 the internal tide generation is relatively weak and no overturns or shear instability are found in the model results so no specific turbulence closure model is employed and explicit viscosity and diffusivity are adopted in the model in addition which turbulence closure model is more suitable for internal tide simulation is still inconclusive robertson and dong 2019 using constant viscosity and diffusivity coefficients and following sensitivity experiments will provide straightforward understanding of parameterization of mixing due to internal tides the vertical and horizontal diffusion coefficients are specified as small constants k v 1 0 5 m2 s 1 and k h 1 0 4 m2 s 1 the vertical and horizontal viscosity coefficients are both constant throughout the whole domain previous studies e g nikurashin and legg 2011 kang and fringer 2012 suggested that the choices of viscosity coefficients can be in a relatively broad range without significantly affecting the results sensitivity experiments will be performed with ν v varying from 10 5 to 10 1 m2 s 1 to examine their impacts on the model results although very fine grids are used in the model the nonhydrostatic effect is still neglected owing to the small aspect ratio of simulated internal tides significantly reducing the computational cost an additional sensitivity experiment is carried out to validate that the nonhydrostatic model does not change the energy and momentum estimate in this area compared with the hydrostatic model the suntans model has been well used to simulate internal tide generation and propagation its performance was validated in several studies in the south china sea zhang et al 2011 li et al 2016a and monterey canyon jachec et al 2006 kang and fringer 2012 numerical calculation may induce high frequency noise appearing near the grid scales in some specific cases the noisy flow may form coherent structures which can affect calculations in energetics to avoid that power spectral analysis is conducted and the results suggests that the power spectra of the model velocities results not shown are well consistent with the garrett munk spectra garrett and munk 1972 and the numerically induced high frequency noise only accounts for a trivial fraction of the internal wave energy here we consider that the suntans is capable of returning reliable and meaningful results for our analysis especially when no literatures or in situ observations are available at this moment to validate our simulated baroclinic structures within the submarine canyon group the internal tides in this region include those locally generated and arrivals from luzon strait technically it is difficult to separate these two mechanisms from either numerical model results or in situ observational data however in our numerical experiment only the barotropic tidal flows are imposed on the open boundaries so that only internal tides generated locally by the shelf break and submarine canyons are simulated while the internal tides arriving from luzon strait are excluded thus it serves the main purpose of investigating the local generation energy balance and momentum budget of internal tides rather than an operational application subsequently these numerical results can be used to advise further field investigation in the studied region 2 2 velocity decomposition in order to separate the barotropic and baroclinic motions the modeled velocity u u v w is decomposed to the time independent mean flow u 0 u 0 v 0 w 0 depth independent barotropic tidal velocity u u v w and internal tide velocity u v w i e 3 u u 0 x y z u x y t u x y z t v v 0 x y z v x y t v x y z t w w 0 x y z w x y z t w x y z t the eulerian mean flow u 0 is obtained through averaged u in a wave period after 20 m 2 tidal periods the mean flow reaches a steady state and u 0 remains almost constant with time it is at least one order smaller in magnitude than either the barotropic or internal tide velocity it will be used to evaluate the volume transport in the next section and its influence on the calculation of energetics can be neglected the horizontal barotropic velocity is obtained through the depth integral 4 u 1 h h 0 u d z and v 1 h h 0 v d z in which the integral from z 0 to the sea surface elevation η is ignored the vertical barotropic velocity w is a linear function of depth and satisfies the boundary conditions at the free surface and bottom 5 w η t u η x v η y at z η u h x v h y at z h the velocity due to internal tides must satisfy the baroclinic condition 6 h 0 u d z h 0 v d z h 0 w d z 0 as well as the pressure perturbation p 7 h 0 p d z 0 3 results energy balance 3 1 theoretical equations for energetics with reference to kang and fringer 2012 the depth integrated energy flux of barotropic tides is 8 f 0 ρ 0 h u h 1 2 u h u h g η ρ 0 h ν h h 1 2 u h u h which includes the advection of barotropic kinetic energy pressure work done by barotropic tides and diffusion with the pressure work playing a dominant role its divergence represents the net energy input by the barotropic tides here u h represents the horizontal barotropic tidal velocity and g the gravity when the barotropic tides flow and reverse over irregular topography in a stratified ocean part of the barotropic tidal energy is converted to internal tides the tidal conversion rate is 9 c p z h w p z h u h h h indicating the rate of pressure work done by barotropic tides on baroclinic tides here the angle brackets represent the wave period average part of the generated internal tides radiates away and the rest dissipates locally the depth integrated baroclinic energy flux indicates the energy 10 f p u u h e k e p ν h e k κ h e p in which e k and e p are the kinetic and available potential energy density respectively and the overbar denotes the depth integral for small amplitude waves the latter two terms on the rhs of eq 10 i e the energy advection and diffusion are usually at least one order smaller than the pressure work lamb and nguyen 2009 therefore the depth integrated baroclinic energy flux is approximated by 11 f p u in order to avoid losing high frequency motions the time averaged values are updated at each time step and then averaged every tidal period in the suntans model after 20 m 2 tidal periods the conversion rate and energy flux remain almost unchanged i e the whole system approaches a steady state and the energy balance is approximately achieved in the period average sense the conversion rate and energy flux averaged in the 30th m 2 period will be used for energetics analysis box a shown in fig 2 represents the shelf break and box b represents the continental slope and submarine canyons which will be used for regional average respectively the dashed line inside box b separates the submarine canyons to the west and east groups which have different tidal conversions the viscosity coefficients are prescribed parameters in the model they are not necessarily the realistic values in the ocean but they are needed to incorporate unresolved sub grid dissipation that is crucial to energy balance of numerical schemes however large viscosity coefficients may induce undesirable non physical side effects kang and fringer 2012 sensitivity experiments through varying the horizontal and vertical viscosity coefficients are employed to evaluate their roles in the energy balance 3 2 tidal conversion and energy flux the shelf break with isobath in the range 300 m to 500 m is a major site to generate internal tides consistent with the critical conditions shown in fig 2 the concave shape of submarine canyons leads the conversion rate to have alternating signs on each flank corresponding to the convergence and divergence of energy flux fig 3 the positive conversion rate on the west flank represents energy conversion from barotropic to internal tides with the reverse on the east flank this phenomenon results from the interference between locally generated and remotely incident internal tides more specifically depending on the phase difference between the bottom pressure of internal tides and barotropic tidal forcing derived from eq 9 12 c p a w a cos g p g w in which p a g p and w a g w are the amplitude and phase of pressure of internal tides and vertical velocity of barotropic tides at the bottom respectively the internal tide generation arises from the shelf break through the across shore tidal flow interacting with the bottom topography the normal to the shelf break is in the south southeast direction for simplicity it is assumed that the meridional barotropic tidal flow v is the major component to generate internal tides according to the linear theory the bottom pressure perturbation p of locally generated internal tides and the across shelf tidal flow v are in phase i e g p g v this equality is also verified from the phase relation derived from the model results shown in fig 4d and b when the generated internal tides propagate offshore the phase difference δ g between the shelf break and submarine canyons is determined by the wave speed of internal tides since the length of submarine canyons is much greater than their width the vertical barotropic velocity is approximately determined by the zonal gradient of topography alone i e 13 w u h x v h y u h x so the phase g w is approximately equal to g u π and g u on the west and east flank respectively this phase relation between g w and g u is verified in fig 4c and a respectively thus the phase lag between p and w above the submarine canyon becomes 14 g p g w g v g u δ g π on the west flank g v g u δ g on the east flank apparently the phase difference g p g w is out of phase between the west and east flank here we only consider the dominant 1st mode internal waves if the submarine canyon is close to the shelf break the phase difference δ g due to internal tide propagation is small so the phase lag 14 is primarily determined by the tidal current phase lag g v g u which is related to the rotational direction of tidal ellipse previous numerical experiments for a single submarine canyon by zhang et al 2014 also proved that it is the rotation of tidal flow which causes the alternating signs of conversion rate here not only does this simple analysis explain this argument but can also be used to determine in which flank the conversion rate is positive or negative as shown in fig 4e the tidal ellipse rotates clockwise above the submarine canyons so the conversion rate is positive on the west flank and negative on the east flank petruncio et al 2002 suggested that the earth s rotation causes the asymmetric conversion the coriolis effect may affect the rotation of tidal flow but it is not a direct factor to determine the sign of conversion rates the offshore energy flux of internal tides is almost along the submarine canyons fig 3a it is greater above the west group of submarine canyons primarily due to the strong internal tide generation from the shelf break in the deep basin the energy flux steers towards the east owing to the refraction caused by varying depth previous studies found asymmetric energy flux radiating onshore zhang et al 2014 it is related to asymmetric conversion rate on the two flanks for shenhu submarine canyon group the canyon flanks are almost perpendicular to the shelf break therefore the energy flux radiated from the canyon flanks is nearly along the continental slope so that the asymmetry in onshore energy flux is not obvious in our case the viscosity coefficients are prescribed parameters which may influence the energetics of internal tides in the model the numerical experiments reveal that the conversion rate and energy flux are not sensitive to the horizontal viscosity coefficient ν h but they both decrease with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v fig 5 the variation is especially apparent for large ν v for example the total conversion rate and baroclinic energy radiation decrease 13 and 17 respectively as ν v increases from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the conversion and baroclinic energy radiation remain almost constant given relatively small vertical viscosity coefficients for example ν v 1 0 3 10 4 and 10 5 m2 s 1 the impact of viscosity on the conversion is consistent with the prediction of a linear analytical model provided by shakespeare et al 2021 in that the dissipation always reduces the internal tide generation unless the water depth is infinite modal formation due to surface reflection enhances the conversion whereas the dissipation controls how much internal wave energy emitted from the bottom can reach the surface to form resonant modes 3 3 dissipation the depth integrated baroclinic energy dissipation rate can be inferred as the difference between the local conversion rate and divergence of the baroclinic energy flux 15 ɛ i c h f the area averaged dissipation rate is 7 19 10 4 w m 2 on the shelf break box a in fig 2 and 1 21 10 3 w m 2 on the continental slope box b more specifically the group of submarine canyons west of 115 2 e induces a dissipation rate of 1 54 10 3 w m 2 and the eastern group 9 34 10 4 w m 2 in the comparative case using the srtm topography the dissipation rate on the shelf break 6 67 10 4 w m 2 is equivalent to that with the multibeam topography however the dissipation rate on the continental slope 6 96 10 4 w m 2 is 43 reduced if the dissipation due to the fake ridge is excluded the latter dissipation rate is further reduced to 6 03 10 4 w m 2 this comparison highlights the remarkable role of submarine canyons in the energy dissipation of internal tides interestingly except a noticeable increase from 8 45 10 4 w m 2 to 1 58 10 3 w m 2 as ν v increases from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the inferred energy dissipation rate is not sensitive to the vertical viscosity coefficient ν v either on the shelf break fig 5d or that above the submarine canyons fig 5e the inferred dissipation includes the interior dissipation due to velocity shears dissipation caused by bottom drag and numerical effect the latter one includes diffusions related to advection schemes and numerical errors both of which are difficult to evaluate directly the interior dissipation rate can be calculated directly from the model 16 ɛ m ρ 0 ν h h u h u ν v u z u z the interior dissipation due to the vertical viscosity is usually one or two orders of magnitude greater than that due to the horizontal viscosity so the vertical viscosity is dominant the bottom panels of fig 5 show that ɛ m monotonically increases with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v for small ν v ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 their relationship is approximately linear i e one order of magnitude change of ν v causes roughly one order of magnitude increase or decrease of the interior dissipation meanwhile increasing viscosity coefficients inhibits the generation of high wavenumber fluctuations hence reducing velocity shears and overall dissipation the joint effect of increasing ν v and decreasing shear reduces the rate of the interior dissipation increase with ν v this effect is especially apparent for large ν v the bottom drag is another factor causing energy dissipation the dissipation rates due to the baroclinic bottom drag are given by 17 d ρ 0 c d u h u u v v w 2 at z h c d 0 0025 is a commonly used bottom drag coefficient the bottom panels in fig 5 show that d decreases with increasing vertical viscosity coefficient ν v opposite to the interior dissipation ɛ m it is close to a constant if small viscosity coefficients are applied ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 for ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 d drops rapidly with increasing ν v owing to reduced bottom flow it is noted that the bottom drag may not be fully resolved in the model since the bottom grid is greater than the thickness of bottom boundary layers for example the vertical grid size is 34 m near the 1000 m depth while the estimated bottom boundary layer is only several meters for ν v 1 0 3 m2 s 1 relevant turbulence closure models for bottom boundary layers exist large et al 1994 burchard et al 2008 but need substantial empirical inputs to determine the dimensionless constants trowbridge and lentz 2018 instead we ran an additional model to increase the vertical resolution to 500 vertically uniform layers to examine the impact of bottom boundary layers the corresponding vertical grid size is reduced to 7 9 m even though this is still not fine enough to resolve the bottom boundary layer it is already the limit of our computation and storage the obtained dissipations due to the bottom drag shown as the red solid diamonds in the bottom panels of fig 5 are greater than those with 100 layers but less than a factor of 2 5 this does not substantially change the energetics analysis the interior dissipation prevails for large ν v ν v 10 3 m2 s 1 while the bottom drag becomes dominant for small ν v in total the modeled dissipation which is the sum of d and ɛ m increases with increasing viscosity coefficient as the inverted triangles shown in the middle panels of fig 5 the discrepancies between the modeled and inferred dissipation likely arise from the numerical diffusions and errors in fig 5d the modeled dissipation is slightly greater than the inferred one as ν v 1 0 1 m2 s 1 this is related to the approximation used to calculate energy flux 11 in which the ignored diffusion terms i e the last two terms in eq 10 so that the divergence of baroclinic energy flux is overestimated this overestimate becomes apparent for large ν v compared with the modeled dissipation which is highly sensitive to the viscosity coefficients the inferred dissipation is nearly independent on the dissipation parameters so it is preferred in the energetic analysis to ensure a closure of energy balance the scales of conversion rate and divergence of energy flux are not sensitive to ν v as well therefore ν v 1 0 3 m2 s 1 is used in the following energetic analysis 3 4 the overall energy balance and comparison with the srtm topography when the multibeam topography is used the total energy input by barotropic tides to the shelf break box a in fig 2 and continental slope box b is 31 4 mw of which 22 9 mw 73 of the total energy is converted to internal tides and the rest 8 5 mw 27 dissipates through internal tides 18 5 mw energy 59 radiates away and 4 4 mw 14 dissipates locally the dissipation due to barotropic tides is almost twice that of internal tides overall 41 of the total input energy dissipates in this region contributing to local mixing more specifically on the shelf break 10 6 mw energy is converted from barotropic to baroclinic tides and 0 4 mw energy of internal tides dissipates while 12 3 mw energy is converted and 4 0 mw dissipates on the continental slope the tidal conversion is equivalent between the shelf break and continental slope even though the area of the shelf break is only 16 of the continental slope the west and east group of submarine canyons have different properties in the energetics the tidal conversion is 9 4 mw and 2 8 mw on the west and east group respectively and the corresponding dissipation is 2 3 mw and 1 7 mw respectively the energetics on the west group of submarine canyons are obviously more active than those on the east group the srtm topography does not resolve the submarine canyons on the continental slope in this case 29 0 mw energy in total is input by barotropic tides of that 22 0 mw 76 of the total energy is converted to internal tides roughly equivalent to the multibeam case the dissipation is 7 0 mw 24 due to barotropic tides and 2 7 mw 9 due to internal tides the barotropic dissipation is roughly equal to the multibeam case but the baroclinic dissipation is significantly reduced on the shelf break the conversion rate 11 4 mw and energy flux divergence 11 0 mw are both greater than those with the multibeam topography but their dissipations are roughly equal on the continental slope the conversion rate 10 6 mw is smaller while the energy flux divergence 8 3 mw is approximately equal as a result the dissipation is 2 3 mw 43 smaller than that with the multibeam topography if the contribution of the fake ridge is excluded the internal tide dissipation on the continental slope is even further reduced to 1 9 mw these comparisons suggest that the incised submarine canyons on the continental slope do not change the internal tides radiated away from the shelf break and continental slope most of which are low mode waves their main function is to excite high wavenumber or short wavelength internal waves which dissipate locally considering that in reality a huge amount of internal tide energy originates from luzon strait alford et al 2015 the dissipation induced by the submarine canyons can be more significant this phenomenon greatly depends on the length scale of submarine canyons some large scale submarine canyons such as monterey canyon may generate considerable low mode internal waves which can propagate away 4 results momentum budgets 4 1 mean flow induced by barotropic and internal tides wave generated mean flow is of special concern because its persistence determines the distribution and migration of water properties and materials it is usually driven by nonlinear interaction between tidal movements topography density gradient wind stress or other oceanic processes pugh 1987 friction or dissipation caused by special topographic features such as headlands or sandbanks may induce additional potential vorticity thus generating eddies or circulations near coast in addition to the bottom friction vorticity conservation and tidal conversion from barotropic to internal tides become important in deep water the lagrangian mean flow is defined as 18 u v u 0 v 0 z b u n 2 b v n 2 the 1st term on the rhs is the eulerian residual current obtained through averaging local current u v over one or several tidal cycles at a fixed point in space the 2nd term on the rhs is induced by the velocity and buoyancy fluctuation due to internal waves it describes the stokes drift induced by internal waves and vanishes if the background density is homogeneous or after it is depth integrated in the simulations the velocity is averaged every m 2 tidal period to obtain the eulerian mean flow the mean flow becomes steady after 20 m 2 tidal periods averages in the 30th m 2 tidal period will be used in this section the depth integrated mean flow i e the mean volume transport is shown in fig 6 for comparison of model results with the homogeneous and stratified background density for the homogeneous case fig 6a c there is a westward mean transport along the continental slope and an eastward one along the shelf break inside each submarine canyon the residual mean transport is towards the north along the west flank and southward along the east flank forming a clockwise circulation negative vorticity in the stratified case fig 6b d the transport is enhanced in comparison with the homogeneous case it is directed towards the west along the continental slope while eastward in the deep basin approximately south of the 1500 m isobath overall there is an on shore transport on the continental slope inside each submarine canyon the transport has a similar pattern but is stronger than the homogeneous case also forming a clockwise circulation negative vorticity in addition we also observe several eddy like residual circulations with horizontal scales of 10 km on the shelf 4 2 transformed eulerian mean equation for barotropic and baroclinic tides the magnitude of the residual mean flow is in millimeters per second it satisfies a leading order balance represented by the wave period averaged and depth integrated transformed eulerian mean tem equations bühler 2014 19 f v 0 g h η x g r x h u u x v u y u z η η t b x f u 0 g h η y g r y h u v x v v y v z η η t b y the residual flow u 0 v 0 comes from the depth average of the lagrangian mean flow 18 it is equivalent to the eulerian mean velocity u 0 v 0 in the sense of depth integral because the 2nd term on the rhs of eq 18 is purely baroclinic the baroclinic pressure head 20 r z η g 1 b d z is related to the buoyancy fluctuation b caused by internal tides the 3rd term on the rhs of eqs 19 comes from the barotropic advections which are moved here as a stress term named the barotropic stress they act as a body force the 4th terms emerge from the depth integral following the leibniz integral rule according to the calculation of the model results they are much smaller than the other depth integrated ones thus neglected the last term is the divergence of pseudo momentum or eliassen palm ep flux induced by internal waves 21 b x u u u v u w f n 2 v b b y u v v v v w f n 2 u b the linear internal wave theory suggests that w b are both zero at the surface and bottom boundaries so the depth integral of the divergence of pseudo momentum flux in the z direction vanishes the depth integrated viscosity which is approximately equal to the bottom drag is too small to be considered 4 3 momentum budget we investigate the momentum balance for the barotropic and internal tides respectively in the sense of wave period average and depth integral in the homogeneous case after 20 m 2 tidal periods the acceleration of mean flow is about three orders smaller of magnitude than the coriolis force further confirming that the mean flow reaches a steady state the tem equations 19 become 22 f v 0 g h η x h u u x v u y f u 0 g h η y h u v x v v y the spatial distribution of each term is shown in fig 7 and their variations along transect a in fig 8 calculated from fig 8 the correlation coefficients between the total forces on the rhs of eq 22 and coriolis force on the lhs are 99 6 and 99 7 in the x and y directions respectively the results confirm that the major momentum budget is characterized by the geostrophic balance an onshore transport is generated along the west flank of each submarine canyon with an offshore transport along the east flank resulting in an eastward and westward coriolis force on the west and east flank respectively which are balanced by the pressure gradient due to a convex like sea surface elevation above each submarine canyon the coriolis force and sea surface slope are greater west of 115 2 e than east of 115 2 e due to steeper canyon flanks although the barotropic stress is relatively small it still shows coherence with the submarine canyons and mitigates the pressure gradient in the zonal direction it is relatively large on the shelf break and generates an offshore acceleration in the coastal region different relative importance of bottom friction in shallow and deep water may introduce asymmetric advection of vorticity huthnance 1973 proposed this theory to interpret the residual circulation around sandbanks in the north sea the mean flow is under a balance between the bottom drag and the net momentum flux input by tides so the mean flow is along the isobath and its direction makes an acute angle with the tidal axis towards shallow water in our case it is the barotropic stress rather than the bottom friction that plays a role of dissipation to induce the clockwise circulation inside the submarine canyons referring to the orientation of tidal ellipses shown in fig 4e the intersection angle between the tidal axis and isobath generates a northward mean flow on the west flank and a southward mean flow on the east flank in the across shore direction the rotation becomes important due to the relative long length scale of continental slope the potential vorticity conservation can also induce a westward along shore mean flow in addition to the asymmetric advection of vorticity by the barotropic tides compared with the homogeneous case the momentum balance in the stratified case includes two additional terms the baroclinic pressure gradient due to disturbed stratification and divergence of the pseudo momentum flux both of which are related to internal waves the depth integrated tem equations now read 23 f v 0 g h η x g r x h u u x v u y b x f u 0 g h η y g r y h u v x v v y b y each term in eq 23 is averaged in the 30th m 2 tidal period and shown in figs 9 and 10 and their variations along transect a are shown in fig 11 the depth integrated barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradients fig 9 are both greater than the barotropic pressure gradient in the homogeneous case fig 7c d the barotropic pressure gradient is directly related to the mean sea surface elevation which is high offshore and low onshore however the mean sea surface reveals no coherence with the submarine canyons this is different from the homogeneous case in which the convex like stripes of sea surface elevation are parallel to the submarine canyons this incoherence is owing to that beneath the surface the barotropic pressure due to the sea surface elevation is counteracted by the baroclinic pressure due to the stratification perturbation by internal waves fig 9c d after adding the total pressure gradient fig 9e f reveals a coherent pattern with the submarine canyons the pressure gradient directs towards west on the west flank of each submarine canyon and east on the east flank it is onshore on the shelf and in the deep basin while a weak offshore pressure gradient appears on the continental slope the barotropic stress fig 10c d shares a similar pattern as that in the homogeneous case but it is much smaller than divergence of pseudo momentum flux induced by internal tides fig 10e f they result from the nonlinear effects of barotropic and baroclinic tides respectively acting as a body drag to rectify the momentum in the zonal direction the pseudo momentum flux of internal tides is convergent on the west flank of submarine canyons and divergent on the east flank mitigating the corresponding pressure gradient force in the momentum budget in the meridional direction the pseudo momentum flux is generally divergent tending to drive a westward along shore mean transport in the stratified case the formation mechanism of mean transport is similar to the homogeneous case the irregular topography converts energy from barotropic tides to internal tides high mode internal tides dissipate locally due to their short wavelength this reinforces the local dissipation as well as the asymmetric advection of vorticity thus forming similar patterns as the homogeneous case but with increased magnitudes the sum of the force terms on the rhs of eq 23 is not exactly equal to the coriolis force on the lhs fig 11 their correlation coefficients are 77 5 and 79 2 in the meridional and zonal directions respectively the discrepancy is related to low frequency perturbations due to baroclinic adjustment on the one hand and computational errors in post processing on the other especially the interpolation from the staggered unstructured grids and the calculation of differentials 4 4 vertical structure of mean flow and pseudo momentum flux the effect of topography is mainly reflected in the vertical distributions of momentums fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of the lagrangian mean flows along transect a in the stratified case they are all intensified in about 100 m above the bottom either for the multibeam or srtm topography here the internal radius of deformation is much greater than the tidal excursion this is in line with conclusions of maas and zimmerman 1989a b that depth dependent vortex stretching due to internal waves and depth dependent nonlinear advection drive the near bottom residual circulation whereas small amplitude topography is assumed in contrast the residual flow is vertically uniform in the homogeneous case the topography affects the vertical structure of mean flow as well if the continental slope is carved out by the submarine canyons i e the multibeam topography is used in the model there is a noticeable westward mean flow near the bottom which is intensified inside a 100 m bottom layer above the submarine canyons its magnitude can reach more than 1 cm s 1 if the continental slope is relatively smooth i e the srtm topography is used the mean flow is also bottom intensified but with strong vertical shear that includes an eastward mean flow near the bottom and a westward one above this structure is related to the zero heat flux on the bottom boundary which requires the isotherms to intersection with the bottom at a right angle thus forming convex isotherm displacements in the meridional direction and generating the above bottom flow pattern under the constraint of the thermal wind relation meanwhile a clockwise mean circulation is found near the top of the fake ridge large values of each momentum component are along the characteristics of generated internal waves which emit from the critical slopes on the seafloor fig 13 strong shear along the internal wave beams causes strong dissipation and so can lead to non zero divergence of momentum flux and generate mean flows as predicted by the non acceleration theorem andrews and mcintyre 1976 bühler 2014 the momentum in the west of 115 2 e is greater than that in the east consistent with the intensity of internal tide generation from a perspective of momentum balance both the pressure gradient and divergence of pseudo momentum flux have a southward component against the coriolis force so as to maintain the westward mean flow inside the submarine canyons the momentum components are even one order of magnitude greater than those in the interior owing to strong interference between internal wave characteristics li et al 2019 this forms a clockwise mean circulation near the bottom of each submarine canyon i e the bottom mean flow goes offshore along the east flank but onshore along the west flank the mean flow can reach more than 2 cm s 1 which may significantly influence the material transport such as sediments or nutrients as well as the geomorphology and evolution of submarine canyons on a long time scale the momentums are weakly intensified in a thin surface layer it is estimated that the mean pseudo momentum fluxes in the top 5 layers approximately 43 m thick in total can impose a mean surface stress above the continental slope of 0 3 n m 2 which is equivalent to the surface stress caused by 13 m s 1 wind according to the bulk formula provided by large and pond 1981 this stress is balanced by the coriolis force and surface pressure gradient driving the mean surface flow in the stratified case the mean surface flow has a spatial scale of 10 20 km and shows no correlation with the submarine canyons however in the homogeneous case the surface and interior mean flow is almost horizontally uniform implying barotropic control by the topography 5 summary and discussion internal tide generation and propagation are sensitive to irregular topography the multibeam survey li et al 2016b disclosed 17 submarine canyons in the shenhu area with length from 17 to 35 km and a regular spacing of 7 km these submarine canyons are not recorded in the high resolution topography datasets commonly used by the oceanography community such as srtm etopo1 etc the numerical simulations with the multibeam and srtm topography reveal different energy balance and momentum budgets during the internal tide generation and propagation in addition to the submarine canyons the multibeam detected undulating bedforms which make the sea floor even rougher these undulating bedforms are extremely irregular with a length scale ranging in kilometers and a height of tens of meters they are not resolved in the suntans model due to the coarse vertical grids near the bottom boundary their roles in internal tide generation and propagation remain unknown in order to resolve these submarine canyons very high resolution meshes are used above the submarine canyons and unstructured grids to speed up numerical simulation different from previous analyses in which the most energetic internal tides originate offshore and propagate into the submarine canyons e g petruncio et al 1998 kunze et al 2002 alberty et al 2017 waterhouse et al 2017 nazarian et al 2021 etc only locally generated internal tides are simulated in the shenhu area internal tides arriving from the remaining regions in the south china sea such as luzon strait dongsha atoll etc are excluded when the multibeam topography is used 76 22 9 mw of the energy input by barotropic tides is converted to internal tides and 14 4 4 mw is lost due to internal tide dissipations that is to say 19 of energy is lost from locally generated internal tides this dissipation efficiency is almost triple that for remotely generated internal tides incident on submarine canyons viz 3 2 7 8 as estimated by nazarian et al 2021 the local energy loss corresponds to a averaged dissipation rate of 1 2 10 9 w kg 1 it is larger than the background dissipation rate in the open ocean 10 10 10 12 w kg 1 scheifele et al 2018 but it is one or two orders smaller than those in other submarine canyons for instance 4 2 10 8 w kg 1 in the eel canyon waterhouse et al 2017 3 3 10 8 w kg 1 in the la jolla canyon hamann et al 2021 2 10 7 2 10 8 w kg 1 in monterey canyon wain et al 2013 etc as locally generated internal tides are one order weaker than those incident from offshore to the above submarine canyons the incident energy flux to the continental slope by the internal tides generated from luzon strait is 10 kw m 1 which is about 20 times stronger than the local generated one the local maximum energy flux is 0 5 kw m 1 so it is anticipated that the total dissipation caused by shenhu submarine canyon group can reach a similar level as the above submarine canyons the dissipation rate is also spatially dependent it can reach 10 8 w kg 1 or even higher on the shelf break near the canyon head or in the bottom layers when the srtm topography is used 76 of barotropic tidal energy is converted to internal tides and the averaged dissipation rate induced by internal tides drops to 0 8 10 9 w kg 1 this is opposite to the results of elmes et al 2022 in that the submarine canyon reduces the dissipation this is probably related to their two layer model in which the effects of critical and supercritical slopes cannot be resolved it is noted that the estimation for the srtm topography includes the influence of a fake ridge which comes from an abnormal ship sounding and does not exist in the real ocean but the dissipation due to the fake ridge only accounts for a small fraction of the total dissipation in the region of interest it should also be noticed in particular that the tidal dissipation is constrained by the tidal flow defined on the open boundaries which is a caveat of regional models expanding the boundaries to include the whole northern south china sea is anticipated in the future to re evaluate the energy balance in this region the energetics derived from this numerical model with very high resolution can be a useful reference for the parameterization of tidal mixing the dissipation rate estimated by de lavergne et al 2020 in this region 115 e 20 n is 1 10 8 w kg 1 which includes both locally generated and arriving internal tides remotely forced by three major tidal constituents m 2 s 2 and k 1 their estimated dissipation is composed of four types of energy sinks which are wave wave interaction of low mode waves wave breaking through shoaling low mode wave dissipation at critical slopes and low mode wave scattering and high mode wave generation due to rough sea floor all of them are sensitive to topography the spatial resolution in de larvergne et al s estimate is 0 5 which cannot resolve the 17 submarine canyons in this region our regional model has revealed a 50 difference of dissipation rates between the multibeam and srtm topography besides p1 in the deep basin is 135 km from p2 on the submarine canyons approximately two wavelengths of the 1st mode m 2 internal tides the corresponding energy flux is reduced by 88 from p2 to p1 for the 1st mode internal tides and the high modes almost all disappear at p1 table 1 these imply a far smaller decay length scale than those assumed in their parameterization method de lavergne et al 2020 high resolution numerical models with sufficient bathymetry resolution are required to assist in improving parameterization schemes although high performance computation is a hindrance so far mean or residual currents due to tidal rectification are well known in shallow water near the coast the mean flow usually arises from asymmetric advection in a tidal cycle due to friction from bottom or lateral boundaries hunt and johns 1963 longuet higgins 1970 huthnance 1973 loder 1980 here the barotropic stress due to irregular topography acting as a form drag plays a dissipative role to balance the asymmetric advection of vorticity the magnitude of the residual circulation is dependent on the ratio between the topographic scale and the tidal excursion clockwise circulations are formed inside the submarine canyons whereas the residual flow is feeble along the shelf break and the continental slope stratification enhances the dissipative effect the model results reveal an apparent divergence of pseudo momentum flux due to the generated internal tides as a result the depth integrated residual currents are reinforced in the stratified case it is a baroclinic response due to depth dependent vortex stretching and advection by internal waves a notable feature of the internal tide rectification is the bottom trapped or intensified mean flow maas and zimmerman 1989b which is also exhibited in the model results a mooring observation on the continental slope which is about 300 km east from shenhu area discovered an intensified westward along shore flow 0 15 m s 1 in a 100 m bottom layer xie et al 2018 the authors attribute this to the internal tide breaking however direct breaking due to shear instability i e the richardson number is less than 0 25 not shown is not found in our model results relatively apparent mean flows 5 mm s 1 are also found along the internal wave characteristics and inside a thin surface layer the estimated mean momentum flux input to the sea surface is 0 3 n m 2 equivalent to stress from a sea surface wind of 13 m s 1 if this is the case the actual contributions of internal wave momentum flux to mesoscale eddies and basin scale circulation are worth further investigation pinkel et al 2012 slope confined submarine canyons are major channels for sediments to be transported to the abyssal seabed they can also trap turbidite sands and form oil and gas reservoirs their formation and evolution result from several geological processes including erosion slumping and landslides all of which are related to the hydraulic conditions in the ocean as a ubiquitous hydrodynamical phenomenon occurring near irregular bathymetry the contributions of internal tides are still unknown even though the mean flow generated by internal tides is weak its long term impact should not be underestimated abundant sediments are carried downstream from the pearl river delta to the deep basin through shenhu submarine canyon group the bottom intensified clockwise mean flow decelerates downstream sediment transport on the west flanks of the submarine canyons but accelerates it on the east flanks hence reinforcing sediment deposition on the west flank and sediment erosion on the east flank this effect may be related to the present morphological feature of the submarine canyons which have narrower and steeper east flanks than the west ones li et al 2016b this may also cause an eastward migration of the submarine canyons on the geological time scale as found from seismic profiles su et al 2020 taking 115 2 e as a dividing line the general morphological features such as the head depth maximum canyon relief channel width etc are significantly different between east and west coincident with the regionally different intensity of internal tide generation whether or how internal tides modify the geomorphic features of submarine canyons is worth a future study with a combination of morphological and hydrodynamic models credit authorship contribution statement qiang li methodology software

23802,the ability to model bar migration in the nearshore zone is critically important for predicting coastal morphology we present a cost effective wave averaged 3d model croco with parameterization of wave related bedload transport adapted santoss and evaluate calibrate its performance in comparison with data measured in a two dimensional wave channel in this model suspended load transport both in and above the wave bottom boundary layer is resolved by the flow model we assume that if the tuning parameters are not robust to varying forcing conditions the parameterization can be considered a failure the present work is therefore a first step towards a numerical model capable of predicting the onshore and offshore migration of a sandbar under storm and post storm conditions using the same set of parameters one way to achieve this goal is to treat the effects of waves and currents in separate formulations to avoid conflicts and redundancy we show that the implementation and adaptation of santoss in croco can achieve this goal provided that the hydrodynamics are accurately reproduced and the separation between the wave related bedload and current related suspended load formulations is respected keywords beach morphology surf zone bed load sediment load sandbar migration beach erosion accretion data availability the code and data will be made open source after publication 1 introduction sediment transport due to waves and currents plays a crucial role in the morphology and ecosystem of coastal areas waves can change coastal morphology in any direction depending on hydrodynamic and morphological conditions sandy beaches are among the areas most rapidly affected by various environmental conditions they are continuously subjected to waves that result in the creation of sandbars near the shoreline therefore sandbars are the primary indicator of cross shore sediment transport in most cases and can migrate onshore or offshore their contribution to wave breaking is considerable and they can therefore serve as a beach protection mechanism many studies have explored the drivers of the motion of coastal sediment particles e g van rijn et al 2013 the processes responsible for shoreward transport are wave related wave streaming wave skewness and asymmetry and stokes drift while the undertow is the main driver of offshore motion henderson et al 2004 wave streaming is the near bed onshore mean eulerian flow caused by waves propagating towards the beach longuet higgins 1953 the stokes drift is the difference between the lagrangian and eulerian flow velocities stokes 1880 van den bremer and breivik 2018 and a nonlinear wave form is described by skewness sharp high peaks and broad shallow troughs and asymmetry steep front faces and mild sloped back faces elgar 1987 henderson et al 2004 the undertow is the wave average seaward current that moves under the trough of the waves it is the result of the balance between the radiation stress gradient due to breaking waves the turbulent shear stress and the cross shore pressure gradient due to wave set up johnson 1919 dyhr nielsen and sørensen 1970 hansen and svendsen 1985 the final balance of these wave and current forcing determines the net direction of coastal particle transport leading to sandbar migration in many of the cases e g elgar et al 2001 hoefel and elgar 2003 hsu et al 2006 one of the key phenomena influencing the role of each process mentioned above is the position of wave breaking in particular whether the waves break onshore or offshore of the sandbar symonds and bowen 1984 roelvink and stive 1989 henderson et al 2004 in particular this affects the cross shore distribution of breaker induced undertow which is considered in many studies as a key player on bar formation e g dyhr nielsen and sørensen 1970 dally and dean 1984 stive and battjes 1985 stive 1987 breakers can also increase the onshore bedload transport through their effect on wave asymmetry and skewness and near bed turbulence however the magnitude of this onshore forcing relative to the offshore forcing by the undertow depends on other parameters such as the breaker type e g ting and kirby 1994 the shear stress caused by near bottom flows triggers sediment mobilization while currents and nonlinear waves move the near bed sediments however there is no exact boundary between bed and suspended load and the bedload boundary layer is rather an arbitrary mathematical definition the resultant balance of these transport modes determines the direction i e onshore or offshore of the bar migration with the increase of the bed shear stress the particles start to roll and slide fredsoe and deigaard 1992 if the shear velocity surpasses a threshold the particles will detach from the bed and depending on their horizontal velocities e g due to turbulent eddies and vertical velocities e g due to settling velocity they may settle on the bed or stay suspended fredsoe and deigaard 1992 in sediment transport modeling the bed elevation is obtained using the exner equation which includes bedload transport parameterization and pickup and settling rate of the suspended sediment the sediment concentration is obtained using a suspended tracer advection diffusion equation coupled with the hydrodynamic model through the velocity field warren and bach 1992 lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 e g in suspended load models the sediments enter exit the flow domain through a source sink term in the bottom layer the bedload transport is coupled with the flow model through either near bottom velocity or shear stress amoudry 2008 the most commonly used bedload transport models are those of meyer peter and müller 1948 van rijn et al 1993 soulsby and damgaard 2005 van der a et al 2013 and their capabilities are studied by various researchers the averaging approaches have been a major restriction to the applicability range of these models for instance rafati et al 2021 successfully used xbeach roelvink et al 2009 a depth averaged model to predict the offshore bar migration during storms however onshore migration could not be simulated using the same set of parameters one approach to solving this problem is to use 3d models that solve the vertical flow structure such as delft3d lesser et al 2004 success may again be limited in predicting beach accretion due to wave averaging procedure and inability of the bedload model to represent the effects of wave asymmetry van rijn et al 2011 to finally predict the correct direction of sandbar migration the santoss transport formula van der a et al 2013 which follows the wave half cycle concept to account for wave asymmetry and skewness was implemented in delft3d veen et al 2014 van der werf et al 2015 their model reproduced both onshore and offshore directed sandbar migration but erosion and accretion conditions had to be calibrated separately possibly due to an overspecification of undertow transport in the bedload formulation the present study builds on the mixed success of delft3d using santoss but applying it to the coastal and regional ocean community croco model debreu et al 2012 marchesiello et al 2021a which is based on the regional oceanic modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the first attempt to add suspended sediment transport equations to roms was done by blaas et al 2007 for the southern california shelf warner et al 2008 supplemented the roms shelf sediment transport model with a bedload formulation and then implemented wave averaged equations using at first a three dimensional radiation stress formulation to address nearshore problems warner et al 2010 next the successful implementation of vortex force formalism by uchiyama et al 2010 was adopted by many others bennis et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 and implemented in all versions of roms and most notably in croco marchesiello et al 2015 for wave forcing croco can be fully coupled to either a ray theory spectrum peak wave propagation model uchiyama et al 2010 or a more comprehensive spectral model i e the third generation wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 in all roms related models mentioned above bedload is calculated using either meyer peter and müller 1948 or soulsby and damgaard 2005 models one of the main challenges of these models is to estimate their average contribution over each wave period this leads to a poor representation of the effects of waves on bedload transport i e velocity and acceleration skewness as a result bedload transport is underestimated by the model and fitting parameters are used to compensate for this defect e g rafati et al 2021 this problem can be solved as in the santoss formulation of van der a et al 2013 by using the half cycle concept e g dibajnia and watanabe 1992a camenen and larson 2005 the half cycle approach enables the model to calculate the amount of sediment mobilized and transported in each half cycle of the wave therefore provided an accurate estimate of the wave shape is given the model can reasonably calculate the net sand transport due to wave asymmetry and skewness as well as phase lag between mobilization and transport at the intra wave cycle the sand entrained by the bed shear stress during a half wave cycle is transported in the other direction during the next half wave cycle this makes the model more physically sound more robust and less dependent on the calibration of parameters as already mentioned the santoss formulation has been implemented in delft3d but also more recently in roms coawst kalra et al 2019 on which the implementation in croco is based modeling the evolution of the sandbar cross shore profile has been a popular but challenging topic among coastal engineers studying the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the surf zone older models are reviewed by roelvink and broker 1993 focusing on a process based approach that explicitly accounts for actual physical processes although the various models use similar governing equations their application are often specific due to differences in parameterization numerical algorithms and boundary conditions spielmann et al 2004 van rijn et al 2013 some specific target include wave energy conditions bathymetric complexity or duration of the desired simulation for example focusing on long term evolution the model of walstra et al 2012 successfully captured the dominant mechanisms in bar growth and decay for short term bar migration spielmann et al 2004 proposed various effective parameters on bar migration in an erosion case while hsu et al 2006 developed a model more suitable for the prediction of onshore bar migration however all of these models were limited to either offshore or onshore migration and were heavily dependent on the calibration of empirical parameters in contrast hoefel and elgar 2003 specifically considered wave induced forcing and successfully simulated onshore bar migration but their model failed under offshore bar migration conditions with more success the models of zheng et al 2014 and rafati et al 2021 predicted both onshore and offshore bar migrations but again they used different values of the fitting parameters to achieve this result this brief review of the literature reveals that a comprehensive hydro morphodynamic model capable of predicting onshore offshore bar migration is still lacking the present work aims at developing and implementing a comprehensive 3d nearshore model to predict the onshore and offshore sandbar migration under storm and post storm conditions without the need to modify the setting parameters to achieve this goal the sediment transport model must be sufficiently extensive to represent the dominant transport processes under each forcing condition in this paper we take a first step by evaluating the ability of the model to predict sandbar migration in a two dimensional wave channel 2dv environment we will demonstrate that the implementation of the santoss transport formula within croco is a reliable and robust solution provided that hydrodynamics are accurately reproduced and that a proper separation between wave and current forcing in the bedload and suspended load formulations is respected this manuscript is structured as follows in section 2 the hydrodynamic and sediment transport model equations are presented the hydrodynamics are modeled by a set of 3d wave averaged equations with wave current interactions coupled with a ray theory spectrum peak wave propagation model the model description for sediment transport and morphodynamic evolution follows with suspended load transport equations and bedload wave related transport parameterization using the santoss formulation in section 3 the numerical configuration including bathymetry and boundary forcing is explained then section 4 presents the hydrodynamic calibration procedure the main results of the model are presented in section 5 where the main drivers of sandbar migration are discussed the discussion is then completed in sections 6 and 7 providing the concluding remarks of this study 2 model formulation in this paper the coastal and regional ocean community croco model is implemented to study the morphological modeling of sandy beaches including hydrodynamics waves sediment transport and morphology a non hydrostatic version of the model is available that can explicitly solve for surface waves marchesiello et al 2021a b but we rely here on a more traditional and less computationally expensive wave averaged approach eulerian wave averaged current equations for mass momentum and tracers are included based on a vortex force formalism from the asymptotic theory of mcwilliams et al 2004 plus non conservative wave effects due to wave breaking roller waves bottom streaming wave enhanced vertical mixing and bottom drag uchiyama et al 2010 marchesiello et al 2015 the wave information is provided by a spectrum peak wkb wave refraction model that includes the effect of currents on waves rather than ww3 the spectrum resolving wave model the velocity field is used to carry the suspended load blaas et al 2007 while the recent santoss bedload formulation is implemented in this study to include nonlinear wave effects 2 1 hydrodynamic model 2 1 1 flow model croco solves the three dimensional free surface rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations transformed into a terrain following coordinate system here with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations as in roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 debreu et al 2012 the wave effect on currents wec is introduced in the mean flow equations using a vortex force formalism vf mcwilliams et al 2004 rather than the radiation stress representation the effects of wave averaging are divided into bernoulli head gradients i e minus the gradient of the horizontal kinetic energy density of the primary and long waves and a vortex force i e the coupling of the flow vorticity with stokes drift this formalism was fully implemented including non conservative terms of acceleration and dissipation into roms by uchiyama et al 2010 then in croco by marchesiello et al 2015 here we use a simplified set of two dimensional vertical equations neglecting the coriolis force but the implementation including the new bedload transport formula is fully 3d and is tested in a 3d configuration in parallel to this work after reorganizing advection and vortex form terms these equations in 2dv eulerian and cartesian form are 1 u t u u x w u z ϕ x k x j f w z ν t u z 2 ϕ z g ρ ρ 0 k z k 3 u x w

side of these equations are the wec terms bernoulli head gradients and vortex force plus non conservative forces wave induced acceleration and vertical mixing however in the actual implementation the

uchiyama et al 2010 the turbulent viscosity ν t in the vertical mixing term is computed using a modified k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 to account for breaker induced turbulence croco has the additional option of a generic length scale gls approach warner et al 2005 in the present study we chose the k ω gls model solving the closure equations for turbulent kinetic energy tke and dissipation rate ω the introduction of wave breaking into this model follows kumar et al 2012 where the injection of surface tke is given by surface boundary conditions in the closure equations in the surf zone only a fraction of the breaker dissipation produces turbulence here we assume 5 while the rest goes to the wave rollers the surface boundary condition for ω is a function of the surface

2004 warner et al 2008 the concept of morphological acceleration is based on the fact that morphodynamic changes are slower than hydrodynamic ones van rijn 1993 in this case the bed evolution can be accelerated without affecting the hydro morphological solution the avalanche module used to reproduce the gravitational flow of sand when the bottom slope exceeds the critical slope angle is presented

already implemented in croco which are described in warner et al 2008 e g those of meyer peter and müller 1948 or soulsby and damgaard 2005 these models are more suited to continental shelf problems in this paper the near bed total transport formulation santoss proposed by van der a et al 2013 suitable for nearshore applications is adapted to croco a depth resolving wave averaged 3d flow model this adaptation is necessary because at least part of the current related transport mechanisms in santoss are already implemented in croco and are thus duplicated in the bedload transport in the problem addressed in this paper we will see that double counting the effect of currents in santoss leads to unrealistic results while only marginal errors are imparted by neglecting these currents in santoss and relying on the suspended load model for the current related transport therefore here the current related transport is solved by the flow model and the remaining physics i e the bedload transport is parameterized in santoss this formulation is implemented as in kalra et al 2019 and validated against a flume experiment it is based on the half wave cycle concept proposed by dibajnia and watanabe 1992b that captures wave velocity and acceleration skewness and the effect of phase lag between mobilization and transport dohmen janssen et al 2002 in this section we present our adapted version of the santoss model the modifications mainly concern the removal of the wave averaged current effects to keep only the nonlinear wave effects in the formulation in doing so we follow up on the observation by veen et al 2014 that the full santoss model would tend to double count the transport by mean currents in the wave boundary layer if a suspended load transport model is used in combination in the case of onshore bar migration for example i e lip1c this double counting prevents the replication of the onshore bar migration observed in the experiments and even reverses the migration see fig 13 in the brief presentation of the model below we retain the terms associated with wave averaged currents for completeness they are implemented in practice with the option to disable them or not but focus on wave effects the method to obtain sediment transport under asymmetric and skewed waves can be divided into three major steps van der a et al 2013 kalra et al 2019 in the first step the asymmetric waveform based on the ursell number is evaluated using wave statistics the shields parameter for each half cycle of the wave form is computed in the second step finally a phase lag is estimated from the velocity field that determines the amount of bedload transported in the half cycle following the mobilization half cycle the non dimensional bedload transport rate φ is thus given by 22 φ q b s 1 g d 50 3 1 t θ c θ c 1 2 t c ω c c t c 2 t c u ω t c θ t θ t 1 2 t t ω t t t t 2 t t u ω c t where s ρ s ρ ρ s is the density of sand and d 50 is the median grain diameter t t c t t t c u and t t u are the wave period duration of wave crest half cycle duration of wave trough half cycle duration of accelerating flow within the crest half cycle and duration of accelerating flow within the trough half cycle respectively see fig 1 for definitions θ c and θ t represent the shields numbers associated with the wave crest and trough half cycles the sand load transported during the crest period is the combination of ω c c mobilized during the crest period and ω t c mobilized during the trough period similarly ω t t and ω c t are the sand load transported during the trough period mobilized during the trough and crest periods respectively the sand load transported during each half cycle is conventionally modeled according to a power law of shields number 23 ω i max 11 θ i θ c r 1 2 0 where θ c r is the critical shields number soulsby 1997a and hereafter the subscript i is either c for crest or t for trough half cycles to determine ω c t and ω t c i e the portion of the bedload remaining in suspension to be transported in the next half cycle a phase lag parameter is evaluated see van der a et al 2013 for details the shields number for the peak or trough θ i θ t or θ c is calculated according to 24 θ i 1 2 f w δ i u i r u i r s 1 g d 50 u i r is the representative cross shore combined wave current velocity at trough or crest half cycles

bedload transport calculation this choice represents our reference configuration to avoid double counting the transport by wave averaged currents the sensitivity to this modeling choice will be shown in the discussion section 6 finally following kalra et al 2019 after calculating φ we apply to q b a bedload factor f b l d bedload coeff in croco this factor allows us to adjust the relative contribution to sediment transport of wave induced bedload compared to the suspended load transported by mean currents in this way we have a better control of the antagonistic mechanisms that govern onshore and offshore transports respectively 3 numerical configuration in this section the initial and boundary conditions as well as the numerical settings of the simulations are presented the lip1b erosion and lip1c accretion cases of the lip11d experiments roelvink and reniers 1995 are used to evaluate and validate the model lip1b and lip1c experiments are conducted sequentially meaning that the final bathymetry of lip1b is the initial bathymetry of lip1c the numerical domain is 201 m long and water depth is 4 1 m the median grain diameter d 50 0 22 mm sand density ρ s 2650 kg m 3 water density ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 and settling velocity w s mm s calculated using soulsby formula the wave boundary conditions including significant wave height and period the dean number and duration of wave generation are provided in table 1 two sets of instruments were used for the measurements fixed and movable by a carriage in this paper the measurements obtained from the velocity meter and suction tubes deployed on the carriage are used to evaluate the modeled cross shore and vertical profiles of velocity and concentration respectively during the lip11d experiment the carriage has been moved cross shore in each wave hour therefore each vertical profile is obtained at different wave hour during the simulation however the simulation results presented in this paper are extracted at half of the total duration of the simulation i e at 9 and 6 5 h for lip1b and lip1c respectively it should be noted that this assumption is a source of errors between the model simulation and the measurements as shown in fig 2 lip1b experiment starts with a developed sandbar after 8 h the bar moves offshore by about 4 m with a slight increase of its height 10 h later it moves 5 m further offshore the crest becomes sharper and about 5 cm higher during this erosion phase the sand seems to be transported mostly from the bar trough and upper shoreface to the offshore side of the bar 18 h after the start of the experiment wave conditions change to the accretion phase table 1 resulting in a 4 m shoreward migration of the bar after 7 h and a 7 cm increase in bar height however over the next 6 h the onshore migration slows down while the bar crest continues to rise by about 5 cm during the accretion phase the sand seems to be transported mostly from the offshore side of the bar to its lee side note that in both cases well developed ripples are apparent on the bar through increasing the roughness of the bottom at this point the numerical domain is discretized using a uniform grid with horizontal resolution of 1 5 m an optimal choice according to a sensitivity analysis not shown longshore gradients are neglected so there is only one grid cell in this direction with terrain following coordinates the number of vertical layers is 20 throughout the domain therefore the heights of the cells in the deep region and around the bar are about 21 cm and 5 cm respectively in the wave model the offshore wave height is forced at the model boundary with values provided in table 1 the significant wave height h s is 1 4 m and 0 6 m for lip1b and lip1c cases respectively the model uses h r m s h s 2 and the peak wave period is 5 and 8 s respectively the resulting dean number ω h s t p w s dean 1973 2018 clearly differentiates the erosion and accretion conditions from the experiments apart from the forcing conditions all other wave model parameters are the same for both cases see next section for the sediment transport model the morphological factors are 18 and 13 for the lip1b and lip1c cases respectively therefore the simulation time is only 1 h in both cases while the real time is accelerated differently without any consequence on the results as confirmed by experiments without morphological acceleration not shown here there are two main calibration parameters to be tuned in the suspended load model the critical bed shear stress τ c e and erosion rate e 0 τ c e is set to 0 18 n m 2 following the empirical relation of soulsby and whitehouse 1997 depending only on grain size which controls the initiation of sand erosion in the suspended load model the range of erosion rate values tested in this paper is 0 e 0 0 025 kg m 2 s note that the grain roughness z 0 s d 50 12 z n o t s in croco is used for the sediment bed roughness the bedload model described in section 2 2 3 has its own empirical formulations for sand mobilization based on grain size and wave statistics we only used one calibration parameter the bedload factor which was tested in the range 0 f b l d 1 4 hydrodynamic calibration in this section before the full hydro morphodynamic simulation the hydrodynamic model is independently calibrated the sediment model is inactive and intermediate bathymetries i e the bathymetry after 8 h for lip1b and 7 h for lip1c cases are used throughout the simulations first the best fit solutions are presented then the most sensitive hydrodynamic parameters are tested and discussed to avoid overload some of the figures are presented in the appendix hydro sensitivity the calibrated hydrodynamic parameters will be used in the morphodynamic calibration section 5 4 1 reference solutions the best parameter values are chosen as those that provide the best model data comparison both using the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 28 value roelvink et al 2009 and qualitatively through figures presented in this paper with major emphasis on the position of the bar crest in both the erosion and accretion phases in eq 28 m stands for measured value and c for computed value represents an averaging operator and σ the associated standard deviation note that the presented nrmse values of velocity are the linear average of the nrmses of each vertical velocity profile 28 n r m s e σ m c max σ m m in fig 3 the top panel compares the vertical profiles of velocity across the beach the middle panel shows the cross shore profile of h r m s and wave set up and the bottom panel shows the near bottom velocity at 10 cm above the bed this figure is obtained by using γ b 0 4 b b 0 6 and α r 1 5 the bottom roughness in the offshore and onshore side of the bar are set to 0 002 and 0 01 m respectively the list of all the parameters tested is presented in table 2 their corresponding normalized rmse values of undertow and wave height are also provided it is important to note that using the same settings for the soulsby transport model soulsby and damgaard 2005 the bar migrates offshore in both cases see the respective results in fig d 1 on the offshore side of the bar in lip1b 60 x 100 the incident waves are already influenced by the bottom and begin to break therefore the wave height decreases as the waves propagate toward the shoreline and the velocity near the bottom used as a proxy for undertow is significant on the other hand in the offshore region of lip1c the incident waves are not large enough to start the breaking process consequently the wave height wave set up and undertow remain unaffected in this region over the bar a strong undertow is generated in both cases stronger in lip1b this is due to strong breaking on the bar that transfers momentum and also causes a drop in wave height and wave set up since lip1b has more incident momentum more of it is transferred on the bar than in lip1c leading to a larger cross shore pressure gradient and stronger undertow the model predicts the wave height and wave set up well in both cases the undertow is also fairly well predicted but the results are more sensitive to the wave breaking parameters as will be shown on the onshore side of the bar in both cases hydrodynamic changes are generally less important the undertow and wave height tend to decrease while the wave set up increases although the presence of a shallow terrace beginning at about x 160 m generates a secondary breakpoint the model follows the observed trend but it seems to underestimate the undertow particularly in lip1b in lip1c the model shows a secondary undertow maximum associated with the secondary breakpoint which is absent in the flume experiment this may reflect a lack of synopticity in the measurements the currents have been measured at different times corresponding to different bathymetries or a modeling issue in the shallow nearshore region e g overestimation of wave setup as can be observed the undertow is underestimated in 1b and overestimated in 1c although the results of each case can be improved by calibrating the wave breaking parameters independently this is the best result we could achieve upon numerous tests using the same parameters for both cases it should be reminded that the lack of synopticity in the measurements is another source of error due to the movement of the bar during the measurement in the lip experiments each velocity profile is measured at different wave hours while we have fixed the bathymetry using the bed profile measured in the middle of the experiment for example activating the sediment transport model strengthens the near bed velocity to 0 29 m s after 5 h from the initial time the same wave hour at which the measurement is conducted this will change the best choice of wave breaking parameters although some studies present simulation results according to the corresponding wave hour of each vertical profile e g marchesiello et al 2021b we present our results obtained in the middle of the simulation time period because they are satisfactory enough 4 2 sensitivity to wave breaking parameters γ b and b b wave breaking parameter γ b controls the cross shore position of the breakpoint fig 4 illustrates the sensitivity of model results to this parameter as expected from eq 7 when γ b is increased the waves tend to break closer to shore and release their energy in shallower water this generally increases the wave height and decreases the wave set up in the surf zone on the offshore side of the bar lip1b is particularly sensitive to γ b because waves start to break earlier in this case due to higher offshore wave height the top panel of fig 4 a shows that at x 65 m an increase of γ b results in a decrease of breaker induced current shear what remains is the eulerian return flow which verifies the lagrangian continuity equation non divergent lagrangian flow due to the delayed breaking with a higher γ b in lip1b there is a large increase in wave breaking on the bar with an increased undertow as a result the breaking pattern in lip1b and lip1c becomes more similar on the contrary for lower γ b the breaking occurs earlier and the offshore points have higher current shear while the onshore points have reduced wave height and undertow on the bar the effects of increasing γ b is opposite for the erosion and accretion cases in lip1b higher γ b moves the breaking point from offshore to the bar crest the higher the γ b is the stronger the undertow becomes in contrast in lip1c with a higher value of γ b wave breaking is stronger inshore of the bar and on the terrace slope which is the sensitive area for lip1c we choose γ b 0 4 as the best compromise in both cases the second tuning parameter in the wave dissipation equation eq 7 is b b it controls the amount of wave energy dissipated during breaking the effects of increasing b b is similar to decreasing γ b throughout the domain and in both cases although the model is less sensitive to b b than γ b the sensitivity of the model to this parameter is shown in fig b 1 b b 0 6 is chosen as the best value to be used in the following 4 3 sensitivity to the bottom roughness length z 0 b another important source of dissipation is the bottom friction eq 10 the logarithmic law of the wall requires for the bottom stress a value for the bottom roughness length z 0 b eqs 11 and 13 this coefficient affects both current and wave induced friction however the friction force due to waves is about one order of magnitude larger than that due to mean currents in the present case in this model due to the existence of well developed ripples in the trough area between the bar crest and the terrace fig 2 higher roughness is considered for the onshore side of the bar than that of the offshore side the offshore onshore transition point is set to be at x 140 m in both lip1b and lip1c cases to avoid sharp changes of roughness we use a hyperbolic tangent function the sensitivity of the model to this coefficient is relatively moderate it is illustrated for both erosion and accretion cases in fig 5 for offshore roughness and fig b 2 for onshore roughness as expected z 0 b mostly affects the near bottom velocity higher values lead to lower velocities it should be noted in fig 5 that the sensitivity of h r m s in lip1c is due to the fact that since the wave energy is moderate the dissipation by bottom friction is comparable to that of the wave breaking in this case the best value for offshore z 0 b 2 mm is chosen by giving more weight to the offshore near bottom velocity inshore of the bar the near bottom velocity is over and under estimated in lip1b and lip1c respectively therefore the best compromise is found to be with z 0 b 10 mm for the onshore side of the bar 4 4 sensitivity to bottom streaming and roller fraction two other parameters in eq 4 for which sensitivity analysis has been performed are bottom streaming eq 6 and roller fraction eqs 5 and 17 as the sensitivity of the results to these parameters are weaker than those to γ b and offshore z 0 b the results are shown in the appendix section rather than in the main text figs b 3 and b 4 bottom streaming is a wave averaged eulerian shoreward flow caused by phase differences in horizontal and vertical orbital velocities occurring in the wave boundary layer longuet higgins 1953 xu and bowen 1994 therefore this term tends to counteract the undertow near the bottom note that the original santoss formulation also accounts for wave streaming but we have neglected it here since it is already accounted for in the flow model uchiyama et al 2010 the roller fraction α r is the fraction of energy transferred from the waves to the rollers during wave breaking thus expanding the surf zone shoreward compared to a local transfer at the breakpoint without roller α r 0 the undertow is localized on the bar crest using a value of α r higher than 1 is unconventional as it implies getting some of the roller energy from the mean flow however it acts as an additional breaker delay roelvink et al 1995 that seems particularly relevant to the breaking process on a sandbar as we observe in fig b 4 in the measurement wave breaking effect on the near bed velocity is spread throughout the inner surf zone while in the model it is more spatially concentrated over the primary bar this may be due to under prediction of turbulence in the flow model not shown here using a roller fraction greater than unity inserts additional energy into the bores which represents this dissipation delay in the model for this reason we decided to challenge the roller model and choose a value of 1 5 that is greater than unity 5 morphodynamic simulations sandbar migration here we pursue the objective of evaluating the model to predict accretion and erosion conditions with the same set of parameters this capability of the model is tested by doing sensitivity analysis to two tuning parameters following an iterative approach due to the disregard of current effects in the bedload formulation i e our adaptation of the santoss formulation to a 3d flow model this iterative calibration process has become simpler while the current driven offshore bar migration is controlled by the erosion rate in the suspended load formulation the control of wave driven onshore bar migration is achieved by the bedload factor considering the onshore directed migration of the bar we expect the sandbar migration to be controlled by bedload transport in the accretion case consequently in the first step of our iteration procedure we focus on the model sensitivity to the bedload factor in lip1c with no suspended load e 0 0 kg m 2 s second using the bedload factor selected in the first step we find the most realistic erosion rate for lip1b where the suspended load transport is dominant then the same procedure as the first step is repeated using the updated value of the erosion rate this iteration is repeated until the differences in two successive iteration cycles become small enough finally the values by which the model predicts both onshore and offshore sandbar migration are chosen as the best fit case more details are presented in the next section note that the critical bed shear stress for erosion is not considered as a tuning parameter but is calculated using the soulsby formulation as in blaas et al 2007 5 1 sensitivity to the bedload factor as mentioned above we start the morphodynamic calibration procedure by considering zero erosion rate e 0 0 kg m 2 s eq 19 therefore in this case the bed height in eq 20 depends only on near bed transport fig 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the model to the bedload factor with zero suspended load in this figure each part consists of two panels the top panel shows the modeled final bed elevation and compares it with the measured initial and final bed levels and the bottom panel shows the differences between the initial and final bed levels z b i and z b f respectively for both measurement and simulation in lip1c the bar moves onshore fig 6 b which is consistent with the flume experiment with higher bedload factor f b l d a larger mass of sand is moved from the offshore to the lee side of the bar which leads to both onshore migration and amplitude increase of the bar the same phenomenon occurs for the terrace around x 160 m which tends to form a secondary inner bar in the model the bar also moves toward the coast in lip1b which is contrary to the experiment fig 6 a in this case as explained by marchesiello et al 2021b wave asymmetry and skewness are stronger in lip1b than in lip1c resulting in greater wave driven onshore sand transport this shows the considerable importance of the suspended load for the offshore migration of the sandbar see section 5 2 note that a sensitivity numerical experiment not shown without the phase lag between mobilization and transport in the santoss formulation setting ω c t and ω t c to zero in eq 22 indicates that the main driver of wave related transport in these experiments is not the phase lag process because the sand is not fine and settling velocity is high but the net result of wave asymmetry or skewness in what follows we will consider wave nonlinearity as the dominant process of wave related sediment transport along with wave streaming effects consequently we start the iteration process by considering f b l d 0 6 in our sensitivity test to erosion rate explained in the next section in the second cycle of our iteration procedure after choosing the best erosion rate for lip1b e 0 0 02 kg m 2 s we reconnect the suspended load transport in lip1c the results are not drastically changed but the undertow even under these moderate conditions requires a compensating increase in f b l d from 0 6 to 0 8 for better comparison to the data f b l d 0 8 is chosen as the final value due to its slightly better results compare figs 7 and c 2 yet in lip1c the f b l d 0 case shown in fig c 1 b confirms that suspended load transport plays a minor role in sandbar migration although it contributes more significantly to terrace shape in lip1b the addition of suspended load transport is so overwhelming that it changes the direction of the bar migration while decreasing the sensitivity to the bedload factor compare fig c 1 a with fig 6 a the wave driven onshore bar migration becomes a minor process in comparison with the current driven offshore migration associated with suspended load however neglecting bedload transport results in an overestimation of the offshore bar migration 5 2 sensitivity to erosion rate the second step in each cycle of the calibration procedure is to adjust the erosion rate to obtain the most accurate offshore bar migration possible retaining the best bedload factor from the first step f b l d 0 6 fig 7 a illustrates how the prediction of the offshore bar migration in lip1b is improved by considering the suspended load the vertical sand concentration profiles of lip1b is shown in fig 8 these profiles are obtained in the middle of the simulation period while the corresponding measurements had been acquired with a wider spread in the sampling period again the lack of synopticity is a source of discrepancy between the model and the experiments since the change in bathymetry during the experiment affects the hydro sedimentary fields however in general the sand concentration and its vertical gradients are well simulated confirming the ability of the 3d flow model to simulate mixing processes in lip1c as already discussed in section 5 1 the low sand concentration and low undertow make e 0 kg m 2 s have even less impact on the bar and its most notable effect is on the terrace note that as expected with e 0 0 kg m 2 s the concentration is zero throughout the domain during the simulations of lip1b and lip1c not shown fig 8 shows that on the offshore side of the bar stronger erosion rate e 0 results in an increase in suspended sand concentration on the bar as expected from the sand source term in eq 18 therefore the undertow transports a larger amount of sand offshore leading to a greater offshore bar migration without notable change in the bar amplitude on the other hand in lip1c the erosion rate does not affect the position of the bar crest although it affects the bar shape and associated distribution of sand around the crest one reason is that the undertow in lip1c is weaker and restricted to the inshore side of the bar as also observed by marchesiello et al 2021b using a wave resolving model vertical turbulent mixing is also lower which does not promote suspended sediment transport and limits it to a local area the inshore side of the bar finally as mentioned the suspended sediment transport is dominant in lip1b making it less sensitive to the bedload factor 5 3 optimization of the morphological calibration this section proves the ability of the model to predict onshore and offshore sandbar migration using the same model tuning parameters choosing the most suitable values for erosion rate e 0 and bedload factor f b l d is tricky because deviation of the simulation from measurement varies spatially across the beach a classical metric to evaluate the quality of a morphological prediction is the bss sutherland et al 2004 defined as follows brier et al 1950 29 b s s 1 v a r c m 0 v a r m f m 0 where v a r is the variance of the quantity between brackets m 0 stands for initial measured bed profile m f for final measured bed profile and c for computed bed profile the bss relates the variance of the difference between data and model to the variance of the data bss 1 means perfect skill bss 0 means no skill bss 0 means model is worse than no change scenario roelvink et al 2009 considering error metrics nrmse and bss see table 3 as well as the position of bar crest and maximum bed evolution see fig 9 altogether we chose the best values to be 0 02 kg m 2 s and 0 6 for erosion rate and bedload coefficient respectively although using f b l d 0 8 i e run 23 predicts the cross shore position of the bar slightly better it leads to negative value of bss in lip1c the reason is that the measured bed evolution is small on the offshore toe of the primary bar and in the shallow region while our model has the largest errors in those regions consequently despite the fact that both cases predict the bar position well run 22 is preferred considering that it has the higher bss for both lip1c bss 0 142 and lipb1b bss 0 142 respectively these values are considered to be reasonable fair and good excellent prediction according to sutherland et al 2004 note that in fig 9 the bottom panel illustrates the vertical concentration profiles at their corresponding position in the domain both the offshore and onshore bar migration lip1b and lip1c respectively are generally well predicted by the model in lip1b the offshore side of the bar follows the same bed profile as in the experiment but the model overestimates the accumulation of sand in the lee side this excessive sand deposition is reflected in an overestimation of sand concentration near the bottom this overestimation also appears in lip1c both on the bar and the terrace as mentioned earlier one reason may be the lack of synopticity in the data for example in lip1b the near bottom concentration 5 cm above the bed at x 138 m decreases from 6 9 g l fig 9 a to 3 6 g l when viewed at 5 h from the initial state the same wave hour at which the concentration is measured however another reason in low energy conditions especially in the shallow waters of the terrace may be the overestimation of the undertow as a results of the overestimation of wave height see section 4 1 that increases the bed shear stress and erosion flux e s 6 discussion in this section we will further explain the improvements this study provides to our understanding of sandbar transport modeling first we will use the maximum bed evolution peak as a proxy to sandbar migration to better assess the sensitivity of the results to bedload and suspended load coefficients next we will use a sand transport budget to assess the contributions of bedload and suspended load section 6 2 and evaluate the role of wave nonlinearity parameters in the onshore transport process section 6 3 then the improvements associated with the modification of the santoss formulation will be discussed finally we will test the performance of the model with the same parameters on another laboratory experiment of cross shore sand transport 6 1 model robustness to better assess the robustness of the onshore offshore bar migration prediction the result of 60 numerical simulations are presented in table 3 corresponding to different values of bedload factor f b l d 0 0 25 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 and erosion rate e 0 0 1 1 5 2 2 5 1 0 2 kg m 2 s the same values are used for 1b and 1c cases moreover the nrmse values see eq 28 of concentration profiles as well as the normalized nrmse and bss of bed evolution at 100 x 175 are presented n r m s e c is the linear average of the nrmse values of each vertical concentration profile and in general it increases with the erosion rate parameter however this did not affect the procedure of choosing the best values since the best cases are chosen considering the final bed profile rather than concentration profiles on the other hand the lowest n r m s e b e d values are obtained when f b l d 0 4 0 6 or 0 8 which is consistent with our best choice considering the relatively small variation of nrmse values moreover bss is closer to unity with higher erosion rates fig 10 shows the distribution of bar height evolution maximum value of z b f z b i on the y axis versus cross shore bar migration horizontal displacement x b a r f x b a r i on the x axis in fig 10 a for lip1b the symbol is in the upper left quadrant corresponding to an offshore bar migration with an increase in bar height evolution while in fig 10 b for lip1c the symbol is in the upper right quadrant corresponding to an onshore bar migration also with an increase in bar height evolution in these figures each symbol type represents a simulation performed with a given value of the bedload factor f b l d while each color corresponds to a given value of the erosion rate e 0 for the lip1b erosion case fig 10 a shows that with the exception of e 0 0 kg m 2 s all model results are in the correct quadrant and as expected both the offshore bar migration and bar height evolution increase with erosion rate as the erosion rate increases from 10 2 to 2 5 1 0 2 kg m 2 s the sensitivity of the model prediction to bedload coefficient decreases significantly for the lip1c accretion case fig 10 b shows a weaker sensitivity than in 1b case consistently in 1c also higher erosion rate leads to less onshore migration but with the decrease of bar height evolution it is interesting to note that in both the erosion and accretion cases the increase in the bedload factor moves the bed shoreward and upward in the absence of suspended load in the erosion case in 1b the increase in the bedload factor tends to increase only the height of the bar with little shoreward movement while in 1c lower erosion rate leads to higher sensitivity to the bedload coefficient although the two selected parameters move the sandbar in opposite directions increasing one does not have the same effect as decreasing the other the main difference is in their effects on sand accumulation for example considering the case of f b l d e 0 0 8 0 015 with the symbol in blue color in lip1b increasing e 0 from 0 015 to 0 02 kg m 2 s with the symbol in cyan color increases the offshore migration of the bar while accumulating sand on the bar crest bar sharpening on the other hand decreasing f b l d from 0 8 to 0 6 with the symbol in blue also leads to an increase in the offshore bar migration but lowers the bar height evolution during the migration process bar smoothing this is because wave related onshore transport even when dominated by current related offshore transport nevertheless contributes to the convergence of sand on the bar however when bedload transport dominates decreasing the bedload coefficient and increasing the erosion rate have the same effects with more sensitivity on bedload coefficient 6 2 contribution of bedload and suspended load to total sand transport in this section a sediment transport budget allows us to separate the transport analysis of the bedload by the adapted santoss formulation and the suspended load transport by the flow model to improve our understanding of the simulated sandbar migration fig 11 illustrates the contribution of each mechanism to total sand transport transport here means flux divergence over the sandbar for both erosion and accretion cases in this figure sediment is removed accumulated in regions with positive negative signs in both cases bedload transport is negative on the offshore side of the bar and positive in the lee side conversely suspended load divergence is positive on the offshore side of the bar and negative on lee side opposite signs to bedload transport around the sandbar as expected the total transport follows the same pattern as the suspended load in 1b and the bedload in 1c as in each case there is a dominant mechanism both transport mechanisms are stronger in 1b than in 1c note that these patterns compare well with a similar analysis performed with a wave resolving model marchesiello et al 2021b although for 1c the present wave averaged model gives lower values for suspended load and higher for bedload the reason may be due to differences in the bottom shear stress in the two models concerning the erosion case 1b the morphological evolution results from the balance between bedload and suspended load which have nearly the same order of magnitude on the bar crest suspended load contribution is positive while bedload is negative with slightly smaller value leading to a net accumulation of sand in the inner bar suspended load contribution is negative while bedload is positive with slightly smaller value leading to a net erosion of sand overall the morphodynamic evolution during erosion case is controlled by suspended load with bedload playing a secondary role by opposing the effect of suspended load in the accretion case suspended load has almost no effect the morphodynamic evolution is almost entirely controlled by bedload 6 3 near bed wave skewness and asymmetry in section 6 2 we discussed the contribution of bedload in the sediment budget in this section the cross shore profile of near bed wave nonlinearity which is the main driver of bedload transport is explained fig 12 in this figure both normalized and absolute values of wave skewness and asymmetry are illustrated for both cases of 1b and 1c in our model normalized plots are calculated using the formulations proposed by ruessink et al 2012 and the absolute values are obtained by multiplying the normalized values by local root mean squared velocity u r m s the absolute values therefore show larger differences between 1b and 1c than the normalized values ruessink et al 2012 used the ursell number doering and bowen 1995 to describe the variability of wave skewness and asymmetry as a function of wave length wave height and water depth u r h λ 2 h 3 according to ruessink et al 2012 asymmetry and skewness reach their maximum at about ur 2 and 10 respectively by definition the negative values of asymmetry indicate that the waves pitch forward therefore when the ursell number exceeds the value of 2 the skewness decreases while the asymmetry continues to increase this is consistent with our results as shown in fig 12 the right axes of the bottom panels show the cross shore profile of ursell number the waves propagating from deep water begin to become skewed starting from x 20 m for both cases before they become asymmetric starting from x 40 m for both cases however in the shoaling zone cross shore changes of absolute skewness is smaller than those of asymmetry over the bar skewness slightly decreases while asymmetry reaches its maximum with a relatively sharp change this emphasizes the effective role of asymmetry on bedload as the cross shore positions of maximum bed evolution and asymmetry peak coincide in addition it suggests that the magnitude of absolute skewness and asymmetry in bedload transport plays a stronger role than their cross shore distribution the same behavior is observed in the wave resolving model marchesiello et al 2021b 6 4 comparison of full and adapted santoss formula in their publication van der a et al 2013 state that the santoss formula is built to model wave and current driven sand transport in the wave boundary layer including both bedload and suspended load i e the total transport for non breaking waves and relatively weak mean currents sand transport can be assumed to occur entirely within the wave boundary layer and the transport formula therefore describes the total transport rate for these conditions however for stronger conditions if there is a significant amount of sediments in suspension above the sheet flow layer or the bedload layer a separate suspended load model based on an advection diffusion equation for the mean concentration evolution c x z t needs to be solved e g soulsby 1997b to avoid double counting the near bed sand transport due to mean currents van der a et al 2013 recommend canceling the sediment transport by the suspended load model in the wave boundary layer in the present work we take a slightly different approach in which the suspended load model is active even in the near bed region including a representation of bottom streaming with the typical vertical resolution we use δ z b 3 cm above the bar crest current related transport is assumed to be essentially resolved by the suspension model under typical flow conditions above the bar crest lip1b the undertow generates a typical shields number θ 0 8 and suspension number w s u 0 4 u is the bed friction velocity for such flow conditions current driven bedload only represents about 5 of the total current driven transport roberts et al 2003 which justifies our modeling approach in lip1c wave related transport becomes dominant and even a higher percentage of bedload transport by currents remains a secondary process to verify our model and justify our hypothesis a sensitivity analysis to the sediment transport model parameters with the full santoss formula is presented below fig 13 b illustrates the behavior of the full santoss formulation for predicting sandbar migration in the accretion case 1c using the same calibration parameters as with the adapted formulation proposed here in this case the full formulation predicts a seaward migration of the bar of about 5 m instead of the observed shoreward migration of 3 m it also stretches the terrace offshore contrary to observation even without suspended load i e e 0 0 the full santoss formula is not able to reproduce the onshore bar migration in the absence of suspended load the bedload transport by currents in santoss is the only mechanism responsible for offshore bar migration contrary to the flume experiment the onshore transport due to wave skewness and asymmetry is thus much weaker in the model than the current related offshore transport compare the green and magenta lines in fig 13 b note that it may be possible to achieve onshore migration in 1c by reducing the contribution of currents in the full santoss using a scaling factor alphac implemented in croco as in coawst and not discussed in this paper thereby minimizing the undertow effect however perhaps as long as the near bed resolution is sufficient it may be more realistic and less reliant on another unknown parameter to separate the undertow and wave contributions in a wave averaged depth resolving model as suggested in this paper in the erosion case 1b fig 13 a maintaining the same tuning parameters as those obtained for the adapted santoss formula the full formula leads to an overestimation of the offshore sandbar migration a more accurate prediction of offshore transport can only be made when the suspension model is disabled i e e 0 0 this result confirms our hypothesis that using current related sediment transport in santoss duplicates the contribution of the undertow since in our simulation the suspended load is resolved incidentally similar results can be obtained in 1b by adjusting the erosion rate in the suspended load model and turning off bedload transport reflecting the dominance of suspended load transport in this case the results presented in this section illustrates one of the difficulties in deriving a sand transport formula for depth resolving wave averaged models accounting for waves and currents in two separate models this difficulty is less noticeable in depth averaged models where the suspended load is strongly parameterized but at the cost of reduced genericity i e a higher need for calibration in depth resolved models most of the suspended load is resolved and as explained above at least under the flow conditions studied here this is the dominant contribution from current driven transport however in the general case our current model may underrepresent some of the near bed transport by the currents further work is needed to address this issue and this is left as a prospect 6 5 further model verification finally the model is tested against the sands experiments eichentopf et al 2018 without further calibration the results for both erosion and accretion cases are presented in fig 14 in the top panel the model correctly predicts the dominant offshore direction of sandbar migration and the cross shore position of the sand pickup and amalgamation in this case the wave height and period are h s t p 0 53 m 4 14 s in the accretion case h s t p 0 32 m 5 44 s which results in onshore sand transport as illustrated in the lower panel here again the model reproduces the observed accretion in a realistic way in summary the present simulations describe a sandbar that is driven onshore by wave related bedload transport and offshore by current related suspended load transport calibrating these two processes separately makes it possible to show that in the erosive case the model is robust to changes in the bedload factor provided that the erosion rate coefficient is within a realistic range of values similarly in the accretion phase the cross shore position of the sandbar is well predicted and not overly sensitive to the bedload factor in a given range e g from 0 6 to 1 this suggests that the model captures enough mechanisms not to strongly rely on the calibration parameters such robust model behavior in predicting bar migration is essential for predicting beach morphodynamics on time scales of days to weeks including upstate and downstate sequences this is of course beyond the scope of this study but the results presented here are a first step on which to build future research 7 conclusion in this paper we applied a depth resolving wave averaged morphodynamic model to the sandbar migration in the nearshore the novelty of the approach lies in the usage of the half wave cycle concept sand transport formula namely santoss van der a et al 2013 to predict on offshore sandbar migration depending on the wave conditions i e accretion erosion cases we studied separately the effects of the main transport drivers undertow wave nonlinearity and phase lag between mobilization and transport which allowed us to better understand the respective contributions of each mechanism in the present model we have separated the current driven suspended load and the wave driven near bed load contributions to the total sand transport this has improved the understanding of their functioning leading to either onshore or offshore sandbar migration without tuning the empirical parameters differently for the two cases in the erosive case 1b both mechanisms exist but suspended load transport by the current is dominant in contrast in the accretion case 1c near bed transport by waves is dominant isolating the effects of velocity skewness asymmetry on onshore transport allows us to observe the coincident position of maximum bed evolution and a distinct peak in wave asymmetry this suggests that the magnitude of the wave nonlinearity rather than its distribution is the dominant factor on the other hand the model shows negligible sensitivity to phase lag between mobilization and transport at different wave half cycles this was expected since in this study the beach is made of medium rather than fine sand for which phase lag effects at the laboratory scale are not expected additionally wave streaming slightly increases the onshore migration of the bar in both cases 1b and 1c and generates slightly taller bar crests all of these results were obtained by disabling the contribution of currents to bedload in the wave boundary layer a limitation that needs to be better evaluated and understood nevertheless our present adaptation of the santoss formulation for 3d wave averaged models allows for the first time to predict the onshore offshore sandbar migration under storm and post storm conditions using the same set of parameters as a major perspective of this work the model should now be applied to the morphological evolution of natural 3d beaches i e adding longshore variations to validate the good

23802,the ability to model bar migration in the nearshore zone is critically important for predicting coastal morphology we present a cost effective wave averaged 3d model croco with parameterization of wave related bedload transport adapted santoss and evaluate calibrate its performance in comparison with data measured in a two dimensional wave channel in this model suspended load transport both in and above the wave bottom boundary layer is resolved by the flow model we assume that if the tuning parameters are not robust to varying forcing conditions the parameterization can be considered a failure the present work is therefore a first step towards a numerical model capable of predicting the onshore and offshore migration of a sandbar under storm and post storm conditions using the same set of parameters one way to achieve this goal is to treat the effects of waves and currents in separate formulations to avoid conflicts and redundancy we show that the implementation and adaptation of santoss in croco can achieve this goal provided that the hydrodynamics are accurately reproduced and the separation between the wave related bedload and current related suspended load formulations is respected keywords beach morphology surf zone bed load sediment load sandbar migration beach erosion accretion data availability the code and data will be made open source after publication 1 introduction sediment transport due to waves and currents plays a crucial role in the morphology and ecosystem of coastal areas waves can change coastal morphology in any direction depending on hydrodynamic and morphological conditions sandy beaches are among the areas most rapidly affected by various environmental conditions they are continuously subjected to waves that result in the creation of sandbars near the shoreline therefore sandbars are the primary indicator of cross shore sediment transport in most cases and can migrate onshore or offshore their contribution to wave breaking is considerable and they can therefore serve as a beach protection mechanism many studies have explored the drivers of the motion of coastal sediment particles e g van rijn et al 2013 the processes responsible for shoreward transport are wave related wave streaming wave skewness and asymmetry and stokes drift while the undertow is the main driver of offshore motion henderson et al 2004 wave streaming is the near bed onshore mean eulerian flow caused by waves propagating towards the beach longuet higgins 1953 the stokes drift is the difference between the lagrangian and eulerian flow velocities stokes 1880 van den bremer and breivik 2018 and a nonlinear wave form is described by skewness sharp high peaks and broad shallow troughs and asymmetry steep front faces and mild sloped back faces elgar 1987 henderson et al 2004 the undertow is the wave average seaward current that moves under the trough of the waves it is the result of the balance between the radiation stress gradient due to breaking waves the turbulent shear stress and the cross shore pressure gradient due to wave set up johnson 1919 dyhr nielsen and sørensen 1970 hansen and svendsen 1985 the final balance of these wave and current forcing determines the net direction of coastal particle transport leading to sandbar migration in many of the cases e g elgar et al 2001 hoefel and elgar 2003 hsu et al 2006 one of the key phenomena influencing the role of each process mentioned above is the position of wave breaking in particular whether the waves break onshore or offshore of the sandbar symonds and bowen 1984 roelvink and stive 1989 henderson et al 2004 in particular this affects the cross shore distribution of breaker induced undertow which is considered in many studies as a key player on bar formation e g dyhr nielsen and sørensen 1970 dally and dean 1984 stive and battjes 1985 stive 1987 breakers can also increase the onshore bedload transport through their effect on wave asymmetry and skewness and near bed turbulence however the magnitude of this onshore forcing relative to the offshore forcing by the undertow depends on other parameters such as the breaker type e g ting and kirby 1994 the shear stress caused by near bottom flows triggers sediment mobilization while currents and nonlinear waves move the near bed sediments however there is no exact boundary between bed and suspended load and the bedload boundary layer is rather an arbitrary mathematical definition the resultant balance of these transport modes determines the direction i e onshore or offshore of the bar migration with the increase of the bed shear stress the particles start to roll and slide fredsoe and deigaard 1992 if the shear velocity surpasses a threshold the particles will detach from the bed and depending on their horizontal velocities e g due to turbulent eddies and vertical velocities e g due to settling velocity they may settle on the bed or stay suspended fredsoe and deigaard 1992 in sediment transport modeling the bed elevation is obtained using the exner equation which includes bedload transport parameterization and pickup and settling rate of the suspended sediment the sediment concentration is obtained using a suspended tracer advection diffusion equation coupled with the hydrodynamic model through the velocity field warren and bach 1992 lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 e g in suspended load models the sediments enter exit the flow domain through a source sink term in the bottom layer the bedload transport is coupled with the flow model through either near bottom velocity or shear stress amoudry 2008 the most commonly used bedload transport models are those of meyer peter and müller 1948 van rijn et al 1993 soulsby and damgaard 2005 van der a et al 2013 and their capabilities are studied by various researchers the averaging approaches have been a major restriction to the applicability range of these models for instance rafati et al 2021 successfully used xbeach roelvink et al 2009 a depth averaged model to predict the offshore bar migration during storms however onshore migration could not be simulated using the same set of parameters one approach to solving this problem is to use 3d models that solve the vertical flow structure such as delft3d lesser et al 2004 success may again be limited in predicting beach accretion due to wave averaging procedure and inability of the bedload model to represent the effects of wave asymmetry van rijn et al 2011 to finally predict the correct direction of sandbar migration the santoss transport formula van der a et al 2013 which follows the wave half cycle concept to account for wave asymmetry and skewness was implemented in delft3d veen et al 2014 van der werf et al 2015 their model reproduced both onshore and offshore directed sandbar migration but erosion and accretion conditions had to be calibrated separately possibly due to an overspecification of undertow transport in the bedload formulation the present study builds on the mixed success of delft3d using santoss but applying it to the coastal and regional ocean community croco model debreu et al 2012 marchesiello et al 2021a which is based on the regional oceanic modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the first attempt to add suspended sediment transport equations to roms was done by blaas et al 2007 for the southern california shelf warner et al 2008 supplemented the roms shelf sediment transport model with a bedload formulation and then implemented wave averaged equations using at first a three dimensional radiation stress formulation to address nearshore problems warner et al 2010 next the successful implementation of vortex force formalism by uchiyama et al 2010 was adopted by many others bennis et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 and implemented in all versions of roms and most notably in croco marchesiello et al 2015 for wave forcing croco can be fully coupled to either a ray theory spectrum peak wave propagation model uchiyama et al 2010 or a more comprehensive spectral model i e the third generation wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 in all roms related models mentioned above bedload is calculated using either meyer peter and müller 1948 or soulsby and damgaard 2005 models one of the main challenges of these models is to estimate their average contribution over each wave period this leads to a poor representation of the effects of waves on bedload transport i e velocity and acceleration skewness as a result bedload transport is underestimated by the model and fitting parameters are used to compensate for this defect e g rafati et al 2021 this problem can be solved as in the santoss formulation of van der a et al 2013 by using the half cycle concept e g dibajnia and watanabe 1992a camenen and larson 2005 the half cycle approach enables the model to calculate the amount of sediment mobilized and transported in each half cycle of the wave therefore provided an accurate estimate of the wave shape is given the model can reasonably calculate the net sand transport due to wave asymmetry and skewness as well as phase lag between mobilization and transport at the intra wave cycle the sand entrained by the bed shear stress during a half wave cycle is transported in the other direction during the next half wave cycle this makes the model more physically sound more robust and less dependent on the calibration of parameters as already mentioned the santoss formulation has been implemented in delft3d but also more recently in roms coawst kalra et al 2019 on which the implementation in croco is based modeling the evolution of the sandbar cross shore profile has been a popular but challenging topic among coastal engineers studying the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the surf zone older models are reviewed by roelvink and broker 1993 focusing on a process based approach that explicitly accounts for actual physical processes although the various models use similar governing equations their application are often specific due to differences in parameterization numerical algorithms and boundary conditions spielmann et al 2004 van rijn et al 2013 some specific target include wave energy conditions bathymetric complexity or duration of the desired simulation for example focusing on long term evolution the model of walstra et al 2012 successfully captured the dominant mechanisms in bar growth and decay for short term bar migration spielmann et al 2004 proposed various effective parameters on bar migration in an erosion case while hsu et al 2006 developed a model more suitable for the prediction of onshore bar migration however all of these models were limited to either offshore or onshore migration and were heavily dependent on the calibration of empirical parameters in contrast hoefel and elgar 2003 specifically considered wave induced forcing and successfully simulated onshore bar migration but their model failed under offshore bar migration conditions with more success the models of zheng et al 2014 and rafati et al 2021 predicted both onshore and offshore bar migrations but again they used different values of the fitting parameters to achieve this result this brief review of the literature reveals that a comprehensive hydro morphodynamic model capable of predicting onshore offshore bar migration is still lacking the present work aims at developing and implementing a comprehensive 3d nearshore model to predict the onshore and offshore sandbar migration under storm and post storm conditions without the need to modify the setting parameters to achieve this goal the sediment transport model must be sufficiently extensive to represent the dominant transport processes under each forcing condition in this paper we take a first step by evaluating the ability of the model to predict sandbar migration in a two dimensional wave channel 2dv environment we will demonstrate that the implementation of the santoss transport formula within croco is a reliable and robust solution provided that hydrodynamics are accurately reproduced and that a proper separation between wave and current forcing in the bedload and suspended load formulations is respected this manuscript is structured as follows in section 2 the hydrodynamic and sediment transport model equations are presented the hydrodynamics are modeled by a set of 3d wave averaged equations with wave current interactions coupled with a ray theory spectrum peak wave propagation model the model description for sediment transport and morphodynamic evolution follows with suspended load transport equations and bedload wave related transport parameterization using the santoss formulation in section 3 the numerical configuration including bathymetry and boundary forcing is explained then section 4 presents the hydrodynamic calibration procedure the main results of the model are presented in section 5 where the main drivers of sandbar migration are discussed the discussion is then completed in sections 6 and 7 providing the concluding remarks of this study 2 model formulation in this paper the coastal and regional ocean community croco model is implemented to study the morphological modeling of sandy beaches including hydrodynamics waves sediment transport and morphology a non hydrostatic version of the model is available that can explicitly solve for surface waves marchesiello et al 2021a b but we rely here on a more traditional and less computationally expensive wave averaged approach eulerian wave averaged

model that includes the effect of currents on waves rather than ww3 the spectrum resolving wave model the velocity field is used to carry the suspended load blaas et al 2007 while the recent santoss

stokes equations transformed into a terrain following coordinate system here with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations as in roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 debreu et al 2012 the wave effect on currents wec is introduced in the mean flow equations using a vortex force formalism vf mcwilliams et al 2004 rather than the radiation stress representation the effects of wave averaging are divided into bernoulli head gradients i e minus the gradient of the horizontal kinetic energy density of the primary and long waves and a vortex force i e the coupling of the flow vorticity with stokes drift this formalism was fully implemented including non conservative terms of acceleration and dissipation into roms by uchiyama et al 2010 then in croco by marchesiello et al 2015 here we use a simplified set of two dimensional vertical equations neglecting the coriolis force but the implementation including the new bedload transport formula is fully 3d and is tested in a 3d configuration

surf zone only a fraction of the breaker dissipation produces turbulence here we assume 5 while the rest goes to the wave rollers the surface boundary condition for ω is a function of the surface mixing length which is taken as 0 5 h r m s the bottom drag divided by ρ is traditionally introduced as a bottom boundary condition of the vertical mixing term here it is a combined wave current shear

stokes drift velocities no explicit diffusion is required since a third order upstream biased advection scheme is used to reduce both numerical dispersion and diffusion and improve the effective resolution of the model soufflet et al 2016 w s is the settling velocity that can be computed from the empirical formula of soulsby 1997a and blaas et al 2007 ν c t is the turbulent tracer diffusivity including wave effects e s represents the upward erosion flux kg m 2 s modeled as 19 e s 1 p e 0 max τ s f τ c e τ c e 0 where the surface erosion rate e 0 and the critical bed shear stress for

calculated as τ b o t c d eq 10 but with a skin roughness increased by ripples in the bar trough area 2 2 2 morphodynamics the cross shore bed evolution variation in time of z b the height of the bed eq 20 is calculated from the cross shore divergence of sediment fluxes exner equation exner 1925 1931 which results from the difference between erosion and sedimentation of suspended sediments calculated as explained in section 2 2 1 as well as from the divergence of bedload fluxes q b s l o p e which needs to be evaluated separately see section 2 2 3 20 z b t f m o r 1 p q b s l o p e x w s c z e s eq 20 accounts for a morphological acceleration factor f m o r introduced by lesser et al 2004 and the effect of bed slope on the bedload fluxes introduced as a flux correction lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 the concept of morphological acceleration is based on the fact that morphodynamic changes are slower than hydrodynamic ones van rijn 1993 in this case the bed evolution can be accelerated without affecting the hydro morphological solution the avalanche module used to reproduce the gravitational flow of sand when the bottom slope exceeds the critical slope angle is presented in eq 21 lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 21 q b s l o p e q b 0 65 0 65 tan β cos β where q b s l o p e is the modification of q b by considering the effect of the bed slope β tan 1 d z b d x the value 0 65 is derived from the consideration of an angle of repose of 33 2 2 3 bedload transport an adapted santoss formulation the sediment flux q b can be calculated using different bedload models already implemented in croco which are described in warner et al 2008 e g those of meyer peter and müller 1948 or soulsby and damgaard 2005 these models are more suited to continental shelf problems in this paper the near bed total transport formulation santoss proposed by van der a et al 2013 suitable for nearshore applications is adapted to croco a depth resolving wave averaged 3d flow model this adaptation is necessary because at least part of the current related transport mechanisms in santoss are already implemented in croco and are thus duplicated in the bedload transport in the problem addressed in this paper we will see that double counting the effect of currents in santoss leads to unrealistic results while only marginal errors are imparted by neglecting these currents in santoss and relying on the suspended load model for the current related transport therefore here the current related transport is solved by the flow model and the remaining physics i e the bedload transport is parameterized in santoss this formulation is implemented as in kalra et al 2019 and validated against a flume experiment it is based on the half wave cycle concept proposed by dibajnia and watanabe 1992b that captures wave velocity and acceleration skewness and the effect of phase lag between mobilization and transport dohmen janssen et al 2002 in this section we present our adapted version of the santoss model the modifications mainly concern the removal of the wave averaged current effects to keep only the nonlinear wave effects in the formulation in doing so we follow up on the observation by veen et al 2014 that the full santoss model would tend to double count the transport by mean currents in the wave boundary layer if a suspended load transport model is used in combination in the case of onshore bar migration for example i e lip1c this double counting prevents the replication of the onshore bar migration observed in the experiments and even reverses the migration see fig 13 in the brief presentation of the model below we retain the terms associated with wave averaged currents for completeness they are implemented in practice with the option to disable them or not but focus on wave effects the method to obtain sediment transport under asymmetric and skewed waves can be divided into three major steps van der a et al 2013 kalra et al 2019 in the first step the asymmetric waveform based on the ursell number is evaluated using wave statistics the shields parameter for each half cycle of the wave form is computed in the second step finally a phase lag is estimated from the velocity field that determines the amount of bedload transported in the half cycle following the mobilization half cycle the non dimensional bedload transport rate φ is thus given by 22 φ q b s 1 g d 50 3 1 t θ c θ c 1 2 t c ω c c t c 2 t c u ω t c θ t θ t 1 2 t t ω t t t t 2 t t u ω c t where s ρ s ρ ρ s is the density of sand and d 50 is the median grain diameter t t c t t t c u and t t u are the wave period duration of wave crest half cycle duration of wave trough half cycle duration of accelerating flow within the crest half cycle and duration of accelerating flow within the trough half cycle respectively see fig 1 for definitions θ c and θ t represent the shields numbers associated with the wave crest and trough half cycles the sand load transported during the crest period is the combination of ω c c mobilized during the crest period and ω t c mobilized during the trough period similarly ω t t and ω c t are the sand load transported during the trough period mobilized during the trough and crest periods respectively the sand load transported during each half cycle is conventionally modeled according to a power law of shields number 23 ω i max 11 θ i θ c r 1 2 0 where θ c r is the critical shields number soulsby 1997a and hereafter the subscript i is either c for crest or t for trough half cycles to determine ω c t and ω t c i e the portion of the bedload remaining in suspension to be transported in the next half cycle a phase lag parameter is evaluated see van der a et al 2013 for details the shields number for the peak or trough θ i θ t or θ c is calculated according to 24 θ i 1 2 f w δ i u i r u i r s 1 g d 50 u i r is the representative cross shore combined wave current velocity at trough or crest half cycles calculated as 25 u i r u ˆ i 2 u δ where u ˆ i is the peak crest or trough orbital velocities u δ is the steady current velocity at the top of the wave boundary layer f w δ i is the linear wave

given by u ˆ 2 u o r b in eq 26 f δ is the current related friction factor dependent on a current related roughness k s δ and f w i is the wave friction factor calculated separately for the crest and trough half cycles and depends on a wave related roughness k s w see appendix a of van der a et al 2013 for more detail if the representative orbital excursion amplitude a ˆ u ˆ t 2 π is large enough i e greater than 1 587 k s w 27 f w i 0 00251 e 5 21 2 t i u t i 2 6 a ˆ k s w 0 19 otherwise f w i 0 3 if u δ 0 u i r u ˆ i 2 and f w δ i f w i the effect of currents is completely removed from the bedload transport calculation this choice represents our reference configuration to avoid double counting the transport by wave averaged currents the sensitivity to this modeling choice will be shown in the discussion section 6 finally following kalra et al 2019 after calculating φ we apply to q b a bedload factor f b l d bedload coeff in croco this factor allows us to adjust the relative contribution to sediment transport of wave induced bedload compared to the suspended load transported by mean currents in this way we have a better control of the antagonistic mechanisms that govern onshore and offshore transports respectively 3 numerical configuration in this section the initial and boundary conditions as well as the numerical settings of the simulations are presented the lip1b erosion and lip1c accretion cases of the lip11d experiments roelvink and reniers 1995 are used to evaluate and validate the model lip1b and lip1c experiments are conducted sequentially meaning that the final bathymetry of lip1b is the initial bathymetry of lip1c the numerical domain is 201 m long and water depth is 4 1 m the median grain diameter d 50 0 22 mm sand density ρ s 2650 kg m 3 water density ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 and settling velocity w s mm s calculated using soulsby formula the wave boundary conditions including significant wave height and period the dean number and duration of wave generation are provided in table 1 two sets of instruments were used for the measurements fixed and movable by a carriage in this paper the measurements obtained from the velocity meter and suction tubes deployed on the carriage are used to evaluate the modeled cross shore and vertical profiles of velocity and concentration respectively during the lip11d experiment the carriage has been moved cross shore in each wave hour therefore each vertical profile is obtained at different wave hour during the simulation however the simulation results presented in this paper are extracted at half of the total duration of the simulation i e at 9 and 6 5 h for lip1b and lip1c respectively it should be noted that this assumption is a source of errors between the model simulation and the measurements as shown in fig 2 lip1b experiment starts with a developed sandbar after 8 h the bar moves offshore by about 4 m with a slight increase of its height 10 h later it moves 5 m further offshore the crest becomes sharper and about 5 cm higher during this erosion phase the sand seems to be transported mostly from the bar trough and upper shoreface to the offshore side of the bar 18 h after the start of the experiment wave conditions change to the accretion phase table 1 resulting in a 4 m shoreward migration of the bar after 7 h and a 7 cm increase in bar height however over the next 6 h the onshore migration slows down while the bar crest continues to rise by about 5 cm during the accretion phase the sand seems to be transported mostly from the offshore side of the bar to its lee side note that in both cases well developed ripples are apparent on the bar through increasing the roughness of the bottom at this point the numerical domain is discretized using a uniform grid with horizontal resolution of 1 5 m an optimal choice according to a sensitivity analysis not shown longshore gradients are neglected so there is only one grid cell in this direction with terrain following coordinates the number of vertical layers is 20 throughout the domain therefore the heights of the cells in the deep region and around the bar are about 21 cm and 5 cm respectively in the wave model the offshore wave height is forced at the model boundary with values provided in table 1 the significant wave height h s is 1 4 m and 0 6 m for lip1b and lip1c cases respectively the model uses h r m s h s 2 and the peak wave period is 5 and 8 s respectively the resulting dean number ω h s t p w s dean 1973 2018 clearly differentiates the erosion and accretion conditions from the experiments apart from the forcing conditions all other wave model parameters are the same for both cases see next section for the sediment transport model the morphological factors are 18 and 13 for the lip1b and lip1c cases respectively therefore the simulation time is only 1 h in both cases while the real time is accelerated differently without any consequence on the results as confirmed by experiments without morphological acceleration not shown here there are two main calibration parameters to be tuned in the suspended load model the critical bed shear stress τ c e and erosion rate e 0 τ c e is set to 0 18 n m 2 following the empirical relation of soulsby and whitehouse 1997 depending only on grain size which controls the initiation of sand erosion in the suspended load model the range of erosion rate values tested in this paper is 0 e 0 0 025 kg m 2 s note that the grain roughness z 0 s d 50 12 z n o t s in croco is used for the sediment bed roughness the bedload model described in section 2 2 3 has its own empirical formulations for sand mobilization based on grain size and wave statistics we only used one calibration parameter the bedload factor which was tested in the range 0 f b l d 1 4 hydrodynamic calibration in this section before the full hydro morphodynamic simulation the hydrodynamic model is independently calibrated the sediment model is inactive and intermediate bathymetries i e the bathymetry after 8 h for lip1b and 7 h for lip1c cases are used throughout the simulations first the best fit solutions are presented then the most sensitive hydrodynamic parameters are tested and discussed to avoid overload some of the figures are presented in the appendix hydro sensitivity the calibrated hydrodynamic parameters will be used in the morphodynamic calibration section 5 4 1 reference solutions the best parameter values are chosen as those that provide the best model data comparison both using the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 28 value roelvink et al 2009 and qualitatively through figures presented in this paper with major emphasis on the position of the bar crest in both the erosion and accretion phases in eq 28 m stands for measured value and c for computed value represents an averaging operator and σ the associated standard deviation note that the presented nrmse values of velocity are the linear average of the nrmses of each vertical velocity profile 28 n r m s e σ m c max σ m m in fig 3 the top panel compares the vertical profiles of velocity across the beach the middle panel shows the cross shore profile of h r m s and wave set up and the bottom panel shows the near bottom velocity at 10 cm above the bed this figure is obtained by using γ b 0 4 b b 0 6 and α r 1 5 the bottom roughness in the offshore and onshore side of the bar are set to 0 002 and 0 01 m respectively the list of all the parameters tested is presented in table 2 their corresponding normalized rmse values of undertow and wave height are also provided it is important to note that using the same settings for the soulsby transport model soulsby and damgaard 2005 the bar migrates offshore in both cases see the respective results in fig d 1 on the offshore side of the bar in lip1b 60 x 100 the incident waves are already influenced by the bottom and begin to break therefore the wave height decreases as the waves propagate toward the shoreline and the velocity near the bottom used as a proxy for undertow is significant on the other hand in the offshore region of lip1c the incident waves are not large enough to start the breaking process consequently the wave height wave set up and undertow remain unaffected in this region over the bar a strong undertow is generated in both cases stronger in lip1b this is due to strong breaking on the bar that transfers momentum and also causes a drop in wave height and wave set up since lip1b has more incident momentum more of it is transferred on the bar than in lip1c leading to a larger cross shore pressure gradient and stronger undertow the model predicts the wave height and wave set up well in both cases the undertow is also fairly well predicted but the results are more sensitive to the wave breaking parameters as will be shown on the onshore side of the bar in both cases hydrodynamic changes are generally less important the undertow and wave height tend to decrease while the wave set up increases although the presence of a shallow terrace beginning at about x 160 m generates a secondary breakpoint the model follows the observed trend but it seems to underestimate the undertow particularly in lip1b in lip1c the model shows a secondary undertow maximum associated with the secondary breakpoint which is absent in the flume experiment this may reflect a lack of synopticity in the measurements the currents have been measured at different times corresponding to different bathymetries or a modeling issue in the shallow nearshore region e g overestimation of wave setup as can be observed the undertow is underestimated in 1b and overestimated in 1c although the results of each case can be improved by calibrating the wave breaking parameters independently this is the best result we could achieve upon numerous tests using the same parameters for both cases it should be reminded that the lack of synopticity in the measurements is another source of error due to the movement of the bar during the measurement in the lip experiments each velocity profile is measured at different wave hours while we have fixed the bathymetry using the bed profile measured in the middle of the experiment for example activating the sediment transport model strengthens the near bed velocity to 0 29 m s after 5 h from the initial time the same wave hour at which the measurement is conducted this will change the best choice of wave breaking parameters although some studies present simulation results according to the corresponding wave hour of each vertical profile e g marchesiello et al 2021b we present our results obtained in the middle of the simulation time period because they are satisfactory enough 4 2 sensitivity to wave breaking parameters γ b and b b wave breaking parameter γ b controls the cross shore position of the breakpoint fig 4 illustrates the sensitivity of model results to this parameter as expected from eq 7 when γ b is increased the waves tend to break closer to shore and release their energy in shallower water this generally increases the wave height and decreases the wave set up in the surf zone on the offshore side of the bar lip1b is particularly sensitive to γ b because waves start to break earlier in this case due to higher offshore wave height the top panel of fig 4 a shows that at x 65 m an increase of γ b results in a decrease of breaker induced current shear what remains is the eulerian return flow which verifies the lagrangian continuity equation non divergent lagrangian flow due to the delayed breaking with a higher γ b in lip1b there is a large increase in wave breaking on the bar with an increased undertow as a result the breaking pattern in lip1b and lip1c becomes more similar on the contrary for lower γ b the breaking occurs earlier and the offshore points have higher current shear while the onshore points have reduced wave height and undertow on the bar the effects of increasing γ b is opposite for the erosion and accretion cases in lip1b higher γ b moves the breaking point from offshore to the bar crest the higher the γ b is the stronger the undertow becomes in contrast in lip1c with a higher value of γ b wave breaking is stronger inshore of the bar and on the terrace slope which is the sensitive area for lip1c we choose γ b 0 4 as the best compromise in both cases the second tuning parameter in the wave dissipation equation eq 7 is b b it controls the amount of wave energy dissipated during breaking the effects of increasing b b is similar to decreasing γ b throughout the domain and in both cases although the model is less sensitive to b b than γ b the sensitivity of the model to this parameter is shown in fig b 1 b b 0 6 is chosen as the best value to be used in the following 4 3 sensitivity to the bottom roughness length z 0 b another important source of dissipation is the bottom friction eq 10 the logarithmic law of the wall requires for the bottom stress a value for the bottom roughness length z 0 b eqs 11 and 13 this coefficient affects both current and wave induced friction however the friction force due to waves is about one order of magnitude larger than that due to mean currents in the present case in this model due to the existence of well developed ripples in the trough area between the bar crest and the terrace fig 2 higher roughness is considered for the onshore side of the bar than that of the offshore side the offshore onshore transition point is set to be at x 140 m in both lip1b and lip1c cases to avoid sharp changes of roughness we use a hyperbolic tangent function the sensitivity of the model to this coefficient is relatively moderate it is illustrated for both erosion and accretion cases in fig 5 for offshore roughness and fig b 2 for onshore roughness as expected z 0 b mostly affects the near bottom velocity higher values lead to lower velocities it should be noted in fig 5 that the sensitivity of h r m s in lip1c is due to the fact that since the wave energy is moderate the dissipation by bottom friction is comparable to that of the wave breaking in this case the best value for offshore z 0 b 2 mm is chosen by giving more weight to the offshore near bottom velocity inshore of the bar the near bottom velocity is over and under estimated in lip1b and lip1c respectively therefore the best compromise is found to be with z 0 b 10 mm for the onshore side of the bar 4 4 sensitivity to bottom streaming and roller fraction two other parameters in eq 4 for which sensitivity analysis has been performed are bottom streaming eq 6 and roller fraction eqs 5 and 17 as the sensitivity of the results to these parameters are weaker than those to γ b and offshore z 0 b the results are shown in the appendix section rather than in the main text figs b 3 and b 4 bottom streaming is a wave averaged eulerian shoreward flow caused by phase differences in horizontal and vertical orbital velocities occurring in the wave boundary layer longuet higgins 1953 xu and bowen 1994 therefore this term tends to counteract the undertow near the bottom note that the original santoss formulation also accounts for wave streaming but we have neglected it here since it is already accounted for in the flow model uchiyama et al 2010 the roller fraction α r is the fraction of energy transferred from the waves to the rollers during wave breaking thus expanding the surf zone shoreward compared to a local transfer at the breakpoint without roller α r 0 the undertow is localized on the bar crest using a value of α r higher than 1 is unconventional as it implies getting some of the roller energy from the mean flow however it acts as an additional breaker delay roelvink et al 1995 that seems particularly relevant to the breaking process on a sandbar as we observe in fig b 4 in the measurement wave breaking effect on the near bed velocity is spread throughout the inner surf zone while in the model it is more spatially concentrated over the primary bar this may be due to under prediction of turbulence in the flow model not shown here using a roller fraction greater than unity inserts additional energy into the bores which represents this dissipation delay in the model for this reason we decided to challenge the roller model and choose a value of 1 5 that is greater than unity 5 morphodynamic simulations sandbar migration here we pursue the objective of evaluating the model to predict accretion and erosion conditions with the same set of parameters this capability of the model is tested by doing sensitivity analysis to two tuning parameters following an iterative approach due to the disregard of current effects in the bedload formulation i e our adaptation of the santoss formulation to a 3d flow model this iterative calibration process has become simpler while the current driven offshore bar migration is controlled by the erosion rate in the suspended load formulation the control of wave driven onshore bar migration is achieved by the bedload factor considering the onshore directed migration of the bar we expect the sandbar migration to be controlled by bedload transport in the accretion case consequently in the first step of our iteration procedure we focus on the model sensitivity to the bedload factor in lip1c with no suspended load e 0 0 kg m 2 s second using the bedload factor selected in the first step we find the most realistic erosion rate for lip1b where the suspended load transport is dominant then the same procedure as the first step is repeated using the updated value of the erosion rate this iteration is repeated until the differences in two successive iteration cycles become small enough finally the values by which the model predicts both onshore and offshore sandbar migration are chosen as the best fit case more details are presented in the next section note that the critical bed shear stress for erosion is not considered as a tuning parameter but is calculated using the soulsby formulation as in blaas et al 2007 5 1 sensitivity to the bedload factor as mentioned above we start the morphodynamic calibration procedure by considering zero erosion rate e 0 0 kg m 2 s eq 19 therefore in this case the bed height in eq 20 depends only on near bed transport fig 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the model to the bedload factor with zero suspended load in this figure each part consists of two panels the top panel shows the modeled final bed elevation and compares it with the measured initial and final bed levels and the bottom panel shows the differences between the initial and final bed levels z b i and z b f respectively for both measurement and simulation in lip1c the bar moves onshore fig 6 b which is consistent with the flume experiment with higher bedload factor f b l d a larger mass of sand is moved from the offshore to the lee side of the bar which leads to both onshore migration and amplitude increase of the bar the same phenomenon occurs for the terrace around x 160 m which tends to form a secondary inner bar in the model the bar also moves toward the coast in lip1b which is contrary to the experiment fig 6 a in this case as explained by marchesiello et al 2021b wave asymmetry and skewness are stronger in lip1b than in lip1c resulting in greater wave driven onshore sand transport this shows the considerable importance of the suspended load for the offshore migration of the sandbar see section 5 2 note that a sensitivity numerical experiment not shown without the phase lag between mobilization and transport in the santoss formulation setting ω c t and ω t c to zero in eq 22 indicates that the main driver of wave related transport in these experiments is not the phase lag process because the sand is not fine and settling velocity is high but the net result of wave asymmetry or skewness in what follows we will consider wave nonlinearity as the dominant process of wave related sediment transport along with wave streaming effects consequently we start the iteration process by considering f b l d 0 6 in our sensitivity test to erosion rate explained in the next section in the second cycle of our iteration procedure after choosing the best erosion rate for lip1b e 0 0 02 kg m 2 s we reconnect the suspended load transport in lip1c the results are not drastically changed but the undertow even under these moderate conditions requires a compensating increase in f b l d from 0 6 to 0 8 for better comparison to the data f b l d 0 8 is chosen as the final value due to its slightly better results compare figs 7 and c 2 yet in lip1c the f b l d 0 case shown in fig c 1 b confirms that suspended load transport plays a minor role in sandbar migration although it contributes more significantly to terrace shape in lip1b the addition of suspended load transport is so overwhelming that it changes the direction of the bar migration while decreasing the sensitivity to the bedload factor compare fig c 1 a with fig 6 a the wave driven onshore bar migration becomes a minor process in comparison with the current driven offshore migration associated with suspended load however neglecting bedload transport results in an overestimation of the offshore bar migration 5 2 sensitivity to erosion rate the second step in each cycle of the calibration procedure is to adjust the erosion rate to obtain the most accurate offshore bar migration possible retaining the best bedload factor from the first step f b l d 0 6 fig 7 a illustrates how the prediction of the offshore bar migration in lip1b is improved by considering the suspended load the vertical sand concentration profiles of lip1b is shown in fig 8 these profiles are obtained in the middle of the simulation period while the corresponding measurements had been acquired with a wider spread in the sampling period again the lack of synopticity is a source of discrepancy between the model and the experiments since the change in bathymetry during the experiment affects the hydro sedimentary fields however in general the sand concentration and its vertical gradients are well simulated confirming the ability of the 3d flow model to simulate mixing processes in lip1c as already discussed in section 5 1 the low sand concentration and low undertow make e 0 kg m 2 s have even less impact on the bar and its most notable effect is on the terrace note that as expected with e 0 0 kg m 2 s the concentration is zero throughout the domain during the simulations of lip1b and lip1c not shown fig 8 shows that on the offshore side of the bar stronger erosion rate e 0 results in an increase in suspended sand concentration on the bar as expected from the sand source term in eq 18 therefore the undertow transports a larger amount of sand offshore leading to a greater offshore bar migration without notable change in the bar amplitude on the other hand in lip1c the erosion rate does not affect the position of the bar crest although it affects the bar shape and associated distribution of sand around the crest one reason is that the undertow in lip1c is weaker and restricted to the inshore side of the bar as also observed by marchesiello et al 2021b using a wave resolving model vertical turbulent mixing is also lower which does not promote suspended sediment transport and limits it to a local area the inshore side of the bar finally as mentioned the suspended sediment transport is dominant in lip1b making it less sensitive to the bedload factor 5 3 optimization of the morphological calibration this section proves the ability of the model to predict onshore and offshore sandbar migration using the same model tuning parameters choosing the most suitable values for erosion rate e 0 and bedload factor f b l d is tricky because deviation of the simulation from measurement varies spatially across the beach a classical metric to evaluate the quality of a morphological prediction is the bss sutherland et al 2004 defined as follows brier et al 1950 29 b s s 1 v a r c m 0 v a r m f m 0 where v a r is the variance of the quantity between brackets m 0 stands for initial measured bed profile m f for final measured bed profile and c for computed bed profile the bss relates the variance of the difference between data and model to the variance of the data bss 1 means perfect skill bss 0 means no skill bss 0 means model is worse than no change scenario roelvink et al 2009 considering error metrics nrmse and bss see table 3 as well as the position of bar crest and maximum bed evolution see fig 9 altogether we chose the best values to be 0 02 kg m 2 s and 0 6 for erosion rate and bedload coefficient respectively although using f b l d 0 8 i e run 23 predicts the cross shore position of the bar slightly better it leads to negative value of bss in lip1c the reason is that the measured bed evolution is small on the offshore toe of the primary bar and in the shallow region while our model has the largest errors in those regions consequently despite the fact that both cases predict the bar position well run 22 is preferred considering that it has the higher bss for both lip1c bss 0 142 and lipb1b bss 0 142 respectively these values are considered to be reasonable fair and good excellent prediction according to sutherland et al 2004 note that in fig 9 the bottom panel illustrates the vertical concentration profiles at their corresponding position in the domain both the offshore and onshore bar migration lip1b and lip1c respectively are generally well predicted by the model in lip1b the offshore side of the bar follows the same bed profile as in the experiment but the model overestimates the accumulation of sand in the lee side this excessive sand deposition is reflected in an overestimation of sand concentration near the bottom this overestimation also appears in lip1c both on the bar and the terrace as mentioned earlier one reason may be the lack of synopticity in the data for example in lip1b the near bottom concentration 5 cm above the bed at x 138 m decreases from 6 9 g l fig 9 a to 3 6 g l when viewed at 5 h from the initial state the same wave hour at which the concentration is measured however another reason in low energy conditions especially in the shallow waters of the terrace may be the overestimation of the undertow as a results of the overestimation of wave height see section 4 1 that increases the bed shear stress and erosion flux e s 6 discussion in this section we will further explain the improvements this study provides to our understanding of sandbar transport modeling first we will use the maximum bed evolution peak as a proxy to sandbar migration to better assess the sensitivity of the results to bedload and suspended load coefficients next we will use a sand transport budget to assess the contributions of bedload and suspended load section 6 2 and evaluate the role of wave nonlinearity parameters in the onshore transport process section 6 3 then the improvements associated with the modification of the santoss formulation will be discussed finally we will test the performance of the model with the same parameters on another laboratory experiment of cross shore sand transport 6 1 model robustness to better assess the robustness of the onshore offshore bar migration prediction the result of 60 numerical simulations are presented in table 3 corresponding to different values of bedload factor f b l d 0 0 25 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 and erosion rate e 0 0 1 1 5 2 2 5 1 0 2 kg m 2 s the same values are used for 1b and 1c cases moreover the nrmse values see eq 28 of concentration profiles as well as the normalized nrmse and bss of bed evolution at 100 x 175 are presented n r m s e c is the linear average of the nrmse values of each vertical concentration profile and in general it increases with the erosion rate parameter however this did not affect the procedure of choosing the best values since the best cases are chosen considering the final bed profile rather than concentration profiles on the other hand the lowest n r m s e b e d values are obtained when f b l d 0 4 0 6 or 0 8 which is consistent with our best choice considering the relatively small variation of nrmse values moreover bss is closer to unity with higher erosion rates fig 10 shows the distribution of bar height evolution maximum value of z b f z b i on the y axis versus cross shore bar migration horizontal displacement x b a r f x b a r i on the x axis in fig 10 a for lip1b the symbol is in the upper left quadrant corresponding to an offshore bar migration with an increase in bar height evolution while in fig 10 b for lip1c the symbol is in the upper right quadrant corresponding to an onshore bar migration also with an increase in bar height evolution in these figures each symbol type represents a simulation performed with a given value of the bedload factor f b l d while each color corresponds to a given value of the erosion rate e 0 for the lip1b erosion case fig 10 a shows that with the exception of e 0 0 kg m 2 s all model results are in the correct quadrant and as expected both the offshore bar migration and bar height evolution increase with erosion rate as the erosion rate increases from 10 2 to 2 5 1 0 2 kg m 2 s the sensitivity of the model prediction to bedload coefficient decreases significantly for the lip1c accretion case fig 10 b shows a weaker sensitivity than in 1b case consistently in 1c also higher erosion rate leads to less onshore migration but with the decrease of bar height evolution it is interesting to note that in both the erosion and accretion cases the increase in the bedload factor moves the bed shoreward and upward in the absence of suspended load in the erosion case in 1b the increase in the bedload factor tends to increase only the height of the bar with little shoreward movement while in 1c lower erosion rate leads to higher sensitivity to the bedload coefficient although the two selected parameters move the sandbar in opposite directions increasing one does not have the same effect as decreasing the other the main difference is in their effects on sand accumulation for example considering the case of f b l d e 0 0 8 0 015 with the symbol in blue color in lip1b increasing e 0 from 0 015 to 0 02 kg m 2 s with the symbol in cyan color increases the offshore migration of the bar while accumulating sand on the bar crest bar sharpening on the other hand decreasing f b l d from 0 8 to 0 6 with the symbol in blue also leads to an increase in the offshore bar migration but lowers the bar height evolution during the migration process bar smoothing this is because wave related onshore transport even when dominated by current related offshore transport nevertheless contributes to the convergence of sand on the bar however when bedload transport dominates decreasing the bedload coefficient and increasing the erosion rate have the same effects with more sensitivity on bedload coefficient 6 2 contribution of bedload and suspended load to total sand transport in this section a sediment transport budget allows us to separate the transport analysis of the bedload by the adapted santoss formulation and the suspended load transport by the flow model to improve our understanding of the simulated sandbar migration fig 11 illustrates the contribution of each mechanism to total sand transport transport here means flux divergence over the sandbar for both erosion and accretion cases in this figure sediment is removed accumulated in regions with positive negative signs in both cases bedload transport is negative on the offshore side of the bar and positive in the lee side conversely suspended load divergence is positive on the offshore side of the bar and negative on lee side opposite signs to bedload transport around the sandbar as expected the total transport follows the same pattern as the suspended load in 1b and the bedload in 1c as in each case there is a dominant mechanism both transport mechanisms are stronger in 1b than in 1c note that these patterns compare well with a similar analysis performed with a wave resolving model marchesiello et al 2021b although for 1c the present wave averaged model gives lower values for suspended load and higher for bedload the reason may be due to differences in the bottom shear stress in the two models concerning the erosion case 1b the morphological evolution results from the balance between bedload and suspended load which have nearly the same order of magnitude on the bar crest suspended load contribution is positive while bedload is negative with slightly smaller value leading to a net accumulation of sand in the inner bar suspended load contribution is negative while bedload is positive with slightly smaller value leading to a net erosion of sand overall the morphodynamic evolution during erosion case is controlled by suspended load with bedload playing a secondary role by opposing the effect of suspended load in the accretion case suspended load has almost no effect the morphodynamic evolution is almost entirely controlled by bedload 6 3 near bed wave skewness and asymmetry in section 6 2 we discussed the contribution of bedload in the sediment budget in this section the cross shore profile of near bed wave nonlinearity which is the main driver of bedload transport is explained fig 12 in this figure both normalized and absolute values of wave skewness and asymmetry are illustrated for both cases of 1b and 1c in our model normalized plots are calculated using the formulations proposed by ruessink et al 2012 and the absolute values are obtained by multiplying the normalized values by local root mean squared velocity u r m s the absolute values therefore show larger differences between 1b and 1c than the normalized values ruessink et al 2012 used the ursell number doering and bowen 1995 to describe the variability of wave skewness and asymmetry as a function of wave length wave height and water depth u r h λ 2 h 3 according to ruessink et al 2012 asymmetry and skewness reach their maximum at about ur 2 and 10 respectively by definition the negative values of asymmetry indicate that the waves pitch forward therefore when the ursell number exceeds the value of 2 the skewness decreases while the asymmetry continues to increase this is consistent with our results as shown in fig 12 the right axes of the bottom panels show the cross shore profile of ursell number the waves propagating from deep water begin to become skewed starting from x 20 m for both cases before they become asymmetric starting from x 40 m for both cases however in the shoaling zone cross shore changes of absolute skewness is smaller than those of asymmetry over the bar skewness slightly decreases while asymmetry reaches its maximum with a relatively sharp change this emphasizes the effective role of asymmetry on bedload as the cross shore positions of maximum bed evolution and asymmetry peak coincide in addition it suggests that the magnitude of absolute skewness and asymmetry in bedload transport plays a stronger role than their cross shore distribution the same behavior is observed in the wave resolving model marchesiello et al 2021b 6 4 comparison of full and adapted santoss formula in their publication van der a et al 2013 state that the santoss formula is built to model wave and current driven sand transport in the wave boundary layer including both bedload and suspended load i e the total transport for non breaking waves and relatively weak mean currents sand transport can be assumed to occur entirely within the wave boundary layer and the transport formula therefore describes the total transport rate for these conditions however for stronger conditions if there is a significant amount of sediments in suspension above the sheet flow layer or the bedload layer a separate suspended load model based on an advection diffusion equation for the mean concentration evolution c x z t needs to be solved e g soulsby 1997b to avoid double counting the near bed sand transport due to mean currents van der a et al 2013 recommend canceling the sediment transport by the suspended load model in the wave boundary layer in the present work we take a slightly different approach in which the suspended load model is active even in the near bed region including a representation of bottom streaming with the typical vertical resolution we use δ z b 3 cm above the bar crest current related transport is assumed to be essentially resolved by the suspension model under typical flow conditions above the bar crest lip1b the undertow generates a typical shields number θ 0 8 and suspension number w s u 0 4 u is the bed friction velocity for such flow conditions current driven bedload only represents about 5 of the total current driven transport roberts et al 2003 which justifies our modeling approach in lip1c wave related transport becomes dominant and even a higher percentage of bedload transport by currents remains a secondary process to verify our model and justify our hypothesis a sensitivity analysis to the sediment transport model parameters with the full santoss formula is presented below fig 13 b illustrates the behavior of the full santoss formulation for predicting sandbar migration in the accretion case 1c using the same calibration parameters as with the adapted formulation proposed here in this case the full formulation predicts a seaward migration of the bar of about 5 m instead of the observed shoreward migration of 3 m it also stretches the terrace offshore contrary to observation even without suspended load i e e 0 0 the full santoss formula is not able to reproduce the onshore bar migration in the absence of suspended load the bedload transport by currents in santoss is the only mechanism responsible for offshore bar migration contrary to the flume experiment the onshore transport due to wave skewness and asymmetry is thus much weaker in the model than the current related offshore transport compare the green and magenta lines in fig 13 b note that it may be possible to achieve onshore migration in 1c by reducing the contribution of currents in the full santoss using a scaling factor alphac implemented in croco as in coawst and not discussed in this paper thereby minimizing the undertow effect however perhaps as long as the near bed resolution is sufficient it may be more realistic and less reliant on another unknown parameter to separate the undertow and wave contributions in a wave averaged depth resolving model as suggested in this paper in the erosion case 1b fig 13 a maintaining the same tuning parameters as those obtained for the adapted santoss formula the full formula leads to an overestimation of the offshore sandbar migration a more accurate prediction of offshore transport can only be made when the suspension model is disabled i e e 0 0 this result confirms our hypothesis that using current related sediment transport in santoss duplicates the contribution of the undertow since in our simulation the suspended load is resolved incidentally similar results can be obtained in 1b by adjusting the erosion rate in the suspended load model and turning off bedload transport reflecting the dominance of suspended load transport in this case the results presented in this section illustrates one of the difficulties in deriving a sand transport formula for depth resolving wave averaged models accounting for waves and currents in two separate models this difficulty is less noticeable in depth averaged models where the suspended load is strongly parameterized but at the cost of reduced genericity i e a higher need for calibration in depth resolved models most of the suspended load is resolved and as explained above at least under the flow conditions studied here this is the dominant contribution from current driven transport however in the general case our current model may underrepresent some of the near bed transport by the currents further work is needed to address this issue and this is left as a prospect 6 5 further model verification finally the model is tested against the sands experiments eichentopf et al 2018 without further calibration the results for both erosion and accretion cases are presented in fig 14 in the top panel the model correctly predicts the dominant offshore direction of sandbar migration and the cross shore position of the sand pickup and amalgamation in this case the wave height and period are h s t p 0 53 m 4 14 s in the accretion case h s t p 0 32 m 5 44 s which results in onshore sand transport as illustrated in the lower panel here again the model reproduces the observed accretion in a realistic way in summary the present simulations describe a sandbar that is driven onshore by wave related bedload transport and offshore by current related suspended load transport calibrating these two processes separately makes it possible to show that in the erosive case the model is robust to changes in the bedload factor provided that the erosion rate coefficient is within a realistic range of values similarly in the accretion phase the cross shore position of the sandbar is well predicted and not overly sensitive to the bedload factor in a given range e g from 0 6 to 1 this suggests that the model captures enough mechanisms not to strongly rely on the calibration parameters such robust model behavior in predicting bar migration is essential for predicting beach morphodynamics on time scales of days to weeks including upstate and downstate sequences this is of course beyond the scope of this study but the results presented here are a first step on which to build future research 7 conclusion in this paper we applied a depth resolving wave averaged morphodynamic model to the sandbar migration in the nearshore the novelty of the approach lies in the usage of the half wave cycle concept sand transport formula namely santoss van der a et al 2013 to predict on offshore sandbar migration depending on the wave conditions i e accretion erosion cases we studied separately the effects of the main transport drivers undertow wave nonlinearity and phase lag between mobilization and transport which allowed us to better understand the respective contributions of each mechanism in the present model we have separated the current driven suspended load and the wave driven near bed load contributions to the total sand transport this has improved the understanding of their functioning leading to either onshore or offshore sandbar migration without tuning the empirical parameters differently for the two cases in the erosive case 1b both mechanisms exist but suspended load transport by the current is dominant in contrast in the accretion case 1c near bed transport by waves is dominant isolating the effects of velocity skewness asymmetry on onshore transport allows us to observe the coincident position of maximum bed evolution and a distinct peak in wave asymmetry this suggests that the magnitude of the wave nonlinearity rather than its distribution is the dominant factor on the other hand the model shows negligible sensitivity to phase lag between mobilization and transport at different wave half cycles this was expected since in this study the beach is made of medium rather than fine sand for which phase lag effects at the laboratory scale are not expected additionally wave streaming slightly increases the onshore migration of the bar in both cases 1b and 1c and generates slightly taller bar crests all of these results were obtained by disabling the contribution of currents to bedload in the wave boundary layer a limitation that needs to be better evaluated and understood nevertheless our present adaptation of the santoss formulation for 3d wave averaged models allows for the first time to predict the onshore offshore sandbar migration under storm and post storm conditions using the same set of parameters as a major perspective of this work the model should now be applied to the morphological evolution of natural 3d beaches i e adding longshore variations to validate the good

23803,the slope area northeast of taiwan island in the southern east china sea ecs is well known as a hotspot for both internal tides and internal solitary waves isws despite uncertainties regarding their specific source and generation mechanism this study investigates the generation and evolution processes of internal tides and isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs based on a super high resolution and non hydrostatic numerical simulation isws create a complex spatial pattern in both satellite images and our simulation with wave propagation in multiple directions including onshore and offshore these isws with the largest amplitudes reaching 50 m are mainly generated by two mechanisms local tide topography interactions and disintegration of internal tides remotely generated over i lan ridge locally generated isws propagate in various directions owing to the complex topography whereas isws generated by the disintegration of remote internal tides are more consistent in their pathways strong barotropic to baroclinic energy conversions occur over both mien hua canyon and north mien hua canyon for the baroclinic tidal energy fluxes the advection flux is comparable to the pressure work term in shallow water while the pressure work flux dominates in deep water the nonlinear energy flux terms in shallow water are more important for the supertidal than the tidal signals the semidiurnal energy flux features a clockwise pattern over the double canyon region indicating the formation of partial standing waves keywords internal solitary waves internal tides mitgcm the southern east china sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ocean internal solitary waves isws and internal tides broadly distributed in the global ocean have been investigated by cruise observation lien et al 2014 mackinnon et al 2017 rayson et al 2019 satellite remote sensing zhao et al 2016 zheng et al 2007 and numerical simulations ansong et al 2015 arbic et al 2018 buijsman et al 2016 2020 zhang et al 2022 previous investigations have revealed that internal tides and isws induce strong mixing and impact water mass exchange boegman and stastna 2019 lin and song 2014 talipova et al 2013 waterhouse et al 2014 xu et al 2016 you et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 most previous studies on isws and internal tides were focused on the continental shelves and slopes alford et al 2015 cai et al 2012 guo and chen 2014 li et al 2016 nash et al 2004 xu et al 2011 as well as underwater ridges buijsman et al 2010a b while recent efforts have attempted to examine their behaviour over complex bottom topography particularly the submarine canyons aslam et al 2018 vlasenko et al 2014 waterhouse et al 2017 submarine canyons are important topographical features affecting internal wave generation and dissipation e g hall and carter 2011 vlasenko et al 2014 recently nazarian et al 2021 estimated the tide driven dissipation in the global submarine canyons and found a large fraction of the incoming tide s energy was dissipated in the canyon to date most canyon research has focused on internal tides e g chang et al 2019 hall and carter 2011 while isws near the canyons have rarely been investigated canyons over the continental slope and shelf northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs have been found to radiate energetic semidiurnal internal tides chang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 isws also occur frequently in this region and propagate in various directions as revealed by synthetic aperture radar sar measurements alpers et al 2005 hsu et al 2000 this suggests multiple isw sources duda et al 2013 hsu et al 2000 hsu et al 2000 proposed that these isws were generated in association with the tides and upwelling induced by the kuroshio intrusion however their proposed mechanism cannot reasonably explain the multiscale and multidirectional characteristics of the observed isws the complex corrugated topography particularly the double canyon system is an important factor influencing internal wave generation and evolution which was not adequately addressed by hsu et al 2000 isws on continental slopes may originate from both local and remote sources min et al 2019 duda et al 2013 suggested that some isws on the continental shelf northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs may originate from the disintegration of northward propagating internal tides from i lan ridge area based on a modis satellite image duda et al 2013 found an isw packet with a long crest that was unaligned with local bathymetric contours suggesting a possible remote source for the isw packet further simulation results e g lien et al 2013 confirmed i lan ridge as a potential energy source area for internal tides however further investigation is required to confirm whether the internal tides generated at i lan ridge can arrive at the northern continental slope and shelf region and disintegrate into isws in this study we carry out a super high resolution non hydrostatic simulation to examine the generation and propagation of internal tides and isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs the double canyon system provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the effects of complex topographies on internal wave characteristics e g shoaling and dissipation the model setup and verification are described in section 2 in section 3 the investigation of sources and generation mechanisms of isws are described the internal tide energetics are discussed in section 4 finally we provide a discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model setup the numerical simulation is performed using the nonlinear non hydrostatic massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 to resolve nonlinear isws the horizontal grid size is set to 50 m in the focus area and increases to 4 km near the lateral boundaries of the domain fig 1b the domain of the numerical experiment is discretised with 1368 1200 computational cells in the horizontal and the experiment requires 32 wall clock days or 221000 cpu hours 288 processors are used to provide the results analysed in this study according to vitousek and fringer 2011 the grid leptic ratio λ δ x h 1 where δ x represents the horizontal grid spacing and h 1 is the pycnocline depth should be less than 1 to ensure the relative dominance of physical dispersion over numerical dispersion the pycnocline depth in our focused area is about 50 60 m so the horizontal resolution of 50 m satisfies the grid requirement proposed by vitousek and fringer 2011 to the best of our knowledge the horizontal grid resolution of 50 m is the finest compared to recent similar three dimensional 3d regional

baroclinic tides is calculated as 11 c p h t w b t q h t w b t where w b t u h h is the vertical component of barotropic velocity to focus on the semidiurnal and diurnal internal tides the simulated results are semidiurnal band pass filtered 10 16 h and diurnal band pass filtered 20 28 h the supertidal signals are obtained by high passing the simulated results with a period of less than 10 h 2 3 model verification 2 3 1 barotropic tide the tidal velocity ellipses of the m 2 and k 1 constituents show good consistency between the model results and the tpxo china seas solution fig 2a and c the major axes of the m 2 tidal ellipses are primarily perpendicular to the isobaths indicating a cross shelf flow during the flood phase m 2 barotropic tides propagate northwest from the okinawa trough to the continental slope and shelf region the m 2 barotropic tidal velocities on the continental shelf reach 0 8 m s 1 the k 1 tidal velocity is much smaller than the m 2 component only 0 1 m s 1on the continental shelf the agreement between the model results and the tpxo solution shows that our simulation can replicate barotropic tides in the region northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs with reasonable accuracy 2 3 2 baroclinic tides to verify the accuracy of the model in simulating internal tides we calculate the baroclinic energy fluxes and compare them to observations by lien et al 2013 red arrows in fig 2b the model results are generally consistent with the mooring results fig 2b the modelled magnitude and direction of the energy fluxes are almost identical to those of the mooring results at the five stations the semidiurnal energy flux is also generally consistent with the mooring results of yang et al 2020 their fig 1b internal tides generated from the double canyons form a mesoscale gyre energy flux pattern as shown in fig 2b the diurnal energy flux is smaller than the semidiurnal energy flux fig 2d with a magnitude of 0 5 kw m 1 compared to 10 kw m 1 for the semidiurnal energy flux therefore the semidiurnal internal tide is dominant in this region and is the focus of this study 2 3 3 kuroshio current the modelled time mean meridional velocity and temperature along pcm 1 section are shown in fig 3a the meridional velocity can reach 1 m s 1 in the upper ocean along the transect shown in fig 3a the structures of the meridional velocity and tilted thermoclines are generally consistent with the hycom results fig 3b and the observations of johns et al 2001 and zhang et al 2001 thus the model can generally capture basic geostrophic background circulation 3 results 3 1 isw distribution and characteristics as shown in fig 4 the isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs exhibit a complex distribution pattern both the sar image and vertical velocity at a depth of 60 m in the simulation indicate multiple isw propagation directions numerous isw packets exist on the continental slope and shelf region northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs some isw packets collide with each other during their propagation e g near site 1 in fig 4b the propagation of these isws is more complex than those of other regions e g the northeastern south china sea this may be due to the complex variations in bottom topography including two canyons and other small topographic features as well as remotely generated internal waves most isw wavefronts are relatively short varying from 5 to 20 km fig 4 the short wavefront characteristics of isws in northeast taiwan island differ from those in the northeastern south china sea zhao et al 2004 the propagation directions of northeast taiwan island isws are rather complex and both onshore and offshore propagating isws are generated some isws propagate northwest to the continental shelf some northeast and some propagate southeast into deeper water their different characteristics are discussed later in this paper 3 2 general propagation paths to study the propagation paths and evolution of isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs a series of simulation results are analysed the overlaid signatures of the main wave paths of roughly 2 days are shown in fig 5 with a vertical velocity magnitude at 60 m depth more than 0 01 m s 1 we draw the wavefronts of the leading waves for every wave packet at one hourly intervals the number beside each wavefront in fig 5 indicates the time in hours after the start of the model run we depict the wave paths in two plots and in different colours to clarify the evolution of isws from different sources short lived waves those that exist for 6 h are not shown the simulated propagation patterns of isws are consistent with both satellite patterns alpers et al 2005 hsu et al 2000 and in situ mooring observations duda et al 2013 the waves in fig 5 originate from different sites wave 1 red lines in fig 5a is generated near the mouth of mien hua mh canyon and has a short wavefront as wave 1 propagates to the shallow continental shelf its wavefront gradually lengthens wave 1 first propagates northward 82 83 h and then turns north west as it reaches shallower water the change in the propagation direction of wave 1 is likely induced by a combination of topography and background current an eastward propagating isw wave 3 is generated at mh canyon head the wavefront of wave 3 is almost perpendicular to the isobaths this shows that the internal waves propagate both parallel and perpendicular to the shelf break in this area a similar phenomenon is observed at the celtic sea shelf break vlasenko et al 2014 as the time series of the temperature at site 3 from t 109 h to t 112 h in fig 6c show wave 3 disintegrates into a wave packet containing approximately seven isws while passing site 3 the mh and north mien hua nmh canyon regions are found to be hotspots of isws the isws generated in the canyon regions tend to propagate in multiple directions which are different from those in relatively continuous shelf slope areas these isws features found here may exist in other submarine canyons 3 3 time series of internal waves to investigate the detailed properties of the isws the temperature and zonal baroclinic perturbation velocity time series data from the three sites indicated in fig 4b are plotted and displayed in fig 6 site 1 coincides with mooring e3 of site b by duda et al 2013 approximately six isw packets with different amplitudes are shown within one and a half days in fig 6a as shown in fig 5 both wave 2 and wave 4 propagate to site 1 indicating that isws generated at different sources propagate to site 1 the isw amplitude reaches 25 m at site 1 about 1 5 of the local water depth which is comparable with in situ observation of duda et al 2013 similar to site 1 isw packets are shown at site 2 on the continental shelf a rank ordered isw packet with a maximum amplitude of 30 m is shown at the time t 113 h of the model run in fig 6b fewer isw packets are shown at the deep water site site 3 than at sites 1 and 2 on the continental shelf this is probably due to the fewer generation sites in the deep region the amplitude of the isws at the deep site site 3 reaches 50 m e g t 100 h in fig 6c which is greater than that at shallow sites sites 1 and 2 3 4 main source and generation mechanism 3 4 1 isws generated by local tide topography interactions barotropic tides near the double canyon region are relatively strong and perpendicular to the isobaths fig 2 which are suitable for isw generation a southeast propagating isw wave 3 is generated near the head of mh canyon fig 5b the baroclinic velocity and isopycnals along transect a solid black line in fig 5b at different times are shown in fig 7 the inset plot in fig 7b indicates zonal barotropic tidal currents over the continental slope at 122 15 e relatively strong baroclinic motion is generated over the continental slope at t 90 h fig 7a nonlinear internal waves which contain two wave packets propagating in opposite directions are present over the continental slope as indicated by black arrow fig 7a and b we focus on internal waves propagating eastward into deeper water because the barotropic tidal current is directed westward at t 90 h and 91 h inset plot in fig 7b the eastward propagating internal waves are almost trapped over the continental slope fig 7a and b the amplitude of the eastward waves gradually increases during propagation fig 7a d at t 93 h the leading isw has an amplitude of 25 m followed by four isws with smaller amplitudes an isw packet with approximately seven isws is generated at t 94 h the largest isw amplitude is 30 m note that the wavefront of wave 3 is almost perpendicular to the isobaths fig 5b this is due to the barotropic tidal current propagating perpendicular to the isobaths over mh canyon head fig 2a and wave 3 which has a wavefront perpendicular to the canyon rim is generated fig 5b to investigate the isw generation mechanism the froude number is calculated as f r u c where u is the velocity of the barotropic flow and c is the internal wave phase speed that is obtained by numerically solving the sturm liouville equation 12 d 2 w n z d z 2 n 2 z c n 2 w n z 0 13 w n 0 w n h 0 where the w n z is the vertical mode n is the mode number n z is buoyancy frequency and c n is the eigenvalue speed the c can be obtained by c ω ω 2 f 2 c n the maximum froude number is calculated to be 1 5 near the continental slope this froude number indicates that the generation mechanism of wave 3 belongs to the mixed tidal lee wave regime garrett and kunze 2007 vlasenko et al 2005 which is similar to the results of li et al 2011 for the northwestern south china sea and buijsman et al 2010a for the luzon strait 3 4 2 isws generated by disintegration of remote internal tides the i lan ridge is another energetic internal tide source area featuring strong internal tides generated by tide topography interactions fig 8 both southward and northward propagating internal tides are generated we focus on northward propagating internal waves similar to the continental slope area discussed in section 3 4 1 relatively strong baroclinic motions are generated as the barotropic currents flow through i lan ridge fig 8a at t 78 h the barotropic current flows northward over i lan ridge inset plot in fig 8b and an internal wave beam is present red this beam is consistent with the theoretical internal wave beam green dashed line in fig 8a whose slope is calculated using α ω 2 f 2 n z 2 ω 2 where ω is the tidal frequency f is the coriolis frequency and n z is the buoyancy frequency at t 80 h the generated internal tide over i lan ridge propagates northward to a shallower area at 25 34 n the internal tide begins to steepen as the nonlinear effects increase black arrow in fig 8b as the internal tide propagates over the continental slope it steepens and a solitary like wave appears at 25 42 n fig 8c simultaneously an internal wave beam blue colour in fig 8c similar to the one in fig 8a is present over i lan ridge as the barotropic current propagates southward the distance between the subsequent black arrows decreases indicating that the speed of the internal tide decreases as it propagates northward at t 84 h a solitary wave packet is formed at 25 48 n owing to the balance between the nonlinear and dispersion effects fig 8d the maximum isw amplitude is 30 m fig 8d wave 1 is generated by the disintegration of the remote internal tide over i lan ridge fig 5a once internal tides are generated over the i lan ridge they propagate northward to the okinawa trough during northward propagation the internal tides steepen nonlinearly into isws 80 km north of i lan ridge this distance is consistent with satellite observations reported by hsu et al 2000 and alpers et al 2005 the isws finally reach the continental shelf region fig 5a in contrast to wave 3 the wavefront of wave 1 is almost parallel with the isobaths over the continental shelf fig 5 when the internal tides from i lan ridge area propagate to the continental slope their propagation is modified by topography with the wavefront almost parallel to the isobaths two nondimensional parameters are usually used for the description of the internal tide disintegration process li and farmer 2011 the ursell u r number representing the ratio between nonlinearity and non hydrostatic dispersion and the ostrovsky o s number representing the ratio between nonlinearity and rotation they are given by 14 u r o α β a l 2 and 15 o s 24 π 2 c 1 α a f 2 l 2 where α 3 c 1 2 h 0 d w 1 d z 3 d z h 0 d w 1 d z 2 d z β 1 2 c 1 h 0 w 1 2 d z h 0 d w 1 d z 2 d z are the nonlinear parameter and non hydrostatic parameters in the ostrovsky equation respectively a is the wave amplitude l is a representative horizontal scale c 1 is the mode 1 eigenvalue speed and f is the coriolis frequency a large ursell number u r 1 indicates the non hydrostatic effect is relatively small compared to the nonlinearity the nonlinear and rotational effects are in balance for the critical ostrovsky number o s 1 for o s 1 nonlinearity will dominate and the wave will break breaking here refers to that the internal tide steepens and disintegrates into isws whereas rotation will inhibit wave breaking for o s 1 for the semidiurnal internal tides generated over the i lan ridge the amplitude a is 20 m and the horizontal length scale is about 100 km the ursell number is on the order of 104 indicating the non hydrostatic effect is initially small however for the generated isws at the continental shelf region the ursell number drops to o 1 10 due to the reduced width l 1 2 km indicating the important role of the non hydrostatic effect there the ostrovsky number is 2 2 for the semidiurnal internal tides generated over the i lan ridge this ostrovsky number shows that the nonlinear steepening will be dominant and the internal tide will tend to break farmer et al 2009 li and farmer 2011 the normalised breaking time t b is found to be 1 1 according to li and farmer 2011 their fig 6 the breaking time is estimated using t t b f 2 c 1 to be 10 h the breaking distance is calculated as 79 km with a phase speed of 2 2 m s 1 this breaking distance is consistent with our model results fig 8 4 energetics the characteristics of internal tides such as the source of generation direction of propagation can be discussed quantitatively based on their energetics hall et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 kelly and nash 2010 mohanty et al 2018 nagai and hibiya 2015 the barotropic to baroclinic conversion rate and baroclinic energy flux are calculated to investigate the generation and evolution of internal tides northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs 4 1 tidal energy budget to study the contribution of the two canyons to internal tide energetics of the area we compute the tidal energy budget over mh canyon bottom rectangle in fig 9a and nmh canyon upper rectangle in fig 9a owing to the steep topography and relatively strong barotropic tidal currents over mh and nmh canyons these canyons are more favourable for the energy transfer from barotropic to baroclinic motions the mouth and head of mh canyon are energetic sites for the generation of internal tides fig 9a the generation of internal tides at the mouth of mh canyon is stronger than at the head fig 9a negative conversion rates blue colour occur over the two canyons because of the negative covariance between the perturbation pressure at the bottom induced by remote internal tides and local barotropic tidal currents e g buijsman et al 2010b kang and fringer 2012 kelly and nash 2010 zilberman et al 2009 the positive conversion rates indicate multiple internal tidal sources over the double canyon region apart from mh canyon the nmh canyon is also an energy source internal tides are mainly generated at the head of nmh canyon this is different from mh canyon likely because of topographic differences between the two canyons the differences of the conversion rates between the two canyons are mainly because of the difference in barotropic tides and pressure perturbations the first term in eq 11 the hydrostatic term dominates the conversion rate in this area fig a 1 since the non hydrostatic pressure is relatively smaller also can be referred from fig 10c and d the topography is an important factor causing the differences between two canyons the wider mh canyon has only one branch while the nmh canyon has three narrow branches the three branches of the nmh canyon all feature internal tide generation fig 9a the generation of internal tides within one branch can be influenced by the remote internal tides generated from other branches kelly and nash 2010 kerry et al 2013 besides the different bottom topography steepness and barotropic current also contribute to the different conversion rates between the two canyons furthermore the remote internal tides originated from the i lan ridge could also influence the generation of internal tides in the mh canyon and nmh canyon fig 10d the area integrated conversion rate over mh canyon is 1 2 gw internal tides are mainly generated in regions with water depths 1000 m some of the generated internal tidal energy radiates away and some dissipates over the canyon in the mh canyon region the energy flux mainly radiates away from the northern and eastern boundaries the boundary integrated baroclinic tidal energy flux for the northern boundary is 58 7 mw and for the eastern boundary 94 4 mw of internal tide energy radiates away radiated energy is the main source of the observed isws over the continental shelf the internal tidal energy dissipation is also calculated over the canyons fig 9b in mh canyon 95 of the baroclinic tidal energy 1 15 gw is dissipated around the canyon indicating the sourced dissipation feature for nmh canyon the area integrated conversion rate is 0 27 gw which is smaller than that over mh canyon baroclinic energy of 0 07 gw radiates out of nmh canyon and 74 of the baroclinic energy 0 2 gw is locally dissipated 4 2 tidal and supertidal energy flux fields the spatial patterns of the baroclinic tidal and supertidal energy flux are shown to indicate the baroclinic energy propagation patterns in this area figs 10 and 11 first we calculate the different terms of energy flux eq 7 in the tidal band and display them in fig 10 to compare the contributions of the different components because the energy flux due to diffusion is too small it is not shown here as shown in fig 10 the dominant term is the hydrostatic pressure work flux note that the scale of the arrows indicating the flux in fig 10d differs from that in fig 10a c the northward hydrostatic fluxes steer to the east over the double canyon region owing to the topography fig 10d some of the hydrostatic flux propagates to the continental shelf compared to the hydrostatic flux the non hydrostatic flux is relatively small fig 10c the ke advection flux is larger than the ape advection flux in deep water because of the stronger ke than ape of internal waves we take the absolute values of the time mean fluxes in fig 10a d and average them over depth bins of 0 50 m 50 100 m 100 150 m 150 200 m 200 300 m 300 400 m 400 500 m 500 600 m 600 700 m 700 900 m 900 1200 m 1200 1500 m and 1500 2000 m for the area bounded by 25 0 n 26 0 n 122 1 e 123 2 e shown in fig 10a in the region shallower than 100 m the advection flux is comparable to the pressure work flux fig 10e and f however in the region deeper than 600 m the advection flux ke advection ape advection is only 6 of the pressure flux hydrostatic non hydrostatic pressure work this indicates that the advection flux is relatively large in the shallow region and the pressure flux dominates in the deep area similar circumstances occur in the luzon strait buijsman et al 2014 the baroclinic tidal energy can transfer partly into the supertidal band particularly in the continental slope and shelf region lien et al 2005 therefore the supertidal energetics are further analysed unlike the tidal energy flux distribution the supertidal energy fluxes in the continental slope and shelf regions are much larger than those in deep water fig 11 in addition the supertidal energy fluxes do not steer eastward over the double canyon region as the tidal component but further propagate across the continental slope towards the shallower shelf region similar to the tidal energy fluxes the supertidal advection fluxes are much smaller than the pressure fluxes in deep water in the region shallower than 50 m the supertidal advection fluxes are about 6 times stronger than the pressure fluxes fig 11f while the ratio is 0 8 for the tidal energy fluxes fig 10f this indicates that the nonlinear energy fluxes terms are more important for the supertidal than the tidal signals in shallow water 5 discussion the baroclinic tidal dissipation is relatively strong in the mh canyon fig 9b the space and time averaged dissipation rate in the mh canyon region is 8 0 1 0 7 w kg 1 which is larger than that in the la jolla canyon system 3 3 1 0 8 w kg 1 hamann et al 2021 and in the near bottom of monterey canyon 4 0 1 0 8 w kg 1 in the bottom 300 m kunze et al 2012 but is smaller than that in the gaoping canyon 7 1 0 6 w kg 1 lee et al 2009 these differences are probably related to different canyon topographies and incoming internal tide energy magnitudes nazarian et al 2021 previous studies suggest that the formation of standing waves can also contribute to the enhanced dissipation in the submarine canyon hamann et al 2021 waterhouse et al 2017 to study this potential mechanism the tidally averaged semidiurnal horizontal kinetic energy density hke 1 2 ρ 0 u 2 v 2 and ape calculated according to eq 10 are calculated the spatial maps of the depth integrated and period averaged semidiurnal hke and ape with the fluxes overlaid are shown in fig 12 high hke appears at the mouth of mh canyon while high ape appears at the head of mh canyon and the adjacent continental slope fig 12 a clockwise energy flux gyre appears around the centre of high hke with high ape at one quarter wavelength 60 km away these features indicate the formation of partial standing waves in the mh canyon region similar phenomena have been revealed in previous studies e g buijsman et al 2014 martini et al 2007 partial standing waves also occur in nmh canyon with weaker hke and ape than those in mh canyon figs 12 and a 2 in the appendix the vertical section of the ape and hke along the mh canyon thalweg are shown in fig 13 for a progressive semidiurnal internal wave at this latitude 25 3 n the hke and ape satisfy 16 h k e a p e ω 2 f 2 ω 2 f 2 1 5 where ω is the internal tide frequency and f is the coriolis frequency the tidally averaged depth integrated hke and ape along the mh canyon thalweg are sinusoidally oscillating with the distance between the ape and hek peaks 14 km about one quarter of the mode 1 internal tide wavelength 60 km fig 13c this indicates that the partial standing semidiurnal internal tides are formed in mh canyon which can explain the enhanced dissipation in the canyon they are formed due to the superposition of incoming and reflected internal tides in mh canyon since the canyon head is supercritical for semidiurnal internal tides fig 13e two more potential causes of enhanced dissipation in our studied area in addition to standing waves are breaking lee waves legg 2021 and wave wave interactions eden and olbers 2014 from our results we cannot rule out their contributions to the enhancement of dissipation which requires further investigations in combination with observations and simulations 6 conclusions a 3d simulation is used to investigate internal wave generation and evolution northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs the fully nonlinear non hydrostatic mitgcm model is applied and the simulation results are validated utilising observational data from lien et al 2013 and duda et al 2013 due to the complexity of the bottom topography and the relatively strong tidal currents northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs we find that strong isws with amplitudes of 50 m are generated which is consistent with the isws previously observed in this area duda et al 2013 unlike isws in the south china sea isws generated northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs propagate in multiple directions and are either perpendicular to or propagate along the shelf break the mh canyon nmh canyon and adjacent continental shelf break are the main sources of the isws by analysing the froude number the isws generated locally over mh canyon are classified as a mixed tidal lee wave regime in addition to isws generated through local tide topography interactions some isws are also generated by the disintegration of remote internal tides from i lan ridge due to shoaling remote internal tides propagate northward to the okinawa trough and arrive at the continental slope during the propagation isws are formed owing to the disintegration of remote internal tides the isw packets are formed 80 km north of i lan ridge with a distance consistent with prior satellite observations the mh canyon and nmh canyon are strong generation sites of internal tides partial standing waves formed in the double canyon region due to the superstition of incident internal tides and the reflected waves for the baroclinic tidal energy fluxes the advection flux is found to be comparable to the pressure work flux in the shallow area while the pressure work flux dominates in the deep region for the supertidal energy fluxes the ratio between the advective and pressure fluxes in shallow water is much larger than that of the tidal signals the supertidal energy fluxes are strong over the continental shelf and slope region where the nonlinear effects are much more important internal tides and isws can be influenced by the background flows and stratification the kuroshio current shows strong temporal variability to the northeast of taiwan island e g hu et al 2020 the generation and evolution of isws might exhibit variable patterns under different states of the kuroshio current xie et al 2021 have found that background circulation in the northern south china sea can greatly influence the propagation of isws besides the period averaged energy conversion and energy fluxes also changed much with different kuroshio current patterns e g xu et al 2021 the influence of the time varying background flows on internal tides and isws to the northeast of taiwan island requires further investigation credit authorship contribution statement wenjia min

23803,the slope area northeast of taiwan island in the southern east china sea ecs is well known as a hotspot for both internal tides and internal solitary waves isws despite uncertainties regarding their specific source and generation mechanism this study investigates the generation and evolution processes of internal tides and isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs based on a super high resolution and non hydrostatic numerical simulation isws create a complex spatial pattern in both satellite images and our simulation with wave propagation in multiple directions including onshore and offshore these isws with the largest amplitudes reaching 50 m are mainly generated by two mechanisms local tide topography interactions and disintegration of internal tides remotely generated over i lan ridge locally generated isws propagate in various directions owing to the complex topography whereas isws generated by the disintegration of remote internal tides are more consistent in their pathways strong barotropic to baroclinic energy conversions occur over both mien hua canyon and north mien hua canyon for the baroclinic tidal energy fluxes the advection flux is comparable to the pressure work term in shallow water while the pressure work flux dominates in deep water the nonlinear energy flux terms in shallow water are more important for the supertidal than the tidal signals the semidiurnal energy flux features a clockwise pattern over the double canyon region indicating the formation of partial standing waves keywords internal solitary waves internal tides mitgcm the southern east china sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ocean internal solitary waves isws and internal tides broadly distributed in the global ocean have been investigated by cruise observation lien et al 2014 mackinnon et al 2017 rayson et al 2019 satellite remote sensing zhao et al 2016 zheng et al 2007 and numerical simulations ansong et al 2015 arbic et al 2018 buijsman et al 2016 2020 zhang et al 2022 previous investigations have revealed that internal tides and isws induce strong mixing and impact water mass exchange boegman and stastna 2019 lin and song 2014 talipova et al 2013 waterhouse et al 2014 xu et al 2016 you et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 most previous studies on isws and internal tides were focused on the continental shelves and slopes alford et al 2015 cai et al 2012 guo and chen 2014 li et al 2016 nash et al 2004 xu et al 2011 as well as underwater ridges buijsman et al 2010a b while recent efforts have attempted to examine their behaviour over complex bottom topography particularly the submarine canyons aslam et al 2018 vlasenko et al 2014 waterhouse et al 2017 submarine canyons are important topographical features affecting internal wave generation and dissipation e g hall and carter 2011 vlasenko et al 2014 recently nazarian et al 2021 estimated the tide driven dissipation in the global submarine canyons and found a large fraction of the incoming tide s energy was dissipated in the canyon to date most canyon research has focused on internal tides e g chang et al 2019 hall and carter 2011 while isws near the canyons have rarely been investigated canyons over the continental slope and shelf northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs have been found to radiate energetic semidiurnal internal tides chang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 isws also occur frequently in this region and propagate in various directions as revealed by synthetic aperture radar sar measurements alpers et al 2005 hsu et al 2000 this suggests multiple isw sources duda et al 2013 hsu et al 2000 hsu et al 2000 proposed that these isws were generated in association with the tides and upwelling induced by the kuroshio intrusion however their proposed mechanism cannot reasonably explain the multiscale and multidirectional characteristics of the observed isws the complex corrugated topography particularly the double canyon system is an important factor influencing internal wave generation and evolution which was not adequately addressed by hsu et al 2000 isws on continental slopes may originate from both local and remote sources min et al 2019 duda et al 2013 suggested that some isws on the continental shelf northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs may originate from the disintegration of northward propagating internal tides from i lan ridge area based on a modis satellite image duda et al 2013 found an isw packet with a long crest that was unaligned with local bathymetric contours suggesting a possible remote source for the isw packet further simulation results e g lien et al 2013 confirmed i lan ridge as a potential energy source area for internal tides however further investigation is required to confirm whether the internal tides generated at i lan ridge can arrive at the northern continental slope and shelf region and disintegrate into isws in this study we carry out a super high resolution non hydrostatic simulation to examine the generation and propagation of internal tides and isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs the double canyon system provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the effects of complex topographies on internal wave characteristics e g shoaling and dissipation the model setup and verification are described in section 2 in section 3 the investigation of sources and generation mechanisms of isws are described the internal tide energetics are discussed in section 4 finally we provide a discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model setup the numerical simulation is performed using the nonlinear non hydrostatic massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 to resolve nonlinear isws the horizontal grid size is set to 50 m in the focus area and increases to 4 km near the lateral boundaries of the domain fig 1b the domain of the numerical experiment is discretised with 1368 1200 computational cells in the horizontal and the experiment requires 32 wall clock days or 221000 cpu hours 288 processors are used to provide the results analysed in this study according to vitousek and fringer 2011 the grid leptic ratio λ δ x h 1 where δ x represents the horizontal grid spacing and h 1 is the pycnocline depth should be less than 1 to ensure the relative dominance of physical dispersion over numerical dispersion the pycnocline depth in our focused area is about 50 60 m so the horizontal resolution of 50 m satisfies the grid requirement proposed by vitousek and fringer 2011 to the best of our knowledge the horizontal grid resolution of 50 m is the finest compared to recent similar three dimensional 3d regional simulations e g 75 m in guo et al 2021 110 m in raju et al 2021 115 m in vlasenko et al 2018 500 m in lai et al 2019 vertically 70 layers are set with a grid spacing of 6 m in the upper 60 m and increasing to 180 m below 60 m we use the polynomial equation of state eos described by mcdougall et al 2003 known as the mdjwf equation the simulation is run for 8 days from 24 august to 1 september 2009 consistent with the period when large amplitude internal waves are observed duda et al 2013 lien et al 2013 the running period is comparable to those of similar high resolution and non hydrostatic regional simulation studies e g vlasenko et al 2014 the model becomes quasi stabilised after 3 days therefore results from the final 5 days are used for detailed analyses the initial and boundary conditions are derived from hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom data http tds hycom org thredds catalog html chassignet et al 2007 the model is initialised with spatially interpolated hycom monthly averaged data in august 2009 for the subtidal circulation forcing at the open boundaries the model is forced with the hycom monthly averaged data in august 2009 we do not force the model with wind in this study for the tidal forcing at the open boundaries the model is forced with eight major tidal constituents m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 k 1 p 1 o 1 and q 1 the amplitudes and phases of these tides are extracted from the tpxo china seas solution otis http people oregonstate edu erofeevs ys html egbert and erofeeva 2002 zonal barotropic tidal current based on 8 tidal constituents from tpxo china seas solution at 25 5 n 122 5 e is shown in fig 1c the bathymetry data used in the experiment is obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco dataset with a 15 arc second resolution a sponge layer is imposed over 15 grid cells at each lateral boundary to absorb the baroclinic waves propagating out of the domain and minimise the reflection of energy back into the model domain the horizontal diffusivity and viscosity are both set to 10 2 m2 s 1 following vlasenko et al 2018 the vertical viscosity ν and diffusivity κ are calculated according to the pp81 scheme pacanowski and philander 1981 1 ν ν 0 1 α ri n ν b κ ν 1 α ri κ b where ν b 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 and κ b 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 are the background viscosity and diffusivity respectively ν 0 1 5 1 0 2 m 2 s 1 α 5 and n 1 are the adjustable parameters ri n 2 z u z 2 v z 2 is the richardson number u and v are the horizontal velocity components and n z is the buoyancy frequency 2 2 baroclinic energy equations following kang and fringer 2012 the depth integrated period averaged baroclinic energy balance equation can be written as 2 h f c d where f represents the baroclinic energy flux and c denotes the energy conversion rate from barotropic to baroclinic tides d represents dissipation represents the integration from the bottom to the surface and the overbar denotes time averaging the total density is 3 ρ x y z t ρ 0 ρ b x y z ρ x y z t where ρ b is the background density ρ 0 is the constant reference density and ρ is the perturbation density due to wave motions the pressure can be split into hydrostatic p h and non hydrostatic q ρ 0 z η d w d t d z in which w is the vertical velocity parts with p p h q the hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as 4 p h p 0 p b p ρ 0 g η z g z η ρ b d z g z η ρ d z where p 0 is the reference pressure p b is the background pressure p is the perturbation pressure and η is the free surface elevation the horizontal baroclinic velocity u h is calculated as 5 u h z t u h z t u h z u h t where u h z t is the instantaneous velocity u h z is the time mean of the velocity and u h t is the barotropic velocity which is calculated according to the baroclinicity requirement 6 1 h η h η

displacement of the fluid particle due to wave motion the baroclinic energy flux f is calculated for the baroclinic energy budget analysis in section 4 the energy conversion rate from barotropic to baroclinic tides is calculated as 11 c p h t w b t q h t w b t where w b t u h h is the vertical component of barotropic velocity to focus on the semidiurnal and diurnal internal tides the simulated results are semidiurnal band pass filtered 10 16 h and diurnal band pass filtered 20 28 h the supertidal signals are obtained by high passing the simulated results with a period of less than 10 h 2 3 model verification 2 3 1 barotropic tide the tidal velocity ellipses of the m 2 and k 1 constituents show good consistency between the model results and the tpxo china seas solution fig 2a and c the major axes of the m 2 tidal ellipses are primarily perpendicular to the isobaths indicating a cross shelf flow during the flood phase m 2 barotropic tides propagate northwest from the okinawa trough to the continental slope and shelf region the m 2 barotropic tidal velocities on the continental shelf reach 0 8 m s 1 the k 1 tidal velocity is much smaller than the m 2 component only 0 1 m s 1on the continental shelf the agreement between the model results and the tpxo solution shows that our simulation can replicate barotropic tides in the region northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs with reasonable accuracy 2 3 2 baroclinic tides to verify the accuracy of the model in simulating internal tides we calculate the baroclinic energy fluxes and compare them to observations by lien et al 2013 red arrows in fig 2b the model results are generally consistent with the mooring results fig 2b the modelled magnitude and direction of the energy fluxes are almost identical to those of the mooring results at the five stations the semidiurnal energy flux is also generally consistent with the mooring results of yang et al 2020 their fig 1b internal tides generated from the double canyons form a mesoscale gyre energy flux pattern as shown in fig 2b the diurnal energy flux is smaller than the semidiurnal energy flux fig 2d with a magnitude of 0 5 kw m 1 compared to 10 kw m 1 for the semidiurnal energy flux therefore the semidiurnal internal tide is dominant in this region and is the focus of this study 2 3 3 kuroshio current the modelled time mean meridional velocity and temperature along pcm 1 section are shown in fig 3a the meridional velocity can reach 1 m s 1 in the upper ocean along the transect shown in fig 3a the structures of the meridional velocity and tilted thermoclines are generally consistent with the hycom results fig 3b and the observations of johns et al 2001 and zhang et al 2001 thus the model can generally capture basic geostrophic background circulation 3 results 3 1 isw distribution and characteristics as shown in fig 4 the isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs exhibit a complex distribution pattern both the sar image and vertical velocity at a depth of 60 m in the simulation indicate multiple isw propagation directions numerous isw packets exist on the continental slope and shelf region northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs some isw packets collide with each other during their propagation e g near site 1 in fig 4b the propagation of these isws is more complex than those of other regions e g the northeastern south china sea this may be due to the complex variations in bottom topography including two canyons and other small topographic features as well as remotely generated internal waves most isw wavefronts are relatively short varying from 5 to 20 km fig 4 the short wavefront characteristics of isws in northeast taiwan island differ from those in the northeastern south china sea zhao et al 2004 the propagation directions of northeast taiwan island isws are rather complex and both onshore and offshore propagating isws are generated some isws propagate northwest to the continental shelf some northeast and some propagate southeast into deeper water their different characteristics are discussed later in this paper 3 2 general propagation paths to study the propagation paths and evolution of isws northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs a series of simulation results are analysed the overlaid signatures of the main wave paths of roughly 2 days are shown in fig 5 with a vertical velocity magnitude at 60 m depth more than 0 01 m s 1 we draw the wavefronts of the leading waves for every wave packet at one hourly intervals the number beside each wavefront in fig 5 indicates the time in hours after the start of the model run we depict the wave paths in two plots and in different colours to clarify the evolution of isws from different sources short lived waves those that exist for 6 h are not shown the simulated propagation patterns of isws are consistent with both satellite patterns alpers et al 2005 hsu et al 2000 and in situ mooring observations duda et al 2013 the waves in fig 5 originate from different sites wave 1 red lines in fig 5a is generated near the mouth of mien hua mh canyon and has a short wavefront as wave 1 propagates to the shallow continental shelf its wavefront gradually lengthens wave 1 first propagates northward 82 83 h and then turns north west as it reaches shallower water the change in the propagation direction of wave 1 is likely induced by a combination of topography and background current an eastward propagating isw wave 3 is generated at mh canyon head the wavefront of wave 3 is almost perpendicular to the isobaths this shows that the internal waves propagate both parallel and perpendicular to the shelf break in this area a similar phenomenon is observed at the celtic sea shelf break vlasenko et al 2014 as the time series of the temperature at site 3 from t 109 h to t 112 h in fig 6c show wave 3 disintegrates into a wave packet containing approximately seven isws while passing site 3 the mh and north mien hua nmh canyon regions are found to be hotspots of isws the isws generated in the canyon regions tend to propagate in multiple directions which are different from those in relatively continuous shelf slope areas these isws features found here may exist in other submarine canyons 3 3 time series of internal waves to investigate the detailed properties of the isws the temperature and zonal baroclinic perturbation velocity time series data from the three sites indicated in fig 4b are plotted and displayed in fig 6 site 1 coincides with mooring e3 of site b by duda et al 2013 approximately six isw packets with different amplitudes are shown within one and a half days in fig 6a as shown in fig 5 both wave 2 and wave 4 propagate to site 1 indicating that isws generated at different sources propagate to site 1 the isw amplitude reaches 25 m at site 1 about 1 5 of the local water depth which is comparable with in situ observation of duda et al 2013 similar to site 1 isw packets are shown at site 2 on the continental shelf a rank ordered isw packet with a maximum amplitude of 30 m is shown at the time t 113 h of the model run in fig 6b fewer isw packets are shown at the deep water site site 3 than at sites 1 and 2 on the continental shelf this is probably due to the fewer generation sites in the deep region the amplitude of the isws at the deep site site 3 reaches 50 m e g t 100 h in fig 6c which is greater than that at shallow sites sites 1 and 2 3 4 main source and generation mechanism 3 4 1 isws generated by local tide topography interactions barotropic tides near the double canyon region are relatively strong and perpendicular to the isobaths fig 2 which are suitable for isw generation a southeast propagating isw wave 3 is generated near the head of mh canyon fig 5b the baroclinic velocity and isopycnals along transect a solid black line in fig 5b at different times are shown in fig 7 the inset plot in fig 7b indicates zonal barotropic tidal currents over the continental slope at 122 15 e relatively strong baroclinic motion is generated over the continental slope at t 90 h fig 7a nonlinear internal waves which contain two wave packets propagating in opposite directions are present over the continental slope as indicated by black arrow fig 7a and b we focus on internal waves propagating eastward into deeper water because the barotropic tidal current is directed westward at t 90 h and 91 h inset plot in fig 7b the eastward propagating internal waves are almost trapped over the continental slope fig 7a and b the amplitude of the eastward waves gradually increases during propagation fig 7a d at t 93 h the leading isw has an amplitude of 25 m followed by four isws with smaller amplitudes an isw packet with approximately seven isws is generated at t 94 h the largest isw amplitude is 30 m note that the wavefront of wave 3 is almost perpendicular to the isobaths fig 5b this is due to the barotropic tidal current propagating perpendicular to the isobaths over mh canyon head fig 2a and wave 3 which has a wavefront perpendicular to the canyon rim is generated fig 5b to investigate the isw generation mechanism the froude number is calculated as f r u c where u is the velocity of the barotropic flow and c is the internal wave phase speed that is obtained by numerically solving the sturm liouville equation 12 d 2 w n z d z 2 n 2 z c n 2 w n z 0 13 w n 0 w n h 0 where the w n z is the vertical mode n is the mode number n z is buoyancy frequency and c n is the eigenvalue speed the c can be obtained by c ω ω 2 f 2 c n the maximum froude number is calculated to be 1 5 near the continental slope this froude number indicates that the generation mechanism of wave 3 belongs to the mixed tidal lee wave regime garrett and kunze 2007 vlasenko et al 2005 which is similar to the results of li et al 2011 for the northwestern south china sea and buijsman et al 2010a for the luzon strait 3 4 2 isws generated by disintegration of remote internal tides the i lan ridge is another energetic internal tide source area featuring strong internal tides generated by tide topography interactions fig 8 both southward and northward propagating internal tides are generated we focus on northward propagating internal waves similar to the continental slope area discussed in section 3 4 1 relatively strong baroclinic motions are generated as the barotropic currents flow through i lan ridge fig 8a at t 78 h the barotropic current flows northward over i lan ridge inset plot in fig 8b and an internal wave beam is present red this beam is consistent with the theoretical internal wave beam green dashed line in fig 8a whose slope is calculated using α ω 2 f 2 n z 2 ω 2 where ω is the tidal frequency f is the coriolis frequency and n z is the buoyancy frequency at t 80 h the generated internal tide over i lan ridge propagates northward to a shallower area at 25 34 n the internal tide begins to steepen as the nonlinear effects increase black arrow in fig 8b as the internal tide propagates over the continental slope it steepens and a solitary like wave appears at 25 42 n fig 8c simultaneously an internal wave beam blue colour in fig 8c similar to the one in fig 8a is present over i lan ridge as the barotropic current propagates southward the distance between the subsequent black arrows decreases indicating that the speed of the internal tide decreases as it propagates northward at t 84 h a solitary wave packet is formed at 25 48 n owing to the balance between the nonlinear and dispersion effects fig 8d the maximum isw amplitude is 30 m fig 8d wave 1 is generated by the disintegration of the remote internal tide over i lan ridge fig 5a once internal tides are generated over the i lan ridge they propagate northward to the okinawa trough during northward propagation the internal tides steepen nonlinearly into isws 80 km north of i lan ridge this distance is consistent with satellite observations reported by hsu et al 2000 and alpers et al 2005 the isws finally reach the continental shelf region fig 5a in contrast to wave 3 the wavefront of wave 1 is almost parallel with the isobaths over the continental shelf fig 5 when the internal tides from i lan ridge area propagate to the continental slope their propagation is modified by topography with the wavefront almost parallel to the isobaths two nondimensional parameters are usually used for the description of the internal tide disintegration process li and farmer 2011 the ursell u r number representing the ratio between nonlinearity and non hydrostatic dispersion and the ostrovsky o s number representing the ratio between nonlinearity and rotation they are given by 14 u r o α β a l 2 and 15 o s 24 π 2 c 1 α a f 2 l 2 where α 3 c 1 2 h 0 d w 1 d z 3 d z h 0 d w 1 d z 2 d z β 1 2 c 1 h 0 w 1 2 d z h 0 d w 1 d z 2 d z are the nonlinear parameter and non hydrostatic parameters in the ostrovsky equation respectively a is the wave amplitude l is a representative horizontal scale c 1 is the mode 1 eigenvalue speed and f is the coriolis frequency a large ursell number u r 1 indicates the non hydrostatic effect is relatively small compared to the nonlinearity the nonlinear and rotational effects are in balance for the critical ostrovsky number o s 1 for o s 1 nonlinearity will dominate and the wave will break breaking here refers to that the internal tide steepens and disintegrates into isws whereas rotation will inhibit wave breaking for o s 1 for the semidiurnal internal tides generated over the i lan ridge the amplitude a is 20 m and the horizontal length scale is about 100 km the ursell number is on the order of 104 indicating the non hydrostatic effect is initially small however for the generated isws at the continental shelf region the ursell number drops to o 1 10 due to the reduced width l 1 2 km indicating the important role of the non hydrostatic effect there the ostrovsky number is 2 2 for the semidiurnal internal tides generated over the i lan ridge this ostrovsky number shows that the nonlinear steepening will be dominant and the internal tide will tend to break farmer et al 2009 li and farmer 2011 the normalised breaking time t b is found to be 1 1 according to li and farmer 2011 their fig 6 the breaking time is estimated using t t b f 2 c 1 to be 10 h the breaking distance is calculated as 79 km with a phase speed of 2 2 m s 1 this breaking distance is consistent with our model results fig 8 4 energetics the characteristics of internal tides such as the source of generation direction of propagation can be discussed quantitatively based on their energetics hall et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 kelly and nash 2010 mohanty et al 2018 nagai and hibiya 2015 the barotropic to baroclinic conversion rate and baroclinic energy flux are calculated to investigate the generation and evolution of internal tides northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs 4 1 tidal energy budget to study the contribution of the two canyons to internal tide energetics of the area we compute the tidal energy budget over mh canyon bottom rectangle in fig 9a and nmh canyon upper rectangle in fig 9a owing to the steep topography and relatively strong barotropic tidal currents over mh and nmh canyons these canyons are more favourable for the energy transfer from barotropic to baroclinic motions the mouth and head of mh canyon are energetic sites for the generation of internal tides fig 9a the generation of internal tides at the mouth of mh canyon is stronger than at the head fig 9a negative conversion rates blue colour occur over the two canyons because of the negative covariance between the perturbation pressure at the bottom induced by remote internal tides and local barotropic tidal currents e g buijsman et al 2010b kang and fringer 2012 kelly and nash 2010 zilberman et al 2009 the positive conversion rates indicate multiple internal tidal sources over the double canyon region apart from mh canyon the nmh canyon is also an energy source internal tides are mainly generated at the head of nmh canyon this is different from mh canyon likely because of topographic differences between the two canyons the differences of the conversion rates between the two canyons are mainly because of the difference in barotropic tides and pressure perturbations the first term in eq 11 the hydrostatic term dominates the conversion rate in this area fig a 1 since the non hydrostatic pressure is relatively smaller also can be referred from fig 10c and d the topography is an important factor causing the differences between two canyons the wider mh canyon has only one branch while the nmh canyon has three narrow branches the three branches of the nmh canyon all feature internal tide generation fig 9a the generation of internal tides within one branch can be influenced by the remote internal tides generated from other branches kelly and nash 2010 kerry et al 2013 besides the different bottom topography steepness and barotropic current also contribute to the different conversion rates between the two canyons furthermore the remote internal tides originated from the i lan ridge could also influence the generation of internal tides in the mh canyon and nmh canyon fig 10d the area integrated conversion rate over mh canyon is 1 2 gw internal tides are mainly generated in regions with water depths 1000 m some of the generated internal tidal energy radiates away and some dissipates over the canyon in the mh canyon region the energy flux mainly radiates away from the northern and eastern boundaries the boundary integrated baroclinic tidal energy flux for the northern boundary is 58 7 mw and for the eastern boundary 94 4 mw of internal tide energy radiates away radiated energy is the main source of the observed isws over the continental shelf the internal tidal energy dissipation is also calculated over the canyons fig 9b in mh canyon 95 of the baroclinic tidal energy 1 15 gw is dissipated around the canyon indicating the sourced dissipation feature for nmh canyon the area integrated conversion rate is 0 27 gw which is smaller than that over mh canyon baroclinic energy of 0 07 gw radiates out of nmh canyon and 74 of the baroclinic energy 0 2 gw is locally dissipated 4 2 tidal and supertidal energy flux fields the spatial patterns of the baroclinic tidal and supertidal energy flux are shown to indicate the baroclinic energy propagation patterns in this area figs 10 and 11 first we calculate the different terms of energy flux eq 7 in the tidal band and display them in fig 10 to compare the contributions of the different components because the energy flux due to diffusion is too small it is not shown here as shown in fig 10 the dominant term is the hydrostatic pressure work flux note that the scale of the arrows indicating the flux in fig 10d differs from that in fig 10a c the northward hydrostatic fluxes steer to the east over the double canyon region owing to the topography fig 10d some of the hydrostatic flux propagates to the continental shelf compared to the hydrostatic flux the non hydrostatic flux is relatively small fig 10c the ke advection flux is larger than the ape advection flux in deep water because of the stronger ke than ape of internal waves we take the absolute values of the time mean fluxes in fig 10a d and average them over depth bins of 0 50 m 50 100 m 100 150 m 150 200 m 200 300 m 300 400 m 400 500 m 500 600 m 600 700 m 700 900 m 900 1200 m 1200 1500 m and 1500 2000 m for the area bounded by 25 0 n 26 0 n 122 1 e 123 2 e shown in fig 10a in the region shallower than 100 m the advection flux is comparable to the pressure work flux fig 10e and f however in the region deeper than 600 m the advection flux ke advection ape advection is only 6 of the pressure flux hydrostatic non hydrostatic pressure work this indicates that the advection flux is relatively large in the shallow region and the pressure flux dominates in the deep area similar circumstances occur in the luzon strait buijsman et al 2014 the baroclinic tidal energy can transfer partly into the supertidal band particularly in the continental slope and shelf region lien et al 2005 therefore the supertidal energetics are further analysed unlike the tidal energy flux distribution the supertidal energy fluxes in the continental slope and shelf regions are much larger than those in deep water fig 11 in addition the supertidal energy fluxes do not steer eastward over the double canyon region as the tidal component but further propagate across the continental slope towards the shallower shelf region similar to the tidal energy fluxes the supertidal advection fluxes are much smaller than the pressure fluxes in deep water in the region shallower than 50 m the supertidal advection fluxes are about 6 times stronger than the pressure fluxes fig 11f while the ratio is 0 8 for the tidal energy fluxes fig 10f this indicates that the nonlinear energy fluxes terms are more important for the supertidal than the tidal signals in shallow water 5 discussion the baroclinic tidal dissipation is relatively strong in the mh canyon fig 9b the space and time averaged dissipation rate in the mh canyon region is 8 0 1 0 7 w kg 1 which is larger than that in the la jolla canyon system 3 3 1 0 8 w kg 1 hamann et al 2021 and in the near bottom of monterey canyon 4 0 1 0 8 w kg 1 in the bottom 300 m kunze et al 2012 but is smaller than that in the gaoping canyon 7 1 0 6 w kg 1 lee et al 2009 these differences are probably related to different canyon topographies and incoming internal tide energy magnitudes nazarian et al 2021 previous studies suggest that the formation of standing waves can also contribute to the enhanced dissipation in the submarine canyon hamann et al 2021 waterhouse et al 2017 to study this potential mechanism the tidally averaged semidiurnal horizontal kinetic energy density hke 1 2 ρ 0 u 2 v 2 and ape calculated according to eq 10 are calculated the spatial maps of the depth integrated and period averaged semidiurnal hke and ape with the fluxes overlaid are shown in fig 12 high hke appears at the mouth of mh canyon while high ape appears at the head of mh canyon and the adjacent continental slope fig 12 a clockwise energy flux gyre appears around the centre of high hke with high ape at one quarter wavelength 60 km away these features indicate the formation of partial standing waves in the mh canyon region similar phenomena have been revealed in previous studies e g buijsman et al 2014 martini et al 2007 partial standing waves also occur in nmh canyon with weaker hke and ape than those in mh canyon figs 12 and a 2 in the appendix the vertical section of the ape and hke along the mh canyon thalweg are shown in fig 13 for a progressive semidiurnal internal wave at this latitude 25 3 n the hke and ape satisfy 16 h k e a p e ω 2 f 2 ω 2 f 2 1 5 where ω is the internal tide frequency and f is the coriolis frequency the tidally averaged depth integrated hke and ape along the mh canyon thalweg are sinusoidally oscillating with the distance between the ape and hek peaks 14 km about one quarter of the mode 1 internal tide wavelength 60 km fig 13c this indicates that the partial standing semidiurnal internal tides are formed in mh canyon which can explain the enhanced dissipation in the canyon they are formed due to the superposition of incoming and reflected internal tides in mh canyon since the canyon head is supercritical for semidiurnal internal tides fig 13e two more potential causes of enhanced dissipation in our studied area in addition to standing waves are breaking lee waves legg 2021 and wave wave interactions eden and olbers 2014 from our results we cannot rule out their contributions to the enhancement of dissipation which requires further investigations in combination with observations and simulations 6 conclusions a 3d simulation is used to investigate internal wave generation and evolution northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs the fully nonlinear non hydrostatic mitgcm model is applied and the simulation results are validated utilising observational data from lien et al 2013 and duda et al 2013 due to the complexity of the bottom topography and the relatively strong tidal currents northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs we find that strong isws with amplitudes of 50 m are generated which is consistent with the isws previously observed in this area duda et al 2013 unlike isws in the south china sea isws generated northeast of taiwan island in the southern ecs propagate in multiple directions and are either perpendicular to or propagate along the shelf break the mh canyon nmh canyon and adjacent continental shelf break are the main sources of the isws by analysing the froude number the isws generated locally over mh canyon are classified as a mixed tidal lee wave regime in addition to isws generated through local tide topography interactions some isws are also generated by the disintegration of remote internal tides from i lan ridge due to shoaling remote internal tides propagate northward to the okinawa trough and arrive at the continental slope during the propagation isws are formed owing to the disintegration of remote internal tides the isw packets are formed 80 km north of i lan ridge with a distance consistent with prior satellite observations the mh canyon and nmh canyon are strong generation sites of internal tides partial standing waves formed in the double canyon region due to the superstition of incident internal tides and the reflected waves for the baroclinic tidal energy fluxes the advection flux is found to be comparable to the pressure work flux in the shallow area while the pressure work flux dominates in the deep region for the supertidal energy fluxes the ratio between the advective and pressure fluxes in shallow water is much larger than that of the tidal signals the supertidal energy fluxes are strong over the continental shelf and slope region where the nonlinear effects are much more important internal tides and isws can be influenced by the background flows and stratification the kuroshio current shows strong temporal variability to the northeast of taiwan island e g hu et al 2020 the generation and evolution of isws might exhibit variable patterns under different states of the kuroshio current xie et al 2021 have found that background circulation in the northern south china sea can greatly influence the propagation of isws besides the period averaged energy conversion and energy fluxes also changed much with different kuroshio current patterns e g xu et al 2021 the influence of the time varying background flows on internal tides and isws to the northeast of taiwan island requires further investigation credit authorship contribution statement wenjia min

23804,this study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the mediterranean induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions we try to add new insight in the long term climatic timescale identification of affected parts of the mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems indicative of the mediterranean basin during the 21st century to achieve this goal an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established green house gasses emission concentration scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots to this end climate projections and outputs from three regional climate models rcms of the med cordex initiative at the mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re analysis data these atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model mecss for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics sea level elevation and currents thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide gauges our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed moreover a slight reduction of average storm induced mean sea level msl component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0 35 and 0 50 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts venice lagoon gulf of lions northern adriatic and aegean seas etc and the gulf of gabes in its southern part overall the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone differentiations between the two scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima which shows a very stable pattern but more in terms of their magnitudes indicatively a decrease of surge maxima from 30 to 2 can be observed towards the end of the 21st century especially for rcp8 5 driven mecss simulations this is a spatially averaged estimation yet for some specific coastal sites in croatia spain italy and france such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the storm surge maxima might increase from 1 to 22 under different rcm rcp combinations towards the end of the 21st century our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100 the strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts gulfs of valencia and lions ligurian and northern adriatic seas they are followed by mid latitude areas around corsica sardinia the mid zonal italian peninsula and the adriatic and the northern aegean sea the influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for sicily south italy peloponnese crete the southern aegean archipelago and alboran sea the only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern mediterranean littorals are the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta these apply to the 20th century however they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts a projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century is likely the reason for the latter the climate change signal difference of future reference period of the deep cyclones effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions i e sardinia corsica the ligurian and adriatic seas and the entire italian peninsula for all rcm fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century conditionally this is the case for the gulf of valencia the north western african coasts the alboran ionian aegean and libyan sea coasts under specific combinations of rcm rcp forcings on the other hand a possible increase of the mediterranean deep depressions influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the gulf of lions the ionian aegean and levantine sea basins covering the north central and north eastern coasts of africa in general a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid to high storm surge maxima e g aegean ionian gulf of lions or valencia or gabes etc but not the highest throughout the basin e g venice lagoon ligurian adriatic etc in the latter coastal regions however intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges the produced

mediterranean sea is a regional aquatic body that has been identified as a hotspot in terms of possible climatic impacts nicholls and hoozemans 1996 cramer et al 2018 the latter have based on several projected climate change scenarios e g special report on emissions scenarios sres scenarios b1 a1b and a2 for the 21st century giorgi 2006 nicholls 2006 lionello et al 2006a 2014 li et al 2011 anagnostopoulou et al 2014 adloff et al 2015 the mediterranean coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to the climatic variability influencing sea level variations von storch and woth 2008 cid et al 2016 satta et al 2017 to incorporate the regional scale effects and local peculiarities of weather patterns over the basin during the last 20 years researchers have simulated the storm surges in the mediterranean focusing on sea level elevation and hydrodynamics with the use of regional scale barotropic circulation models in long term projection mode based on the output of respective climatic studies e g giorgi and lionello 2008 li et al 2011 carillo et al 2012 jordà et al 2012 gualdi et al 2013 calafat et al 2014 lionello et al 2014 adloff et al 2018 1 1 research theme the immediate environmental impacts of extreme storm surge events can be identified as coastal flooding beach erosion degradation of coastal vegetation and agriculture saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers lagoons and other bodies of freshwater resources nicholls 2010 storm surges can lead to the destruction of coastal infrastructure ports protection works roads and railways and industry built environment and property residential touristic and commercial loss of fauna and human lives with immense societal and economic effects ciavola et al 2011 hallegatte et al 2013 fang et al 2014 wahl et al 2017 hochman et al 2021 lionello et al 2021 boyes and elliott 2019 recently demonstrated the significant issues of coastal management against the storm surge hazard in terms of first responders to the problem on a european scale they pinpointed several low land coastal areas of the mediterranean littoral zone that are threatened by the combination of high tides and storm surges and related inundation these include e g the northern adriatic the venice lagoon the gulf of gabes the northern aegean the western peloponnese in the ionian sea and many greek islands as well as almost all the deltaic areas of egypt france greece italy and spain e g nile po rhone ebro vardar axios rivers etc enríquez et al 2020 have further stressed the need to pay attention to the spatial analysis of storm surge occurrence introducing the spatial footprint notion along coastline stretches withal the peculiarities of the complex topography and highly varying bathymetry in the mediterranean basin have also been identified as a crucial factor for surge induced coastal risk e g due to local hydrodynamic circulation driven by specific aeolian patterns i e lengthy fetch scirocco winds in the adriatic wind canalization in the northern aegean viz persistent etesian winds in the highly exposed central aegean archipelago and mediterranean extratropical cyclones etc lionello et al 2006b sánchez arcilla et al 2008 ullmann and moron 2008 marcos et al 2011 lionello et al 2012 šepić et al 2012 calafat et al 2014 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 cid et al 2016 makris et al 2016 lionello et al 2019 2021 mel et al 2022 most of the studies based on future simulations with barotropic tide surge models under sres a2 a1b and b1 approaches have estimated a general decrease in the frequency and intensity of extreme surge events and attenuation of marine storminess over the entire mediterranean basin towards the end of the 21st century after 2050 with a possible increase of extremes locally only for the early quarter of the 21st century gomis et al 2008 marcos et al 2009 jordà et al 2012 tsimplis and shaw 2010 lionello et al 2012 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc however the projected rising mean sea level msl globally and the local isostatic changes land subsidence combined with low pressure systems affecting by the inverse barometer effect and intense onshore winds blowing in shallow waters and high tides may still induce individual enhanced episodic events of storm surge calafat et al 2022 the latter are likely to inflict catastrophic impacts on many areas of the mediterranean i e the northern aegean sea the eastern ionian coasts the entire adriatic coastline with emphasis on the northern part of it the gulf of gabes the alboran sea the gulfs of valencia and lion the eastern coastal areas of the ligurian sea the nile delta the north eastern levantine sea and the gulf of alexandretta sánchez arcilla et al 2008 snoussi et al 2008 ullmann and moron 2008 mosso et al 2009 krestenitis et al 2011 cid et al 2014 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc all the aforementioned studies discuss in either a concise or a more elaborate manner the model validation approaches and predictive model skill issues that may arise due to erroneous treatment of boundary conditions low resolution of simulations ambiguity of bathymetric data uncertainty in msl owing to eustatic changes and steric effects estimation under climate change conditions and parametric assumptions of physical processes thus herein we follow the same reasonable approach of comparing model simulation output of sea level elevation against field observations by tide gauges for a historical control run period in terms of main statistical measures maxima statistically significant indexes percentiles probabilities of exceedance etc for the simulated field datasets of sea level e g marcos et al 2009 mcinnes et al 2009 jordà et al 2012 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc nevertheless the achieved good skill metrics does not ensure a good model performance for the 21st century climatic projections in terms of timing and magnitude prediction as the storm surge models skill mainly rely on projected atmospheric forcing input given the above the comprehensive analyses of synoptic scale meteorology and climatology over the mediterranean basin are numerous trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 trigo et al 2002a lionello et al 2002 nissen et al 2010 garcies and homar 2011 campins et al 2011 sanchez gomez and somot 2018 velikou et al 2019 tolika et al 2021 and their relation to the occurrence of storm surges has been investigated extensively in recent literature krestenitis et al 2011 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 šepić et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 2018 2020a vousdoukas et al 2016 lionello et al 2019 2021 tolika et al 2021 etc it is found that coastal inundation events are usually caused by enfeebled extra tropical cyclones following the south european extension of the north atlantic storm tracks or by secondary triggered cyclones in the north western mediterranean basin cyclogenetic centre of the gulf of lions the north african cyclogenesis centre can also produce deep depressions pronounced in the east central mediterranean probably affected by climate change signals mid latitude storm tracks and their mediterranean branches towards the adriatic ionian and aegean seas alpert et al 1990 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 flaounas et al 2018 lionello et al 2016 reale and lionello 2013 the main centres of cyclogenesis around and over the mediterranean sea are the genoa aera the saharan cyclonic regions mainly during spring the iberian peninsula thermal lows the aegean sea during winter and spring the eastern black sea region enhanced during summer the leeward regions of the alps and atlas mountains the cyprus cyclone source and the middle eastern centre over syria as an extension of the indian monsoon low maheras et al 2001 makris et al 2016 several characteristic atmospheric low pressure systems exist over the basin in the form of extratropical cyclones induced by deep depressions occasionally termed as medicanes radinovic 1987 cavicchia et al 2014 cid et al 2016 fortelli et al 2021 toomey et al 2022 flaounas et al 2021 such as the recent ianos event lagouvardos et al 2021 androulidakis et al 2022 such severe storm conditions may cause extended damages on the mediterranean coasts driven by sea level elevation due to the combinatory action of storm surges high tides and rough seas long and high waves with large energetic content martzikos et al 2021 past research about related climate change projections for the 21st century based on sres scenarios reveal significant alterations in the occurrence of cyclones and coastal sea level response particularly during winter lionello et al 2008 marcos et al 2011 jordà et al 2012 more recently međugorac et al 2021 found a small probability of significant change in the frequency intensity annual cycle and spatial structure of the local wind status inducing storm surges in the adriatic under the med cordex climate projections independently of the rcm boundary conditions rcp scenarios or future time interval considered moreover reale et al 2022 presented an analysis of mediterranean cyclone characteristics in projected future climatic conditions based on med cordex ensemble of coupled rcsms under rcp8 5 estimating the spatial patterns and cyclone activity in the mediterranean during the 21st century in general the rcsms showed a decrease in the number and an overall enfeeblement of cyclones moving across the mediterranean towards 2100 the authors corroborated the observed cmip5 projections for the area where an obvious increase in the central mediterranean is estimated compared to a decrease in its south eastern part a pronounced inter model discrepancy of rcsm outputs refers to the cyclone adjusted deepening rate seasonal cycle occurrence and associated wind patterns over some areas of the basin ionian sea and iberian peninsula 1 2 study objectives in all the above emphasis was put on the analysis of synoptic scale climatic weather patterns and tidal surge sea level anomalies astronomical tides can be more or less predicted within a deterministic framework in the long run whereas surges and waves and their extremes are estimated to evolve in a stochastic mode during the 21st century driven by projected climate change and have thus been treated probabilistically wahl et al 2012 wahl and chambers 2016 vousdoukas et al 2018 yet what seems to be fairly missing from literature is a long term and basin scale systematic analysis of deep depressions intense low barometric systems and their correlation to storm surges at the entire mediterranean basin s coastal zone e g lionello et al 2019 this motivates the present analysis to focus on coastal sea level variations of mid to short term timescale events but within a climatic 30 years timeframe therefore we engage filtering operations on the used tide gauge data in order to remove long term higher than a month effects of sea level variability prompted by basin scale oscillations planetary or edge waves steric effects and eustatic changes of the mediterranean water masses accordingly herein the storm surge on the coast is defined as the phenomenon that causes temporary short to mid term deviations e g setup of the sea surface height ssh from msl with simultaneous barotropic currents pushing seawater onshore these events usually last from a few hours to a few days having a large spatial extent and they are induced by severe synoptic timescale weather conditions combining the action of wind and sea level pressure slp on the free surface of seawater in local or regional scales meðugorac et al 2018 identifying the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones occurrence in climatic timescales 30 years is relevant to its correlation with coastal impacts and quantification of coastal hazards surges wave run up and floods hence in the present paper we try to recognize the evolution of cyclonic patterns and characteristics under possible future climatic conditions their influence on the coastal sea level response is then determined to assist the mapping of vulnerable littoral areas against possible inundation hazard specifically for the low lying coastal plains therefore the general objective of the paper is to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the mediterranean induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions thus our aim is to add new insight in the climatic scale identification of vulnerable parts of the coastal zones correlated to peculiar atmospheric patterns indicative of the mediterranean basin during the 21st century an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed to achieve these goals by combining projections from available established climate change scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcps with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on exposed coastal zone hotspots to this end climate projections and outputs from several global climate models gcms generating outputs of regional climate models rcms at the mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated the latter atmospheric datasets fed a validated robust storm surge model for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics sea level elevation and currents the proposed methodology incorporates and enhances older numerical simulations of the storm driven hydrodynamic circulation in the entire mediterranean basin with special focus on the meteorologically induced sea level variations on the coastal zone based on mecss model initially set up and presented by de vries et al 1995 further implemented by krestenitis et al 2011 established by androulidakis et al 2015 and enhanced with nested simulations by makris et al 2015 2016 2018 2020a moreover the produced results of the present study have already been used in a focused site specific study integrated within a local scale hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling approach under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century makris et al 2020b skoulikaris et al 2021 the application involved coastal flooding

the study section 6 2 methodology 2 1 study domain the study region refers to the mediterranean basin for both analyses of the climatic and the storm driven hydrodynamic processes especially focusing on the sea level response over the entire mediterranean coastal zone related to storm surge impacts on vulnerable low land littoral areas for this purpose the modelling component of hydrodynamic circulation for storm surges is implemented by a 1 10 1 10 horizontal resolution the entire study area in tandem with the used tide gauge stations for validation are shown in fig 1 the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco http www gebco net was used to build the storm surge model bathymetries with bilinear interpolation into the models ortho regular computational grid with a resolution down to a spatial discretization step of almost dx 10 km the atmospheric forcing namely the winds at 10 m elevation from msl and the slp fields are provided in daily format within the spatial window of fig 1 the mediterranean sea s quite unique character results both from its complex morphology and the specific socio economic conditions highly urbanized littorals of coastal countries in southern europe northern africa and the southwestern anatolian part of asian continent therefore it is a practically enclosed aquatic basin in terms of storm surges and waves confined by the southern european continental land asia minor and the western part of the middle east and north africa connected to the atlantic ocean and the black sea through the very narrow straits of gibraltar and bosporus respectively the mediterranean basin includes several microtidal marginal seas sub basins and has its own peculiar very active regional thermohaline and weather driven circulation patterns the first induced by deep and intermediate dense water formation and convection in the gulf of lions the adriatic the south aegean and the north east levantine adloff et al 2015 and the latter by a specific regional cyclogenetic regime and local aeolian patterns the mediterranean basin is surrounded by a variable coastline and complex continental orography which causes several channelling regional winds e g mistral tramontane bora etesian sirocco etc this defines certain peculiarities in simulating local climatic conditions considering a spread out and strong land sea contrast land atmosphere feedback and intense air sea coupling viz the existence of many mid to large size islands and smaller insular formations e g in aegean archipelago may limit or enhance low level air flow defining local wind patterns etc makris et al 2016 2 2 climatic data the climatic data used as forcing to the hydrodynamic model implementation were retrieved from the med cordex

cordex database includes simulation outputs of different spatial resolutions e g down to 10 km yet at the time of the presented research and modelling implementation the only full climatic datasets

economic activities and policies lifestyles energy uses land use patterns technology developments and climate policies the rcps make projections based on the aforementioned factors and describe four different 21st century pathways of ghg atmospheric concentrations air pollutant emissions and land use in ipcc ar5 moss et al 2010 the rcps include a stringent mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two intermediate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and one scenario with very high ghg emissions rcp8 5 they are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the literature which indicate strong consistent almost linear relationships between cumulative co2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in all rcps and the wider set of proposed mitigation rcp scenarios include timeseries of emissions and concentrations of full suite ghgs aerosols and chemically active gases as well as land use cover moss et al 2008 two out of the four rcps presented in the ipcc ar5 are used herein rcp4 5 is an intermediate stabilization pathway in which radiative forcing is stabilized at approximately 4 5 w m2 and 6 0 w m2 after 2100 assuming constant concentrations after 2150 it describes a possible climate future that depends on modest estimations about greenhouse gases concentrations in coming years rcp8 5 considers radiative forcing that reaches 8 5 w m2 by 2100 and continues to rise for some amount of time assuming constant emissions after 2100 and constant concentrations after 2250 it poses a worst case scenario among the four rcps rcp4 5 can be characterized as a medium stabilization pathway with an estimated increase of temperature by comparison of the future period 2081 2100 to the pre industrial period 1850 1900 of 2 4 c range 1 7 3 2 c on the other hand aiming on estimating the future storm surges under the most pessimistic scenario we also choose rcp8 5 in which the increase of the global mean temperature is estimated to rise to 4 3 c range 3 2 5 4 c according to moss et al 2010 and van vuuren et al 2011 moreover for an easy association with the previous sres scenarios rpc4 5 is mainly similar to b2 low emissions scenario and rcp8 5 with sres a1f1 high emissions scenario 2 3 storm surge model the numerical modelling of maritime hydrodynamics comprises regional scale simulations of the entire mediterranean basin in terms of meteorologically induced ssh and barotropic currents on the coastal zone computations were done with the mediterranean climatic storm surge mecss model krestenitis et al 2011 2014 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 mecss is a long term climatic mode running version of the operational high resolution storm surge hiress model set up in the mediterranean basin krestenitis et al 2015 2017 makris et al 2019 2021 hiress mecss is a 2 d horizontal barotropic hydrodynamic circulation model that solves the depth averaged shallow water equations for the high resolution simulation of storm surges and related flows in large scale enclosed or semi enclosed water bodies de vries et al 1995 krestenitis et al 2011 2014 2015 mecss simulates the meteorologically induced sea level variations and depth averaged currents by considering large scale shear forces on the air seawater interface and the inverse barometer effect thus it takes into account the atmospheric forcing i e zonal and meridional wind fields at 10 m from msl and slp fields the geostrophic effects of the coriolis force the influence of astronomical tides on the open boundaries based on harmonic tidal elevation bottom friction on the seabed and internal friction forces due to horizontal vortices based on the eddy viscosity concept and the smagorinsky model approach makris et al 2015 2021 mecss computations are executed on an ortho regular staggered cartesian grid of the arakawa c type and the chosen numerical scheme of integration is an explicit first order forward time cantered space ftcs algorithm of the finite difference method fdm with small time step dt 30 s to keep a sufficiently low courant number producing output in a 3 hourly time interval over the entire mediterranean computational domain and on the coastal zone cells a contingency file for restart of computations and uninterrupted continuity of simulations is produced systematically in case of numerical blow ups or power failure as simulations are quite demanding in terms of computational resources and time it has been widely implemented in the mediterranean and other similar scale water bodies during the past decade for both climatic type long term simulations and short term operational forecasts of storm surges with ranging resolutions for the entire mediterranean basin e g 1 10 1 10 down to a 5 km horizontal grid and even 1 6 km in shallower water coastal areas viz thermaikos gulf and thesaloniki bay or nestos delta littoral zone in northern greece androulidakis et al 2015 krestenitis et al 2014 2017 makris et al 2016 skoulikaris et al 2021 it has been successfully calibrated and validated in the past to produce reliable estimates of sea level elevation during shallow and deep barometric systems giving acceptable to quite good estimations of negative and positive surges respectively in nearshore areas makris et al 2018 2019 2021 skoulikaris et al 2021 herein we examine the long term inter annual patterns of daily scale peak values of ssh induced by severe events of meteorological tides for which the storm surge impacts on the coast may last from several hours up to a few days depending on the inundation levels and extents makris et al 2020b skoulikaris et al 2021 tolika et al 2021 2 4 detection of deep depressions 2 4 1 identification of the mediterranean low pressure systems the deep depressions low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea have been the subject of numerous studies over the past years however at first their identification and localization were mostly based on empirical methods including the subjectivity of researchers maheras 1983 radinovic 1987 flocas 1988 later and since the 1990 s more objective methodologies were utilized to detect these centres of cyclogenesis at several domains of interest e g alpert et al 1990 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 flaounas et al 2018 over and around the basin according to relevant literature flocas and karacostas 1996 thorncroft and flocas 1997 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 lionello et al 2016 the main areas characterized as cyclogenesis centres related to the mediterranean domain are the following the gulf of genoa the depressions are mainly formed over the downhill sides of the alps presenting quite stable frequency of occurrence throughout the year the gulf of lions as well as the balearic islands region are considered as extensions of the main centre and cannot be considered as separate cyclogenesis centres the region at the south of the mountain range of atlas the most characteristic area is at the northwest africa and the frequency of the cyclones is higher mainly during may and june the iberian peninsula it appears mainly during the mid spring period until summer when the temperature differences between sea and land favour the development of thermal depressions the aegean sea it is also characterized as a cyclogenesis centre even though it is a rather limited area in comparison to the aforementioned ones the eastern black sea there depressions can be formed throughout the year and mainly during the summer period july and august the broader cyprus region the east central levantine sea can produce cyclones of mid intensity usually observed during summer and autumn the middle east the area over syria and iraq related to the formation of summer cyclones as a result of the easternmost extension of the pakistan low 2 4 2 validation of med cordex rcms for the simulation of deep cyclones over the mediterranean sea in order to detect deep depressions i e cyclones with centre pressure lower than 1000 hpa trigo et al 2002b the methodology introduced by rousi 2014 was applied the proposed algorithm uses gridded data of daily slp by both cera and the three rcms for the studied 30 years timespans reference and future periods it computes the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions i e number of days within the 30 years period after the identification of separate cyclonic circulation events results are illustrated on gridded maps of the study area see sections 3 3 and 5 1 2 for results by comparisons of cera to rcm produced maps the ability of the climate models to reproduce both the locations of deep depressions and their frequencies can be assessed the characterization of a daily time step in our analysis as day of deep depression relies on two criteria firstly on this day slp in a grid point must be lower than 1000 hpa secondly it is also necessary for neighbouring grid points within a threshold radius to have higher atmospheric pressure values than that of the examined point to identify it as the centre of cyclogenesis as the med cordex project was very recent during the time of implementation of the presented research 2018 2020 and its evaluation is still ongoing only a few validation reports were available in recent literature these mainly focus on synoptic scale weather patterns cyclones

daily averaged ssh values in this study the measured in situ datasets were processed after subtraction of the calculated 11 year msl with a high pass filter operator using a cut off frequency of 1 30 days in order to exclude long term sea level oscillations conte and lionello 2013 the latter can be primarily induced by the steric effects due to the large scale low frequency thermohaline fluctuations and or total mass variations of the enclosed basin under investigation carillo et al 2012 these types of effects are not simulated by mecss which considers the mediterranean region as an enclosed aquatic body and thus it was necessary to exclude the effects of such processes from the observations as well moreover mecss model does not include modelling of tidal motions on all grid cells as is typically done in short term forecasts with hiress model but only on the open straits as a dirichlet type boundary condition astronomical tide signals are therefore removed from the used field data of ssh with the use of the t tide software pawlowicz et al 2002 it is also noted that tides are of generally small amplitude in most parts of the mediterranean sea compared to the extreme positive and negative free surface elevation due to storm surges this is not necessarily true for the n adriatic where the tidal signal can add up to 30 cm on the 50 year return period ssh marcos et al 2009 it is noted that no tidal gauge data in the adriatic region were used for comparisons with model output in the present study 2 6 available climate reference data for rcm validation for the evaluation of the used rcm outputs datasets by the cera 20c coupled assimilation system are used please note that finer resolution datasets e g era5 were not yet available at the time of implementation cera 20c consists of a 10 member ensemble of coupled climate re analyses of the 20th century from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and aims at reconstructing the past weather and climate of the earth system including the atmosphere ocean land ocean waves and sea ice laloyaux et al 2018 the timeseries cover the period from 1901 to 2010 it is based on the coupled ecmwf re analysis cera coupled data assimilation system laloyaux et al 2016 which assimilates only surface pressure and marine wind observations as well as ocean temperature and salinity profiles it has been one of the crucial outcomes of era clim2 project https www ecmwf int en research projects era clim2 the cera 20c product describes the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere 125 km horizontal grid with 91 vertical levels between the surface and 0 01 hpa the land surface 125 km horizontal grid with 4 soil layers the waves for the period 1901 2010 the ocean 110 km horizontal grid with meridional refinement at the equator 42 vertical levels and the sea ice it should be highlighted that atmospheric data are not only available on the native 91 model levels but also on 37 pressure levels as in era interim 16 potential temperature levels and the 2 pvu potential vorticity level the utilized spatial resolution of cera 20c dataset was a downscaled version of 0 25 0 25 the cera assimilation system has the ability to produce a more balanced and consistent earth system climate reconstruction as it considers the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean more detailed information about the cera database can be found via the link https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets archive datasets reanalysis datasets cera 20c to evaluate the skill of the three selected rcms in simulating the main parameters that were used for mecss forcing it was decided to execute comparisons during the 30 year reference period 1971 2000 on both an annual and seasonal basis 3 climatic data evaluation in any respect all researchers stress the need of consistent and quality checked fine scale observational datasets for the robust evaluation of rcms in the following we present our own systematic validation of the med cordex slp and wind data for the reference period 1971 2000 control run simulations via comparisons against cera 20c datasets 3 1 validation of sea level pressure fields over the mediterranean region 3 1 1 annual analysis the spatial distribution of both re analysis and rcm data for averaged slp values on an annual basis is presented in fig 2 regarding the mean annual slp fields derived from cera data it is found that the pressure values range from 1013 up to 1020 hpa with an increasing gradient from east to west northwest the minimum is located over cyprus and the highest ones at the north in the iberian peninsula the comparison with equivalent slp fields simulated by the three examined rcms cmcc cnrm and guf see section 2 2 showed that all three models can capture the main characteristics of annual atmospheric pressure patterns with the lowest values at the easternmost part of the mediterranean basin and the highest over to its western part the calculated differences which were evaluated applying t test statistics at a level of significance 0 05 revealed that the cmcc tends to slightly overestimate the actual slp values all over the domain of study small positive differences cover almost the entire mediterranean region up to 3 hpa and only at a limited area near the north western boundary the computed differences are negative however even though the magnitude of the differences is small most of the grid points were found to be statistically significant since the applied test considers the actual compared values of node to node slp timeseries in tandem with the discrepancies in their variability regarding the cnrm model the difference pattern divides the mediterranean region in half the northern continental parts are characterized by negative differences i e model underestimates slp values whereas the marine area shows small positive differences with higher overestimation over the south eastern mediterranean central and eastern levantine southern anatolia and the middle eastern continent and coasts values of mean slp deviations vary from 3 hpa to 3 5 hpa the guf model overestimates the annual atmospheric surface pressure towards the southern mediterranean and the iberian peninsula positive differences while in the northern part of the domain the differences are negative slp underestimation as in previous models guf modelled slp differences are quite small showing that the three models present an efficient skill in simulating mean slp characteristics main dynamics of barometric systems during the typical annual cycle for a 30 years period 3 1 2 seasonal analysis the large scale barometric system patterns during winter of the reference period 1971 2000 according to the cera results is characterized by four main high pressure centres above 1020 hpa i e over the iberian peninsula algeria balkans and turkey fig 3 the central and eastern mediterranean sea on the other hand is characterized by lower values with a minimum over cyprus all models seem to be able to capture the location of these maximum centres but with overestimated pressure values while the minimum in all of them is found at the north western parts of the domain in spring appendix b figure a1 1 all over the mediterranean slp values are much lower and more uniform in comparison to winter slp varies from 1015 hpa at the south eastern parts cyprus syria lebanon and to 1017 hpa at the western parts of the mediterranean with slp maxima covering a quite large area the studied rcms can reproduce the spring slp fields but the barometric highs are slightly more extended and intense compared to cera datasets especially for guf s rcm a stronger horizontal gradient characterizes the summer mean slp fields over the mediterranean varying from 1005 hpa over its eastern parts up to 1019 hpa at the northwest similar to aforementioned seasonal patterns the three rcms present high skills in reproducing the spatial pressure distribution capturing the main characteristics of summer pressure over the mediterranean finally a more uniform distribution of the mean slp values is illustrated in appendix b figure a1 2 during autumn according to the cera data the minimum is located at the southeast of the mediterranean region while the highest mean pressure values are observed at the north especially over the balkan peninsula cmcc model can simulate this maximum but high pressure values 1020 hpa are found over france and spain too equivalent slp autumn values are also observed over the western african coast the cnrm simulations have a similar pattern with slightly lower values they do not exceed 1018 hpa analogous results are found in the case of the guf model with the minimum over cyprus and the maximums located over the same areas as the cera pattern moreover the respective composite maps of mean slp differences over the entire studied domain comparing cera to the three rcm datasets the winter period is characterized by the largest differences compared to the rest of the seasonal patterns specifically the cmcc model mainly overestimates the winter mean slp with the highest positive differences found over the central and eastern mediterranean sea turkey and the south eastern african coast on the other hand cnrm and guf models overestimate the winter slp mean values over the central and southern parts of the domain while an underestimation negative differences down to 5 hpa is observed over the northern continental parts in spring cmcc can simulate the actual mean slp values even better since all over the study region the differences are very small close to zero cnrm underestimates the pressure values at the north western parts of the mediterranean whereas positive differences are found at the south eastern parts of the basin simulations seem more efficient over the marine areas than continental ones the relevant map of the cnrm cera comparisons shows that negative differences prevail at the north western western and central mediterranean sea whilst positive ones at the southwestern african coast in the case of guf s rcm the positive differences cover a more extended westernmost area up to the iberian peninsula appendix b figure a1 1 as regards summer differences both cmcc and cnrm models slightly underestimate summer mean slp fields over the maritime mediterranean area and the african coast and slightly overestimate them over the continent mainly cmcc conversely guf model overestimates the reference period s mean slp values almost all over the examined domain with the positive differences increasing from north to south fig 3 finally the computed autumn difference maps show that cmcc and guf models have a similar performance in simulating the mean slp values and overestimate them all over the domain of interest in the case of cnrm model positive differences cover only a very limited part of the mediterranean at the southeast and negative differences dominate the largest deviations being statistically significant are found at the north western parts of the region appendix b figure a1 2 3 2 validation of wind fields over the mediterranean region 3 2 1 annual analysis fig 4 displays the 30 years mean climatic patterns of wind speed over the study domain based on annual cycle analysis according to cera data depictions the prevailing pattern refers to more intense winds over the marine areas than overland maximum values of mean wind speeds reach up to 8 m s over the aegean sea as expected a secondary maximum of mean atmospheric circulation can be seen over the broader gulf of lions area as well as in the southwestern mediterranean region between sardinia and tunisia the occurrence of wind maxima over the aegean region could be attributed to the etesian winds during summer as well as to the strong north winds prevailing in winter moreover the western maximum over the broader region around marseille is found in one of the most characteristic cyclogenetic centres of deep depression formation over the mediterranean which should be associated with high speed winds the evaluation of the three examined rcms in simulating the wind fields over the mediterranean showed in general an efficient skill in reproducing the spatial distribution of their velocities fig 4 the gulf of lions is the region where all climate models reproduce the highest mean wind speed values up to 8 m s while the aegean sea is the second mediterranean area where high winds blow however discrepancies can be traced e g rcms could not reproduce the intense wind regime above and around the island of crete conversely to cera output another differentiation of the rcm simulation outputs from the cera annual wind maps is the existence of more intense winds at the strait of gibraltar fig 4 left column regarding the continental parts of the study domain cmcc and guf models simulate slightly higher wind speeds especially in some parts of the balkan peninsula and the mountainous areas of the iberian peninsula on the other hand the cnrm model reproduces quite weaker winds over spain italy and greece the equivalent composite maps of mean wind speed differences between rcms and cera values reveal several relatively small areas where the differences are rather significant fig 4 right column all models underestimate negative differences the wind speeds at the mediterranean coasts of spain and france over corsica and sardinia the southern parts of italy in greece above peloponnese and crete and in the south eastern coastal area of turkey moreover negative differences up to 2 5 m s can be found over cyprus the above findings could be attributed to inadequacies in schemes and resolutions of the rcms in simulating regional peculiarities of aeolian patterns and local complexities of the geographical characteristics in the mediterranean region especially in areas with diverse island formations and intense changes in land sea sequence regarding the main body of the mediterranean sea the three examined rcms seem to slightly overestimate the average wind speed patterns with small positive differences all over the region cmcc model results portray the highest overestimations while for guf model positive differences are very close to zero except for the gibraltar strait the latter is an area where highest positive differences are traced up to 2 m s as mentioned above the gulf of lions is another area where rcms overestimate the mean wind speed climate as well as the ionian sea the eastern and south eastern parts of the aegean sea guf model seems to underestimate the annual basis mean wind speed regime of the northern parts of continental africa even though it presents the smallest differences in comparison to the other two rcms fig 4 right column 3 2 2 seasonal analysis during winter the cera mean wind speed fields over the aegean sea reach up to 9 m s representing an apparent local maximum throughout the mediterranean region followed by the local high wind speed potential in the gulf of lions fig 5 in spring the winds in these two areas are much weaker and the domain of study presents a much more uniform wind speed pattern in summer a dipole is detected with strong winds in the aegean region etesians over the central and southern parts and significantly weaker winds over the central mediterranean tyrrhenian sea and sicily finally in autumn the two maxima winter pattern remains but with significantly lower wind speeds appendix b figure a1 3 the equivalent maps of the cmcc model output reveal its ability to reproduce the main features of the horizontal wind speed distribution during winter months when maxima are correctly represented over the gulf of lions and the aegean sea however it is noteworthy that strong winds are also detected over the black sea especially at its north and north western parts as well as in the central part of the mediterranean sea between sardinia and sicily fig 5 a more homogeneous wind speed pattern is reproduced during spring period in accordance with cera data yet with persistent stronger winds over the gulf of lions appendix b figure a1 3 in summer the cmcc s rcm can reproduce the etesian winds regime in the aegean but with lower speed values on the other hand in autumn depictions the two aforementioned maxima are higher than cera results fig 5 cnrm simulations diversify in terms of winter patterns as the model can capture strong wind fields over the gulf of lions but the maximum over the aegean sea is much weaker than the cera one for the rest of the seasons more homogeneous wind speed patterns are detected apart from the southern french continental shelf maximum the rest of the mediterranean sea is characterized by speeds from 6 to 7 5 m s finally the guf model seems to reliably simulate the actual pattern of winds distribution over the study domain yet especially winter wind fields are estimated to be much stronger on the other hand the summer dipole mentioned in the above paragraph is more extended especially its minimum pole and the greatest part of central mediterranean sea is covered by wind speed values that do not exceed 3 m s fig 5 the composite maps of wind velocity differences fig 5 show in general the same positive and negative poles as in the previous maps it is worth mentioning that the highest positive differences overestimation of the guf model refer to wintertime and that the overestimation of wind speeds over the strait of gibraltar corresponds to all seasons for all three rcms fig 5 3 3 evaluation of extreme sea level pressure systems according to the annual scale analysis of cera data fig 6 deep cyclones can be found in a quite large part of the mediterranean region especially over the sea for most of the grid points the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions does not exceed five days during the reference period 1971 2000 however it is obvious that there are regions of depression centres especially over italy in the apennine peninsula where these frequencies are higher fig 6 the maximum is found over two of the most well known regions of mediterranean cyclogenesis such as the gulf of genoa ligurian sea and the gulf of venice in the adriatic sea in these areas the frequency of extreme depressions reaches 10 days 2nd class for some grid points in the aforementioned regions as well as the gulf of taranto in southern italy the frequency is even higher up to 15 days 3rd class finally grid points with 2nd class frequency of occurrence are detected in the north of cyprus at the northeast of the black sea as well as in the centre of the tyrrhenian sea it should be underlined that these centres are in accordance with previous studies trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 regarding cmcc model results its ability to reproduce the main centres of the deep depression formation over the domain of study is rather plausible however the grid points of the domain which satisfy the suggested criteria for deep depression identification are more than the relevant cera based results furthermore a larger number of grid points have frequencies of the 2nd class 5 to 10 days the deep cyclone centre over the gulf of venice presents the largest recurrence pattern with 20 days of extreme depressions fig 6 for cnrm model the spatial distribution of incident frequencies of deep cyclones is quite similar to the cera one with the main cyclonic centres over the gulfs of genoa and venice the middle of the tyrrhenian sea and the centre of the adriatic sea fig 6 however the hotspot of deep depressions with a maximum frequency of 20 days is shifted to the west at the gulf of genoa in comparison with the cmcc model finally the equivalent annual scale results of the guf model are mainly analogous to the cmcc model output regarding especially the frequency maximums fig 6 in general guf s rcm is capable in reproducing the deep depression areas also indicating three neighbouring grid points over the central and northern aegean sea with frequencies of occurrence up to 10 days and one more over the northern black sea with barometric low incident frequencies in the 3rd class 10 to 15 days figs 7 8 and a1 5 6 in the appendix b present the spatial distribution of the grid points corresponding to locations with sufficient days of incident deep depressions 1000 hpa on a seasonal basis for the winter season fig 7 the largest percentage of deep cyclogenetic areas are located over the sea rather than the continental parts of the mediterranean region the grid points with the maximum frequencies are found over the adriatic sea the gulf of genoa at the west of corsica and at the gulf of taranto respective results were found for the cmcc s rcm simulations with a more extended cyclogenesis area over the black sea in general the winter deep depression frequencies do not exceed the five days threshold during the reference period in the cnrm case rcm results are very similar once again to the cera data indicating that the model can capture the deep depression occurrence frequencies in both location and magnitude in the aegean sea the number of cnrm grid points with deep depressions is smaller than the cera based ones while there is an overestimation of them over the balkan peninsula moreover the guf model results show that rather few grid points in the southern mediterranean sea fulfil the criteria of the extreme cyclone incidence while the maximum is reasonably located over the gulf of genoa with winter incidence frequency reaching up to 15 days fig 7 during springtime cera results show that the main pattern of the deep depression grid points is quite similar to the winter one even though their number is higher and they are more extended to the south it is noteworthy that frequency maxima are traced over the continental parts of the study domain the most important differentiation of the cmcc simulations is the exaggerated number of cyclogenetic grid points with deep depressions covering a very large part of the mediterranean region however the incident maxima are located at the same areas as the winter ones appendix b figure a1 5 analogous overestimating results were found for the other two rcms from cnrm and cuf the summer results both for cera and rcm simulations show that the deep depressions are quite fewer than the rest of the seasons and the areas that are generally characterized by extreme depressions are limited over the northeast of the study domain fig 8 lastly cera results for the autumn season show that most of the deep cyclone grid points are gathered over the central parts of the mediterranean sea with the maximum frequency location over the northern adriatic sea while very few grid points are found in the southern mediterranean all rcms seem to simulate this pattern efficiently appendix b figure a1 6 4 storm surge model validation the rigorous evaluation of mecss model and its operational forecasting counterpart hiress has been extensively performed during the last decade especially within the mediterranean basin including datasets form greek spanish italian and french tide gauges androulidakis et al 2015 krestenitis et al 2015 2017 makris et al 2015 2016 2019 2021 for the sake of coherence brevity and fulfilling the need for continuous datasets during an adequate timespan at least 10 years within a climatic study of the reference period 1971 2000 herein we focus on comparisons of mecss results against field data of ssh in five selected greek stations data from other mediterranean hydrographic services are not freely available for the specific timeframe at least within the classic sea level data sources the utilized datasets refer to uninterrupted long term and extensively pre validated in situ hydrographic information by tide gauges of the hnhs herein the mecss model runs were extended to 2005 to at least cover a decadal period 1995 2005 for validation purposes forced by the same set of cmcc cnrm guf rcms produced atmospheric conditions in evaluations of climatic mode runs of storm surge models researchers usually pursue the agreement of model results and field observations mainly based on statistical measures of either seasonal or annual and inter annual maxima values and their correlations rather than day to day comparisons of modelled and in situ ssh timeseries as commonly done in operational forecasts this is because the atmospheric forcing data from rcms does not reproduce the daily weather patterns as in meteorological forecast modelling but rather seeks to capture the long term climatic patterns of atmospheric circulation 4 1 storm surge index and ssh maxima in the present analysis we focus on inter annual maxima of storm surges in order to trace 30 year long changes of sea level variations therefore the storm surge index ssi is used as it refers to the average of the three highest independent storm surge maxima per year conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc only incidents of maximum ssh separated by at least 120 h estimation of the maximum duration of a typical storm in the mediterranean are considered as independent storm surge events to avoid overestimations of ssi due to the occurrence of multiple conjugate peaks within a unique storm incident in the ssh timeseries the ssi for both simulated and observed timeseries was calculated for each of the five stations along with corresponding percent error e error index ei root mean square error rmse pearson product moment correlation coefficient cor x and willmott skill score wss or index of agreement ioa see appendix a 1 for analytic definitions of statistical parameters fig 9 presents the comparisons of the decadal 1995 2005 average ssi m and ssh max m in five selected greek stations between field and model cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss data all mecss model implementations follow the same geographical pattern as the one referring to field observations i e higher storm surge levels in the northern part of the studied area and lower sshs towards the south the model s performance is better in the central aegean and ionian seas chios and lefkada followed by the northern part of the aegean sea alexandroupoli and thessaloniki while in heraklion the mecss runs seem to behave like an outlier this is attributed to peculiarities of the computational domain s coastal bathymetry in the southern aegean sea on the northern coast of the island of crete the guf forced mecss model runs perform quite adequately in almost all locations in general mecss model implementations forced by med 44 resolution med cordex climatic data for the reference period slightly underestimate the magnitudes of annual ssh maxima and ssi except from guf mecss in the central aegean table 2 presents the aggregate estimation of mecss model s performance forced by the three rcms cmcc cnrm and guf in the form of overall statistical measures and skill metrics e ei rmse cor and wss for comparisons between field and model data these are based on decadal 1995 2005 averages of ssi and ssh max at five greek stations corroborating several previous works e g androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 the highest ssi values occur over the northern aegean coastal region alexandroupoli where both modelled and observed ssis are 23 cm the median percent errors range from quite small to tolerable 13 e i 6 2 for ssi and 22 e i 12 for ssh max with generally low values in certain parts of the mediterranean basin this supports the good performance of mecss model during the reference period even though the model underestimates the ssi at all stations negative ei values the error is generally acceptable and differences between modelled and observed ssi values are plausible conte and lionello 2013 also showed results of storm surge climate simulations with rather high errors e g e 40 and similar underestimations of the simulated ssh over coastal regions of the western mediterranean the model resolution might be the prime reason for this discrepancy yet refining the discretization of storm surge models for long term climatic runs drastically increases the need for computational resources and times undermining the feasibility of adequate combinations of rcms rcps implementations similar analytic comparisons of storm surge intra annual extremes were performed based on the absolute yearly maxima of sea level variations giving an average of annual ssh max for both simulated and observed timeseries same comparisons as for the ssi were performed providing similar results overall the cumulative comparisons reveal quite high pearson correlation coefficients 0 8 with rmse ranging from only 3 to 4 3 cm namely a rough 12 18 of the average ssh max and 7 of the absolute observed ssh max the ioa based on wss reveals a high correlation of guf forced mecss model 0 8 with field data in terms of the interdecadal ssh extremes the skill scores of the cmcc and cnrm forced mecss are lower rendering the guf forced mecss model setup as generally but not locally most reliable in performing estimations of the extreme climate of storm surges large ssh at least for the east central mediterranean 4 2 ssh percentiles and hrp index to enhance our validation of mecss runs for the reference period comparisons of simulated ssh with corresponding field data were expanded to other types of storm surge maxima and mid range values of storm induced sea levels thus the performance of mecss model implementations was also evaluated using mid to high order percentiles 80th 90th 95th 97 5th 99th 99 5th etc of ssh for both modelled and observed timeseries as ssi and ssh max values lie around the 99th and 99 5th percentiles for the sake of brevity only comparisons of the decadal 1995 2005 97 5th and 90th percentiles of ssh for field against cmcc cnrm and guf mecss data are presented in fig 10 the highest modelled values were derived again for the northern aegean sea alexandroupoli in agreement with the analysis of intra annual maxima ssi and ssh max it is although obvious that unlike the case of ssh maxima all model runs tend to overestimate the ssh for mid range values i e for the 90th and lower percentiles in general all model implementations perform very well for the 97 5th percentile of ssh to acceptably for the 90th percentile of ssh the rest classes of percentiles are not shown for the sake of conciseness the case of heraklion is still considered to be an outlier compared to other locations of focus e g mecss model skill in ssh percentile comparisons is very good for lefakda chios and alexandroupoli sites and occasionally for thessaloniki we note that the hreaklion in situ measured timeseries is the most unreliable out of the bunch of the hnhs observations as it is incomplete lacking continuous information about the 1995 1997 period it is also evident that all model implementations perform very well in reference to the decadal 97 5th percentile of ssh therefore it can be deduced that the agreement of the mecss model runs for all model implementations is high in terms of the unfiltered ssh mid and extreme values reproduced within the 1995 2005 period aiming to quantitatively assess the ability of the mecss model to reproduce a wide range of the ssh values within its simulated timeseries and further decide on the essentiality of a possible bias correction of modelled results we also calculated the hit rate of percentiles hrp index schoetter et al 2012 makris et al 2016 as a model evaluation metric see appendix a 1 in general if hrp index is greater than 0 95 then bias correction is not necessary for model results the closest that hrp values are to 1 then it can be deduced that mecss model should efficiently reproduce the most classes of ssh in the simulated dataset this applies to maxima mid range and minima of modelled ssh i e for both positive and negative surges the hrp index for the five greek stations is presented in table 3 regarding cmcc cnrm guf forced mecss model runs it was found that the mecss model simulates the statistical properties of the ranked percentiles of ssh in four of the characteristic locations adequately heraklion continues to be the outlier reference spot since hrp exceeds the limit of 0 95 everywhere and reaches the value of 0 98 and 1 00 in thessaloniki and alexandroupoli for the cmcc and guf meccs setups the latter however seems to slightly outperform the cmcc and cnrm forced mecss simulations in terms of mean hrp values yet the median hrp index reveals that differences are marginal 0 95 0 96 for all three model implementations and not able to offer a definite reason for discarding the one or the other setup altogether it can be concluded that the mecss model can reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of percentiles in an adequate way and thus the statistical distributions of the modelled ssh data are considered to be reliable for further use in future projections during the 21st century by a combination of rcms rcps implemented mecss 4 3 probabilistic analysis of ssh maxima occurrence and threshold values exceedance a heuristic approach is used in the present study to define statistically coherent events as these storm surge incidents having values of ssh c o h μ s s h σ s s h where μ is the mean of the ssh timeseries over the entire study period 1995 2005 and σ is the corresponding standard deviation makris et al 2015 2016 skoulikaris et al 2021 the exceedance probability p c o h of the critical value for coherent events together with the respective calculated thresholds ssh c o h μ s s h σ s s h for all greek stations are presented in fig 11 top and mid graphs as derived from both simulated and observed timeseries of ssh the simulated values are correlated well with the measured ones in all stations except the heraklion site with lower frequencies of occurrence shown here by probabilities of exceedance of coherent events over the ionian and central aegean seas lefkada and chios compared to the northern aegean regions thessaloniki and alexandorupoli it follows that these areas show more frequent either lower or higher in magnitude ssh both model and in situ values support this finding indicating the good performance of the mecss model between different areas it is also noted that the coherent threshold is adequately estimated or slightly overestimated everywhere except from the heraklion station where model results exactly fit to the field data overall it can be deduced that the mecss model can adequately reproduce the statistical storm surge patterns corresponding to heuristically defined coherent events a tendency is traced for the mecss model implementations to mostly overestimate small values of ssh and perform better for the estimation of statistical features for larger ssh values not shown here for brevity representative of intense storm surge events therefore the reproduced probabilistic parametric features of the modelled ssh data can be considered reliable for further use in future projections under several rcp climate change scenarios we have also calculated the probabilities of occurrence of local peaks in the ssh timeseries at the five greek stations in order to assess the performance of mecss model in terms of the local maxima of sea level variations in coastal regions with different topographic characteristics the local maxima computation is based on the minimization of the ssh distribution gradient in local short frames of the timeseries where there is a flat tangent line the probability of occurrence of ssh local maxima is shown in fig 11 lower graph as derived from the number of days that they appeared in the ssh timeseries divided by the total number of days of each study period for each station all local peak points maxima with ssh that exceed 10 20 and 30 cm were also computed to evaluate the mecss model performance during events of extreme surges not shown here for conciseness the comparison between model and field data shows that the agreement is very satisfactory in all stations for all three mecss implementations this observation agrees with previous studies androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 for the sres 20c3m historical dataset that have also found the highest ssh values of the aegean over the northern part of it in general it can be concluded that the mecss model can well reproduce the probabilistic features of storm surge patterns in terms of the amount and occurrence frequency of surge events leading to a prominent peak in the modelled ssh timeseries the latter correspond to temporally local events of high sea levels on the coast induced by meteorological phenomena therefore the estimated probabilistic features of the modelled ssh data are considered reliable for further use in a climatic study of storm surge patterns estimation in the 21st century 5 results in the following projections of the rcm simulation results are provided over the mediterranean region we provide estimations on a 30 year level of analysis for the cyclonic patterns and synoptic scale atmospheric dynamics that serves as input in high resolution hydrodynamic modelling with mecss model we further analyse the sea level response to rcm projections in the entire mediterranean basin and present climate change signals of the maxima and mean ssh due to storm surges on the shoreline and correlations of deep depressions to episodic elevations of coastal sea level 5 1 weather patterns by rcm projections in the 21 st century the climatic projections of mean and extreme barometric systems i e the projected changes of respective slp and wind fields over the mediterranean region for the 21st century per rcm implementation and rcp scenario used is presented herein this is done to correlate the future trends and climate change signals of synoptic scale patterns barometric systems and aeolian regimes to the respective projected trends of episodic ssh and storm surge induced changes in msl on the coastal zone of the mediterranean basin 5 1 1 mean barometric systems over the mediterranean region future climate projections for sea level pressure and wind fields an attempt is made to analyse the potential future changes as estimated by the three rcms used regarding the two main parameters that are widely used slp and wind speeds since this is a primer analysis on the model s future projections it is selected to present the results regarding the last 30 year period of the century and to show the rcm estimations under the high emission concentration scenario rcp 8 5 according to the ipcc synthesis report 2014 the rcp 8 5 is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions that lead to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time estimating that co2 levels will triple by the end of the century accompanied by a rapid increase of the ch4 emissions the future estimations of the slp and wind changes were computed by calculating the biases differences of the mean annual and seasonal values of the two examined parameters future period 2071 2100 in comparison with the equivalent values of the reference period 1971 2000 which are analysed in section 3 fig 12 illustrates both the mean annual spatial distribution of the slp values over the mediterranean region as well as the calculated difference future present for each model under study all models agree in general that the slp values are estimated to present an increasing gradient from the south eastern part of the region to the northwest in the future the values range from 1012 hpa over cyprus up to 1020 hpa at the north of the iberian peninsula however even though the spatial distribution does not seem to differ much from one model to the other the estimated future differences present some discrepancies overall all models agree that slp values are going to increase in the future since positive differences up to 3 5 hpa characterize the largest part of the mediterranean region yet in the case of the cmcc model these positive differences are observed mainly over italy and the balkan peninsula while over the west and south the differences are very small and in some parts almost zero for cnrm the maximum of the positive differences is located at the northwest of the region and the smallest ones at the south eastern mediterranean sea finally for guf s rcm the positive differences decrease moving to the south fig 12 the winter future slp values are quite higher than the annual ones and with a difference in spatial distribution all models estimate that the minimum sea level pressures will be observed at the northwest of the domain of interest while the maximum will be found at the southwest over north africa fig 13 it is worth mentioning that a large part of the mediterranean area is estimated to present slp values that will exceed 1020 hpa in the future on the other hand the estimated differences between the future and reference period vary between model implementations in the case of cmcc s rcm a characteristic dipole is observed with positive difference increase of the slp over the balkan peninsula and the eastern europe and negative ones decrease of the slp values at the northwest also some regions over the central mediterranean are estimated according to the model to have no future changes regarding slp for cnrm the increase of the examined parameter is clear all over the domain of study the most intense future changes are expected to be found at the northwest and the smallest ones over the cyprus area in the case of guf the centre of positive differences is located over greece up to almost 5 hpa which seem to decrease perimetrically with the smallest positive difference found at the west fig 13 the future spring slp values are smaller in comparison to the winter ones the spatial distribution is very similar to the annual one with the smallest values 1012 hpa observed over cyprus and the highest ones over the northwester part of the mediterranean region regarding the actual sea the future slps are estimated to present a gradient from east minimum to west maximum all model results indicate that the spring pressures will increase during the last 30 years of the 21st century positive differences cover the whole area under study while the most intense future changes are found in the cmcc model over the central continental areas of the mediterranean appendix b figure a1 7 regarding summer the mean seasonal slp future values are lower than the other two seasons the smallest pressures are found at the southeast of the region lower than 1010 hpa increasing over the sea area and the maximum is found at the north northwest up to 1018 hpa all models agree on that spatial distribution fig 14 the equivalent estimated changes in comparison with the reference period s summer ones show that summer will be the only season where slp is estimated to decrease in the 21st century especially in the case of the cmcc model quite large negative differences decrease cover the sea area of the mediterranean as well as the north continental parts of africa the cnrm projections present a weaker climate signal with small positive differences at the northwest and central continental parts of the mediterranean and small negative ones over the balkan peninsula and eastern europe fig 15 in the case of autumn during the last 30 years of the 21st century all models agree that higher pressures will characterize the continental parts of the region under study while lower pressures will be observed over the sea the slp values range from 1015 hpa up to 1022 hpa in limited areas over the iberian and the italian peninsulas appendix b figure a1 8 in comparison to the reference period s slp autumn values it is estimated that pressure will generally increase over the mediterranean according to the cmcc future projections the autumn slp is estimated to increase small positive differences especially in italy and the balkan peninsula over the sea area these positive differences are even smaller and in some regions very close to zero no future climate signal only over cyprus the examined parameter is expected to slightly decrease regarding cnrm the future slp increase is more intense positive differences cover the whole of the study region with the highest ones at the north and northwest as previously over cyprus the change of the autumn slp values is zero no future pressure change analogous is the distribution of the positive differences for guf model but the pressure increase is slightly weaker smaller positive change appendix b figure a1 8 the future projections of the three examined models regarding the wind speeds over the mediterranean domain present many similarities especially in the spatial distribution of their patterns the most intense wind speeds are expected to prevail mainly over the sea areas especially over the aegean sea and the marseille gulf reaching up to approximately 8 m s while over the continents the winds are estimated to be weaker in the future fig 15 the composite maps of the differences in comparison to the reference period are not very strong in general it could be mentioned that there is a small strengthening of the wind speeds over the balkan peninsula as well as over spain with positive differences that in most of the areas are statistically significant it should be highlighted that mainly cmcc and guf model project stronger winds also over the aegean sea statistically significant too the future pattern of the wind speeds during the winter months is quite similar to the annual one regarding the spatial distribution of the velocities weak speeds are estimated to be found over the continent while the sea is going to present larger values conversely to the year analysis the maximum this time is observed over the marseille gulf up to 8 m s while the secondary one is located in the aegean sea moreover strong winds are predicted by the models over the northwest of the domain of interest over the atlantic ocean as well as in the black sea region fig 14 the computation of the differences between the future and the reference mean values revealed that the climate signal is quite weak small positive yet statistically significant differences are expected over land especially in italy central europe and the balkan peninsula on the other hand the wind speeds are not estimated to change drastically over the sea and in some case there are going to be slightly weaker small negative differences as in winter the future spring winds are expected to present their maximum speeds over the sea during the last 30 years of the century however they are quite smaller than the respected winter ones appendix b figure a1 9 also the selected models predict that overall winds in the future are going to be a little stronger small positive difference prevails especially over the continental parts of the mediterranean region the only exception is in the case of the cmcc model where a more significant positive change strengthening of wind speeds is projected over the aegean sea region in summer the regions with future winds lower than 3 m s are more extended over the sea particularly in the cases of cmcc and guf models however these two models estimate a maximum of wind speeds over the aegean sea meaning that the etesian winds will also be detected during the future years moreover from the difference maps the etesian winds are estimated to become even stronger in the future with larger positive differences over the area of the aegean sea this intensification of the winds over this area is mainly found in the case of the cnrm model and the maximum is extended over the southern black sea and over the southeast of the island of crete fig 15 finally in the case of the future autumn estimations the spatial distribution of the wind speeds is similar to the winter spring and annual ones where the land is expected to be characterized by weak winds and the sea with stronger ones all models also detect two future maxima the first in the aegean sea and the second in marseille which is expected to be more intense according to the future cmcc and guf projections the future climate signal of the examined parameter is weak and the calculated differences are in general quite small positive differences are mainly observed over the eastern parts of the mediterranean region especially the aegean sea meaning that the autumn winds over these regions are expected to be slightly stronger in the future appendix b figure a1 10 5 1 2 extreme barometric systems over the mediterranean region future climatic projections of deep depressions the future projections of the three models in estimating the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions centre 1000 hpa is also presented the methodology described in section 2 4 was followed to define the centres of these deep depressions low barometric pressure systems and the grid points on which these low pressure centres will occur in the future were mapped for the future period 2071 2100 moreover the differences on the days of occurrence of these depressions future reference were also computed and illustrated both on an annual and seasonal basis the annual results showed fig 16 that all three models estimate the occurrence of these deep cyclones in the largest part of the mediterranean region in the case of cmcc and guf model these cyclones are expected to have their centres mainly over land while according to the cnrm model their occurrence is also over the sea area it should be mentioned that their frequency in most of the cases does not exceed 5 days however scattered grid point both over the continental as well as the sea areas present a higher frequency of occurrence from the differences maps it becomes obvious that cyclones even though they will still occur in the future are estimated to present a general frequency decrease for a high percentage of the grid points the calculated differences are negative meaning either that there is a decrease of these deep cyclones for future projections compared to the reference period or that the centres of these cyclones are estimated to be found in different areas during the 21st century creating negative differences fig 16 yet it should be considered that there are also grid points with an increasing frequency of occurrence of extreme pressures up to almost 10 days but their locations differ by model application the winter future projections showed that for all three rcms the number of grid points that will present deep depressions by the end of the 21st century is much lower than the annual ones fig 17 as expected their frequency of occurrence is also smaller does not exceed 5 days than the equivalent frequencies found in the annual analysis the deep depression centres are mainly located over the continental land rather than the sea according to the difference maps it should be noted that the extreme cyclones are expected to be less frequent since negative differences prevail over the mediterranean however the maximum of the frequency of occurrence detected for the guf model over the north adriatic sea and the intense positive differences at the same grid point and intense negative difference at the next one shows that this centre of extreme cyclogenesis remains strong over the area during spring the regions that will present deep depressions in the future are more extended also covering several parts of the mediterranean sea as in winter the frequency of occurrence mainly belongs to the first class appendix b figure a1 11 moreover these extreme cyclones will be rarer in the future from the projections of the cmcc and guf models while in the case of the cnrm one numerous grid points over the sea are expected to present more deep depressions at the last 30 years of the century regarding summer and autumn fig 17 and figure a1 12 in appendix b all models project in the future a very limited number of grid points areas where in the future very low pressure systems will occur especially for summer the eastern and north eastern mediterranean region is the one that will generally experience in the future deep depressions the respected differences over this area are either positive or negative due to the slight change of the geographical location of the grid points with extreme pressures and not to an actual change of their frequency for autumn the deep depressions are also expected to become less frequent mainly over central mediterranean sea an exception can be observed over the north adriatic sea in the case of the guf model where the grid points over the area present positive differences indicating that the frequency of the extreme cyclones is expected to increase in the future appendix b figure a1 12 5 2 storm surge projections in the 21 st century by mecss model output we investigate the estimated evolution the projected future trends and variability of ssh maxima and averages in tandem with their correlation to the main forcing mechanisms deep depressions that can induce high surges in the mediterranean coastal zone under the effects of possible climate change 5 2 1 maps of inter annual ssh maxima future projections under combinations of rcms and rcps the main output of the storm surge model is presented in the form of horizontal maps of ssh max m portraying the entire coastal zone of the mediterranean basin the presented ssh max values correspond to model output of 30 year averages of annual maxima of ssh for the two main time windows of simulations for reference and future periods figs 18 20 the graphs are firstly separated by model implementation setup i e for cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss figs 18 19 and 20 respectively for the historical time window reference period upper graphs secondly they are separated by future climatic scenario i e rcp4 5 based runs middle graphs and rcp8 5 based runs lower graphs the latter two refer to percentage differences future reference period of estimated ssh max for each discrete model implementation for the end of the 21st century 2071 2100 along the coastline from the baseline historical 1971 2000 control run of mecss the 30 year averaged ssh max for every rcm forced mecss model implementation follows a similar and rather consistent pattern in terms of geographical distribution the largest storm surge maxima ssh max are observed in the northern adriatic sea followed by the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta south central mediterranean and north eastern levantine respectively the peak values of ssh max score 0 43 0 45 m reference 0 41 0 43 m future rcp4 5 and 0 43 0 44 m future rcp4 5 reaching up to ssh 0 58 0 65 m locally e g venice lagoon during certain years of simulation in the coastal zones of the northern aegean sea and southern france storm surge maxima range from 0 24 to 0 38 m while in the area around the gibraltar strait and the outer western boundary of the mediterranean ssh max may extent up to 0 35 m the mid latitude regions and the rest of the north african coasts show a consistent pattern for all climate implementations with ssh max 0 25 m in general the guf forced mecss results reveal the more pronounced ssh max values 0 42 0 44 m all over the mediterranean compared to the second and third cmcc and cnrm forced mecss 0 40 0 42 m and 0 37 0 38 m respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 mid graphs of figs 18 20 the storminess patterns and the consequent coastal surges are estimated to decrease by a percentage of 5 down to 15 depending on rcm in most of the mediterranean littoral areas adriatic alboran aegean and ionian seas sardinia sicily corsica crete cyprus and almost all african coasts the regions with a possible small increase of 5 7 for estimated future ssh max towards the end of the 21st century are the french coasts of the balearic sea the gulf of lions the ligurian sea coasts only for cnrm and guf implementations the south western italian coasts only for cmcc and guf implementations the gulf of gabes only for cmcc implementation the northern aegean sea only for guf implementation the north western cyprus and southern anatolia coasts both only for cmcc and guf implementations we observe that climatic projections tend to generally favour the future increase of local surge maxima only in areas of mid to low coastal sea level extremes while ssh max is estimated to slightly decrease in the 21st century in areas of the highest observed storm surges conditionally except from the gulf of gabes therefore an occasional projected attenuation of storminess over the entire mediterranean basin under the rcp4 5 scenario is rather prevalent for the last 30 years of the 21st century as also suggested by other researchers in the past e g marcos et al 2011 jordà et al 2012 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 all based on former sres the latter is further corroborated by the spatially averaged over the mediterranean coastline difference of ssh max from future to reference period which marginally reaches values of 3 72 9 92 and 4 66 for cmcc cnrm and guf implementations respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 lower graphs of figs 18 20 the storminess patterns and the consequent coastal surges are also estimated to decrease by generally higher negative percentages than the rcp4 5 driven output i e by a percentage of 10 down to 20 depending on rcm almost except from cnrm in most of the mediterranean littoral areas adriatic alboran aegean and ionian seas sardinia sicily corsica crete cyprus and almost all african coasts the only regions with a possible small increase of 5 for estimated future ssh max towards the end of the 21st century are the french coasts of the balearic sea only for cnrm implementation the ligurian sea coasts only for guf implementation the western italian coasts only for guf implementation the alexandroupoli coastal area in the northern aegean sea only for cnrm implementation finally a rather large possible increase 15 for the gulf of gabes only for cmcc implementation is also expected we again observe that climatic projections tend to generally favour a slight future increase of local surge maxima only in areas of mid to low coastal hazards related to storms while ssh max is estimated to decrease towards the end of the 21st century in high surge areas conditionally except from the gulf of gabes however it is noted that in the reference period cmcc and guf forced mecss model results were higher than the cnrm driven ones hence the occasional larger projected attenuation of storminess over the entire mediterranean basin under the rcp8 5 scenario our inferences are further confirmed by the spatially averaged over the mediterranean coastline differences of ssh max from future to reference period by rcp8 5 which score 11 6 44 and 8 76 for cmcc cnrm and guf implementations respectively essentially a similar spatiotemporal pattern of estimated ssh max evolution in the 21st century can be observed between cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss model outputs namely the averaged ssh max for every 30 year period follows a similar and consistent trend in its geographical distribution a conditional small rise in magnitude for the 21st century in certain mid level surge areas can be traced together with a respective generalized attenuation of ssh max almost everywhere around the basin especially in locations with observed strong surges in the past the guf model runs tend to overestimate the surge level maxima and their projected variations in the future period compared to the other two rcms yet except for the gulf of gabes within the cmcc forced simulations that assess a possible 15 20 increase in storm induced coastal hazard only under the pessimistic rcp8 5 scenario the inter scenario differences rcp8 5 rcp4 5 also reveal a stable pattern for all rcm forced model performances viz giving a slight increment of the pessimistic scenario compared to the modest one by 4 76 2 63 and 4 55 respectively for the evaluated storm surge maxima in general a plausible increase of ssh maxima may be estimated for the 21st century compared to those of the reference period only in specific areas under certain projected climatic conditions overall the spatial distributions of storm surge levels are estimated to remain similar to those of the past period throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone however a generalized storminess enfeeblement is more likely to occur in the study area towards the end of the 21st century moreover a reduction of averaged meteorological residual storm induced sea level ssh mean not shown here for the sake of brevity is also apparent throughout the 21st century the extreme magnitudes of ssh range between 0 4 m and 0 6 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of the adriatic sea and the gulf of gabes the differentiations between the two scenarios used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of ssh max which show a very stable pattern but in terms of magnitudes of surge induced sea levels for these a mild decrease of ssh max values can be observed for the 21st century for both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 driven mecss simulations the largest sshs of the entire mediterranean coastal region seem to occur in the adriatic sea probably due to the reinforcement of the inverse barometer effect by intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco 5 2 2 climate change signals of ssh maxima in the 21 st century the climate change signals ccs are also defined locally i e at 28 mediterranean locations as variations in the timeseries of annual storm surge maxima ssh max and annual meteorologically induced msl ssh mean averaged over the two 30 year periods of study 1971 200 and 2071 2100 for the two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 the 28 locations refer to coastal cities such as kavala thessaloniki heraklion lefkada chios and alexandroupoli in greece zadar dubrovnik split rovinj and bakar in croatia marseilles nice and toulon in france genova catania naples cagliari ancona otranto venice and trieste in italy alexandria in egypt ajaccio in corsica tarifa ibixa barcelona in spain and antalya in turkey see appendix b a3 ssh max relates to the annual maximum of ssh as storm surge induced high seas and ssh mean relates to the average ssh defined as the meteorologically induced residual of deviation from msl the analysis is separated to three discrete mecss model implementations cmcc forced cnrm forced and guf forced the raw data of calculations for the ccs of storm surge patterns for the 28 mediterranean coastal sites are provided in appendix b a3 figures a3 1 3 together with differences of future reference ssh max mean and their percentages compared to the respective reference period values table 4 presents the mean values averaged over the 28 locations of differences from a future reference subtraction for ssh max and ssh mean dssh max and dssh mean respectively together with their percentages compared to the values of the reference period e g dssh max ssh max ref in in general for all rcm forced mecss runs both scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 show small decreases in ssh max of 3 5 to 9 5 i e from 12 mm to 3 7 cm compared to the reference period thus rcp scenario based projections of storm surge maxima offer a bulk estimate of coastal storminess attenuation in terms of surges for the mediterranean basin towards the end of the 21st century nevertheless this is a spatially averaged assessment that presumes equal contribution of each location to the ccs calculation either weighted averaging or a spread out derivation at more representative coastal sites around the mediterranean littoral zone could maybe change this perception for larger or smaller decrease moreover when referring locally at certain stations for many of these coastal sites such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the ssh max is expected to increase from 1 up to 22 the change in ssh mean seems to be negative everywhere around the mediterranean basin at the rest of the locations the ssh max decrease towards the end of the 21st century ranges from 30 to 2 the aforementioned values refer to the cmcc forced mecss implementation similarly proportional changes are found for the cnrm and guf forced mecss simulated results although with a more pronounced attenuation pattern for these cases and specific differentiations of positive negative ccs given the different locations for the storm induced component of msl rise based on the calculation of ssh mean the general attenuation pattern is also prevalent for all cases of any rcm forced mecss run all the above signify that there is a need to assess if the calculated ccs is robust in our implemented projections i e trace if there is a strong agreement between the results produced based on the three rcms the robustness of the local ccs values for each coastal city was defined as the agreement of results per rcm induced cmcc cnrm guf forced mecss model results for at least one or even both of the rcp based 4 5 and 8 5 implementations as agreement we consider the case of e g both cmcc and cnrm or guf forced mecss to produce results that show a decrease or increase negative or positive rate of change as ccs respectively when comparing the future projections of ssh max mean to the respective reference period values the 30 year average of the annual meteorologically induced msl ssh mean tends to robustly decrease everywhere in the 28 examined coastal sites for all the possible rcm and rcp combinations tried in our analysis therefore the reducing ccs concerning the meteorological residual of msl deviation can be considered fully robust for the 30 year average of the annual storm surge maxima ssh max 18 out of 28 sites 64 present a robust agreement in the tendency to a storminess attenuation towards the end of the 21st century i e all rcm rcp combinations of mecss runs reveal an accordance about the trend for negative ccs values either for one of the rcps or for both especially for the coastal cities of kavala alexandroupoli toulon ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice ibixa and barcelona all rcm forced mecss implementations do not agree with each other but at least two out of the three rcm based runs tend to show the same behaviour analytic datasets are provided in appendix b a3 5 3 impact of mediterranean deep depression systems on storm surges the statistically significant correlation p v a l u e 0 01 with mann kendall test between the occurrence of storm surge maxima ssh max and deep depressions slp min see sections 2 4 2 3 3 fig 6 and 5 1 2 fig 16 for identification calculation methodology evaluation and derivation respectively is quantified by the pearson product moment coefficient of the slp timeseries on the nodal points of the rcm grid to ssh timeseries on all coastal cells of mecss model these refer to entire the mediterranean coastline yet specifically for the time window of occurrence of separate deep depression events therefore correlation maps on the mediterranean coastal zone are produced for each one of the identified deep cyclone events section 5 1 2 these are divided in two 30 year reference and future simulation periods by rcm forced implementations only for rcp8 5 worst case scenario for the sake of brevity in our case the negative pearson coefficient values reveal a large correlation of coastal ssh to the slp due to physical process of the inverse barometer effect lowest slps induce highest sea levels in the vicinity of the cyclone s eye thus the minima of correlations are then derived on every mecss coastal cell for each 30 year model run and compared against each other in respective pairs e g see intercomparisons in section 5 2 1 hence a cumulative portrayal of the effect of synoptic scale climatology on the coastal storm surges is achieved in a heuristic way this allows the mapping of vulnerable coastal areas due to storm surges exposed to specific identified atmospheric patterns of extreme low pressure systems figs 21 23 present maps of the calculated pearson correlation minima cor m i n slp min ssh max for the ssh on all coastal cells of the mecss model domain with the low slp values of the identified deep depression systems this way we produce a display of topographic variability of the influence that deep depression low pressure barometric systems exert on the entire mediterranean coastal zone in terms of storm induced sea level elevation the results are separated by model implementation setup i e for cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss figs 21 22 and 23 respectively presenting cor m i n slp min ssh max on reference and future period rcp8 5 maps upper and mid graphs the lower graphs in figs 21 22 and 23 refer to the algebraic differences future reference period of estimated correlation i e pearson coefficient minima of rcp8 5 based data last 30 years of the 21st century 2071 2100 to baseline control run data 1971 2000 along the coastline by each model implementation the localized 30 year cor m i n slp min ssh max for all rcm forced mecss model implementations follows a rather similar and consistent pattern in terms of geographical distribution figs 21 23 upper and mid graphs the highest correlations lowest cor m i n are observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts namely the littoral zones of the gulfs of valencia and lions the ligurian and northern adriatic seas cor m i n 0 50 to 0 65 they are followed by lower values on the coastal zones of mid latitude areas around corsica sardinia the mid zonal italian peninsula and the adriatic and the northern aegean sea cor m i n 0 55 to 0 40 significant yet lower correlations can be found in sicily south italy peloponnese crete the southern aegean archipelago and alboran sea cor m i n 0 45 to 0 25 this signifies the systematic influence of mediterranean deep depression systems on the coastal storm surges of the mediterranean basin in a progressive manner from its south to the north the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta show even lower correlations cor m i n 0 25 to 0 20 even though they are locations of exceptionally high storm surge maxima probably also influenced significantly by local wind patterns however they discern from the rest of the southern parts of the mediterranean coastal zone cor m i n 0 15 to 0 00 where the effect of deep depressions on sea level extremes seems minimal especially for cmcc driven mecss simulations all the above refer to the reference period nonetheless also apply to the future period estimations where differentiations between the southern and the northern parts is more pronounced especially for cmcc fed mecss runs this could be attributed to the known projected northward shift of the main cyclonic centres and tracks of medicanes or storms in general over the mediterranean during the 21st century based on climate change scenarios in the lower graphs of figs 21 23 the differences future reference of cor m i n reveal that when they are negative towards blue and purple colours it implies an increase of the deep depressions influence on the storm surges while positive values entail a decrease of the deep depression events on the occurrence of storm surge maxima therefore there is a very clear pattern of an estimated slight attenuation of the deep cyclones effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level in sardinia corsica the ligurian and adriatic seas and the entire italian peninsula for all rcm fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century this is projected to be the case also for alboran sea the gulf of valencia the north western african coasts and the ionian aegean and libyan sea coasts especially for the cmcc and guf forced mecss simulations respectively on the other hand a possible increase of the mediterranean deep depressions influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the gulf of lions the ionian aegean and levantine sea basins covering the north central and north eastern coasts of africa cmcc forced mecss similarly for cnrm and guf based future period runs alboran sea the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta are estimated to be further increasingly influenced by the projected deep depressions patterns while these kinds of cyclones are prone to further boost the storm surge maxima of the aegean sea for cnrm based implementations towards the end of the 21st century all the above refer to the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 compared to the 20th century baseline levels of the reference period conclusively the projected climate change scenarios examined herein allow us to investigate several differentiations in estimated future storminess patterns generally a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas with mid to high ssh max e g aegean ionian gulf of lions or valencia or gabes etc but not the highest throughout the basin e g venice lagoon ligurian adriatic etc in the latter coastal regions however intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco play a most significant role in the formation of high storm surges 6 discussion this study presents a systematic analysis of climatic simulations output about atmospheric patterns and barotropic ocean circulation in the mediterranean basin we follow an integrated approach of evaluating certain products med 44 slp and winds of the med cordex database and further feeding them as input to basin scale storm surge modelling mecss a control run baseline for mecss model in a 30 year reference period is thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide gauges the results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation towards the end of the 21st century under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios yet locally estimated increases or decreases of storm surge maxima around the mediterranean coastal zone is pinpointed and thoroughly discussed depending on rcm forced mecss implementation we conclusively propose a heuristic analysis for the quantification of the identified deep depressions extreme low pressure systems effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100 the signal of possible projected climate change effects is also provided in the form of comparisons by future reference period outputs an important issue which has come up in our analysis concerns the effects of climate and marine model resolutions on the produced results this particularly refers to the reproduction of storm surges in the coastal zone and therefore also to atmospheric data e g wind fields in the open sea and coastal waters resolution which influences the storm surge evolution according to ferrarin et al 2021 who analysed one of the most extreme flooding events in terms of physics in venice it is necessary to use a high resolution model 1 km in order to describe the local processes and the interaction with the local topography as well as to reproduce the small scale cyclonic vortices that develop in northern adriatic sea and affect the area of study but these kinds of resolutions are impossible to achieve for the entire mediterranean basin in terms of computational cost especially for the amount of simulations we implemented in our study i e 15 sets of simulations by 3 rcms 2 rcps 2 future periods 1 reference period denamiel et al 2021 discuss the balancing accuracy and efficiency of atmospheric models in the northern adriatic sub basin during the blowing of high bora winds they comment on the need for atmospheric model resolutions of o 100 m especially in focused fine scale process oriented studies to achieve accurate representation of severe bora rotor dynamics typical rcm resolutions of 10 km are not considered accurate enough to drive the marine coastal processes and a discussion is introduced about kilometre scale atmospheric models in order to balance accuracy and efficiency in coupled atmosphere ocean climate studies in the adriatic a divergence of results for both era5 reanalysis and wrf 15 km model output from super high resolution weather modelling with wrf 1 5 km is apparent especially in terms of wind speeds this is a crucial point and certainly sets new ground for climate studies in the coastal ocean but such an approach is still applicable only in focused local case studies e g northern adriatic sub basin referring to confined areas of the coastal zone rather than the entire mediterranean basin moreover according to denamiel and vilibić 2022 the next generation climate modelling efforts should focus on sub kilometre scale simulations for extreme storm surges and their projections in the 21st century as a proof of concept they present long term sea level variations and distributions at the climate timeframe yet again in the focused spatial scale of the adriatic sea s small lagoons and bays the authors assert that this newly developed methodology could lead to more targeted local mitigation strategies for the storm surge hazard in regional studies furthermore the utilized cera 20c data most up to date reanalysis dataset during the study implementation in 2019 era5 dataset was not published yet for the validation of the med cordex med 44 datasets have a lower resolution of 125 km compared to the latter of 44 km downscaled to 10 km therefore cera 20c wind fields might not be representative for fine scale effects of winds especially in coastal areas where diverse topography of shorelines play an important role in atmospheric dynamics however the spatial resolution of cera 20c dataset that was utilized was downscaled to 0 25 0 25 for easier comparisons it is further noted that the cera assimilation system has the ability to produce a more balanced and consistent earth system climate reconstruction as it takes into account the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean our study relies on mainly detecting the effects of slp on the sea level elevation around the entire basin in a large synoptic scale analysis therefore slp is considered to be the main driver for sea level elevation as it can be adequately simulated by the med 44 rcms feeding the 10 km resolution storm surge model the effects of winds are of course important especially in fine coastal scales and still simulated in our model but in a rather cruder way than the effects of slp as wind fields are highly irregular more steeply changing in space and time nevertheless our results focus on synoptic scale climatology of deep depressions by slp minima on the coastal ssh by the term coastal herein we refer to a rather crude scale representation of ssh on the continental shelf and not the exact fine scale sea level elevation on the coastline which would certainly require a very detailed dynamic downscaling of model runs this is still impossible to achieve in terms of computational cost in a systematic way for the entire mediterranean coastal zone for a climatic analysis from 1971 to 2100 involving several combined cases rcms and rcps thus we opted to check if the reasonably reproduced weather patterns mainly slp and winds could be used as forcing drivers for large scale maritime hydrodynamic simulations in the open sea of the mediterranean basin and not focus too much on fine scale topographic peculiarities and local coastal wind patterns certain local wind patterns could drive coastal waters to littoral run up in very diverse ways but this is an issue for a future study where we will focus on a lot finer scales for coastal inundation also involving wave induced sea levels on selected areas of the mediterranean coastal zone our results on the detection of deep depressions please refer to figs 6 8 can be also loosely compared to reale et al 2022 outputs please refer to their figs 2 3 the patterns of spatial distribution of deep depressions and the annual density of cyclone tracks seem generically similar with a pronounced centre over the ligurian sea and the southcentral italian peninsula including some cells expanding also to the central adriatic sea comparisons between the two works cannot be straightforward as they refer to different timeframes 1971 2000 and 1981 2005 in ours and reale et al 2022 analysis respectively while we compute the number of deep depressions in a 30 year period and reale et al 2022 present the spatial distribution of annual mean number of cyclone tracks in each 1 5 cell of the mediterranean however similar patterns can be found for wind speed fields too given the applied comparison restrictions 7 conclusions 7 1 conclusive remarks about atmospheric modelling aspects under the effects of climate change in the presented research the analyses are based on three implemented rcms namely cmcc cclm cnrm aladin52 and guf cclm nemo for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the 21st century atmospheric modelling datasets cover the reference 1971 2000 and future 2071 2100 periods of climate projections thorough validation of the rcm outputs was conducted by comparisons of the control run reference period datasets against the most recent cera 20c re analysis data no definite conclusion can be deduced concerning the skill score of the three models for all regions of the mediterranean about the barometric systems based on slp and wind patterns however the cclm model implementations of both the cmcc and guf institutions seem to slightly dominate over the cnrm s aladin model runs this is also the case for the detection of deep depressions over the mediterranean which is crucial for the simulation of storm surges and ssh variations due to climate change in some cases based on changing between seasonal and annual analyses and concerning warm or cold periods of the year the cnrm aladin52 model outputs are found to be superior to the rest of the model results therefore all climatic input datasets were used for the forcing of the mecss model implementations providing ensembles of results for a more robust representation of the future climate change impacts on mediterranean coastal sea level elevations in the 21st century from the analysis of the future projections of the three examined models cmcc cnrm and guf under rcp4 5 8 5 for sea level pressure slp wind speed and extreme cyclones the following could be concluded slp is expected to increase on an annual basis during the last 30 years of the 21st century over the mediterranean this is probably associated to a northward shift of cyclonic systems also found by other researchers in the past under a different rcm rcp scrutiny conversely to the other three seasons in summer the slp values are expected in general to decrease with the most intense negative differences future present day found over the sea rather than the continental areas regarding wind patterns the areas with the stronger wind speeds remain the same in the future as in the reference period both cmcc and guf models estimate that winds will become stronger over the aegean sea 2 5 m s meaning that this increase will affect greece and especially the islands of the aegean archipelago moreover in summer the etesian winds are estimated to become even stronger in the future with larger positive differences over the area of the aegean sea all three models estimate the occurrence of deep cyclones in the largest part of the mediterranean region in the cases of cmcc and guf models these cyclones are expected to have their centres mainly overland while according to cnrm model they are estimated to occur almost evenly between continental and oversea areas even though deep depressions are bound to occur in the future period their frequency is generally going to decrease towards the end of the 21st century 7 2 conclusive remarks about storm surge modelling aspects under the effects of climate change several implementations of maritime hydrodynamic simulation for storm surges throughout the entire mediterranean sea basin were conducted mecss model simulated the sea level variations and barotropic hydrodynamic circulation in offshore and coastal areas of the mediterranean both at present and future climatic conditions reference and future periods 1971 2000 and 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the model takes into account the inverse barometer effect and the win drag on the sea surface providing reliable estimations of storm induced sea surface height ssh variations locally under the estimated effects of climate change on marine water bodies msl rise estimations in the mediterranean under the med cordex initiative or other possible interactive effects on storm surge patterns at specific areas by e g tides seiches meteotsunamis wave induced runup etc were not considered in this study as they were out of scope the calibration and simulation of the storm surge model was conducted for a decadal period around the millennium for which there were available in situ observations by the hnhs for the simulation of the climate change impacts on storm induced sea level in the coastal zone of mediterranean the modelling results of three rcms cmcc cnrm and guf were used as forcing input to the mecss model the following conclusions can be deduced overall the cumulative comparison of measured and simulated 10 year mean ssis for the three mecss implementations reveals that there is a rather high correlation cor 0 79 reaching up to 0 89 with the lowest rmses of ssi and ssh max 3 cm being 13 of ssi mean referring to the guf forced mecss run this is also backed up by the very high skill scores wss 0 80 rendering the guf forced mecss model setup the generally yet not locally most reliable performance of the mecss model for the east central mediterranean region generally the mecss model can reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of ssh percentiles in an adequate way and thus the statistical distributions of the modelled ssh data are considered to be reliable for further use by coastal engineers and scientists especially for coastal water resources management moreover the mecss model can also adequately reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of statistical thresholds which correspond to heuristically defined coherent intense and extreme events it was also found to perform well in reproducing the probabilistic features of storm surge patterns in terms of the amount and occurrence frequency of surge events viz local maxima in the modelled ssh timeseries however a tendency is traced for the present mecss model implementations to underestimate small values of ssh and perform better for the estimation of large sshs representative of intense and extreme storm surge events therefore the reproduced probabilistic parametric features of the modelled ssh data are reliable for further coastal impact analysis in general a plausible decrease of ssh maxima is estimated for the last 30 years of the 21st century compared to those of the reference period moreover a slight reduction of average storm induced sea level ssh mean msl component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century extreme magnitudes of ssh max range between 0 35 and 0 50 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts venice lagoon gulf of lions northern adriatic and aegean seas etc and the gulf of gabes in its southern part overall the spatial distributions of surge level maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the reference period throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone differentiations between the two scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of ssh max which shows a very stable pattern but more in terms of magnitudes of the extreme surge induced sea levels for these a decrease of ssh max values that ranges from 30 to 2 can be observed towards the end of the 21st century especially for rcp8 5 driven mecss simulations the rcp driven scenarios of mecss implementations estimate a general attenuation of storminess in the mediterranean basin during the last third of the 21st century of course this is a spatially averaged estimation and for some specific coastal sites in croatia spain italy and france such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the ssh max is expected to increase from 1 to 22 towards the end of the 21st century analogously similar or proportional changes are found for the cnrm forced and the guf forced mecss simulated results although with a more pronounced attenuation pattern for these cases and differentiations of the locations of positive negative climate change signals 7 3 conclusive remarks about the correlation of deep depressions to storm surges under the effects of climate change by heuristically correlating the occurrence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima on the coast in a localized manner throughout the two 30 year periods of study for all rcm forced mecss model implementations it seems that the effect of deep cyclones on coastal sea levels follows a similar and consistent geographical pattern the highest correlations of deep depression events to sea level highs i e lowest pearson coefficients due to the inverse barometer effect were observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts gulfs of valencia and lions ligurian and northern adriatic seas they are followed by mid latitude areas around corsica sardinia the mid zonal italian peninsula and the adriatic and the northern aegean sea the influence of deep depressions on storm surges was lower for sicily south italy peloponnese crete the southern aegean archipelago and alboran sea a pattern of northward increase in the influence of mediterranean deep depression systems on the coastal storm surges of the basin is obvious the only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern mediterranean littorals are the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta these apply to the reference period however seem to repeat for future period estimations even with more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts especially for the cmcc based analysis a projected northward shift of the main cyclonic centres and tracks of storms over the mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century is likely the reason for the latter all the following conclusions refer to the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 compared to the 20th century baseline levels of the reference period the climate change signal difference of future reference period of the deep cyclones effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions these refer to sardinia corsica the ligurian and adriatic seas and the entire italian peninsula for all rcm fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century conditionally this is the case for the gulf of valencia the north western african coasts the alboran ionian aegean and libyan sea coasts under specific combinations of rcm rcp forcings on the other hand a possible increase of the mediterranean deep depressions influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the gulf of lions the ionian aegean and levantine sea basins covering the north central and north eastern coasts of africa only under the cmcc forced mecss outputs based on cnrm and guf based future period projections under the rcp8 5 scenario alboran sea the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta are estimated to be further increasingly influenced by the projected deep depressions in the 21st century the entire aegean sea s coasts are also prone to be influenced by deep cyclones under the cnrm based projections towards the end of the 21st century conclusively the projected climate change scenarios examined herein allow us to investigate several differentiations in estimated future storminess patterns a general consensus is that a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid to high ssh max e g aegean ionian gulf of lions or valencia or gabes etc but not the highest throughout the basin e g venice lagoon ligurian adriatic etc in the latter coastal regions however intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco might play a most significant role in the formation of high storm surges 7 4 future steps the results produced within this study can be used for investigations in specific locations of the mediterranean basin within integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions during the 21st century our next goals are to implement nonstationary extreme value analysis of nearshore storm surges galiatsatou et al 2019 2021 makris et al 2018 in order to assess design water levels at the shoreline under the effects of projected

herein it is taken as the average of standard deviations of all modelled and observed ssh timeseries σ s s h in the analysis of schoetter et al 2012 if the hrp index with range between 0 and 1 is greater than 0 95 then the model efficiently represents the regarded observation timeseries and the simulated dataset under examination does not need to be corrected for bias the hrp index is

23804,this study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the mediterranean induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions we try to add new insight in the long term climatic timescale identification of affected parts of the mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems indicative of the mediterranean basin during the 21st century to achieve this goal an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established green house gasses emission concentration scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots to this end climate projections and outputs from three regional climate models rcms of the med cordex initiative at the mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re analysis data these atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model mecss for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics sea level elevation and currents thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide gauges our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed moreover a slight reduction of average storm induced mean sea level msl component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0 35 and 0 50 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts venice lagoon gulf of lions northern adriatic and aegean seas etc and the gulf of gabes in its southern part overall the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone differentiations between the two scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima which shows a very stable pattern but more in terms of their magnitudes indicatively a decrease of surge maxima from 30 to 2 can be observed towards the end of the 21st century especially for rcp8 5 driven mecss simulations this is a spatially averaged estimation yet for some specific coastal sites in croatia spain italy and france such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the storm surge maxima might increase from 1 to 22 under different rcm rcp combinations towards the end of the 21st century our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100 the strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts gulfs of valencia and lions ligurian and northern adriatic seas they are followed by mid

the problem on a european scale they pinpointed several low land coastal areas of the mediterranean littoral zone that are threatened by the combination of high tides and storm surges and related

deltaic areas of egypt france greece italy and spain e g nile po rhone ebro vardar axios rivers etc enríquez et al 2020 have further stressed the need to pay attention to the spatial analysis of storm surge occurrence introducing the spatial footprint notion along coastline stretches withal the peculiarities of the complex topography and highly varying bathymetry in the mediterranean basin have also been identified as a crucial factor for surge induced coastal risk e g due to local hydrodynamic circulation driven by specific aeolian patterns i e lengthy fetch scirocco winds in the adriatic wind canalization in the northern aegean viz persistent etesian winds in the highly exposed central aegean archipelago and mediterranean extratropical cyclones etc lionello et al 2006b sánchez arcilla

et al 2019 2021 mel et al 2022 most of the studies based on future simulations with barotropic tide surge models under sres a2 a1b and b1 approaches have estimated a general decrease in the frequency and intensity of extreme surge events and attenuation of marine storminess over the entire mediterranean basin towards the end of the 21st century after 2050 with a possible increase of extremes locally only for the early quarter of the 21st century gomis et al 2008 marcos et al 2009 jordà et al 2012 tsimplis and shaw 2010 lionello et al 2012 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc however the projected rising mean sea level msl globally and the local isostatic changes land subsidence combined with low pressure systems affecting by the inverse barometer effect and intense onshore winds blowing in shallow waters and high tides may still induce individual enhanced episodic events of storm surge calafat et al 2022 the latter are likely to inflict catastrophic impacts on many areas of the mediterranean i e the northern aegean sea the eastern ionian coasts the entire adriatic coastline with emphasis on the northern part of it the gulf of gabes

discuss in either a concise or a more elaborate manner the model validation approaches and predictive model skill issues that may arise due to erroneous treatment of boundary conditions low resolution of simulations ambiguity of bathymetric data uncertainty in msl owing to eustatic changes and steric effects estimation under climate change conditions and parametric assumptions of physical processes

climatic projections in terms of timing and magnitude prediction as the storm surge models skill mainly rely on projected atmospheric forcing input given the above the comprehensive analyses of synoptic scale meteorology and climatology over the mediterranean basin are numerous trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 trigo et al 2002a lionello et al 2002 nissen et al 2010 garcies and homar 2011 campins et al 2011 sanchez gomez and somot 2018 velikou et al 2019 tolika et al 2021 and their relation to the occurrence of storm surges has been investigated extensively in recent literature

found that coastal inundation events are usually caused by enfeebled extra tropical cyclones following the south european extension of the north atlantic storm tracks or by secondary triggered cyclones in the north western mediterranean basin cyclogenetic centre of the gulf of lions the north african cyclogenesis centre can also produce deep depressions pronounced in the east central mediterranean probably affected by climate change signals mid latitude storm tracks and their mediterranean branches towards the adriatic ionian and aegean seas alpert et al 1990 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 flaounas et al 2018 lionello et al 2016 reale and lionello 2013 the main centres of cyclogenesis around and over the mediterranean sea are the genoa aera the saharan cyclonic regions mainly during spring the iberian peninsula thermal lows the aegean sea during winter and spring the eastern black sea region enhanced during summer the leeward regions of the alps and atlas mountains the cyprus cyclone source and the middle eastern centre over syria as an extension of the indian monsoon low maheras et al 2001 makris et al 2016 several characteristic atmospheric low

mediterranean coasts driven by sea level elevation due to the combinatory action of storm surges high tides and rough seas long and high waves with large energetic content martzikos et al 2021 past research about related climate change projections for the 21st century based on sres scenarios reveal significant alterations in the occurrence of cyclones and coastal sea level response particularly during winter lionello et al 2008 marcos et al 2011 jordà et al 2012 more recently međugorac et al 2021 found a small probability of significant change in the frequency intensity annual cycle and spatial structure of the local wind status inducing storm surges in the adriatic under the med cordex climate projections independently of the rcm boundary conditions rcp scenarios or future time interval considered moreover reale et al 2022 presented an analysis of mediterranean cyclone characteristics in projected future climatic conditions based on med cordex ensemble of coupled rcsms under rcp8 5 estimating the spatial patterns and cyclone activity in the mediterranean during the 21st century in general the rcsms showed a decrease in the number and an overall enfeeblement of cyclones moving across the mediterranean towards 2100 the authors corroborated the observed cmip5 projections for the area where an obvious increase in the central mediterranean is estimated compared to a decrease in its south eastern part a pronounced inter model discrepancy of rcsm outputs refers to the cyclone adjusted deepening rate seasonal cycle occurrence and associated wind patterns over some areas of the basin ionian sea and iberian peninsula 1 2 study objectives in all the above emphasis was put on the analysis of synoptic scale climatic weather patterns and tidal surge sea level anomalies astronomical tides can be more or less predicted within a deterministic framework in the long run whereas surges and waves and their extremes are estimated to evolve in a stochastic mode during the 21st century driven by projected climate change and have thus been treated probabilistically wahl et al 2012 wahl and chambers 2016 vousdoukas et al 2018 yet what seems to be fairly missing from literature is a long term and basin scale systematic analysis of deep depressions intense low barometric systems and their correlation to storm surges at the entire mediterranean basin s coastal zone e g lionello et al 2019 this motivates the present analysis to focus on coastal sea level variations of mid to short term timescale events but within a climatic 30 years timeframe therefore we engage filtering operations on the used tide gauge data in order to remove long term higher than a month effects of sea level variability prompted by basin scale oscillations planetary or edge waves steric effects and eustatic changes of the mediterranean water masses accordingly herein the storm surge on the coast is defined as the phenomenon that causes temporary short to mid term deviations e g setup of the sea surface height ssh from msl with simultaneous barotropic currents pushing seawater onshore these events usually last from a few hours to a few days having a large spatial extent and they are induced by severe synoptic timescale weather conditions combining the action of wind and sea level pressure slp on the free surface of seawater in local or regional scales meðugorac et al 2018 identifying the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones occurrence in climatic timescales 30 years is relevant to its correlation with coastal impacts and quantification of coastal hazards surges wave run up and floods hence in the present paper we try to recognize the evolution of cyclonic patterns and characteristics under possible future climatic conditions their influence on the coastal sea level response is then determined to assist the mapping of vulnerable littoral areas against possible inundation hazard specifically for the low lying coastal plains therefore the general objective of the paper is to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the mediterranean induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions thus our aim is to add new insight in the climatic scale identification of vulnerable parts of the coastal zones correlated to peculiar atmospheric patterns indicative of the mediterranean basin during the 21st century an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed to achieve these goals by combining projections from available established climate change scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcps with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on exposed coastal zone hotspots to this end climate projections and outputs from several global climate models gcms generating outputs of regional climate models rcms at the mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated the latter atmospheric datasets fed a validated robust storm surge model for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics sea level elevation and currents the proposed methodology incorporates and enhances older numerical simulations of the storm driven hydrodynamic circulation in the entire mediterranean basin with special focus on the meteorologically induced sea level variations on the coastal zone based on mecss model initially set up and presented by de vries et al 1995 further implemented by krestenitis et al 2011 established by androulidakis et al 2015 and enhanced with nested simulations by makris et al 2015 2016 2018 2020a moreover the produced results of the present study have already been used in a focused site specific study integrated within a local scale hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling approach under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century makris et al 2020b skoulikaris et al 2021 the application involved coastal flooding

on the sea level response over the entire mediterranean coastal zone related to storm surge impacts on vulnerable low land littoral areas for this purpose the modelling component of hydrodynamic circulation for storm surges is implemented by a 1 10 1 10 horizontal resolution the entire study area in tandem with the used tide gauge stations for validation are shown in fig 1 the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco http www gebco net was used to build the storm surge model bathymetries with bilinear interpolation into the models ortho regular computational grid with a resolution down to a spatial discretization step of almost dx 10 km the atmospheric forcing namely the winds at 10 m elevation from msl and the slp fields are provided in daily format within the spatial window of fig 1 the mediterranean sea s quite unique character results both from its complex morphology and the specific socio economic conditions highly urbanized littorals of coastal countries in southern europe northern africa and the southwestern anatolian part of asian continent therefore it is a practically enclosed aquatic basin in terms of storm surges and waves confined by the southern european continental land asia minor and the western part of the middle east and north africa connected to the atlantic ocean and the black sea through the very narrow straits of gibraltar and bosporus respectively the mediterranean basin includes several microtidal marginal seas sub basins and has its own peculiar very active regional thermohaline and weather driven circulation patterns the first induced by deep and intermediate dense water formation and convection in the gulf of lions the adriatic the south aegean and the north east levantine adloff et al 2015 and the latter by a specific regional cyclogenetic regime and local aeolian patterns the mediterranean basin is surrounded by a variable coastline and complex continental orography which causes several channelling regional winds e g mistral tramontane bora etesian sirocco etc this defines certain peculiarities in simulating local climatic conditions considering a spread out and strong land sea contrast land atmosphere feedback and intense air sea coupling viz the existence of many mid to large size islands and smaller insular formations e g in aegean archipelago may limit or enhance low level air flow defining local wind patterns etc makris et al 2016 2 2 climatic data the climatic data used as forcing to the hydrodynamic model implementation were retrieved from the med cordex

analysis fields see section 2 6 for analytical presentation of them and section 3 for the extensive evaluation anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions are mainly driven by human population size economic activities and policies lifestyles energy uses land use patterns technology developments and climate policies the rcps make projections based on the aforementioned factors and describe four different 21st century pathways of ghg atmospheric concentrations air pollutant emissions and land use in ipcc ar5 moss et al 2010 the rcps include a stringent mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two intermediate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and one scenario with very high ghg emissions rcp8 5 they are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the literature which indicate strong consistent almost linear relationships between cumulative co2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in all rcps and the wider set of proposed mitigation rcp scenarios include timeseries of emissions and concentrations of full suite ghgs aerosols and chemically active gases as well as land use cover moss et al 2008 two out of the four rcps presented in the ipcc ar5 are used herein rcp4 5 is an intermediate stabilization pathway in which radiative forcing is stabilized at approximately 4 5 w m2 and 6 0 w m2 after 2100 assuming constant concentrations after 2150 it describes a possible climate future that depends on modest estimations about greenhouse gases concentrations in coming years rcp8 5 considers radiative forcing that reaches 8 5 w m2 by 2100 and continues to rise for some amount of time assuming constant emissions after 2100 and constant concentrations after 2250 it poses a worst case scenario among the four rcps rcp4 5 can be characterized as a medium stabilization pathway with an estimated increase of temperature by comparison of the future period 2081 2100 to the pre industrial period 1850 1900 of 2 4 c range 1 7 3 2 c on the other hand aiming on estimating the future storm surges under the most pessimistic scenario we also choose rcp8 5 in which the increase of the global mean temperature is estimated to rise to 4 3 c range 3 2 5 4 c according to moss et al 2010 and van vuuren et al 2011 moreover for an easy association with the previous sres scenarios rpc4 5 is mainly similar to b2 low emissions scenario and rcp8 5 with sres a1f1 high emissions scenario 2 3 storm surge model the numerical modelling of maritime hydrodynamics comprises regional scale simulations of the entire mediterranean basin in terms of meteorologically induced ssh and barotropic currents on the coastal zone computations were done with the mediterranean climatic storm surge mecss model krestenitis et al 2011 2014 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 mecss is a long term climatic mode running version of the operational high resolution storm surge hiress model set up in the mediterranean basin krestenitis et al 2015 2017 makris et al 2019 2021 hiress mecss is a 2 d horizontal barotropic hydrodynamic circulation model that solves the depth averaged shallow water equations for the high resolution simulation of storm surges and related flows in large scale enclosed or semi enclosed water bodies de vries et al 1995 krestenitis et al 2011 2014 2015 mecss simulates the meteorologically induced sea level variations and depth averaged currents by considering large scale shear forces on the air seawater interface and the inverse barometer effect thus it takes into account the atmospheric forcing i e zonal and meridional wind fields at 10 m from msl and slp fields the geostrophic effects of the coriolis force the influence of astronomical tides on the open boundaries based on harmonic tidal elevation bottom friction on the seabed and internal friction forces due to horizontal vortices based on the eddy viscosity concept and the smagorinsky model approach makris et al 2015 2021 mecss computations are executed on an ortho regular staggered cartesian grid of the arakawa c type and the chosen numerical scheme of integration is an explicit first order forward time cantered space ftcs algorithm of the finite difference method fdm with small time step dt 30 s to keep a sufficiently low courant number producing output in a 3 hourly time interval over the entire mediterranean computational domain and on the coastal zone cells a contingency file for restart of computations and uninterrupted continuity of simulations is produced systematically in case of numerical blow ups or power failure as simulations are quite demanding in terms of computational resources and time it has been widely implemented in the mediterranean and other similar scale water bodies during the past decade for both climatic type long term simulations and short term operational forecasts of storm surges with ranging resolutions for the entire mediterranean basin e g 1 10 1 10 down to a 5 km horizontal grid and even 1 6 km in shallower water coastal areas viz thermaikos gulf and thesaloniki bay or nestos delta littoral zone in northern greece androulidakis et al 2015 krestenitis et al 2014 2017 makris et al 2016 skoulikaris et al 2021 it has been successfully calibrated and validated in the past to produce reliable estimates of sea level elevation during shallow and deep barometric systems giving acceptable to quite good estimations of negative and positive surges respectively in nearshore areas makris et al 2018 2019 2021 skoulikaris et al 2021 herein we examine the long term inter annual patterns of daily scale peak values of ssh induced by severe events of meteorological tides for which the storm surge impacts on the coast may last from several hours up to a few days depending on the inundation levels and extents makris et al 2020b skoulikaris et al 2021 tolika et al 2021 2 4 detection of deep depressions 2 4 1 identification of the mediterranean low pressure systems the deep depressions low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea have been the subject of numerous studies over the past years however at first their identification and localization were mostly based on empirical methods including the subjectivity of researchers maheras 1983 radinovic 1987 flocas 1988 later and since the 1990 s more objective methodologies were utilized to detect these centres of cyclogenesis at several domains of interest e g alpert et al 1990 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 flaounas et al 2018 over and around the basin according to relevant literature flocas and karacostas 1996 thorncroft and flocas 1997 trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 lionello et al 2016 the main areas characterized as cyclogenesis centres related to the mediterranean domain are the following the gulf of genoa the depressions are mainly formed over the downhill sides of the alps presenting quite stable frequency of occurrence throughout the year the gulf of lions as well as the balearic islands region are considered as extensions of the main centre and cannot be considered as separate cyclogenesis centres the region at the south of the mountain range of atlas the most characteristic area is at the northwest africa and the frequency of the cyclones is higher mainly during may and june the iberian peninsula it appears mainly during the mid spring period until summer when the temperature differences between sea and land favour the development of thermal depressions the aegean sea it is also characterized as a cyclogenesis centre even though it is a rather limited area in comparison to the aforementioned ones the eastern black sea there depressions can be formed throughout the year and mainly during the summer period july and august the broader cyprus region the east central levantine sea can produce cyclones of mid intensity usually observed during summer and autumn the middle east the area over syria and iraq related to the formation of summer cyclones as a result of the easternmost extension of the pakistan low 2 4 2 validation of med cordex rcms for the simulation of deep cyclones over the mediterranean sea in order to detect deep depressions i e cyclones with centre pressure lower than 1000 hpa trigo et al 2002b the methodology introduced by rousi 2014 was applied the proposed algorithm uses gridded data of daily slp by both cera and the three rcms for the studied 30 years timespans reference and future periods it computes the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions i e number of days within the 30 years period after the identification of separate cyclonic circulation events results are illustrated on gridded maps of the study area see sections 3 3 and 5 1 2 for results by comparisons of cera to rcm produced maps the ability of the climate models to reproduce both the locations of deep depressions and their frequencies can be assessed the characterization of a daily time step in our analysis as day of deep depression relies on two criteria firstly on this day slp in a grid point must be lower than 1000 hpa secondly it is also necessary for neighbouring grid points within a threshold radius to have higher atmospheric pressure values than that of the examined point to identify it as the centre of cyclogenesis as the med cordex project was very recent during the time of implementation of the presented research 2018 2020 and its evaluation is still ongoing only a few validation reports were available in recent literature these mainly focus on synoptic scale weather patterns cyclones

freely available by tide gauge measurements of national hydrographic services e g via the global sea level observing system gloss http www gloss sealevel org emodnet https map emodnet physics eu etc have been traced these have been used for comparisons with mecss results to validate the model s performance for control run during different reference periods see androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 2021 herein for temporal sufficiency homogeneity and qualitative consistency reasons data from the tide gauge network of the hellenic navy hydrographic service hnhs http www hnhs gr portal page portal hnhs are presented namely by four stations in the aegean sea thessaloniki alexandroupoli heraklion and chios and one in the ionian sea lefkada the available data cover an 11 year period from 1995 to 2005 to this end the retrieved historical climatic dataset for the reference period was expanded by 5 more years from 2001 to 2005 as comparisons of model field data are based on daily averaged ssh values in this study the measured in situ datasets were processed after subtraction of the calculated 11 year msl with a high pass filter operator using a cut off frequency of 1 30 days in order to exclude long term sea level oscillations conte and lionello 2013 the latter can be primarily induced by the steric effects due to the large scale low frequency thermohaline fluctuations and or total mass variations of the enclosed basin under investigation carillo et al 2012 these types of effects are not simulated by mecss which considers the mediterranean region as an enclosed aquatic body and thus it was necessary to exclude the effects of such processes from the observations as well moreover mecss model does not include modelling of tidal motions on all grid cells as is typically done in short term forecasts with hiress model but only on the open straits as a dirichlet type boundary condition astronomical tide signals are therefore removed from the used field data of ssh with the use of the t tide software pawlowicz et al 2002 it is also noted that tides are of generally small amplitude in most parts of the mediterranean sea compared to the extreme positive and negative free surface elevation due to storm surges this is not necessarily true for the n adriatic where the tidal signal can add up to 30 cm on the 50 year return period ssh marcos et al 2009 it is noted that no tidal gauge data in the adriatic region were used for comparisons with model output in the present study 2 6 available climate reference data for rcm validation for the evaluation of the used rcm outputs datasets by the cera 20c coupled assimilation system are used please note that finer resolution datasets e g era5 were not yet available at the time of implementation cera 20c consists of a 10 member ensemble of coupled climate re analyses of the 20th century from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and aims at reconstructing the past weather and climate of the earth system including the atmosphere ocean land ocean waves and sea ice laloyaux et al 2018 the timeseries cover the period from 1901 to 2010 it is based on the coupled ecmwf re analysis cera coupled data assimilation system laloyaux et al 2016 which assimilates only surface pressure and marine wind observations as well as ocean temperature and salinity profiles it has been one of the crucial outcomes of era clim2 project https www ecmwf int en research projects era clim2 the cera 20c product describes the spatiotemporal evolution of the atmosphere 125 km horizontal grid with 91 vertical levels between the surface and 0 01 hpa the land surface 125 km horizontal grid with 4 soil layers the waves for the period 1901 2010 the ocean 110 km horizontal grid with meridional refinement at the equator 42 vertical levels and the sea ice it should be highlighted that atmospheric data are not only available on the native 91 model levels but also on 37 pressure levels as in era interim 16 potential temperature levels and the 2 pvu potential vorticity level the utilized spatial resolution of cera 20c dataset was a downscaled version of 0 25 0 25 the cera assimilation system has the ability to produce a more balanced and consistent earth system climate reconstruction as it considers the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean more detailed information about the cera database can be found via the link https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets archive datasets reanalysis datasets cera 20c to evaluate the skill of the three selected rcms in simulating the main parameters that were used for mecss forcing it was decided to execute comparisons during the 30 year reference period 1971 2000 on both an annual and seasonal basis 3 climatic data evaluation in any respect all researchers stress the need of consistent and quality checked fine scale observational datasets for the robust evaluation of rcms in the following we present our own systematic validation of the med cordex slp and wind data for the reference period 1971 2000 control run simulations via comparisons against cera 20c datasets 3 1 validation of sea level pressure fields over the mediterranean region 3 1 1 annual analysis the spatial distribution of both re analysis and rcm data for averaged slp values on an annual basis is presented in fig 2 regarding the mean annual slp fields derived from cera data it is found that the pressure values range from 1013 up to 1020 hpa with an increasing gradient from east to west northwest the minimum is located over cyprus and the highest ones at the north in the iberian peninsula the comparison with equivalent slp fields simulated by the three examined rcms cmcc cnrm and guf see section 2 2 showed that all three models can capture the main characteristics of annual atmospheric pressure patterns with the lowest values at the easternmost part of the mediterranean basin and the highest over to its western part the calculated differences which were evaluated applying t test statistics at a level of significance 0 05 revealed that the cmcc tends to slightly overestimate the actual slp values all over the domain of study small positive differences cover almost the entire mediterranean region up to 3 hpa and only at a limited area near the north western boundary the computed differences are negative however even though the magnitude of the differences is small most of the grid points were found to be statistically significant since the applied test considers the actual compared values of node to node slp timeseries in tandem with the discrepancies in their variability regarding the cnrm model the difference pattern divides the mediterranean region in half the northern continental parts are characterized by negative differences i e model underestimates slp values whereas the marine area shows small positive differences with higher overestimation over the south eastern mediterranean central and eastern levantine southern anatolia and the middle eastern continent and coasts values of mean slp deviations vary from 3 hpa to 3 5 hpa the guf model overestimates the annual atmospheric surface pressure towards the southern mediterranean and the iberian peninsula positive differences while in the northern part of the domain the differences are negative slp underestimation as in previous models guf modelled slp differences are quite small showing that the three models present an efficient skill in simulating mean slp characteristics main dynamics of barometric systems during the typical annual cycle for a 30 years period 3 1 2 seasonal analysis the large scale barometric system patterns during winter of the reference period 1971 2000 according to the cera results is characterized by four main high pressure centres above 1020 hpa i e over the iberian peninsula algeria balkans and turkey fig 3 the central and eastern mediterranean sea on the other hand is characterized by lower values with a minimum over cyprus all models seem to be able to capture the location of these maximum centres but with overestimated pressure values while the minimum in all of them is found at the north western parts of the domain in spring appendix b figure a1 1 all over the mediterranean slp values are much lower and more uniform in comparison to winter slp varies from 1015 hpa at the south eastern parts cyprus syria lebanon and to 1017 hpa at the western parts of the mediterranean with slp maxima covering a quite large area the studied rcms can reproduce the spring slp fields but the barometric highs are slightly more extended and intense compared to cera datasets especially for guf s rcm a stronger horizontal gradient characterizes the summer mean slp fields over the mediterranean varying from 1005 hpa over its eastern parts up to 1019 hpa at the northwest similar to aforementioned seasonal patterns the three rcms present high skills in reproducing the spatial pressure distribution capturing the main characteristics of summer pressure over the mediterranean finally a more uniform distribution of the mean slp values is illustrated in appendix b figure a1 2 during autumn according to the cera data the minimum is located at the southeast of the mediterranean region while the highest mean pressure values are observed at the north especially over the balkan peninsula cmcc model can simulate this maximum but high pressure values 1020 hpa are found over france and spain too equivalent slp autumn values are also observed over the western african coast the cnrm simulations have a similar pattern with slightly lower values they do not exceed 1018 hpa analogous results are found in the case of the guf model with the minimum over cyprus and the maximums located over the same areas as the cera pattern moreover the respective composite maps of mean slp differences over the entire studied domain comparing cera to the three rcm datasets the winter period is characterized by the largest differences compared to the rest of the seasonal patterns specifically the cmcc model mainly overestimates the winter mean slp with the highest positive differences found over the central and eastern mediterranean sea turkey and the south eastern african coast on the other hand cnrm and guf models overestimate the winter slp mean values over the central and southern parts of the domain while an underestimation negative differences down to 5 hpa is observed over the northern continental parts in spring cmcc can simulate the actual mean slp values even better since all over the study region the differences are very small close to zero cnrm underestimates the pressure values at the north western parts of the mediterranean whereas positive differences are found at the south eastern parts of the basin simulations seem more efficient over the marine areas than continental ones the relevant map of the cnrm cera comparisons shows that negative differences prevail at the north western western and central mediterranean sea whilst positive ones at the southwestern african coast in the case of guf s rcm the positive differences cover a more extended westernmost area up to the iberian peninsula appendix b figure a1 1 as regards summer differences both cmcc and cnrm models slightly underestimate summer mean slp fields over the maritime mediterranean area and the african coast and slightly overestimate them over the continent mainly cmcc conversely guf model overestimates the reference period s mean slp values almost all over the examined domain with the positive differences increasing from north to south fig 3 finally the computed autumn difference maps show that cmcc and guf models have a similar performance in simulating the mean slp values and overestimate them all over the domain of interest in the case of cnrm model positive differences cover only a very limited part of the mediterranean at the southeast and negative differences dominate the largest deviations being statistically significant are found at the north western parts of the region appendix b figure a1 2 3 2 validation of wind fields over the mediterranean region 3 2 1 annual analysis fig 4 displays the 30 years mean climatic patterns of wind speed over the study domain based on annual cycle analysis according to cera data depictions the prevailing pattern refers to more intense winds over the marine areas than overland maximum values of mean wind speeds reach up to 8 m s over the aegean sea as expected a secondary maximum of mean atmospheric circulation can be seen over the broader gulf of lions area as well as in the southwestern mediterranean region between sardinia and tunisia the occurrence of wind maxima over the aegean region could be attributed to the etesian winds during summer as well as to the strong north winds prevailing in winter moreover the western maximum over the broader region around marseille is found in one of the most characteristic cyclogenetic centres of deep depression formation over the mediterranean which should be associated with high speed winds the evaluation of the three examined rcms in simulating the wind fields over the mediterranean showed in general an efficient skill in reproducing the spatial distribution of their velocities fig 4 the gulf of lions is the region where all climate models reproduce the highest mean wind speed values up to 8 m s while the aegean sea is the second mediterranean area where high winds blow however discrepancies can be traced e g rcms could not reproduce the intense wind regime above and around the island of crete conversely to cera output another differentiation of the rcm simulation outputs from the cera annual wind maps is the existence of more intense winds at the strait of gibraltar fig 4 left column regarding the continental parts of the study domain cmcc and guf models simulate slightly higher wind speeds especially in some parts of the balkan peninsula and the mountainous areas of the iberian peninsula on the other hand the cnrm model reproduces quite weaker winds over spain italy and greece the equivalent composite maps of mean wind speed differences between rcms and cera values reveal several relatively small areas where the differences are rather significant fig 4 right column all models underestimate negative differences the wind speeds at the mediterranean coasts of spain and france over corsica and sardinia the southern parts of italy in greece above peloponnese and crete and in the south eastern coastal area of turkey moreover negative differences up to 2 5 m s can be found over cyprus the above findings could be attributed to inadequacies in schemes and resolutions of the rcms in simulating regional peculiarities of aeolian patterns and local complexities of the geographical characteristics in the mediterranean region especially in areas with diverse island formations and intense changes in land sea sequence regarding the main body of the mediterranean sea the three examined rcms seem to slightly overestimate the average wind speed patterns with small positive differences all over the region cmcc model results portray the highest overestimations while for guf model positive differences are very close to zero except for the gibraltar strait the latter is an area where highest positive differences are traced up to 2 m s as mentioned above the gulf of lions is another area where rcms overestimate the mean wind speed climate as well as the ionian sea the eastern and south eastern parts of the aegean sea guf model seems to underestimate the annual basis mean wind speed regime of the northern parts of continental africa even though it presents the smallest differences in comparison to the other two rcms fig 4 right column 3 2 2 seasonal analysis during winter the cera mean wind speed fields over the aegean sea reach up to 9 m s representing an apparent local maximum throughout the mediterranean region followed by the local high wind speed potential in the gulf of lions fig 5 in spring the winds in these two areas are much weaker and the domain of study presents a much more uniform wind speed pattern in summer a dipole is detected with strong winds in the aegean region etesians over the central and southern parts and significantly weaker winds over the central mediterranean tyrrhenian sea and sicily finally in autumn the two maxima winter pattern remains but with significantly lower wind speeds appendix b figure a1 3 the equivalent maps of the cmcc model output reveal its ability to reproduce the main features of the horizontal wind speed distribution during winter months when maxima are correctly represented over the gulf of lions and the aegean sea however it is noteworthy that strong winds are also detected over the black sea especially at its north and north western parts as well as in the central part of the mediterranean sea between sardinia and sicily fig 5 a more homogeneous wind speed pattern is reproduced during spring period in accordance with cera data yet with persistent stronger winds over the gulf of lions appendix b figure a1 3 in summer the cmcc s rcm can reproduce the etesian winds regime in the aegean but with lower speed values on the other hand in autumn depictions the two aforementioned maxima are higher than cera results fig 5 cnrm simulations diversify in terms of winter patterns as the model can capture strong wind fields over the gulf of lions but the maximum over the aegean sea is much weaker than the cera one for the rest of the seasons more homogeneous wind speed patterns are detected apart from the southern french continental shelf maximum the rest of the mediterranean sea is characterized by speeds from 6 to 7 5 m s finally the guf model seems to reliably simulate the actual pattern of winds distribution over the study domain yet especially winter wind fields are estimated to be much stronger on the other hand the summer dipole mentioned in the above paragraph is more extended especially its minimum pole and the greatest part of central mediterranean sea is covered by wind speed values that do not exceed 3 m s fig 5 the composite maps of wind velocity differences fig 5 show in general the same positive and negative poles as in the previous maps it is worth mentioning that the highest positive differences overestimation of the guf model refer to wintertime and that the overestimation of wind speeds over the strait of gibraltar corresponds to all seasons for all three rcms fig 5 3 3 evaluation of extreme sea level pressure systems according to the annual scale analysis of cera data fig 6 deep cyclones can be found in a quite large part of the mediterranean region especially over the sea for most of the grid points the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions does not exceed five days during the reference period 1971 2000 however it is obvious that there are regions of depression centres especially over italy in the apennine peninsula where these frequencies are higher fig 6 the maximum is found over two of the most well known regions of mediterranean cyclogenesis such as the gulf of genoa ligurian sea and the gulf of venice in the adriatic sea in these areas the frequency of extreme depressions reaches 10 days 2nd class for some grid points in the aforementioned regions as well as the gulf of taranto in southern italy the frequency is even higher up to 15 days 3rd class finally grid points with 2nd class frequency of occurrence are detected in the north of cyprus at the northeast of the black sea as well as in the centre of the tyrrhenian sea it should be underlined that these centres are in accordance with previous studies trigo et al 1999 maheras et al 2001 regarding cmcc model results its ability to reproduce the main centres of the deep depression formation over the domain of study is rather plausible however the grid points of the domain which satisfy the suggested criteria for deep depression identification are more than the relevant cera based results furthermore a larger number of grid points have frequencies of the 2nd class 5 to 10 days the deep cyclone centre over the gulf of venice presents the largest recurrence pattern with 20 days of extreme depressions fig 6 for cnrm model the spatial distribution of incident frequencies of deep cyclones is quite similar to the cera one with the main cyclonic centres over the gulfs of genoa and venice the middle of the tyrrhenian sea and the centre of the adriatic sea fig 6 however the hotspot of deep depressions with a maximum frequency of 20 days is shifted to the west at the gulf of genoa in comparison with the cmcc model finally the equivalent annual scale results of the guf model are mainly analogous to the cmcc model output regarding especially the frequency maximums fig 6 in general guf s rcm is capable in reproducing the deep depression areas also indicating three neighbouring grid points over the central and northern aegean sea with frequencies of occurrence up to 10 days and one more over the northern black sea with barometric low incident frequencies in the 3rd class 10 to 15 days figs 7 8 and a1 5 6 in the appendix b present the spatial distribution of the grid points corresponding to locations with sufficient days of incident deep depressions 1000 hpa on a seasonal basis for the winter season fig 7 the largest percentage of deep cyclogenetic areas are located over the sea rather than the continental parts of the mediterranean region the grid points with the maximum frequencies are found over the adriatic sea the gulf of genoa at the west of corsica and at the gulf of taranto respective results were found for the cmcc s rcm simulations with a more extended cyclogenesis area over the black sea in general the winter deep depression frequencies do not exceed the five days threshold during the reference period in the cnrm case rcm results are very similar once again to the cera data indicating that the model can capture the deep depression occurrence frequencies in both location and magnitude in the aegean sea the number of cnrm grid points with deep depressions is smaller than the cera based ones while there is an overestimation of them over the balkan peninsula moreover the guf model results show that rather few grid points in the southern mediterranean sea fulfil the criteria of the extreme cyclone incidence while the maximum is reasonably located over the gulf of genoa with winter incidence frequency reaching up to 15 days fig 7 during springtime cera results show that the main pattern of the deep depression grid points is quite similar to the winter one even though their number is higher and they are more extended to the south it is noteworthy that frequency maxima are traced over the continental parts of the study domain the most important differentiation of the cmcc simulations is the exaggerated number of cyclogenetic grid points with deep depressions covering a very large part of the mediterranean region however the incident maxima are located at the same areas as the winter ones appendix b figure a1 5 analogous overestimating results were found for the other two rcms from cnrm and cuf the summer results both for cera and rcm simulations show that the deep depressions are quite fewer than the rest of the seasons and the areas that are generally characterized by extreme depressions are limited over the northeast of the study domain fig 8 lastly cera results for the autumn season show that most of the deep cyclone grid points are gathered over the central parts of the mediterranean sea with the maximum frequency location over the northern adriatic sea while very few grid points are found in the southern mediterranean all rcms seem to simulate this pattern efficiently appendix b figure a1 6 4 storm surge model validation the rigorous evaluation of mecss model and its operational forecasting counterpart hiress has been extensively performed during the last decade especially within the mediterranean basin including datasets form greek spanish italian and french tide gauges androulidakis et al 2015 krestenitis et al 2015 2017 makris et al 2015 2016 2019 2021 for the sake of coherence brevity and fulfilling the need for continuous datasets during an adequate timespan at least 10 years within a climatic study of the reference period 1971 2000 herein we focus on comparisons of mecss results against field data of ssh in five selected greek stations data from other mediterranean hydrographic services are not freely available for the specific timeframe at least within the classic sea level data sources the utilized datasets refer to uninterrupted long term and extensively pre validated in situ hydrographic information by tide gauges of the hnhs herein the mecss model runs were extended to 2005 to at least cover a decadal period 1995 2005 for validation purposes forced by the same set of cmcc cnrm guf rcms produced atmospheric conditions in evaluations of climatic mode runs of storm surge models researchers usually pursue the agreement of model results and field observations mainly based on statistical measures of either seasonal or annual and inter annual maxima values and their correlations rather than day to day comparisons of modelled and in situ ssh timeseries as commonly done in operational forecasts this is because the atmospheric forcing data from rcms does not reproduce the daily weather patterns as in meteorological forecast modelling but rather seeks to capture the long term climatic patterns of atmospheric circulation 4 1 storm surge index and ssh maxima in the present analysis we focus on inter annual maxima of storm surges in order to trace 30 year long changes of sea level variations therefore the storm surge index ssi is used as it refers to the average of the three highest independent storm surge maxima per year conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 etc only incidents of maximum ssh separated by at least 120 h estimation of the maximum duration of a typical storm in the mediterranean are considered as independent storm surge events to avoid overestimations of ssi due to the occurrence of multiple conjugate peaks within a unique storm incident in the ssh timeseries the ssi for both simulated and observed timeseries was calculated for each of the five stations along with corresponding percent error e error index ei root mean square error rmse pearson product moment correlation coefficient cor x and willmott skill score wss or index of agreement ioa see appendix a 1 for analytic definitions of statistical parameters fig 9 presents the comparisons of the decadal 1995 2005 average ssi m and ssh max m in five selected greek stations between field and model cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss data all mecss model implementations follow the same geographical pattern as the one referring to field observations i e higher storm surge levels in the northern part of the studied area and lower sshs towards the south the model s performance is better in the central aegean and ionian seas chios and lefkada followed by the northern part of the aegean sea alexandroupoli and thessaloniki while in heraklion the mecss runs seem to behave like an outlier this is attributed to peculiarities of the computational domain s coastal bathymetry in the southern aegean sea on the northern coast of the island of crete the guf forced mecss model runs perform quite adequately in almost all locations in general mecss model implementations forced by med 44 resolution med cordex climatic data for the reference period slightly underestimate the magnitudes of annual ssh maxima and ssi except from guf mecss in the central aegean table 2 presents the aggregate estimation of mecss model s performance forced by the three rcms cmcc cnrm and guf in the form of overall statistical measures and skill metrics e ei rmse cor and wss for comparisons between field and model data these are based on decadal 1995 2005 averages of ssi and ssh max at five greek stations corroborating several previous works e g androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 the highest ssi values occur over the northern aegean coastal region alexandroupoli where both modelled and observed ssis are 23 cm the median percent errors range from quite small to tolerable 13 e i 6 2 for ssi and 22 e i 12 for ssh max with generally low values in certain parts of the mediterranean basin this supports the good performance of mecss model during the reference period even though the model underestimates the ssi at all stations negative ei values the error is generally acceptable and differences between modelled and observed ssi values are plausible conte and lionello 2013 also showed results of storm surge climate simulations with rather high errors e g e 40 and similar underestimations of the simulated ssh over coastal regions of the western mediterranean the model resolution might be the prime reason for this discrepancy yet refining the discretization of storm surge models for long term climatic runs drastically increases the need for computational resources and times undermining the feasibility of adequate combinations of rcms rcps implementations similar analytic comparisons of storm surge intra annual extremes were performed based on the absolute yearly maxima of sea level variations giving an average of annual ssh max for both simulated and observed timeseries same comparisons as for the ssi were performed providing similar results overall the cumulative comparisons reveal quite high pearson correlation coefficients 0 8 with rmse ranging from only 3 to 4 3 cm namely a rough 12 18 of the average ssh max and 7 of the absolute observed ssh max the ioa based on wss reveals a high correlation of guf forced mecss model 0 8 with field data in terms of the interdecadal ssh extremes the skill scores of the cmcc and cnrm forced mecss are lower rendering the guf forced mecss model setup as generally but not locally most reliable in performing estimations of the extreme climate of storm surges large ssh at least for the east central mediterranean 4 2 ssh percentiles and hrp index to enhance our validation of mecss runs for the reference period comparisons of simulated ssh with corresponding field data were expanded to other types of storm surge maxima and mid range values of storm induced sea levels thus the performance of mecss model implementations was also evaluated using mid to high order percentiles 80th 90th 95th 97 5th 99th 99 5th etc of ssh for both modelled and observed timeseries as ssi and ssh max values lie around the 99th and 99 5th percentiles for the sake of brevity only comparisons of the decadal 1995 2005 97 5th and 90th percentiles of ssh for field against cmcc cnrm and guf mecss data are presented in fig 10 the highest modelled values were derived again for the northern aegean sea alexandroupoli in agreement with the analysis of intra annual maxima ssi and ssh max it is although obvious that unlike the case of ssh maxima all model runs tend to overestimate the ssh for mid range values i e for the 90th and lower percentiles in general all model implementations perform very well for the 97 5th percentile of ssh to acceptably for the 90th percentile of ssh the rest classes of percentiles are not shown for the sake of conciseness the case of heraklion is still considered to be an outlier compared to other locations of focus e g mecss model skill in ssh percentile comparisons is very good for lefakda chios and alexandroupoli sites and occasionally for thessaloniki we note that the hreaklion in situ measured timeseries is the most unreliable out of the bunch of the hnhs observations as it is incomplete lacking continuous information about the 1995 1997 period it is also evident that all model implementations perform very well in reference to the decadal 97 5th percentile of ssh therefore it can be deduced that the agreement of the mecss model runs for all model implementations is high in terms of the unfiltered ssh mid and extreme values reproduced within the 1995 2005 period aiming to quantitatively assess the ability of the mecss model to reproduce a wide range of the ssh values within its simulated timeseries and further decide on the essentiality of a possible bias correction of modelled results we also calculated the hit rate of percentiles hrp index schoetter et al 2012 makris et al 2016 as a model evaluation metric see appendix a 1 in general if hrp index is greater than 0 95 then bias correction is not necessary for model results the closest that hrp values are to 1 then it can be deduced that mecss model should efficiently reproduce the most classes of ssh in the simulated dataset this applies to maxima mid range and minima of modelled ssh i e for both positive and negative surges the hrp index for the five greek stations is presented in table 3 regarding cmcc cnrm guf forced mecss model runs it was found that the mecss model simulates the statistical properties of the ranked percentiles of ssh in four of the characteristic locations adequately heraklion continues to be the outlier reference spot since hrp exceeds the limit of 0 95 everywhere and reaches the value of 0 98 and 1 00 in thessaloniki and alexandroupoli for the cmcc and guf meccs setups the latter however seems to slightly outperform the cmcc and cnrm forced mecss simulations in terms of mean hrp values yet the median hrp index reveals that differences are marginal 0 95 0 96 for all three model implementations and not able to offer a definite reason for discarding the one or the other setup altogether it can be concluded that the mecss model can reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of percentiles in an adequate way and thus the statistical distributions of the modelled ssh data are considered to be reliable for further use in future projections during the 21st century by a combination of rcms rcps implemented mecss 4 3 probabilistic analysis of ssh maxima occurrence and threshold values exceedance a heuristic approach is used in the present study to define statistically coherent events as these storm surge incidents having values of ssh c o h μ s s h σ s s h where μ is the mean of the ssh timeseries over the entire study period 1995 2005 and σ is the corresponding standard deviation makris et al 2015 2016 skoulikaris et al 2021 the exceedance probability p c o h of the critical value for coherent events together with the respective calculated thresholds ssh c o h μ s s h σ s s h for all greek stations are presented in fig 11 top and mid graphs as derived from both simulated and observed timeseries of ssh the simulated values are correlated well with the measured ones in all stations except the heraklion site with lower frequencies of occurrence shown here by probabilities of exceedance of coherent events over the ionian and central aegean seas lefkada and chios compared to the northern aegean regions thessaloniki and alexandorupoli it follows that these areas show more frequent either lower or higher in magnitude ssh both model and in situ values support this finding indicating the good performance of the mecss model between different areas it is also noted that the coherent threshold is adequately estimated or slightly overestimated everywhere except from the heraklion station where model results exactly fit to the field data overall it can be deduced that the mecss model can adequately reproduce the statistical storm surge patterns corresponding to heuristically defined coherent events a tendency is traced for the mecss model implementations to mostly overestimate small values of ssh and perform better for the estimation of statistical features for larger ssh values not shown here for brevity representative of intense storm surge events therefore the reproduced probabilistic parametric features of the modelled ssh data can be considered reliable for further use in future projections under several rcp climate change scenarios we have also calculated the probabilities of occurrence of local peaks in the ssh timeseries at the five greek stations in order to assess the performance of mecss model in terms of the local maxima of sea level variations in coastal regions with different topographic characteristics the local maxima computation is based on the minimization of the ssh distribution gradient in local short frames of the timeseries where there is a flat tangent line the probability of occurrence of ssh local maxima is shown in fig 11 lower graph as derived from the number of days that they appeared in the ssh timeseries divided by the total number of days of each study period for each station all local peak points maxima with ssh that exceed 10 20 and 30 cm were also computed to evaluate the mecss model performance during events of extreme surges not shown here for conciseness the comparison between model and field data shows that the agreement is very satisfactory in all stations for all three mecss implementations this observation agrees with previous studies androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2015 2016 for the sres 20c3m historical dataset that have also found the highest ssh values of the aegean over the northern part of it in general it can be concluded that the mecss model can well reproduce the probabilistic features of storm surge patterns in terms of the amount and occurrence frequency of surge events leading to a prominent peak in the modelled ssh timeseries the latter correspond to temporally local events of high sea levels on the coast induced by meteorological phenomena therefore the estimated probabilistic features of the modelled ssh data are considered reliable for further use in a climatic study of storm surge patterns estimation in the 21st century 5 results in the following projections of the rcm simulation results are provided over the mediterranean region we provide estimations on a 30 year level of analysis for the cyclonic patterns and synoptic scale atmospheric dynamics that serves as input in high resolution hydrodynamic modelling with mecss model we further analyse the sea level response to rcm projections in the entire mediterranean basin and present climate change signals of the maxima and mean ssh due to storm surges on the shoreline and correlations of deep depressions to episodic elevations of coastal sea level 5 1 weather patterns by rcm projections in the 21 st century the climatic projections of mean and extreme barometric systems i e the projected changes of respective slp and wind fields over the mediterranean region for the 21st century per rcm implementation and rcp scenario used is presented herein this is done to correlate the future trends and climate change signals of synoptic scale patterns barometric systems and aeolian regimes to the respective projected trends of episodic ssh and storm surge induced changes in msl on the coastal zone of the mediterranean basin 5 1 1 mean barometric systems over the mediterranean region future climate projections for sea level pressure and wind fields an attempt is made to analyse the potential future changes as estimated by the three rcms used regarding the two main parameters that are widely used slp and wind speeds since this is a primer analysis on the model s future projections it is selected to present the results regarding the last 30 year period of the century and to show the rcm estimations under the high emission concentration scenario rcp 8 5 according to the ipcc synthesis report 2014 the rcp 8 5 is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions that lead to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time estimating that co2 levels will triple by the end of the century accompanied by a rapid increase of the ch4 emissions the future estimations of the slp and wind changes were computed by calculating the biases differences of the mean annual and seasonal values of the two examined parameters future period 2071 2100 in comparison with the equivalent values of the reference period 1971 2000 which are analysed in section 3 fig 12 illustrates both the mean annual spatial distribution of the slp values over the mediterranean region as well as the calculated difference future present for each model under study all models agree in general that the slp values are estimated to present an increasing gradient from the south eastern part of the region to the northwest in the future the values range from 1012 hpa over cyprus up to 1020 hpa at the north of the iberian peninsula however even though the spatial distribution does not seem to differ much from one model to the other the estimated future differences present some discrepancies overall all models agree that slp values are going to increase in the future since positive differences up to 3 5 hpa characterize the largest part of the mediterranean region yet in the case of the cmcc model these positive differences are observed mainly over italy and the balkan peninsula while over the west and south the differences are very small and in some parts almost zero for cnrm the maximum of the positive differences is located at the northwest of the region and the smallest ones at the south eastern mediterranean sea finally for guf s rcm the positive differences decrease moving to the south fig 12 the winter future slp values are quite higher than the annual ones and with a difference in spatial distribution all models estimate that the minimum sea level pressures will be observed at the northwest of the domain of interest while the maximum will be found at the southwest over north africa fig 13 it is worth mentioning that a large part of the mediterranean area is estimated to present slp values that will exceed 1020 hpa in the future on the other hand the estimated differences between the future and reference period vary between model implementations in the case of cmcc s rcm a characteristic dipole is observed with positive difference increase of the slp over the balkan peninsula and the eastern europe and negative ones decrease of the slp values at the northwest also some regions over the central mediterranean are estimated according to the model to have no future changes regarding slp for cnrm the increase of the examined parameter is clear all over the domain of study the most intense future changes are expected to be found at the northwest and the smallest ones over the cyprus area in the case of guf the centre of positive differences is located over greece up to almost 5 hpa which seem to decrease perimetrically with the smallest positive difference found at the west fig 13 the future spring slp values are smaller in comparison to the winter ones the spatial distribution is very similar to the annual one with the smallest values 1012 hpa observed over cyprus and the highest ones over the northwester part of the mediterranean region regarding the actual sea the future slps are estimated to present a gradient from east minimum to west maximum all model results indicate that the spring pressures will increase during the last 30 years of the 21st century positive differences cover the whole area under study while the most intense future changes are found in the cmcc model over the central continental areas of the mediterranean appendix b figure a1 7 regarding summer the mean seasonal slp future values are lower than the other two seasons the smallest pressures are found at the southeast of the region lower than 1010 hpa increasing over the sea area and the maximum is found at the north northwest up to 1018 hpa all models agree on that spatial distribution fig 14 the equivalent estimated changes in comparison with the reference period s summer ones show that summer will be the only season where slp is estimated to decrease in the 21st century especially in the case of the cmcc model quite large negative differences decrease cover the sea area of the mediterranean as well as the north continental parts of africa the cnrm projections present a weaker climate signal with small positive differences at the northwest and central continental parts of the mediterranean and small negative ones over the balkan peninsula and eastern europe fig 15 in the case of autumn during the last 30 years of the 21st century all models agree that higher pressures will characterize the continental parts of the region under study while lower pressures will be observed over the sea the slp values range from 1015 hpa up to 1022 hpa in limited areas over the iberian and the italian peninsulas appendix b figure a1 8 in comparison to the reference period s slp autumn values it is estimated that pressure will generally increase over the mediterranean according to the cmcc future projections the autumn slp is estimated to increase small positive differences especially in italy and the balkan peninsula over the sea area these positive differences are even smaller and in some regions very close to zero no future climate signal only over cyprus the examined parameter is expected to slightly decrease regarding cnrm the future slp increase is more intense positive differences cover the whole of the study region with the highest ones at the north and northwest as previously over cyprus the change of the autumn slp values is zero no future pressure change analogous is the distribution of the positive differences for guf model but the pressure increase is slightly weaker smaller positive change appendix b figure a1 8 the future projections of the three examined models regarding the wind speeds over the mediterranean domain present many similarities especially in the spatial distribution of their patterns the most intense wind speeds are expected to prevail mainly over the sea areas especially over the aegean sea and the marseille gulf reaching up to approximately 8 m s while over the continents the winds are estimated to be weaker in the future fig 15 the composite maps of the differences in comparison to the reference period are not very strong in general it could be mentioned that there is a small strengthening of the wind speeds over the balkan peninsula as well as over spain with positive differences that in most of the areas are statistically significant it should be highlighted that mainly cmcc and guf model project stronger winds also over the aegean sea statistically significant too the future pattern of the wind speeds during the winter months is quite similar to the annual one regarding the spatial distribution of the velocities weak speeds are estimated to be found over the continent while the sea is going to present larger values conversely to the year analysis the maximum this time is observed over the marseille gulf up to 8 m s while the secondary one is located in the aegean sea moreover strong winds are predicted by the models over the northwest of the domain of interest over the atlantic ocean as well as in the black sea region fig 14 the computation of the differences between the future and the reference mean values revealed that the climate signal is quite weak small positive yet statistically significant differences are expected over land especially in italy central europe and the balkan peninsula on the other hand the wind speeds are not estimated to change drastically over the sea and in some case there are going to be slightly weaker small negative differences as in winter the future spring winds are expected to present their maximum speeds over the sea during the last 30 years of the century however they are quite smaller than the respected winter ones appendix b figure a1 9 also the selected models predict that overall winds in the future are going to be a little stronger small positive difference prevails especially over the continental parts of the mediterranean region the only exception is in the case of the cmcc model where a more significant positive change strengthening of wind speeds is projected over the aegean sea region in summer the regions with future winds lower than 3 m s are more extended over the sea particularly in the cases of cmcc and guf models however these two models estimate a maximum of wind speeds over the aegean sea meaning that the etesian winds will also be detected during the future years moreover from the difference maps the etesian winds are estimated to become even stronger in the future with larger positive differences over the area of the aegean sea this intensification of the winds over this area is mainly found in the case of the cnrm model and the maximum is extended over the southern black sea and over the southeast of the island of crete fig 15 finally in the case of the future autumn estimations the spatial distribution of the wind speeds is similar to the winter spring and annual ones where the land is expected to be characterized by weak winds and the sea with stronger ones all models also detect two future maxima the first in the aegean sea and the second in marseille which is expected to be more intense according to the future cmcc and guf projections the future climate signal of the examined parameter is weak and the calculated differences are in general quite small positive differences are mainly observed over the eastern parts of the mediterranean region especially the aegean sea meaning that the autumn winds over these regions are expected to be slightly stronger in the future appendix b figure a1 10 5 1 2 extreme barometric systems over the mediterranean region future climatic projections of deep depressions the future projections of the three models in estimating the frequency of occurrence of deep depressions centre 1000 hpa is also presented the methodology described in section 2 4 was followed to define the centres of these deep depressions low barometric pressure systems and the grid points on which these low pressure centres will occur in the future were mapped for the future period 2071 2100 moreover the differences on the days of occurrence of these depressions future reference were also computed and illustrated both on an annual and seasonal basis the annual results showed fig 16 that all three models estimate the occurrence of these deep cyclones in the largest part of the mediterranean region in the case of cmcc and guf model these cyclones are expected to have their centres mainly over land while according to the cnrm model their occurrence is also over the sea area it should be mentioned that their frequency in most of the cases does not exceed 5 days however scattered grid point both over the continental as well as the sea areas present a higher frequency of occurrence from the differences maps it becomes obvious that cyclones even though they will still occur in the future are estimated to present a general frequency decrease for a high percentage of the grid points the calculated differences are negative meaning either that there is a decrease of these deep cyclones for future projections compared to the reference period or that the centres of these cyclones are estimated to be found in different areas during the 21st century creating negative differences fig 16 yet it should be considered that there are also grid points with an increasing frequency of occurrence of extreme pressures up to almost 10 days but their locations differ by model application the winter future projections showed that for all three rcms the number of grid points that will present deep depressions by the end of the 21st century is much lower than the annual ones fig 17 as expected their frequency of occurrence is also smaller does not exceed 5 days than the equivalent frequencies found in the annual analysis the deep depression centres are mainly located over the continental land rather than the sea according to the difference maps it should be noted that the extreme cyclones are expected to be less frequent since negative differences prevail over the mediterranean however the maximum of the frequency of occurrence detected for the guf model over the north adriatic sea and the intense positive differences at the same grid point and intense negative difference at the next one shows that this centre of extreme cyclogenesis remains strong over the area during spring the regions that will present deep depressions in the future are more extended also covering several parts of the mediterranean sea as in winter the frequency of occurrence mainly belongs to the first class appendix b figure a1 11 moreover these extreme cyclones will be rarer in the future from the projections of the cmcc and guf models while in the case of the cnrm one numerous grid points over the sea are expected to present more deep depressions at the last 30 years of the century regarding summer and autumn fig 17 and figure a1 12 in appendix b all models project in the future a very limited number of grid points areas where in the future very low pressure systems will occur especially for summer the eastern and north eastern mediterranean region is the one that will generally experience in the future deep depressions the respected differences over this area are either positive or negative due to the slight change of the geographical location of the grid points with extreme pressures and not to an actual change of their frequency for autumn the deep depressions are also expected to become less frequent mainly over central mediterranean sea an exception can be observed over the north adriatic sea in the case of the guf model where the grid points over the area present positive differences indicating that the frequency of the extreme cyclones is expected to increase in the future appendix b figure a1 12 5 2 storm surge projections in the 21 st century by mecss model output we investigate the estimated evolution the projected future trends and variability of ssh maxima and averages in tandem with their correlation to the main forcing mechanisms deep depressions that can induce high surges in the mediterranean coastal zone under the effects of possible climate change 5 2 1 maps of inter annual ssh maxima future projections under combinations of rcms and rcps the main output of the storm surge model is presented in the form of horizontal maps of ssh max m portraying the entire coastal zone of the mediterranean basin the presented ssh max values correspond to model output of 30 year averages of annual maxima of ssh for the two main time windows of simulations for reference and future periods figs 18 20 the graphs are firstly separated by model implementation setup i e for cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss figs 18 19 and 20 respectively for the historical time window reference period upper graphs secondly they are separated by future climatic scenario i e rcp4 5 based runs middle graphs and rcp8 5 based runs lower graphs the latter two refer to percentage differences future reference period of estimated ssh max for each discrete model implementation for the end of the 21st century 2071 2100 along the coastline from the baseline historical 1971 2000 control run of mecss the 30 year averaged ssh max for every rcm forced mecss model implementation follows a similar and rather consistent pattern in terms of geographical distribution the largest storm surge maxima ssh max are observed in the northern adriatic sea followed by the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta south central mediterranean and north eastern levantine respectively the peak values of ssh max score 0 43 0 45 m reference 0 41 0 43 m future rcp4 5 and 0 43 0 44 m future rcp4 5 reaching up to ssh 0 58 0 65 m locally e g venice lagoon during certain years of simulation in the coastal zones of the northern aegean sea and southern france storm surge maxima range from 0 24 to 0 38 m while in the area around the gibraltar strait and the outer western boundary of the mediterranean ssh max may extent up to 0 35 m the mid latitude regions and the rest of the north african coasts show a consistent pattern for all climate implementations with ssh max 0 25 m in general the guf forced mecss results reveal the more pronounced ssh max values 0 42 0 44 m all over the mediterranean compared to the second and third cmcc and cnrm forced mecss 0 40 0 42 m and 0 37 0 38 m respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 mid graphs of figs 18 20 the storminess patterns and the consequent coastal surges are estimated to decrease by a percentage of 5 down to 15 depending on rcm in most of the mediterranean littoral areas adriatic alboran aegean and ionian seas sardinia sicily corsica crete cyprus and almost all african coasts the regions with a possible small increase of 5 7 for estimated future ssh max towards the end of the 21st century are the french coasts of the balearic sea the gulf of lions the ligurian sea coasts only for cnrm and guf implementations the south western italian coasts only for cmcc and guf implementations the gulf of gabes only for cmcc implementation the northern aegean sea only for guf implementation the north western cyprus and southern anatolia coasts both only for cmcc and guf implementations we observe that climatic projections tend to generally favour the future increase of local surge maxima only in areas of mid to low coastal sea level extremes while ssh max is estimated to slightly decrease in the 21st century in areas of the highest observed storm surges conditionally except from the gulf of gabes therefore an occasional projected attenuation of storminess over the entire mediterranean basin under the rcp4 5 scenario is rather prevalent for the last 30 years of the 21st century as also suggested by other researchers in the past e g marcos et al 2011 jordà et al 2012 conte and lionello 2013 androulidakis et al 2015 makris et al 2016 all based on former sres the latter is further corroborated by the spatially averaged over the mediterranean coastline difference of ssh max from future to reference period which marginally reaches values of 3 72 9 92 and 4 66 for cmcc cnrm and guf implementations respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 lower graphs of figs 18 20 the storminess patterns and the consequent coastal surges are also estimated to decrease by generally higher negative percentages than the rcp4 5 driven output i e by a percentage of 10 down to 20 depending on rcm almost except from cnrm in most of the mediterranean littoral areas adriatic alboran aegean and ionian seas sardinia sicily corsica crete cyprus and almost all african coasts the only regions with a possible small increase of 5 for estimated future ssh max towards the end of the 21st century are the french coasts of the balearic sea only for cnrm implementation the ligurian sea coasts only for guf implementation the western italian coasts only for guf implementation the alexandroupoli coastal area in the northern aegean sea only for cnrm implementation finally a rather large possible increase 15 for the gulf of gabes only for cmcc implementation is also expected we again observe that climatic projections tend to generally favour a slight future increase of local surge maxima only in areas of mid to low coastal hazards related to storms while ssh max is estimated to decrease towards the end of the 21st century in high surge areas conditionally except from the gulf of gabes however it is noted that in the reference period cmcc and guf forced mecss model results were higher than the cnrm driven ones hence the occasional larger projected attenuation of storminess over the entire mediterranean basin under the rcp8 5 scenario our inferences are further confirmed by the spatially averaged over the mediterranean coastline differences of ssh max from future to reference period by rcp8 5 which score 11 6 44 and 8 76 for cmcc cnrm and guf implementations respectively essentially a similar spatiotemporal pattern of estimated ssh max evolution in the 21st century can be observed between cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss model outputs namely the averaged ssh max for every 30 year period follows a similar and consistent trend in its geographical distribution a conditional small rise in magnitude for the 21st century in certain mid level surge areas can be traced together with a respective generalized attenuation of ssh max almost everywhere around the basin especially in locations with observed strong surges in the past the guf model runs tend to overestimate the surge level maxima and their projected variations in the future period compared to the other two rcms yet except for the gulf of gabes within the cmcc forced simulations that assess a possible 15 20 increase in storm induced coastal hazard only under the pessimistic rcp8 5 scenario the inter scenario differences rcp8 5 rcp4 5 also reveal a stable pattern for all rcm forced model performances viz giving a slight increment of the pessimistic scenario compared to the modest one by 4 76 2 63 and 4 55 respectively for the evaluated storm surge maxima in general a plausible increase of ssh maxima may be estimated for the 21st century compared to those of the reference period only in specific areas under certain projected climatic conditions overall the spatial distributions of storm surge levels are estimated to remain similar to those of the past period throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone however a generalized storminess enfeeblement is more likely to occur in the study area towards the end of the 21st century moreover a reduction of averaged meteorological residual storm induced sea level ssh mean not shown here for the sake of brevity is also apparent throughout the 21st century the extreme magnitudes of ssh range between 0 4 m and 0 6 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of the adriatic sea and the gulf of gabes the differentiations between the two scenarios used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of ssh max which show a very stable pattern but in terms of magnitudes of surge induced sea levels for these a mild decrease of ssh max values can be observed for the 21st century for both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 driven mecss simulations the largest sshs of the entire mediterranean coastal region seem to occur in the adriatic sea probably due to the reinforcement of the inverse barometer effect by intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco 5 2 2 climate change signals of ssh maxima in the 21 st century the climate change signals ccs are also defined locally i e at 28 mediterranean locations as variations in the timeseries of annual storm surge maxima ssh max and annual meteorologically induced msl ssh mean averaged over the two 30 year periods of study 1971 200 and 2071 2100 for the two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 the 28 locations refer to coastal cities such as kavala thessaloniki heraklion lefkada chios and alexandroupoli in greece zadar dubrovnik split rovinj and bakar in croatia marseilles nice and toulon in france genova catania naples cagliari ancona otranto venice and trieste in italy alexandria in egypt ajaccio in corsica tarifa ibixa barcelona in spain and antalya in turkey see appendix b a3 ssh max relates to the annual maximum of ssh as storm surge induced high seas and ssh mean relates to the average ssh defined as the meteorologically induced residual of deviation from msl the analysis is separated to three discrete mecss model implementations cmcc forced cnrm forced and guf forced the raw data of calculations for the ccs of storm surge patterns for the 28 mediterranean coastal sites are provided in appendix b a3 figures a3 1 3 together with differences of future reference ssh max mean and their percentages compared to the respective reference period values table 4 presents the mean values averaged over the 28 locations of differences from a future reference subtraction for ssh max and ssh mean dssh max and dssh mean respectively together with their percentages compared to the values of the reference period e g dssh max ssh max ref in in general for all rcm forced mecss runs both scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 show small decreases in ssh max of 3 5 to 9 5 i e from 12 mm to 3 7 cm compared to the reference period thus rcp scenario based projections of storm surge maxima offer a bulk estimate of coastal storminess attenuation in terms of surges for the mediterranean basin towards the end of the 21st century nevertheless this is a spatially averaged assessment that presumes equal contribution of each location to the ccs calculation either weighted averaging or a spread out derivation at more representative coastal sites around the mediterranean littoral zone could maybe change this perception for larger or smaller decrease moreover when referring locally at certain stations for many of these coastal sites such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the ssh max is expected to increase from 1 up to 22 the change in ssh mean seems to be negative everywhere around the mediterranean basin at the rest of the locations the ssh max decrease towards the end of the 21st century ranges from 30 to 2 the aforementioned values refer to the cmcc forced mecss implementation similarly proportional changes are found for the cnrm and guf forced mecss simulated results although with a more pronounced attenuation pattern for these cases and specific differentiations of positive negative ccs given the different locations for the storm induced component of msl rise based on the calculation of ssh mean the general attenuation pattern is also prevalent for all cases of any rcm forced mecss run all the above signify that there is a need to assess if the calculated ccs is robust in our implemented projections i e trace if there is a strong agreement between the results produced based on the three rcms the robustness of the local ccs values for each coastal city was defined as the agreement of results per rcm induced cmcc cnrm guf forced mecss model results for at least one or even both of the rcp based 4 5 and 8 5 implementations as agreement we consider the case of e g both cmcc and cnrm or guf forced mecss to produce results that show a decrease or increase negative or positive rate of change as ccs respectively when comparing the future projections of ssh max mean to the respective reference period values the 30 year average of the annual meteorologically induced msl ssh mean tends to robustly decrease everywhere in the 28 examined coastal sites for all the possible rcm and rcp combinations tried in our analysis therefore the reducing ccs concerning the meteorological residual of msl deviation can be considered fully robust for the 30 year average of the annual storm surge maxima ssh max 18 out of 28 sites 64 present a robust agreement in the tendency to a storminess attenuation towards the end of the 21st century i e all rcm rcp combinations of mecss runs reveal an accordance about the trend for negative ccs values either for one of the rcps or for both especially for the coastal cities of kavala alexandroupoli toulon ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice ibixa and barcelona all rcm forced mecss implementations do not agree with each other but at least two out of the three rcm based runs tend to show the same behaviour analytic datasets are provided in appendix b a3 5 3 impact of mediterranean deep depression systems on storm surges the statistically significant correlation p v a l u e 0 01 with mann kendall test between the occurrence of storm surge maxima ssh max and deep depressions slp min see sections 2 4 2 3 3 fig 6 and 5 1 2 fig 16 for identification calculation methodology evaluation and derivation respectively is quantified by the pearson product moment coefficient of the slp timeseries on the nodal points of the rcm grid to ssh timeseries on all coastal cells of mecss model these refer to entire the mediterranean coastline yet specifically for the time window of occurrence of separate deep depression events therefore correlation maps on the mediterranean coastal zone are produced for each one of the identified deep cyclone events section 5 1 2 these are divided in two 30 year reference and future simulation periods by rcm forced implementations only for rcp8 5 worst case scenario for the sake of brevity in our case the negative pearson coefficient values reveal a large correlation of coastal ssh to the slp due to physical process of the inverse barometer effect lowest slps induce highest sea levels in the vicinity of the cyclone s eye thus the minima of correlations are then derived on every mecss coastal cell for each 30 year model run and compared against each other in respective pairs e g see intercomparisons in section 5 2 1 hence a cumulative portrayal of the effect of synoptic scale climatology on the coastal storm surges is achieved in a heuristic way this allows the mapping of vulnerable coastal areas due to storm surges exposed to specific identified atmospheric patterns of extreme low pressure systems figs 21 23 present maps of the calculated pearson correlation minima cor m i n slp min ssh max for the ssh on all coastal cells of the mecss model domain with the low slp values of the identified deep depression systems this way we produce a display of topographic variability of the influence that deep depression low pressure barometric systems exert on the entire mediterranean coastal zone in terms of storm induced sea level elevation the results are separated by model implementation setup i e for cmcc cnrm and guf forced mecss figs 21 22 and 23 respectively presenting cor m i n slp min ssh max on reference and future period rcp8 5 maps upper and mid graphs the lower graphs in figs 21 22 and 23 refer to the algebraic differences future reference period of estimated correlation i e pearson coefficient minima of rcp8 5 based data last 30 years of the 21st century 2071 2100 to baseline control run data 1971 2000 along the coastline by each model implementation the localized 30 year cor m i n slp min ssh max for all rcm forced mecss model implementations follows a rather similar and consistent pattern in terms of geographical distribution figs 21 23 upper and mid graphs the highest correlations lowest cor m i n are observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts namely the littoral zones of the gulfs of valencia and lions the ligurian and northern adriatic seas cor m i n 0 50 to 0 65 they are followed by lower values on the coastal zones of mid latitude areas around corsica sardinia the mid zonal italian peninsula and the adriatic and the northern aegean sea cor m i n 0 55 to 0 40 significant yet lower correlations can be found in sicily south italy peloponnese crete the southern aegean archipelago and alboran sea cor m i n 0 45 to 0 25 this signifies the systematic influence of mediterranean deep depression systems on the coastal storm surges of the mediterranean basin in a progressive manner from its south to the north the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta show even lower correlations cor m i n 0 25 to 0 20 even though they are locations of exceptionally high storm surge maxima probably also influenced significantly by local wind patterns however they discern from the rest of the southern parts of the mediterranean coastal zone cor m i n 0 15 to 0 00 where the effect of deep depressions on sea level extremes seems minimal especially for cmcc driven mecss simulations all the above refer to the reference period nonetheless also apply to the future period estimations where differentiations between the southern and the northern parts is more pronounced especially for cmcc fed mecss runs this could be attributed to the known projected northward shift of the main cyclonic centres and tracks of medicanes or storms in general over the mediterranean during the 21st century based on climate change scenarios in the lower graphs of figs 21 23 the differences future reference of cor m i n reveal that when they are negative towards blue and purple colours it implies an increase of the deep depressions influence on the storm surges while positive values entail a decrease of the deep depression events on the occurrence of storm surge maxima therefore there is a very clear pattern of an estimated slight attenuation of the deep cyclones effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level in sardinia corsica the ligurian and adriatic seas and the entire italian peninsula for all rcm fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century this is projected to be the case also for alboran sea the gulf of valencia the north western african coasts and the ionian aegean and libyan sea coasts especially for the cmcc and guf forced mecss simulations respectively on the other hand a possible increase of the mediterranean deep depressions influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the gulf of lions the ionian aegean and levantine sea basins covering the north central and north eastern coasts of africa cmcc forced mecss similarly for cnrm and guf based future period runs alboran sea the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta are estimated to be further increasingly influenced by the projected deep depressions patterns while these kinds of cyclones are prone to further boost the storm surge maxima of the aegean sea for cnrm based implementations towards the end of the 21st century all the above refer to the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 compared to the 20th century baseline levels of the reference period conclusively the projected climate change scenarios examined herein allow us to investigate several differentiations in estimated future storminess patterns generally a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas with mid to high ssh max e g aegean ionian gulf of lions or valencia or gabes etc but not the highest throughout the basin e g venice lagoon ligurian adriatic etc in the latter coastal regions however intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco play a most significant role in the formation of high storm surges 6 discussion this study presents a systematic analysis of climatic simulations output about atmospheric patterns and barotropic ocean circulation in the mediterranean basin we follow an integrated approach of evaluating certain products med 44 slp and winds of the med cordex database and further feeding them as input to basin scale storm surge modelling mecss a control run baseline for mecss model in a 30 year reference period is thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide gauges the results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation towards the end of the 21st century under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios yet locally estimated increases or decreases of storm surge maxima around the mediterranean coastal zone is pinpointed and thoroughly discussed depending on rcm forced mecss implementation we conclusively propose a heuristic analysis for the quantification of the identified deep depressions extreme low pressure systems effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100 the signal of possible projected climate change effects is also provided in the form of comparisons by future reference period outputs an important issue which has come up in our analysis concerns the effects of climate and marine model resolutions on the produced results this particularly refers to the reproduction of storm surges in the coastal zone and therefore also to atmospheric data e g wind fields in the open sea and coastal waters resolution which influences the storm surge evolution according to ferrarin et al 2021 who analysed one of the most extreme flooding events in terms of physics in venice it is necessary to use a high resolution model 1 km in order to describe the local processes and the interaction with the local topography as well as to reproduce the small scale cyclonic vortices that develop in northern adriatic sea and affect the area of study but these kinds of resolutions are impossible to achieve for the entire mediterranean basin in terms of computational cost especially for the amount of simulations we implemented in our study i e 15 sets of simulations by 3 rcms 2 rcps 2 future periods 1 reference period denamiel et al 2021 discuss the balancing accuracy and efficiency of atmospheric models in the northern adriatic sub basin during the blowing of high bora winds they comment on the need for atmospheric model resolutions of o 100 m especially in focused fine scale process oriented studies to achieve accurate representation of severe bora rotor dynamics typical rcm resolutions of 10 km are not considered accurate enough to drive the marine coastal processes and a discussion is introduced about kilometre scale atmospheric models in order to balance accuracy and efficiency in coupled atmosphere ocean climate studies in the adriatic a divergence of results for both era5 reanalysis and wrf 15 km model output from super high resolution weather modelling with wrf 1 5 km is apparent especially in terms of wind speeds this is a crucial point and certainly sets new ground for climate studies in the coastal ocean but such an approach is still applicable only in focused local case studies e g northern adriatic sub basin referring to confined areas of the coastal zone rather than the entire mediterranean basin moreover according to denamiel and vilibić 2022 the next generation climate modelling efforts should focus on sub kilometre scale simulations for extreme storm surges and their projections in the 21st century as a proof of concept they present long term sea level variations and distributions at the climate timeframe yet again in the focused spatial scale of the adriatic sea s small lagoons and bays the authors assert that this newly developed methodology could lead to more targeted local mitigation strategies for the storm surge hazard in regional studies furthermore the utilized cera 20c data most up to date reanalysis dataset during the study implementation in 2019 era5 dataset was not published yet for the validation of the med cordex med 44 datasets have a lower resolution of 125 km compared to the latter of 44 km downscaled to 10 km therefore cera 20c wind fields might not be representative for fine scale effects of winds especially in coastal areas where diverse topography of shorelines play an important role in atmospheric dynamics however the spatial resolution of cera 20c dataset that was utilized was downscaled to 0 25 0 25 for easier comparisons it is further noted that the cera assimilation system has the ability to produce a more balanced and consistent earth system climate reconstruction as it takes into account the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean our study relies on mainly detecting the effects of slp on the sea level elevation around the entire basin in a large synoptic scale analysis therefore slp is considered to be the main driver for sea level elevation as it can be adequately simulated by the med 44 rcms feeding the 10 km resolution storm surge model the effects of winds are of course important especially in fine coastal scales and still simulated in our model but in a rather cruder way than the effects of slp as wind fields are highly irregular more steeply changing in space and time nevertheless our results focus on synoptic scale climatology of deep depressions by slp minima on the coastal ssh by the term coastal herein we refer to a rather crude scale representation of ssh on the continental shelf and not the exact fine scale sea level elevation on the coastline which would certainly require a very detailed dynamic downscaling of model runs this is still impossible to achieve in terms of computational cost in a systematic way for the entire mediterranean coastal zone for a climatic analysis from 1971 to 2100 involving several combined cases rcms and rcps thus we opted to check if the reasonably reproduced weather patterns mainly slp and winds could be used as forcing drivers for large scale maritime hydrodynamic simulations in the open sea of the mediterranean basin and not focus too much on fine scale topographic peculiarities and local coastal wind patterns certain local wind patterns could drive coastal waters to littoral run up in very diverse ways but this is an issue for a future study where we will focus on a lot finer scales for coastal inundation also involving wave induced sea levels on selected areas of the mediterranean coastal zone our results on the detection of deep depressions please refer to figs 6 8 can be also loosely compared to reale et al 2022 outputs please refer to their figs 2 3 the patterns of spatial distribution of deep depressions and the annual density of cyclone tracks seem generically similar with a pronounced centre over the ligurian sea and the southcentral italian peninsula including some cells expanding also to the central adriatic sea comparisons between the two works cannot be straightforward as they refer to different timeframes 1971 2000 and 1981 2005 in ours and reale et al 2022 analysis respectively while we compute the number of deep depressions in a 30 year period and reale et al 2022 present the spatial distribution of annual mean number of cyclone tracks in each 1 5 cell of the mediterranean however similar patterns can be found for wind speed fields too given the applied comparison restrictions 7 conclusions 7 1 conclusive remarks about atmospheric modelling aspects under the effects of climate change in the presented research the analyses are based on three implemented rcms namely cmcc cclm cnrm aladin52 and guf cclm nemo for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the 21st century atmospheric modelling datasets cover the reference 1971 2000 and future 2071 2100 periods of climate projections thorough validation of the rcm outputs was conducted by comparisons of the control run reference period datasets against the most recent cera 20c re analysis data no definite conclusion can be deduced concerning the skill score of the three models for all regions of the mediterranean about the barometric systems based on slp and wind patterns however the cclm model implementations of both the cmcc and guf institutions seem to slightly dominate over the cnrm s aladin model runs this is also the case for the detection of deep depressions over the mediterranean which is crucial for the simulation of storm surges and ssh variations due to climate change in some cases based on changing between seasonal and annual analyses and concerning warm or cold periods of the year the cnrm aladin52 model outputs are found to be superior to the rest of the model results therefore all climatic input datasets were used for the forcing of the mecss model implementations providing ensembles of results for a more robust representation of the future climate change impacts on mediterranean coastal sea level elevations in the 21st century from the analysis of the future projections of the three examined models cmcc cnrm and guf under rcp4 5 8 5 for sea level pressure slp wind speed and extreme cyclones the following could be concluded slp is expected to increase on an annual basis during the last 30 years of the 21st century over the mediterranean this is probably associated to a northward shift of cyclonic systems also found by other researchers in the past under a different rcm rcp scrutiny conversely to the other three seasons in summer the slp values are expected in general to decrease with the most intense negative differences future present day found over the sea rather than the continental areas regarding wind patterns the areas with the stronger wind speeds remain the same in the future as in the reference period both cmcc and guf models estimate that winds will become stronger over the aegean sea 2 5 m s meaning that this increase will affect greece and especially the islands of the aegean archipelago moreover in summer the etesian winds are estimated to become even stronger in the future with larger positive differences over the area of the aegean sea all three models estimate the occurrence of deep cyclones in the largest part of the mediterranean region in the cases of cmcc and guf models these cyclones are expected to have their centres mainly overland while according to cnrm model they are estimated to occur almost evenly between continental and oversea areas even though deep depressions are bound to occur in the future period their frequency is generally going to decrease towards the end of the 21st century 7 2 conclusive remarks about storm surge modelling aspects under the effects of climate change several implementations of maritime hydrodynamic simulation for storm surges throughout the entire mediterranean sea basin were conducted mecss model simulated the sea level variations and barotropic hydrodynamic circulation in offshore and coastal areas of the mediterranean both at present and future climatic conditions reference and future periods 1971 2000 and 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the model takes into account the inverse barometer effect and the win drag on the sea surface providing reliable estimations of storm induced sea surface height ssh variations locally under the estimated effects of climate change on marine water bodies msl rise estimations in the mediterranean under the med cordex initiative or other possible interactive effects on storm surge patterns at specific areas by e g tides seiches meteotsunamis wave induced runup etc were not considered in this study as they were out of scope the calibration and simulation of the storm surge model was conducted for a decadal period around the millennium for which there were available in situ observations by the hnhs for the simulation of the climate change impacts on storm induced sea level in the coastal zone of mediterranean the modelling results of three rcms cmcc cnrm and guf were used as forcing input to the mecss model the following conclusions can be deduced overall the cumulative comparison of measured and simulated 10 year mean ssis for the three mecss implementations reveals that there is a rather high correlation cor 0 79 reaching up to 0 89 with the lowest rmses of ssi and ssh max 3 cm being 13 of ssi mean referring to the guf forced mecss run this is also backed up by the very high skill scores wss 0 80 rendering the guf forced mecss model setup the generally yet not locally most reliable performance of the mecss model for the east central mediterranean region generally the mecss model can reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of ssh percentiles in an adequate way and thus the statistical distributions of the modelled ssh data are considered to be reliable for further use by coastal engineers and scientists especially for coastal water resources management moreover the mecss model can also adequately reproduce the storm surge patterns for all the classes of statistical thresholds which correspond to heuristically defined coherent intense and extreme events it was also found to perform well in reproducing the probabilistic features of storm surge patterns in terms of the amount and occurrence frequency of surge events viz local maxima in the modelled ssh timeseries however a tendency is traced for the present mecss model implementations to underestimate small values of ssh and perform better for the estimation of large sshs representative of intense and extreme storm surge events therefore the reproduced probabilistic parametric features of the modelled ssh data are reliable for further coastal impact analysis in general a plausible decrease of ssh maxima is estimated for the last 30 years of the 21st century compared to those of the reference period moreover a slight reduction of average storm induced sea level ssh mean msl component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century extreme magnitudes of ssh max range between 0 35 and 0 50 m in the mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts venice lagoon gulf of lions northern adriatic and aegean seas etc and the gulf of gabes in its southern part overall the spatial distributions of surge level maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the reference period throughout the entire mediterranean coastal zone differentiations between the two scenarios rcp4 5 8 5 used are obvious not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of ssh max which shows a very stable pattern but more in terms of magnitudes of the extreme surge induced sea levels for these a decrease of ssh max values that ranges from 30 to 2 can be observed towards the end of the 21st century especially for rcp8 5 driven mecss simulations the rcp driven scenarios of mecss implementations estimate a general attenuation of storminess in the mediterranean basin during the last third of the 21st century of course this is a spatially averaged estimation and for some specific coastal sites in croatia spain italy and france such as rovinj bakar toulon trieste ajaccio genova marseilles naples venice cagliari ancona ibixa and barcelona the ssh max is expected to increase from 1 to 22 towards the end of the 21st century analogously similar or proportional changes are found for the cnrm forced and the guf forced mecss simulated results although with a more pronounced attenuation pattern for these cases and differentiations of the locations of positive negative climate change signals 7 3 conclusive remarks about the correlation of deep depressions to storm surges under the effects of climate change by heuristically correlating the occurrence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima on the coast in a localized manner throughout the two 30 year periods of study for all rcm forced mecss model implementations it seems that the effect of deep cyclones on coastal sea levels follows a similar and consistent geographical pattern the highest correlations of deep depression events to sea level highs i e lowest pearson coefficients due to the inverse barometer effect were observed in several parts along the northern mediterranean coasts gulfs of valencia and lions ligurian and northern adriatic seas they are followed by mid latitude areas around corsica sardinia the mid zonal italian peninsula and the adriatic and the northern aegean sea the influence of deep depressions on storm surges was lower for sicily south italy peloponnese crete the southern aegean archipelago and alboran sea a pattern of northward increase in the influence of mediterranean deep depression systems on the coastal storm surges of the basin is obvious the only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern mediterranean littorals are the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta these apply to the reference period however seem to repeat for future period estimations even with more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts especially for the cmcc based analysis a projected northward shift of the main cyclonic centres and tracks of storms over the mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century is likely the reason for the latter all the following conclusions refer to the rcp8 5 scenario during the future period 2071 2100 compared to the 20th century baseline levels of the reference period the climate change signal difference of future reference period of the deep cyclones effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions these refer to sardinia corsica the ligurian and adriatic seas and the entire italian peninsula for all rcm fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century conditionally this is the case for the gulf of valencia the north western african coasts the alboran ionian aegean and libyan sea coasts under specific combinations of rcm rcp forcings on the other hand a possible increase of the mediterranean deep depressions influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the gulf of lions the ionian aegean and levantine sea basins covering the north central and north eastern coasts of africa only under the cmcc forced mecss outputs based on cnrm and guf based future period projections under the rcp8 5 scenario alboran sea the gulfs of gabes and alexandretta are estimated to be further increasingly influenced by the projected deep depressions in the 21st century the entire aegean sea s coasts are also prone to be influenced by deep cyclones under the cnrm based projections towards the end of the 21st century conclusively the projected climate change scenarios examined herein allow us to investigate several differentiations in estimated future storminess patterns a general consensus is that a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid to high ssh max e g aegean ionian gulf of lions or valencia or gabes etc but not the highest throughout the basin e g venice lagoon ligurian adriatic etc in the latter coastal regions however intense local wind forcing mechanisms i e scirocco might play a most significant role in the formation of high storm surges 7 4 future steps the results produced within this study can be used for investigations in specific locations of the mediterranean basin within integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions during the 21st century our next goals are to implement nonstationary extreme value analysis of nearshore storm surges galiatsatou et al 2019 2021 makris et al 2018 in order to assess design water levels at the shoreline under the effects of projected climate change applied to the entire mediterranean coastal zone focusing on lowland littoral areas and river deltas we further intend to focus on the entire greek coastal zone and define vulnerability

national action plan european r d cooperation grant act of greek partners successfully participating in joint calls for proposals of the european networks era nets and the competitiveness entrepreneurship innovation program appendix a a 1 the statistical measures used in the analysis refer to the following parameters the ssi and ssh m a x etc factors for both simulated and observed timeseries of storm surge levels is calculated for each of the five stations along with the corresponding percent error e 1 e 100 s s i mod s s i o b s s s i mod s s i o b s 2 where ssi m o d and ssi o b s are the mean ssi over the 10 years study period as derived from modelled and observed data respectively it is noted that e is positive when the model overestimates the amplitude of the sea level against observed data in order to provide more information about the significance of the error the error index ei is also calculated according to the following relation 2 e i s s i m o d s s i o b s σ s s i m o d 2 σ s s i o b s 2 2 where σ is the mean standard deviation of ssis corresponding to either the simulated mod or observed obs timeseries for each station the aforementioned parameters refer to the entire timeseries of ssh and respective calculated ssi parameters in each examined station for further general evaluation of the mecss model performance the root mean square error rmse of 10 year average values of ssi between modelled and observed values in each of the five stations is also provided as 3 r m s e i 1 5 s s i m o d i s s i o b s i 2 5 the percentage index of the ratio rmse ssi m e a n ssi m e a n corresponds to the average ssi value of all model results and observations is also given followed by the classic pearson product moment correlation coefficient cor x viz the covariance of the modelled and observed ssi variables divided by the product of their standard deviations 4 c o r s s i i i 1 5 s s i mod s s i mod s s i o b s s s i o b s i 1 5 s s i mod s s i mod 2 i 1 5 s s i o b s s s i o b s 2 the pearson coefficient 1 1 being the full agreement between modelled and observed ssis measures the strength of linear dependence between experimental and numerical data but does not directly compare their actual values therefore the combination with the rmse provides a clearer insight on the mecss model performance skill moreover the willmott skill score wss or index of agreement willmott et al 2012 is also calculated for ssi and other ssh magnitudes as 5 w s s s s i 1 i 1 5 s s i mod s s i o b s 2 i 1 5 s s i mod s s i mod s s i o b s s s i o b s 2 the higher the wss with 1 as a limit the better match is reached between simulated values of ssi and observations form tide gauges while wss values close to 0 indicate disagreement between the two samples the hit rate of percentiles hrp index schoetter et al 2012 makris et al 2016 is also used as a model evaluation metric namely for the hrp index one computes the absolute differences between the sorted from 1st to 99th percentiles of simulated and observed values herein of ssh then the hrp index is defined as the sum of the categorical fractions i e the differences compared to an allowed deviation herein it is taken as the average of standard deviations of all modelled and observed ssh timeseries σ s s h in the analysis of schoetter et al 2012 if the hrp index with range between 0 and 1 is greater than 0 95 then the model efficiently represents the regarded observation timeseries and the simulated dataset under examination does not need to be corrected for bias the hrp index is independent of the variable under evaluation appendix b supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j ocemod 2022 102149 appendix b
